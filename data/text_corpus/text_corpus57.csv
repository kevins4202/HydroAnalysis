285,the poultry industry plays an important role in meat production supply with a growth rate of more than 4 p a in the last few years this white meat production requires a large amount of feed that increases competition in the use of natural resources for primary food and other uses grains are the primary source of poultry nutrition and oilseeds are the most common protein source with maize wheat and soybean being the most common ingredients in poultry diets it is not clear to what extent natural resources are used to produce these feed crops and what the impact is of the resulting pressure on the availability of natural resources for other uses the study evaluates and quantifies the local feed availability and the associated amount of local and non local land and water resources required for the poultry production worldwide at a country and region scale as of 2016 including a detailed global feed trade analysis for the top poultry producer countries country specific diets were used for the ten largest producer countries and two simplified diets for the global scale the feed amounts were converted in land and water demand using crop specific yields and a phisically based and spatially distributed hydrological model the findings showed that 49 mha of cereals 37 mha local and 64 mha of soybean 25 mha local are needed to feed chickens globally together with approximately 441 km3 of green water 197 km3 and 244 km3 for cereals and soybean respectively and 52 km3 of blue water 27 km3 and 25 km3 respectively required by these feed crops in 2016 however significant amounts of natural resources are saved through the international feed trade the results obtained suggest the need for more sustainable approaches to address future projections in the sector keywords livestock land water feed food poultry 1 introduction with the planet s increasing population which the un estimates will reach over nine billion inhabitants worldwide by 2050 the challenge of feeding the planet is at the top of the agenda fao 2018a un 2019 meat consumption plays a predominant role above all in countries with significant gdp growth and the production of poultry meat is crucial alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 poultry meat and eggs are among the most common animal products consumed globally by a wide diversity of cultures traditions and religions making them key to food security and nutrition mottet and tempio 2017 chickens are raised in a wide range of production systems and provide mainly meat eggs and manure for crop fertilization according to fao in 2016 more than 106 million tons of chicken meat were produced and roughly 66 billion chickens were slaughtered globally which corresponds approximately to nine birds per person faostat 2016 only two years later in 2018 there had been an increase of more than 8 4 p a in poultry meat with approximately 70 billion chickens slaughtered in 2018 faostat 2018 global per capita consumption of poultry meat increased from 2 9 kg in 1961 to 15 6 kg in 2018 faostat 2018 alexandratos and bruinsma estimated that the world s demand for animal derived food could increase by 70 between 2005 and 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 poultry meat is thus expected to have the highest growth 121 while the demand for beef and pork is predicted to increase by 66 and 43 respectively this growth in the poultry sector also leads to a significant increase in the demand for feed and raw materials kleyn and ciacciariello 2021 the availability of low priced and high quality feed that keep poultry meat competitive and simultaneously meet the increasing demand ravindran 2013 is fundamental for this sector however the growing demand for poultry risks creating a competition between the feed and human primary food sectors as cereals and oilseeds are the two main feed crops used in chicken diets but they are also extensively consumed as primary human food mottet et al 2017 mottet and tempio 2017 pauwels 2016 in addition to an exacerbation of the feed food competition the growth in feed demand is part of the framework of global food trade which accompanies the growth in population and food demand and the increase in interconnections between countries almeida et al 2021 kim et al 2019 the pressure on the environment is already a global challenge and the increasing demand in feed and food is intensifying the problem of the limited availability of natural resources in fact both land and water resources the basis of our food production are limited and already under pressure at the same time future agricultural production will need to be more productive and more sustainable unep 2016 weeks 2020 livestock is one of the sectors that consumes the most natural resources both locally and globally fao and steinfeld 2006 according to some studies including those conducted by the world wide fund for nature world wildlife fund 2020 and the global footprint network global footprint network 2020 humans are already using more than one earth s worth of resources in its report world livestock transforming the livestock sector through the sustainable development goals the fao assessed the correlation between this sector and the sdgs proposed by the un in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development fao 2018b un 2018 agriculture uses approximately 70 of the available freshwater supply and roughly 30 of this is used in livestock production sdg 6 fao 2013 gerbens leenes et al 2013 heinke et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 similarly 26 of the earth s surface land is used for livestock grazing and 33 of croplands above all cereals crops are used for livestock feed production sdg 15 fao 2013 fao and steinfeld 2006 karlsson and röös 2019 mottet et al 2017 more than 465 million tons of feed were consumed by the poultry sector in 2020 alltech 2020 poultry is the most efficient livestock segment in the use of natural resources consuming less feed to produce the same amount of protein fao and steinfeld 2006 gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 mottet and tempio 2017 ravindran 2013 however it is estimated that poultry feed requires nearly 93 mha of cereal and 60 mha of oilseed crops mottet and tempio 2017 and consumes 11 255 km3 y and 7 167 km3 y of the total water used for animal production in the form of meat and egg products respectively mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 previous works have highlighted the total significant amount of resources required by the livestock sector and how these uses of resources can compete with other sectors to guarantee local food security el deek et al 2020 gerbens leenes et al 2013 gerber et al 2007 heinke et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 mottet et al 2017 mottet and tempio 2017 specifically for the poultry sector mottet et al 2017 quantified the total feed demand and the associated land in oecd and non oecd countries calculating the proportions in which these amounts compete with the demand for primary food for humans including all the ingredients in various animals diets in terms of water use studies by mekonnen hoekstra and gerbens leenes showed the water footprint of white meat production at the country level gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 however to the best of our knowledge there have been no specific studies on the consumption of natural resources i e land and water for poultry meat production where local feed availability and feed trade flows are also assessed and quantified specifically here we propose a methodology to evaluate and quantify the detailed feed trade associated with poultry production in the top ten producer countries and the local and non local cereals and oilseed availability for chickens on a global scale with reference to 2016 the most up to date data available consequently the double scale analysis calculates the land and water associated with this feed production in both the producers and the partner countries in the trade of raw materials country specific chicken diets were used for the top ten producers and two simpler balanced diets in the global scale scenario to explore the role and the impacts of white meat production on the environment 2 methods the impacts of chicken diets on natural resources were assessed under two different scales firstly a detailed analysis of the top ten poultry producer countries was carried out section 2 1 then the analysis was enlarged to the global scale section 2 2 in order to create a global overview of the effects of white meat production 2 1 top 10 poultry producers analysis according to fao faostat 2016 the top ten poultry producer countries in 2016 were china u s brazil indonesia russia india iran mexico thailand and myanmar alone these countries contributed to almost 60 of the global production 40 of which was ascribed just to the first three figure s1 supplementary material faostat 2016 2 1 1 chicken diets and production systems chicken diet composition data were taken from the global livestock environmental assessment model gleam version 2 0 developed and updated by fao fao 2018c gerber et al 2013 for the ten countries we selected chicken production is categorized into backyard layer and broiler systems crops are used as animal feed in different forms i as the main crop e g grains or whole crops ii as crop residues such as straw or iii as agro industrial by products e g brans and cakes accordingly the ingredients included in the diets were converted from dry dm to fresh matter using dm contents from gleam the fresh values of each feed material were then corrected by the feed use efficiency fue which is the fraction of the crop that is effectively ingested and used as feed by the animals fao 2018c the diets are mainly composed of cereal grains from wheat maize barley millet rice and sorghum and oilseed crops soybean rape cotton and palm kernel cereal and oilseed crops are often combined with pulses roots and tubers and other secondary ingredients such as fishmeal when allowed by the law and limestone as well as supplements amino acids minerals however fishmeal complements limestone swill and scavenging that are particularly used in backyard systems were not included in the analysis as they are not involved in the feed food competition and do not put increasing pressure on resources furthermore crop residues and by products from grain industries and from cottonseed oil production were not converted into natural resources because they are produced primarily for food or other uses while the feed fraction is from processing waste the demand for country chicken feed was estimated by considering the numbers of animals in each production system and the relative associated diet the chicken production systems were categorized using the methodology described in gilbert et al 2015 following gleam they developed a model to estimate the numbers of animals differentiating them between those raised in backyards and industrial systems animals in industrial systems were further sub divided into layers and broilers combining production data on meat and eggs from faostat and productivity data from gleam fao 2018c faostat 2016 in our analysis we considered the total number of slaughtered chickens in 2016 faostat 2016 considering that broilers are slaughtered after 42 days for meat while backyard and layers which are raised mainly for egg production have a total life of approximately three years fao 2018c we report the regional values of feed rations and the percentage of chickens in the production system used in this study in table s1 and table s2 supplementary material while the total daily feed intake dfi is taken from mottet et al 2017 and gleam fao 2018c 2 1 2 feed self sufficiency and feed trade the total amount of fresh raw material of all dietary ingredients needed were compared with the local availability of feed for livestock for this fao food balance sheets fbs were used splitting between local and imported feed use faostat 2016 as described in figure s3 supplementary material soybean is mainly processed to obtain oil 20 that is used both for human and animal feed and meal 78 which is almost all used as a protein source for livestock dei 2011 soyatech 2003 the quantity of soybean used directly as feed was considered together with that processed that is indirectly consumed as feed so obtaining the total soybean feed availability if the feed local production is insufficient to meet the local chicken feed demand of a specific country the difference between the two was added to the imported feed these countries therefore need to increase their current imports or more likely the diet applied is slightly different and they mix the available cereals differently the import feed demand was ascribed to partner countries by analyzing the detailed trade matrix dtm from the fao faostat 2016 and data from the un database comtrade un 2016 in these cases all partners the analyzed country imported feed crops from in 2016 were selected the required chicken feed production was thus allocated partly to the country itself which produces the chickens and partly to the countries where it imports the raw materials used as feed from a specific case is the trade associated with the netherlands and switzerland partners in cereals and soybean trade with iran because the re export of goods is an integral part of the dutch and swiss trade balance sheet lemmers and wong 2019 for these countries dtms were investigated despite not being among the largest poultry producers 2 1 3 land assessment the quantities of each raw material were converted into the necessary cropland area crop specific yields for each country and partners taken from fao for the year 2016 were thus used faostat 2016 the land needed to produce chicken feed for a given country was subdivided between local and non local leading to a virtual natural resources land trade analysis 2 1 4 water assessment a crop specific globally and spatially distributed water model named watneeds chiarelli et al 2020 was used to compute the amount of green gw and blue bw water associated with chicken feed production by considering the cropland area required within each country and partner countries the soil water balance was assessed daily at a 5 arc minute resolution around 10 km to obtain the crop water requirements cwrs for the selected chicken diet ingredients cwr is satisfied by gw and bw components gw is defined as the amount of water stored in the soil derived from the fraction of precipitation that does not runoff or percolate in depth but evaporates and transpires through plants bw corresponds to the fresh surface and groundwater from rivers lakes and aquifers hoekstra 2003 for rainfed crops the gw flux equates the potential evapotranspiration if soil moisture can guarantee the plant demand for water otherwise gw equates the actual evapotranspiration computed considering a coefficient of water stress condition as in chiarelli et al 2020 total bw for irrigated crops was computed as the cumulative difference of the daily crop water demand and the daily gw during the growing period of the crops crop specific cultivated areas were retrieved from the mirca dataset referring to the year 2000 and distinguishing between rainfed and irrigated areas portmann et al 2010 soil type information was taken from batjes et al 2006 based on soil data from the fao harmonized world soil database monthly data on potential reference evapotranspiration eto for the year 2016 were taken from the university of east anglia s climate research unit time series version 4 01 dataset harris et al 2014 daily precipitation data for the year 2016 were retrieved from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station version 2 0 dataset chirps funk et al 2015 and from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s climate prediction center global unified gauge based analysis of daily precipitation dataset cpc chen et al 2008 crop coefficients and growing stages were taken from allen et al 1998 and adapted from siebert and döll 2010 the total volume of water was finally estimated as the product of gw and bw respectively for the area harvested within each country obtaining the local gw and bw the virtual water trade associated with feed imports is obtained by taking into account the demand for bw and gw met through the import thus virtual non local water volumes are assessed in the partner countries considering their virtual exporting cropland area and data associated with their specific climate and soil 2 2 global scale analysis after estimating the natural resources associated with chicken feed production in the top ten poultry producing countries the analysis was extended to a global scale by making some simplifications related to chicken diets and production systems section 2 2 1 information on chicken meat production chickens slaughtered and number of chickens were taken from the fao for the year 2016 for all countries and then aggregated to the global macro regional scale as listed in figure s2 supplementary material faostat 2016 2 2 1 chicken diets and production systems the country chicken feed demand was quantified by considering only two different balanced chicken diets with maize and wheat as the main source of carbohydrates both diets analyzed in this scenario are specific for broiler chickens because on average 89 of chickens globally are reared for meat production and only the remaining 11 are reared for eggs as reported in table s2 supplementary material and in the literature fao 2018c leeson and summers 2012 the selected diets have maize and wheat as main ingredients since the two cereals are the main source of energy in broiler diets wheat based diets tend to be used for broiler chickens in europe australia and new zealand and maize based diets in the u s and asia akter et al 2017 at a global scale maize grain is commonly used as a primary basic food by humans in developing countries while in developed countries it is used mainly for animal feeding karlsson and röös 2019 in terms of protein soybean is the primary source used as feed however this assumption does not hold everywhere and there may be countries where the energy and or protein sources are different and replaced by other ingredients as described in the previous detailed scenario diet 1 is adapted from biasato et al 2017 2018 for broiler chickens with respect to three growth stages of 12 days 13 days and 17 days aviagen 2019a the diet is mainly composed of maize meal maize gluten meal soybean meal and soybean oil table 1 these ingredients constitute approximately 96 of the total diet diet 2 is adapted from hashemipour et al 2015 for broiler chickens aviagen 2019b the starter period is 10 days the grower and finisher periods are 14 days and 18 days respectively wheat soybean meal and soybean oil are considered as main ingredients for this alternative diet table 2 covering almost 96 of the chicken diet sex effects were not considered in the simulation however diet 1 is specific for both male and female broilers biasato et al 2018 2017 while diet 2 is not gender specific hashemipour et al 2015 to convert by products to raw agricultural material the dry matter contents and conversion factors reported in table s3 supplementary material were used the conversion factor suggests the amount of feed fraction achievable from 1 kg of raw material 2 2 2 feed self sufficiency and feed trade whether the amount of ingredients produced locally maize and or wheat soybean is enough to satisfy the national chicken feed demand was assessed this was done by relating the diets to the number of chickens slaughtered annually in that country data were taken from the fao fbs faostat 2016 for each commodity the chicken feed demand was compared with the amount of feed produced in each country where the feed production was quantified by removing the percentage of feed imported and or stocked from the previous year from the total feed quantity where the demand is higher than the production the country is considered not self sufficient thus the country is trade dependent for countries where neither local production nor imports meet the demand for cereals maize or wheat by chickens the possibility of mixing the two ingredients was evaluated depending on the local availability of maize and wheat the results at the country scale were then aggregated and presented at the global macro regional scale the associated feed flows were assumed in an intra region trade and were not evaluated in this global scale scenario 2 2 3 land assessment after estimating the chicken feed availability diet 1 or 2 was selected for each country as the main broiler diet according to the ingredient most produced locally and most used as feed between maize and wheat as reported in the fao fbs faostat 2016 after the diet selection the cropland area needed to grow the three crops maize wheat and soybean was estimated considering the country crop yield faostat 2016 this area was then compared to the country area currently cultivated for feed production where the area needed was greater than the area currently cultivated for feed feed imports were considered in these cases we refer to virtually imported land as the land needed for the cultivation of the imported feed this results in a virtual land trade associated with feed imports the detailed country analysis of this trade was performed only for the first ten poultry producer countries in the detailed scenario in the global scenario the land associated with feed crop production was totally allocated to the poultry producer country distinguishing only between local and non local fraction this latter was obtained with the crop specific yield of the producer country which in fact can vary in quantity depending on the partner country yields macro regional results are presented 2 2 4 water assessment gw and bw calculations associated with feed crop production maize wheat and soybean were obtained with the watneeds model chiarelli et al 2020 as for the detailed scenario as was done for the land assessment for the global scenario we distinguished only between gw and bw local and non local for macro regions 3 results 3 1 top 10 poultry producers analysis 3 1 1 self sufficient and import dependent countries in terms of chicken feed the meat sector and poultry production in particular hide an extensive trade of raw materials being a large producer of white meat often does not coincide with being self sufficient in terms of the local availability of feed required to support this production in fact no country has zero imports not even the largest producers of cereals and oilseeds however in countries such as the u s and brazil these quantities are negligible among the top ten producers the u s appears to be the only truly self sufficient country able to meet its domestic chicken feed demand less than 1 of chicken feed is imported brazil is almost self sufficient and needs to import only a few thousand tons of pulses and rice 5 of chicken feed imported all the other eight producers need to rely on imports mainly for cereals and soybean demand fig 1 table s4 for cereal and pulses imports trade between countries that are relatively close to each other is common and the trade is generally smaller because of a wide variety of cereal crops while the same cannot be said for soybean imports a clear example is the trade of cereals among the u s and mexico brazil argentina and paraguay myanmar thailand and india table s4 regarding oilseed crops among the ten countries only the top soybean producers i e the u s brazil and india are self sufficient in soybean production for their chicken feed demand fig 1 on the other hand china is the only major soybean producer that is not self sufficient due to its large chicken and swine domestic production which forces china to import soybeans in fact more than 60 of the world s exports of soybean go to china mainly from the u s brazil and argentina china and the other soybean import dependent countries thus generate inter continental flows of feed crops 3 1 2 land requirements and land trade the import dependence of countries results in a global feed trade involving a virtual trade in natural resources the highest amount of land for feed production is usually used locally countries seem to use their cropland area to produce and harvest the crops they need and switch to imports when they do not have sufficient land or water when a given crop is not suitable for their climate and soil or when the local agricultural yield is not economically viable however countries such mexico indonesia iran thailand and myanmar consumed more virtual than local land being net land importers the most significant land flows appear in the soybean trade with significant amounts directed mainly by the u s 1 5 mha and brazil 2 1 mha to china table s4 the land flows between north america u s and canada and latin america brazil argentina and paraguay to several asian countries are smaller but not negligible fig 1 table s4 adding together the local and virtual land associated with chicken feed india s poultry production has the highest land footprint that is 27 4 m2 chicken the u s requires the lowest demand for land requiring 7 4 m2 chicken thanks to its high yield both for cereal and oilseed crops however considering the total country chicken production china has the greatest land demand amounting to 13 4 mha table s4 the total land demand for chicken production in the top ten producer countries results in 52 mha covering 60 of poultry production globally cereals represent on average 50 of the land demand 27 mha contributing over 60 to the chicken diet layers and broilers diet due to the high yields observed in the last few decades soybean and other oilseed crops cover 48 of the land demand 24 3 mha being 20 30 of the dfi and pulses roots and tubers cover 2 of the total land 3 1 3 water requirements and water trade the water demand varies significantly depending on the location climate and soil crop yield and extent of cropland rice and cassava are to be the most gw demanding crop while wheat and rice are the most bw demanding referring to bw all the relevant virtual flows are from the u s to asian countries and to mexico the u s in fact is the greatest net exporter of bw through the production and export of irrigated crops on the other hand gw flows almost completely reflect the virtual land trade scenario fig 1 table s4 accordingly the flow between the u s to china made up mainly of soybean is confirmed to be the greatest both in land and water volumes both gw and bw on the other hand the other substantial flow again of soybean from brazil to china is relevant in terms of land and gw volume but completely negligible in terms of bw flow fig 1 in addition the results show that india has the highest both gw 11 7 m3 chicken and bw footprint 2 2 m3 chicken and u s has the lowest gw footprint 4 3 m3 chicken but not the bw 0 2 m3 chicken brazil indonesia and thailand in fact show a lower bw footprint than 0 1 m3 chicken only a small share of crops used as chicken feed are irrigated of the crop water demand on average more than 90 is provided by rainfall thus reducing the demand for irrigation water countries in near east and north africa such as iran are an exception gw covers 18 of the maize water demand and only 24 of the soybean water demand the high demand for bw is mainly linked to the fact that 100 of the maize area and in general the area under cultivation in iran is irrigated to supplement the low rainfall usually occurring during the maize growing season ababaei and ramezani etedali 2017 faramarzi et al 2009 there is a similar situation in egypt fao 2015 3 1 4 feed trade soybean in china the domestic pressure on food production in many countries has been outsourced in foreign countries on a food feed trade basis as a result the natural resources requirements to produce agricultural commodities and the implications of their use have been transferred from the consumer to the exporting country carr et al 2013 da silva et al 2017 hoekstra 2003 qiang et al 2020 rulli et al 2019 in such cases the amount of land demand can vary depending on the importing countries and their crop yields hayami and ruttan 2011 a clear example is the difference in agricultural yields in china and the u s considering maize the average national values are approximately 6 tons ha and 11 8 tons ha respectively while for soybean 1 8 tons ha and 3 5 tons ha faostat 2016 therefore the land requirement for maize and soybean in china is more than double that of the u s if produced domestically although the total number of chickens is not that different that is 9 8 billion and 8 9 billion heads year respectively while for cereals it can be very difficult to trace and analyze the dtm due to high volumes of trade the trade in soybean is more clearly defined soybean is mainly exported by brazil and the u s which together in 2016 accounted for 65 of the global soybean production faostat 2016 while china imported 65 of the total soybean on the market brazil and the u s are completely soybean self sufficient while china is soybean import dependent fig 1 table s4 the fao s dtm faostat 2016 shows that in 2016 china was responsible for only 9 of its soybean domestic supply while the three top exporters brazil u s and argentina integrated china s needs by 42 36 and 8 respectively faostat 2016 the resources associated with china s chicken feed demand are reported in table 3 which shows that if china had produced all the soybean required for its poultry production locally it would have needed 8 2 mha of land 3 4 km3 of bw and 33 km3 of gw these quantities are higher than those associated with the current trade scenario thus showing how importing raw materials seems to be the best solution for the country 5 1 mha of land 0 6 km3 of bw and 26 2 km3 of gw in particular bw consumption is lower 83 because irrigation contributes much more to the soybean water demand in china thenkabail et al 2017 than in brazil and argentina where soybean is mostly rainfed willaarts et al 2011 3 2 global scale analysis 3 2 1 self sufficient and import dependent regions in terms of chicken feed maize based diets seem to be preferred globally 70 of countries thus representing the top feed item demanded wheat based diets are preferred over maize based ones in 30 of countries including russia north american countries are able to completely meet their cereal feed demand with their local maize production in fact on average the local maize feed production of these countries covers 100 of their chicken cereal demand in the russian federation chicken feed demand is entirely satisfied by both the local maize and wheat production with wheat being more cultivated fig 2 however not all countries and consequently the macro regions produce enough maize and or wheat to meet their chicken feed demand and thus they need to rely on imports as is the case of western europe south asia oceania near east and north africa latin america and the caribbean in these regions cereal feed is supplied both by domestic production and imports finally the data in sub saharan africa and east and southeast asia show that it is currently impossible to meet the demand for cereals to feed chickens with the two diets proposed here either with local production or by importing or mixing which suggests that in these regions backyard systems are used to feed poultry fig 2 from a global perspective considering the first hundred poultry producer countries covering 99 of the global chickens stock approximately 40 of countries have a sufficient local production of maize to feed chickens and 20 have sufficient wheat by mixing maize and wheat produced domestically 50 of countries are able to meet the cereal feed demand adding cereal feed imports to the domestic production the cereals chicken feed demand can be satisfied in 82 of countries finally some countries 18 appear to have insufficient amounts of both cereals mainly in sub saharan africa and south east asia fig 2 also considering mixed and imported feed in addition the results highlight that in all of these countries that are unable to meet their chicken feed demand the prevalence of undernourishment indicator percentage of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels required is higher than 5 fao et al 2020 from a macro regional perspective only the north america region is self sufficient in terms of soybean fig 2 the russian federation almost meets its demand with soybean imports while all the other regions do not and in fact usually mix soybean with other oilseed crops i e cotton rape palm only 12 of countries globally are self sufficient in soybean and are able to meet their chicken feed demand and approximately 14 meet the demand by importing soybean as feed however the remaining 74 do not satisfy the demand in any way 3 2 2 results in terms of land requirement for feed supply in terms of only relying on maize based diet diet 1 as the main source of carbohydrates 44 mha of land are needed to sustain the global chicken feed demand while 67 mha of land are required for a global wheat based chicken diet diet 2 an additional 64 mha of land are necessary for soybean production which provide 35 of the chicken s diet while cereals cover 61 maize seems to be the best option in terms of land cultivation to meet the chicken cereal feed demand however countries such as australia and the united kingdom have a very low maize harvested area 53 thousand and zero hectares respectively and the feed fraction is imported or more frequently substituted with a wheat based diet consequently only one of the two diets was applied in each country as described in the methods section and the land requirement was recalculated east and southeast asia and latin america and the caribbean need the highest amount of land to cultivate cereals mainly maize in both regions 12 4 mha and 10 4 mha of land respectively table 4 east and southeast asia also need the highest amount of land for soybean 23 2 mha in contrast with latin america and the caribbean 9 6 mha where soybean crops are more suited to and reach higher values of productivity resulting in a lower land demand however in terms of feed availability several regions are not able to meet their demand these import dependent regions and countries are net virtual land importers in the animal feed sector north america latin america and the caribbean and oceania are usually net exporters of virtual land while some asian and mediterranean countries are net importers fader et al 2011 qiang et al 2020 table 4 from a global point of view approximately 37 mha of land for maize diet 1 70 of countries and 12 mha of land for wheat diet 2 30 of countries are required to satisfy the demand for cereals as chicken feed 76 local land the land demand for soybean is 64 mha 40 local 3 2 3 results in terms of water requirements for feed supply wheat is on average the most water demanding crop m3 ha among the three feed ingredients analyzed however since diet 1 is the most common the highest amount of water resources used for single feed ingredient production is actually for maize 163 km3 rather than wheat 62 km3 local water volumes for cereal crops represent 75 of the total cereal water demand this water demand is concentrated in east and southeast asia both in terms of bw and gw requirements and latin america and the caribbean for the gw demand thus confirming the results obtained for the land demand a higher demand for gw in fact is usually accompanied by a larger cropland area however a high demand for blue water is related to the use of irrigation systems davis et al 2017 areas equipped for irrigation are more diffused in the near east and north africa i e egypt and iran east and southeast asia china south asia india and north america u s table 4 the soybean water demand does not show the same trend as that for cereals the cultivation of soybean crops in fact is not as widespread as cereals and is concentrated in specific countries namely the u s brazil argentina and india thus only small fractions of soybean water volumes as soybean land are actually consumed locally 46 table 4 the remaining non local volumes 54 of the total are associated with the international soybean trade and are thus virtual water flows that may vary on the assumption that only one of the diets is applied in each country it is estimated that chicken feed production requires 224 km3 of water for cereals 197 km3 and 27 km3 of gw and bw respectively and 269 km3 for soybean 244 km3 and 25 km3 globally table 4 similarly to the land requirement results the water volumes needed to cultivate the three crops for the two diets are often not consumed domestically but in the country where the feed is imported from 4 discussion 4 1 virtual land and water trade effects international trade in raw materials seems to be a winning solution in those countries where the domestic demand for feed is not met due to water and or land scarcity in this context thanks to these global virtual flows in fact china is currently the largest producer of monogastric meat despite being able to produce less than 10 of the soybean demand domestically required by this sector countries such as indonesia iran and myanmar are also among the top ten poultry producers even though they depend on feed imports not only of soybean but also of cereals the international trade in raw materials can also reduce the pressure on natural resources this may involve land and water savings if crops cereals or oilseeds are traded from a country with more efficient land uses or relatively high water productivity to a country with less efficient land uses or low water productivity d odorico et al 2014 qiang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 again china appears to be the most significant example saving nearly 3 mha of land and about 2 8 km3 and 6 7 km3 of bw and gw respectively by importing soybean instead of increasing its local production table 4 however at the same time pressure on the environment has grown dramatically in different forms wiedmann 2016 global issues such as land use change biodiversity loss food insecurity water scarcity and deforestation are often caused by international trade through this in fact distant consumers and natural resources find themselves interconnected within the global human and natural telecoupled system rulli et al 2019 our analysis fits this context by showing how in the white meat production sector the largest virtual flows of resources associated with feed imports are those related to soybean exports from brazil and the u s to china the extent and the actors in this flow have changed rapidly in recent years from soybean imports by china which until the end of the last century came almost entirely from the u s to 2012 when imports from brazil exceeded that from the u s to 2018 when china increased soybean imports in order to import 70 of brazilian soybeans and 18 from the u s faostat 2018 the increased imports of brazilian soybean have had significant impacts on deforestation of the amazon forest with the expansion of soybean being one of the largest drivers da silva et al 2017 fearnside and figueiredo 2015 gollnow et al 2018 masuda and goldsmith 2012 torres et al 2017 zu ermgassen et al 2020 furthermore despite its water abundance in recent decades brazil has stated to have problems with water scarcity as a result of agricultural displacement combined with climate effects brito 2018 lathuillière et al 2018 willaarts et al 2011 another important issue arising from the international trade is the dependance of countries which threatens the resilience of the food system arsenault 2015 fader et al 2013 gil 2020 seekell et al 2017 more and more countries are dependent on global food trade which creates vulnerability largely due to population growth and changes in food habits this food trade dependence will continue to exacerbate the exposure of importing countries to international market shocks fao 2009 seekell et al 2017 xu 2019 macdonald 2013 4 2 alternative diets in africa and asia most countries in sub saharan africa and south east asia cannot sustain the demand for maize or wheat based chicken diets even with imports or mixing grains table 4 fig 2 this is even more true for soybean however often the chicken production in these countries is limited and backyard systems prevail over industrial ones in fact in sub saharan africa and south east asia it has been estimated that 45 or more of chickens are raised in extensive or backyard systems intensive system share 55 table s2 due to the shortage of cereals and oilseeds but also income disparities chicken and livestock diets in these regions are very different from those used in other parts of the globe in particular with respect to industrial livestock systems davis et al 2018 gilbert et al 2015 seré and steinfeld 1996 backyard systems are mainly subsistence driven animals produce meat and eggs for the owner or the local market diets in these types of systems consist mainly of swill and scavenging from 20 to 40 of dfi with locally produced feed covering the rest of the diet mottet et al 2017 seré and steinfeld 1996 the diet composition in different production systems is reported in table s1 supplementary material soybean meal stands out as the standard protein supplement for many reasons such as its amino acid pattern the lack of anti nutritional factors and its expansion as a cash crop in many regions worldwide ravindran and blair 1992 1991 however the availability of soybean meal for livestock feed in asia is low figure s3 for two main reasons firstly in most asian countries soybean is used as food more than as animal feed unlike in europe and the americas secondly soybean is much less productive in asia compared to other countries where twice as much is produced hayami and ruttan 2011 ravindran and blair 1992 faostat 2016 a wide range of alternative protein sources in asian countries were explored by ravindran and blair 1991 1992 mainly including other oilseed meals such as cottonseed groundnut and rapeseed or grain legumes ali and leeson 1995 also studied the use of snail meal for male broilers diet as a replacement for soybean meal with similar body weight weight gain and feed grain to those seen in chickens fed with maize soybean meal diet most african countries also show a deficit in local production and imports for both energy cereals and protein oilseeds sources fig 2 this can be partially explained by the recent increase in the cost of maize due to competition with the human food industry biofuel production and droughts in some parts of africa morgan and choct 2016 such increases in the cost of conventional raw materials have led to the interest in alternative feed resources that can replace a proportion of these products in poultry diets at a lower cost of production cassava is the highest supplier of carbohydrates energy source among staple crops and could potentially replace maize as an energy source in poultry diets morgan and choct 2016 onabolu et al 2001 to integrate the poultry diet in these countries and to give chickens the protein supplement needed cassava leaves seeds or cakes which are richer in protein are included in the diet alternatively synthetic amino acids can be used as supplements morgan and choct 2016 or a large amount of peel can also be used in the poultry diet diarra 2018 insects are another sustainable option as poultry ingredient and are already part of the diet of some animals biasato et al 2017 d odorico et al 2018 pinotti et al 2019 insects have great potential for various reasons i they are rich in proteins fat and in turn energy vitamins and minerals ii they have also shown a satisfactory feed conversion efficiency compared to livestock iii they have low space requirements iv the natural diet of poultry and fish is already partly represented by insects v they are mostly omnivorous and can grow on different substrates pinotti et al 2019 this potential is also indicated by the fact that industrial insect production is increasing worldwide for instance the yearly production of insects in the eu is about 6 000 tons corresponding to an average of 2 000 3 000 tons of insect derived processed animal proteins gasco et al 2020 insects are expected to be increasingly used in europe and around the globe as a replacement for conventional animal derived proteins for aquaculture and terrestrial livestock insect protein production for both human food and animal feed in 2025 is expected to be more than 1 2 mt reaching about 10 of the eu share of total protein supply gasco et al 2020 at a world level the 24 4 growth in the quantity produced per year over the next decade is predicted for both food and feed markets with a global production that will reach more than 730 000 tons in 2030 wood 2019 4 3 competition between animal feed and primary food for human consumption approximately 50 of the world s agricultural area and 40 of total arable land are used for livestock feed production and grazing karlsson and röös 2019 mottet et al 2017 in the current food system the production of animal feed already competes with human food production with negative implications for the total food supply di paola et al 2017 poultry production requires the most land for cereal production estimated in this analysis as 27 mha needed by the top ten poultry producers and approximately 49 mha globally including only maize and wheat crops one third of the global production of cereal grains 963 million tons year ends up in livestock feed fao 2013 136 million tons required by the top ten poultry producers and 215 million tons globally including only maize and wheat cereal crops our estimated results showed a lower land demand for cereals 49 mha than 93 mha estimated by mottet et al 2017 there are two possible reasons for this underestimation i mottet et al 2017 considered a chicken diet consisting of maize barley millet rice sorghum and other cereal crops in addition they considered a more significant use of wheat as feed than those considered in our global analysis see diets table 1 table 2 table s1 all these cereals have a lower agricultural yield compared to maize thus resulting in a higher cropland area ii cereal crop yields used by mottet et al 2017 from gaez v3 0 iiasa and fao 2012 relate to the year 2000 were compared with the 2016 yields from faostat fao 2016 used in our global analysis all cereals showed much higher yields on average in 2016 than in 2000 an increase in yield of over 100 in myanmar indonesia iran and russia for maize and the same in china india iran and russia for wheat considering only the top ten chicken producers the year 2016 yields therefore translated in a lower total amount of land for cereals than estimated using the gaez v3 0 yields the results by gerber et al 2007 on the amount of cereals expressed in unit of weight tons used as chicken feed are more similar to our estimation they estimated that 28 190 million tons of cereals used in the livestock sector 666 million tons were consumed as chicken feed in 2004 similar to our estimate of 22 215 million tons for chicken over 963 million tons for livestock sector globally on the other hand considering the land required to produce oilseed crops for poultry we estimated approximately 64 mha when land is allocated to the production of different co products of the crops oil and cakes this is very similar to the amount estimated by mottet et al 2017 of 60 mha soybean yield in fact did not increase as much as that of cereals between 2000 and 2016 in addition fao and gaez showed more similar yields for this crop in our context 90 of soybean meal is used as feed for livestock 236 million tons in 2016 soyatech 2003 and the poultry segment covers 54 of this sector 125 million tons monogastric animals including both chicken and pigs can only digest simple carbohydrates and therefore they consume higher amounts of grains and agricultural co and by products and lower amounts of roughage compared to ruminants thus exacerbating the feed food competition mottet et al 2017 considering industrial poultry production given that cereal grains and oilseeds comprise more than 90 of the chickens diet broilers and layers and apart from a small proportion of by products are human edible industrial systems affect the feed food competition more than backyard systems this competition is likely to worsen the situation in several countries that already suffer from a highly undernourished population rate pou 5 especially in africa and south east asia 4 4 water effect the low contribution of bw to the crop water use showed in our results can be ascribed to the low irrigation area reported in the cropland maps used in the model mirca2000 in fact china the u s india and iran where irrigation was already widespread in the early 2000s have a relatively higher contribution of bw portmann et al 2010 compared to 2000 in several countries today the number of irrigated and rainfed harvested hectares is quite different meier et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge crop specific spatially distributed maps are still not available the irrigated area used in our model was compared with data updated to 2012 from the central intelligence agency cia 2012 to confirm the increase in the extent of this area nearly all countries have increased their irrigated area china by 37 the u s by 32 and brazil by 99 the greatest increase occurred for maize thenkabail et al 2017 soybean however still remains mostly rainfed all over the world due to the suitable climate in the areas where it is cultivated and also thanks to its high adaptability willaarts et al 2011 conclusions poultry production is the largest in the livestock sector and will continue to be according to projections chickens are also the most efficient livestock in converting feed i e natural resources into edible products however when the individual elements of the diets are considered chicken feed for industrial production 83 of poultry is in direct competition with food production due to its lower inclusion of roughage our results show that in 2016 the global feed for poultry production covered approximately 16 5 and 37 of maize wheat and soybean global production respectively these global cereals and soybean production shares require globally at least 49 mha and 64 mha of cropland area and 223 km3 and 267 km3 of water gw plus bw respectively specifically in countries covering 60 of global poultry production 24 mha of cereals and 22 mha of oilseeds are used and or traded which required 110 km3 and 117 km3 of water respectively furthermore our analysis shows how much most countries depend on trade in terms of chicken meat production due to the lack of local feed crop production soybean in particular this leads to an inevitable degree of production uncertainty and vulnerability which is bound to increase with the projected growth in population and demand for food compromising the resilience of the sector both in terms of future food availability and increasing pressure on the environment however international feed trade flows could contribute to global land or water savings if trade is directed from a relatively more efficient to a less efficient country in crop production qiang et al 2013 feed researchers and producers are thus investigating innovative and sustainable protein and energy supplies

285,the poultry industry plays an important role in meat production supply with a growth rate of more than 4 p a in the last few years this white meat production requires a large amount of feed that increases competition in the use of natural resources for primary food and other uses grains are the primary source of poultry nutrition and oilseeds are the most common protein source with maize wheat and soybean being the most common ingredients in poultry diets it is not clear to what extent natural resources are used to produce these feed crops and what the impact is of the resulting pressure on the availability of natural resources for other uses the study evaluates and quantifies the local feed availability and the associated amount of local and non local land and water resources required for the poultry production worldwide at a country and region scale as of 2016 including a detailed global feed trade analysis for the top poultry producer countries country specific diets were used for the ten largest producer countries and two simplified diets for the global scale the feed amounts were converted in land and water demand using crop specific yields and a phisically based and spatially distributed hydrological model the findings showed that 49 mha of cereals 37 mha local and 64 mha of soybean 25 mha local are needed to feed chickens globally together with approximately 441 km3 of green water 197 km3 and 244 km3 for cereals and soybean respectively and 52 km3 of blue water 27 km3 and 25 km3 respectively required by these feed crops in 2016 however significant amounts of natural resources are saved through the international feed trade the results obtained suggest the need for more sustainable approaches to address future projections in the sector keywords livestock land water feed food poultry 1 introduction with the planet s increasing population which the un estimates will reach over nine billion inhabitants worldwide by 2050 the challenge of feeding the planet is at the top of the agenda fao 2018a un 2019 meat consumption plays a predominant role above all in countries with significant gdp growth and the production of poultry meat is crucial alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 poultry meat and eggs are among the most common animal products consumed globally by a wide diversity of cultures traditions and religions making them key to food security and nutrition mottet and tempio 2017 chickens are raised in a wide range of production systems and provide mainly meat eggs and manure for crop fertilization according to fao in 2016 more than 106 million tons of chicken meat were produced and roughly 66 billion chickens were slaughtered globally which corresponds approximately to nine birds per person faostat 2016 only two years later in 2018 there had been an increase of more than 8 4 p a in poultry meat with approximately 70 billion chickens slaughtered in 2018 faostat 2018 global per capita consumption of poultry meat increased from 2 9 kg in 1961 to 15 6 kg in 2018 faostat 2018 alexandratos and bruinsma estimated that the world s demand for animal derived food could increase by 70 between 2005 and 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 poultry meat is thus expected to have the highest growth 121 while the demand for beef and pork is predicted to increase by 66 and 43 respectively this growth in the poultry sector also leads to a significant increase in the demand for feed and raw materials kleyn and ciacciariello 2021 the availability of low priced and high quality feed that keep poultry meat competitive and simultaneously meet the increasing demand ravindran 2013 is fundamental for this sector however the growing demand for poultry risks creating a competition between the feed and human primary food sectors as cereals and oilseeds are the two main feed crops used in chicken diets but they are also extensively consumed as primary human food mottet et al 2017 mottet and tempio 2017 pauwels 2016 in addition to an exacerbation of the feed food competition the growth in feed demand is part of the framework of global food trade which accompanies the growth in population and food demand and the increase in interconnections between countries almeida et al 2021 kim et al 2019 the pressure on the environment is already a global challenge and the increasing demand in feed and food is intensifying the problem of the limited availability of natural resources in fact both land and water resources the basis of our food production are limited and already under pressure at the same time future agricultural production will need to be more productive and more sustainable unep 2016 weeks 2020 livestock is one of the sectors that consumes the most natural resources both locally and globally fao and steinfeld 2006 according to some studies including those conducted by the world wide fund for nature world wildlife fund 2020 and the global footprint network global footprint network 2020 humans are already using more than one earth s worth of resources in its report world livestock transforming the livestock sector through the sustainable development goals the fao assessed the correlation between this sector and the sdgs proposed by the un in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development fao 2018b un 2018 agriculture uses approximately 70 of the available freshwater supply and roughly 30 of this is used in livestock production sdg 6 fao 2013 gerbens leenes et al 2013 heinke et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 similarly 26 of the earth s surface land is used for livestock grazing and 33 of croplands above all cereals crops are used for livestock feed production sdg 15 fao 2013 fao and steinfeld 2006 karlsson and röös 2019 mottet et al 2017 more than 465 million tons of feed were consumed by the poultry sector in 2020 alltech 2020 poultry is the most efficient livestock segment in the use of natural resources consuming less feed to produce the same amount of protein fao and steinfeld 2006 gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 mottet and tempio 2017 ravindran 2013 however it is estimated that poultry feed requires nearly 93 mha of cereal and 60 mha of oilseed crops mottet and tempio 2017 and consumes 11 255 km3 y and 7 167 km3 y of the total water used for animal production in the form of meat and egg products respectively mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 previous works have highlighted the total significant amount of resources required by the livestock sector and how these uses of resources can compete with other sectors to guarantee local food security el deek et al 2020 gerbens leenes et al 2013 gerber et al 2007 heinke et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 mottet et al 2017 mottet and tempio 2017 specifically for the poultry sector mottet et al 2017 quantified the total feed demand and the associated land in oecd and non oecd countries calculating the proportions in which these amounts compete with the demand for primary food for humans including all the ingredients in various animals diets in terms of water use studies by mekonnen hoekstra and gerbens leenes showed the water footprint of white meat production at the country level gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 however to the best of our knowledge there have been no specific studies on the consumption of natural resources i e land and water for poultry meat production where local feed availability and feed trade flows are also assessed and quantified specifically here we propose a methodology to evaluate and quantify the detailed feed trade associated with poultry production in the top ten producer countries and the local and non local cereals and oilseed availability for chickens on a global scale with reference to 2016 the most up to date data available consequently the double scale analysis calculates the land and water associated with this feed production in both the producers and the partner countries in the trade of raw materials country specific chicken diets were used for the top ten producers and two simpler balanced diets in the global scale scenario to explore the role and the impacts of white meat production on the environment 2 methods the impacts of chicken diets on natural resources were assessed under two different scales firstly a detailed analysis of the top ten poultry producer countries was carried out section 2 1 then the analysis was enlarged to the global scale section 2 2 in order to create a global overview of the effects of white meat production 2 1 top 10 poultry producers analysis according to fao faostat 2016 the top ten poultry producer countries in 2016 were china u s brazil indonesia russia india iran mexico thailand and myanmar alone these countries contributed to almost 60 of the global production 40 of which was ascribed just to the first three figure s1 supplementary material faostat 2016 2 1 1 chicken diets and production systems chicken diet composition data were taken from the global livestock environmental assessment model gleam version 2 0 developed and updated by fao fao 2018c gerber et al 2013 for the ten countries we selected chicken production is categorized into backyard layer and broiler systems crops are used as animal feed in different forms i as the main crop e g grains or whole crops ii as crop residues such as straw or iii as agro industrial by products e g brans and cakes accordingly the ingredients included in the diets were converted from dry dm to fresh matter using dm contents from gleam the fresh values of each feed material were then corrected by the feed use efficiency fue which is the fraction of the crop that is effectively ingested and used as feed by the animals fao 2018c the diets are mainly composed of cereal grains from wheat maize barley millet rice and sorghum and oilseed crops soybean rape cotton and palm kernel cereal and oilseed crops are often combined with pulses roots and tubers and other secondary ingredients such as fishmeal when allowed by the law and limestone as well as supplements amino acids minerals however fishmeal complements limestone swill and scavenging that are particularly used in backyard systems were not included in the analysis as they are not involved in the feed food competition and do not put increasing pressure on resources furthermore crop residues and by products from grain industries and from cottonseed oil production were not converted into natural resources because they are produced primarily for food or other uses while the feed fraction is from processing waste the demand for country chicken feed was estimated by considering the numbers of animals in each production system and the relative associated diet the chicken production systems were categorized using the methodology described in gilbert et al 2015 following gleam they developed a model to estimate the numbers of animals differentiating them between those raised in backyards and industrial systems animals in industrial systems were further sub divided into layers and broilers combining production data on meat and eggs from faostat and productivity data from gleam fao 2018c faostat 2016 in our analysis we considered the total number of slaughtered chickens in 2016 faostat 2016 considering that broilers are slaughtered after 42 days for meat while backyard and layers which are raised mainly for egg production have a total life of approximately three years fao 2018c we report the regional values of feed rations and the percentage of chickens in the production system used in this study in table s1 and table s2 supplementary material while the total daily feed intake dfi is taken from mottet et al 2017 and gleam fao 2018c 2 1 2 feed self sufficiency and feed trade the total amount of fresh raw material of all dietary ingredients needed were compared with the local availability of feed for livestock for this fao food balance sheets fbs were used splitting between local and imported feed use faostat 2016 as described in figure s3 supplementary material soybean is mainly processed to obtain oil 20 that is used both for human and animal feed and meal 78 which is almost all used as a protein source for livestock dei 2011 soyatech 2003 the quantity of soybean used directly as feed was considered together with that processed that is indirectly consumed as feed so obtaining the total soybean feed availability if the feed local production is insufficient to meet the local chicken feed demand of a specific country the difference between the two was added to the imported feed these countries therefore need to increase their current imports or more likely the diet applied is slightly different and they mix the available cereals differently the import feed demand was ascribed to partner countries by analyzing the detailed trade matrix dtm from the fao faostat 2016 and data from the un database comtrade un 2016 in these cases all partners the analyzed country imported feed crops from in 2016 were selected the required chicken feed production was thus allocated partly to the country itself which produces the chickens and partly to the countries where it imports the raw materials used as feed from a specific case is the trade associated with the netherlands and switzerland partners in cereals and soybean trade with iran because the re export of goods is an integral part of the dutch and swiss trade balance sheet lemmers and wong 2019 for these countries dtms were investigated despite not being among the largest poultry producers 2 1 3 land assessment the quantities of each raw material were converted into the necessary cropland area crop specific yields for each country and partners taken from fao for the year 2016 were thus used faostat 2016 the land needed to produce chicken feed for a given country was subdivided between local and non local leading to a virtual natural resources land trade analysis 2 1 4 water assessment a crop specific globally and spatially distributed water model named watneeds chiarelli et al 2020 was used to compute the amount of green gw and blue bw water associated with chicken feed production by considering the cropland area required within each country and partner countries the soil water balance was assessed daily at a 5 arc minute resolution around 10 km to obtain the crop water requirements cwrs for the selected chicken diet ingredients cwr is satisfied by gw and bw components gw is defined as the amount of water stored in the soil derived from the fraction of precipitation that does not runoff or percolate in depth but evaporates and transpires through plants bw corresponds to the fresh surface and groundwater from rivers lakes and aquifers hoekstra 2003 for rainfed crops the gw flux equates the potential evapotranspiration if soil moisture can guarantee the plant demand for water otherwise gw equates the actual evapotranspiration computed considering a coefficient of water stress condition as in chiarelli et al 2020 total bw for irrigated crops was computed as the cumulative difference of the daily crop water demand and the daily gw during the growing period of the crops crop specific cultivated areas were retrieved from the mirca dataset referring to the year 2000 and distinguishing between rainfed and irrigated areas portmann et al 2010 soil type information was taken from batjes et al 2006 based on soil data from the fao harmonized world soil database monthly data on potential reference evapotranspiration eto for the year 2016 were taken from the university of east anglia s climate research unit time series version 4 01 dataset harris et al 2014 daily precipitation data for the year 2016 were retrieved from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station version 2 0 dataset chirps funk et al 2015 and from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s climate prediction center global unified gauge based analysis of daily precipitation dataset cpc chen et al 2008 crop coefficients and growing stages were taken from allen et al 1998 and adapted from siebert and döll 2010 the total volume of water was finally estimated as the product of gw and bw respectively for the area harvested within each country obtaining the local gw and bw the virtual water trade associated with feed imports is obtained by taking into account the demand for bw and gw met through the import thus virtual non local water volumes are assessed in the partner countries considering their virtual exporting cropland area and data associated with their specific climate and soil 2 2 global scale analysis after estimating the natural resources associated with chicken feed production in the top ten poultry producing countries the analysis was extended to a global scale by making some simplifications related to chicken diets and production systems section 2 2 1 information on chicken meat production chickens slaughtered and number of chickens were taken from the fao for the year 2016 for all countries and then aggregated to the global macro regional scale as listed in figure s2 supplementary material faostat 2016 2 2 1 chicken diets and production systems the country chicken feed demand was quantified by considering only two different balanced chicken diets with maize and wheat as the main source of carbohydrates both diets analyzed in this scenario are specific for broiler chickens because on average 89 of chickens globally are reared for meat production and only the remaining 11 are reared for eggs as reported in table s2 supplementary material and in the literature fao 2018c leeson and summers 2012 the selected diets have maize and wheat as main ingredients since the two cereals are the main source of energy in broiler diets wheat based diets tend to be used for broiler chickens in europe australia and new zealand and maize based diets in the u s and asia akter et al 2017 at a global scale maize grain is commonly used as a primary basic food by humans in developing countries while in developed countries it is used mainly for animal feeding karlsson and röös 2019 in terms of protein soybean is the primary source used as feed however this assumption does not hold everywhere and there may be countries where the energy and or protein sources are different and replaced by other ingredients as described in the previous detailed scenario diet 1 is adapted from biasato et al 2017 2018 for broiler chickens with respect to three growth stages of 12 days 13 days and 17 days aviagen 2019a the diet is mainly composed of maize meal maize gluten meal soybean meal and soybean oil table 1 these ingredients constitute approximately 96 of the total diet diet 2 is adapted from hashemipour et al 2015 for broiler chickens aviagen 2019b the starter period is 10 days the grower and finisher periods are 14 days and 18 days respectively wheat soybean meal and soybean oil are considered as main ingredients for this alternative diet table 2 covering almost 96 of the chicken diet sex effects were not considered in the simulation however diet 1 is specific for both male and female broilers biasato et al 2018 2017 while diet 2 is not gender specific hashemipour et al 2015 to convert by products to raw agricultural material the dry matter contents and conversion factors reported in table s3 supplementary material were used the conversion factor suggests the amount of feed fraction achievable from 1 kg of raw material 2 2 2 feed self sufficiency and feed trade whether the amount of ingredients produced locally maize and or wheat soybean is enough to satisfy the national chicken feed demand was assessed this was done by relating the diets to the number of chickens slaughtered annually in that country data were taken from the fao fbs faostat 2016 for each commodity the chicken feed demand was compared with the amount of feed produced in each country where the feed production was quantified by removing the percentage of feed imported and or stocked from the previous year from the total feed quantity where the demand is higher than the production the country is considered not self sufficient thus the country is trade dependent for countries where neither local production nor imports meet the demand for cereals maize or wheat by chickens the possibility of mixing the two ingredients was evaluated depending on the local availability of maize and wheat the results at the country scale were then aggregated and presented at the global macro regional scale the associated feed flows were assumed in an intra region trade and were not evaluated in this global scale scenario 2 2 3 land assessment after estimating the chicken feed availability diet 1 or 2 was selected for each country as the main broiler diet according to the ingredient most produced locally and most used as feed between maize and wheat as reported in the fao fbs faostat 2016 after the diet selection the cropland area needed to grow the three crops maize wheat and soybean was estimated considering the country crop yield faostat 2016 this area was then compared to the country area currently cultivated for feed production where the area needed was greater than the area currently cultivated for feed feed imports were considered in these cases we refer to virtually imported land as the land needed for the cultivation of the imported feed this results in a virtual land trade associated with feed imports the detailed country analysis of this trade was performed only for the first ten poultry producer countries in the detailed scenario in the global scenario the land associated with feed crop production was totally allocated to the poultry producer country distinguishing only between local and non local fraction this latter was obtained with the crop specific yield of the producer country which in fact can vary in quantity depending on the partner country yields macro regional results are presented 2 2 4 water assessment gw and bw calculations associated with feed crop production maize wheat and soybean were obtained with the watneeds model chiarelli et al 2020 as for the detailed scenario as was done for the land assessment for the global scenario we distinguished only between gw and bw local and non local for macro regions 3 results 3 1 top 10 poultry producers analysis 3 1 1 self sufficient and import dependent countries in terms of chicken feed the meat sector and poultry production in particular hide an extensive trade of raw materials being a large producer of white meat often does not coincide with being self sufficient in terms of the local availability of feed required to support this production in fact no country has zero imports not even the largest producers of cereals and oilseeds however in countries such as the u s and brazil these quantities are negligible among the top ten producers the u s appears to be the only truly self sufficient country able to meet its domestic chicken feed demand less than 1 of chicken feed is imported brazil is almost self sufficient and needs to import only a few thousand tons of pulses and rice 5 of chicken feed imported all the other eight producers need to rely on imports mainly for cereals and soybean demand fig 1 table s4 for cereal and pulses imports trade between countries that are relatively close to each other is common and the trade is generally smaller because of a wide variety of cereal crops while the same cannot be said for soybean imports a clear example is the trade of cereals among the u s and mexico brazil argentina and paraguay myanmar thailand and india table s4 regarding oilseed crops among the ten countries only the top soybean producers i e the u s brazil and india are self sufficient in soybean production for their chicken feed demand fig 1 on the other hand china is the only major soybean producer that is not self sufficient due to its large chicken and swine domestic production which forces china to import soybeans in fact more than 60 of the world s exports of soybean go to china mainly from the u s brazil and argentina china and the other soybean import dependent countries thus generate inter continental flows of feed crops 3 1 2 land requirements and land trade the import dependence of countries results in a global feed trade involving a virtual trade in natural resources the highest amount of land for feed production is usually used locally countries seem to use their cropland area to produce and harvest the crops they need and switch to imports when they do not have sufficient land or water when a given crop is not suitable for their climate and soil or when the local agricultural yield is not economically viable however countries such mexico indonesia iran thailand and myanmar consumed more virtual than local land being net land importers the most significant land flows appear in the soybean trade with significant amounts directed mainly by the u s 1 5 mha and brazil 2 1 mha to china table s4 the land flows between north america u s and canada and latin america brazil argentina and paraguay to several asian countries are smaller but not negligible fig 1 table s4 adding together the local and virtual land associated with chicken feed india s poultry production has the highest land footprint that is 27 4 m2 chicken the u s requires the lowest demand for land requiring 7 4 m2 chicken thanks to its high yield both for cereal and oilseed crops however considering the total country chicken production china has the greatest land demand amounting to 13 4 mha table s4 the total land demand for chicken production in the top ten producer countries results in 52 mha covering 60 of poultry production globally cereals represent on average 50 of the land demand 27 mha contributing over 60 to the chicken diet layers and broilers diet due to the high yields observed in the last few decades soybean and other oilseed crops cover 48 of the land demand 24 3 mha being 20 30 of the dfi and pulses roots and tubers cover 2 of the total land 3 1 3 water requirements and water trade the water demand varies significantly depending on the location climate and soil crop yield and extent of cropland rice and cassava are to be the most gw demanding crop while wheat and rice are the most bw demanding referring to bw all the relevant virtual flows are from the u s to asian countries and to mexico the u s in fact is the greatest net exporter of bw through the production and export of irrigated crops on the other hand gw flows almost completely reflect the virtual land trade scenario fig 1 table s4 accordingly the flow between the u s to china made up mainly of soybean is confirmed to be the greatest both in land and water volumes both gw and bw on the other hand the other substantial flow again of soybean from brazil to china is relevant in terms of land and gw volume but completely negligible in terms of bw flow fig 1 in addition the results show that india has the highest both gw 11 7 m3 chicken and bw footprint 2 2 m3 chicken and u s has the lowest gw footprint 4 3 m3 chicken but not the bw 0 2 m3 chicken brazil indonesia and thailand in fact show a lower bw footprint than 0 1 m3 chicken only a small share of crops used as chicken feed are irrigated of the crop water demand on average more than 90 is provided by rainfall thus reducing the demand for irrigation water countries in near east and north africa such as iran are an exception gw covers 18 of the maize water demand and only 24 of the soybean water demand the high demand for bw is mainly linked to the fact that 100 of the maize area and in general the area under cultivation in iran is irrigated to supplement the low rainfall usually occurring during the maize growing season ababaei and ramezani etedali 2017 faramarzi et al 2009 there is a similar situation in egypt fao 2015 3 1 4 feed trade soybean in china the domestic pressure on food production in many countries has been outsourced in foreign countries on a food feed trade basis as a result the natural resources requirements to produce agricultural commodities and the implications of their use have been transferred from the consumer to the exporting country carr et al 2013 da silva et al 2017 hoekstra 2003 qiang et al 2020 rulli et al 2019 in such cases the amount of land demand can vary depending on the importing countries and their crop yields hayami and ruttan 2011 a clear example is the difference in agricultural yields in china and the u s considering maize the average national values are approximately 6 tons ha and 11 8 tons ha respectively while for soybean 1 8 tons ha and 3 5 tons ha faostat 2016 therefore the land requirement for maize and soybean in china is more than double that of the u s if produced domestically although the total number of chickens is not that different that is 9 8 billion and 8 9 billion heads year respectively while for cereals it can be very difficult to trace and analyze the dtm due to high volumes of trade the trade in soybean is more clearly defined soybean is mainly exported by brazil and the u s which together in 2016 accounted for 65 of the global soybean production faostat 2016 while china imported 65 of the total soybean on the market brazil and the u s are completely soybean self sufficient while china is soybean import dependent fig 1 table s4 the fao s dtm faostat 2016 shows that in 2016 china was responsible for only 9 of its soybean domestic supply while the three top exporters brazil u s and argentina integrated china s needs by 42 36 and 8 respectively faostat 2016 the resources associated with china s chicken feed demand are reported in table 3 which shows that if china had produced all the soybean required for its poultry production locally it would have needed 8 2 mha of land 3 4 km3 of bw and 33 km3 of gw these quantities are higher than those associated with the current trade scenario thus showing how importing raw materials seems to be the best solution for the country 5 1 mha of land 0 6 km3 of bw and 26 2 km3 of gw in particular bw consumption is lower 83 because irrigation contributes much more to the soybean water demand in china thenkabail et al 2017 than in brazil and argentina where soybean is mostly rainfed willaarts et al 2011 3 2 global scale analysis 3 2 1 self sufficient and import dependent regions in terms of chicken feed maize based diets seem to be preferred globally 70 of countries thus representing the top feed item demanded wheat based diets are preferred over maize based ones in 30 of countries including russia north american countries are able to completely meet their cereal feed demand with their local maize production in fact on average the local maize feed production of these countries covers 100 of their chicken cereal demand in the russian federation chicken feed demand is entirely satisfied by both the local maize and wheat production with wheat being more cultivated fig 2 however not all countries and consequently the macro regions produce enough maize and or wheat to meet their chicken feed demand and thus they need to rely on imports as is the case of western europe south asia oceania near east and north africa latin america and the caribbean in these regions cereal feed is supplied both by domestic production and imports finally the data in sub saharan africa and east and southeast asia show that it is currently impossible to meet the demand for cereals to feed chickens with the two diets proposed here either with local production or by importing or mixing which suggests that in these regions backyard systems are used to feed poultry fig 2 from a global perspective considering the first hundred poultry producer countries covering 99 of the global chickens stock approximately 40 of countries have a sufficient local production of maize to feed chickens and 20 have sufficient wheat by mixing maize and wheat produced domestically 50 of countries are able to meet the cereal feed demand adding cereal feed imports to the domestic production the cereals chicken feed demand can be satisfied in 82 of countries finally some countries 18 appear to have insufficient amounts of both cereals mainly in sub saharan africa and south east asia fig 2 also considering mixed and imported feed in addition the results highlight that in all of these countries that are unable to meet their chicken feed demand the prevalence of undernourishment indicator percentage of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels required is higher than 5 fao et al 2020 from a macro regional perspective only the north america region is self sufficient in terms of soybean fig 2 the russian federation almost meets its demand with soybean imports while all the other regions do not and in fact usually mix soybean with other oilseed crops i e cotton rape palm only 12 of countries globally are self sufficient in soybean and are able to meet their chicken feed demand and approximately 14 meet the demand by importing soybean as feed however the remaining 74 do not satisfy the demand in any way 3 2 2 results in terms of land requirement for feed supply in terms of only relying on maize based diet diet 1 as the main source of carbohydrates 44 mha of land are needed to sustain the global chicken feed demand while 67 mha of land are required for a global wheat based chicken diet diet 2 an additional 64 mha of land are necessary for soybean production which provide 35 of the chicken s diet while cereals cover 61 maize seems to be the best option in terms of land cultivation to meet the chicken cereal feed demand however countries such as australia and the united kingdom have a very low maize harvested area 53 thousand and zero hectares respectively and the feed fraction is imported or more frequently substituted with a wheat based diet consequently only one of the two diets was applied in each country as described in the methods section and the land requirement was recalculated east and southeast asia and latin america and the caribbean need the highest amount of land to cultivate cereals mainly maize in both regions 12 4 mha and 10 4 mha of land respectively table 4 east and southeast asia also need the highest amount of land for soybean 23 2 mha in contrast with latin america and the caribbean 9 6 mha where soybean crops are more suited to and reach higher values of productivity resulting in a lower land demand however in terms of feed availability several regions are not able to meet their demand these import dependent regions and countries are net virtual land importers in the animal feed sector north america latin america and the caribbean and oceania are usually net exporters of virtual land while some asian and mediterranean countries are net importers fader et al 2011 qiang et al 2020 table 4 from a global point of view approximately 37 mha of land for maize diet 1 70 of countries and 12 mha of land for wheat diet 2 30 of countries are required to satisfy the demand for cereals as chicken feed 76 local land the land demand for soybean is 64 mha 40 local 3 2 3 results in terms of water requirements for feed supply wheat is on average the most water demanding crop m3 ha among the three feed ingredients analyzed however since diet 1 is the most common the highest amount of water resources used for single feed ingredient production is actually for maize 163 km3 rather than wheat 62 km3 local water volumes for cereal crops represent 75 of the total cereal water demand this water demand is concentrated in east and southeast asia both in terms of bw and gw requirements and latin america and the caribbean for the gw demand thus confirming the results obtained for the land demand a higher demand for gw in fact is usually accompanied by a larger cropland area however a high demand for blue water is related to the use of irrigation systems davis et al 2017 areas equipped for irrigation are more diffused in the near east and north africa i e egypt and iran east and southeast asia china south asia india and north america u s table 4 the soybean water demand does not show the same trend as that for cereals the cultivation of soybean crops in fact is not as widespread as cereals and is concentrated in specific countries namely the u s brazil argentina and india thus only small fractions of soybean water volumes as soybean land are actually consumed locally 46 table 4 the remaining non local volumes 54 of the total are associated with the international soybean trade and are thus virtual water flows that may vary on the assumption that only one of the diets is applied in each country it is estimated that chicken feed production requires 224 km3 of water for cereals 197 km3 and 27 km3 of gw and bw respectively and 269 km3 for soybean 244 km3 and 25 km3 globally table 4 similarly to the land requirement results the water volumes needed to cultivate the three crops for the two diets are often not consumed domestically but in the country where the feed is imported from 4 discussion 4 1 virtual land and water trade effects international trade in raw materials seems to be a winning solution in those countries where the domestic demand for feed is not met due to water and or land scarcity in this context thanks to these global virtual flows in fact china is currently the largest producer of monogastric meat despite being able to produce less than 10 of the soybean demand domestically required by this sector countries such as indonesia iran and myanmar are also among the top ten poultry producers even though they depend on feed imports not only of soybean but also of cereals the international trade in raw materials can also reduce the pressure on natural resources this may involve land and water savings if crops cereals or oilseeds are traded from a country with more efficient land uses or relatively high water productivity to a country with less efficient land uses or low water productivity d odorico et al 2014 qiang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 again china appears to be the most significant example saving nearly 3 mha of land and about 2 8 km3 and 6 7 km3 of bw and gw respectively by importing soybean instead of increasing its local production table 4 however at the same time pressure on the environment has grown dramatically in different forms wiedmann 2016 global issues such as land use change biodiversity loss food insecurity water scarcity and deforestation are often caused by international trade through this in fact distant consumers and natural resources find themselves interconnected within the global human and natural telecoupled system rulli et al 2019 our analysis fits this context by showing how in the white meat production sector the largest virtual flows of resources associated with feed imports are those related to soybean exports from brazil and the u s to china the extent and the actors in this flow have changed rapidly in recent years from soybean imports by china which until the end of the last century came almost entirely from the u s to 2012 when imports from brazil exceeded that from the u s to 2018 when china increased soybean imports in order to import 70 of brazilian soybeans and 18 from the u s faostat 2018 the increased imports of brazilian soybean have had significant impacts on deforestation of the amazon forest with the expansion of soybean being one of the largest drivers da silva et al 2017 fearnside and figueiredo 2015 gollnow et al 2018 masuda and goldsmith 2012 torres et al 2017 zu ermgassen et al 2020 furthermore despite its water abundance in recent decades brazil has stated to have problems with water scarcity as a result of agricultural displacement combined with climate effects brito 2018 lathuillière et al 2018 willaarts et al 2011 another important issue arising from the international trade is the dependance of countries which threatens the resilience of the food system arsenault 2015 fader et al 2013 gil 2020 seekell et al 2017 more and more countries are dependent on global food trade which creates vulnerability largely due to population growth and changes in food habits this food trade dependence will continue to exacerbate the exposure of importing countries to international market shocks fao 2009 seekell et al 2017 xu 2019 macdonald 2013 4 2 alternative diets in africa and asia most countries in sub saharan africa and south east asia cannot sustain the demand for maize or wheat based chicken diets even with imports or mixing grains table 4 fig 2 this is even more true for soybean however often the chicken production in these countries is limited and backyard systems prevail over industrial ones in fact in sub saharan africa and south east asia it has been estimated that 45 or more of chickens are raised in extensive or backyard systems intensive system share 55 table s2 due to the shortage of cereals and oilseeds but also income disparities chicken and livestock diets in these regions are very different from those used in other parts of the globe in particular with respect to industrial livestock systems davis et al 2018 gilbert et al 2015 seré and steinfeld 1996 backyard systems are mainly subsistence driven animals produce meat and eggs for the owner or the local market diets in these types of systems consist mainly of swill and scavenging from 20 to 40 of dfi with locally produced feed covering the rest of the diet mottet et al 2017 seré and steinfeld 1996 the diet composition in different production systems is reported in table s1 supplementary material soybean meal stands out as the standard protein supplement for many reasons such as its amino acid pattern the lack of anti nutritional factors and its expansion as a cash crop in many regions worldwide ravindran and blair 1992 1991 however the availability of soybean meal for livestock feed in asia is low figure s3 for two main reasons firstly in most asian countries soybean is used as food more than as animal feed unlike in europe and the americas secondly soybean is much less productive in asia compared to other countries where twice as much is produced hayami and ruttan 2011 ravindran and blair 1992 faostat 2016 a wide range of alternative protein sources in asian countries were explored by ravindran and blair 1991 1992 mainly including other oilseed meals such as cottonseed groundnut and rapeseed or grain legumes ali and leeson 1995 also studied the use of snail meal for male broilers diet as a replacement for soybean meal with similar body weight weight gain and feed grain to those seen in chickens fed with maize soybean meal diet most african countries also show a deficit in local production and imports for both energy cereals and protein oilseeds sources fig 2 this can be partially explained by the recent increase in the cost of maize due to competition with the human food industry biofuel production and droughts in some parts of africa morgan and choct 2016 such increases in the cost of conventional raw materials have led to the interest in alternative feed resources that can replace a proportion of these products in poultry diets at a lower cost of production cassava is the highest supplier of carbohydrates energy source among staple crops and could potentially replace maize as an energy source in poultry diets morgan and choct 2016 onabolu et al 2001 to integrate the poultry diet in these countries and to give chickens the protein supplement needed cassava leaves seeds or cakes which are richer in protein are included in the diet alternatively synthetic amino acids can be used as supplements morgan and choct 2016 or a large amount of peel can also be used in the poultry diet diarra 2018 insects are another sustainable option as poultry ingredient and are already part of the diet of some animals biasato et al 2017 d odorico et al 2018 pinotti et al 2019 insects have great potential for various reasons i they are rich in proteins fat and in turn energy vitamins and minerals ii they have also shown a satisfactory feed conversion efficiency compared to livestock iii they have low space requirements iv the natural diet of poultry and fish is already partly represented by insects v they are mostly omnivorous and can grow on different substrates pinotti et al 2019 this potential is also indicated by the fact that industrial insect production is increasing worldwide for instance the yearly production of insects in the eu is about 6 000 tons corresponding to an average of 2 000 3 000 tons of insect derived processed animal proteins gasco et al 2020 insects are expected to be increasingly used in europe and around the globe as a replacement for conventional animal derived proteins for aquaculture and terrestrial livestock insect protein production for both human food and animal feed in 2025 is expected to be more than 1 2 mt reaching about 10 of the eu share of total protein supply gasco et al 2020 at a world level the 24 4 growth in the quantity produced per year over the next decade is predicted for both food and feed markets with a global production that will reach more than 730 000 tons in 2030 wood 2019 4 3 competition between animal feed and primary food for human consumption approximately 50 of the world s agricultural area and 40 of total arable land are used for livestock feed production and grazing karlsson and röös 2019 mottet et al 2017 in the current food system the production of animal feed already competes with human food production with negative implications for the total food supply di paola et al 2017 poultry production requires the most land for cereal production estimated in this analysis as 27 mha needed by the top ten poultry producers and approximately 49 mha globally including only maize and wheat crops one third of the global production of cereal grains 963 million tons year ends up in livestock feed fao 2013 136 million tons required by the top ten poultry producers and 215 million tons globally including only maize and wheat cereal crops our estimated results showed a lower land demand for cereals 49 mha than 93 mha estimated by mottet et al 2017 there are two possible reasons for this underestimation i mottet et al 2017 considered a chicken diet consisting of maize barley millet rice sorghum and other cereal crops in addition they considered a more significant use of wheat as feed than those considered in our global analysis see diets table 1 table 2 table s1 all these cereals have a lower agricultural yield compared to maize thus resulting in a higher cropland area ii cereal crop yields used by mottet et al 2017 from gaez v3 0 iiasa and fao 2012 relate to the year 2000 were compared with the 2016 yields from faostat fao 2016 used in our global analysis all cereals showed much higher yields on average in 2016 than in 2000 an increase in yield of over 100 in myanmar indonesia iran and russia for maize and the same in china india iran and russia for wheat considering only the top ten chicken producers the year 2016 yields therefore translated in a lower total amount of land for cereals than estimated using the gaez v3 0 yields the results by gerber et al 2007 on the amount of cereals expressed in unit of weight tons used as chicken feed are more similar to our estimation they estimated that 28 190 million tons of cereals used in the livestock sector 666 million tons were consumed as chicken feed in 2004 similar to our estimate of 22 215 million tons for chicken over 963 million tons for livestock sector globally on the other hand considering the land required to produce oilseed crops for poultry we estimated approximately 64 mha when land is allocated to the production of different co products of the crops oil and cakes this is very similar to the amount estimated by mottet et al 2017 of 60 mha soybean yield in fact did not increase as much as that of cereals between 2000 and 2016 in addition fao and gaez showed more similar yields for this crop in our context 90 of soybean meal is used as feed for livestock 236 million tons in 2016 soyatech 2003 and the poultry segment covers 54 of this sector 125 million tons monogastric animals including both chicken and pigs can only digest simple carbohydrates and therefore they consume higher amounts of grains and agricultural co and by products and lower amounts of roughage compared to ruminants thus exacerbating the feed food competition mottet et al 2017 considering industrial poultry production given that cereal grains and oilseeds comprise more than 90 of the chickens diet broilers and layers and apart from a small proportion of by products are human edible industrial systems affect the feed food competition more than backyard systems this competition is likely to worsen the situation in several countries that already suffer from a highly undernourished population rate pou 5 especially in africa and south east asia 4 4 water effect the low contribution of bw to the crop water use showed in our results can be ascribed to the low irrigation area reported in the cropland maps used in the model mirca2000 in fact china the u s india and iran where irrigation was already widespread in the early 2000s have a relatively higher contribution of bw portmann et al 2010 compared to 2000 in several countries today the number of irrigated and rainfed harvested hectares is quite different meier et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge crop specific spatially distributed maps are still not available the irrigated area used in our model was compared with data updated to 2012 from the central intelligence agency cia 2012 to confirm the increase in the extent of this area nearly all countries have increased their irrigated area china by 37 the u s by 32 and brazil by 99 the greatest increase occurred for maize thenkabail et al 2017 soybean however still remains mostly rainfed all over the world due to the suitable climate in the areas where it is cultivated and also thanks to its high adaptability willaarts et al 2011 conclusions poultry production is the largest in the livestock sector and will continue to be according to projections chickens are also the most efficient livestock in converting feed i e natural resources into edible products however when the individual elements of the diets are considered chicken feed for industrial production 83 of poultry is in direct competition with food production due to its lower inclusion of roughage our results show that in 2016 the global feed for poultry production covered approximately 16 5 and 37 of maize wheat and soybean global production respectively these global cereals and soybean production shares require globally at least 49 mha and 64 mha of cropland area and 223 km3 and 267 km3 of water gw plus bw respectively specifically in countries covering 60 of global poultry production 24 mha of cereals and 22 mha of oilseeds are used and or traded which required 110 km3 and 117 km3 of water respectively furthermore our analysis shows how much most countries depend on trade in terms of chicken meat production due to the lack of local feed crop production soybean in particular this leads to an inevitable degree of production uncertainty and vulnerability which is bound to increase with the projected growth in population and demand for food compromising the resilience of the sector both in terms of future food availability and increasing pressure on the environment however international feed trade flows could contribute to global land or water savings if trade is directed from a relatively more efficient to a less efficient country in crop production qiang et al 2013 feed researchers and producers are thus investigating innovative and sustainable protein and energy supplies

286,multiphase mass and heat transfer are ubiquitous in the subsurface within manifold applications the presence of fractures over several scales and complex geometry magnifies the uncertainty of the heat transfer phenomena which will significantly impact or even dominate the dynamic transport process capturing the details of fluid and heat transport within the fractured system is beneficial to the subsurface operations however accurate modeling methodologies for thermal high enthalpy multiphase flow within fractured reservoirs are quite limited in this work multiphase flow in fractured geothermal reservoirs is numerically investigated a discrete fracture model is utilized to describe the fractured system to characterize the thermal transport process accurately and efficiently the resolution of discretization is necessarily optimized a synthetic fracture model is firstly selected to run on different levels of discretization with different initial thermodynamic conditions a comprehensive analysis is conducted to compare the convergence and computational efficiency of simulations the numerical scheme is implemented within the delft advanced research terra simulator darts which can provide fast and robust simulation to energy applications in the subsurface based on the converged numerical solutions a thermal péclet number is defined to characterize the interplay between thermal convection and conduction which are the two governing mechanisms in geothermal development different heat transfer stages are recognized on the péclet curve in conjunction with production regimes of the synthetic fractured reservoir a fracture network sketched and scaled up from a digital map of a realistic outcrop is then utilized to perform a sensitivity analysis of the key parameters influencing the heat and mass transfer thermal propagation and péclet number are found to be sensitive to flow rate and thermal parameters e g rock heat conductivity and heat capacity

the reservoir condition the geysers field geysers 2019 an epitome of high enthalpy geothermal systems is the worlds largest exploited geothermal complex producing hot steam from more than 350 wells to generate electricity in 22 power plants the development of geothermal systems can be assisted by the inherent or induced fracture networks especially for reservoirs with a low permeable matrix wang et al 2019c due to their high conductivity open fractures behave as preferential flow channels for the injected cold water most high enthalpy geothermal systems either contain naturally developed fractures or require induced fractures for fluid flow to accurately simulate mass and heat transport in fractured geothermal systems a suitable fracture model is critical to capture the reservoir response two approaches are commonly used in the representation of fractured reservoir systems berre et al 2019 one is based on the continuum model of which the typical examples are the dual porosity model proposed by warren and root 1963 and the dual permeability model presented by gerke and van genuchten 1993a b the continuum model is an efficient simplification of the fracture system but is not accurate enough when dealing with discontinuous fractures and large scale fractures dominating fluid flow jiang and younis 2015 another approach is the discrete fracture model dfm where the fracture networks are explicitly characterized by individual control volumes karimi fard et al 2004 proposed the dfm method which is suitable for general purpose reservoir simulators this approach captures the pressure response generated by flow in fractured networks in a robust and accurate manner flemisch et al 2018 berre et al 2021 glser et al 2017 nissen et al 2018 however it is computationally more expensive due to the introduction of additional degrees of freedom in the computational domain another approach proposed by lee et al 2000 entails an effective representation of fractures in a computational domain and called embedded discrete fracture model edfm this approach has been greatly extended recently using multiscale techniques by hajibeygi et al 2011 and helps to control the computational performance and accuracy however the edfm may not be as accurate as the dfm in some practical situations li and voskov 2021 while operating a high enthalpy geothermal reservoir with cold water re injection complicated phase behavior water vaporization and steam condensation will take place at the thermal front pruess et al 1987 the multiphase flow and transport with complex phase changes that appear in high enthalpy geothermal systems introduce significant challenges for numerical simulations coats 1980 several advanced techniques were proposed recently to overcome these challenges wong et al 2018 wang et al 2019b in geothermal simulations the mass and energy formulations are often tightly coupled because of the fluid thermodynamic properties coats et al 1974 chen et al 2019 the fully coupled fully implicit approach is generally adopted to solve the system of equations in a robust way during a numerical simulation the governing equations need to be discretized in both space and time to get approximate solutions usually the formulation in discretized form is nonlinear and should be linearized to facilitate solving iteratively a newton raphson based process is generally adopted to linearize the discretized formulation which requires the values of fluid properties and their derivatives when complex physics e g multiphase compositional flow with complex chemical reactions is required in a model a multiphase flash calculation is often necessary for the evaluation of accurate fluid rock properties during each newton iteration in the molar formulation collins et al 1992 voskov and tchelepi 2012 therefore the linearization of nonlinear equations becomes a complex problem that can take up a large portion of the overall simulation time voskov 2017 proposed the operator based linearization obl approach to simplify this procedure and accelerate the linearization process like discretization in space and time the main idea of obl is to discretize the physics within the space of nonlinear unknowns the obl approach has been utilized in the recently introduced delft advanced research terra simulator darts 2019 the darts framework for geothermal modeling khait and voskov 2018b wang et al 2019a 2020b has been validated against the state of the art numerical simulators tough2 pruess et al 1999 and ad gprs garipov et al 2018 which have been widely used in geothermal energy and verified against experimental and pilot test results moreover all correlations used in our code are based on the robust industrial equation of state kretzschmar and wagner 2019 and experimental work saeid et al 2014 in this study we present a computational framework to numerically simulate multiphase mass and heat transport within fractured high enthalpy geothermal systems the dfm model is used to characterize the reservoir all simulations are run in darts with the obl approach to linearize the physics in the following description we first introduce the adopted nonlinear formulation and the basics of the obl approach then a comprehensive study on grid optimization and heat transfer dynamics is conducted within a synthetic fracture model next a realistic model based on practical outcrop measurements is utilized to perform numerical experiments with different parameters and different scenarios are discussed 2 methodology mass and heat transfer in a fractured reservoir involves a thermal multiphase flow system which requires a set of equations to depict the flow dynamics in this section we introduce the governing equations and detailed spatial and temporal discretization and linearization procedures further details related to the darts implementation can be found in khait 2019 2 1 governing equations for the investigated domain with volume ω bounded by surface γ the mass and energy conservation can be expressed in a uniformly integral way as 1 t ω m k d ω γ f k n d γ ω q k d ω here m k denotes the accumulation term for the k th component k 1 2 n indexing for the mass components e g water co 2 and k n 1 for the energy quantity f k refers to the flux term of the k th component n refers to the unit normal pointing outward to the domain boundary q k denotes the source sink term of the k th component the mass accumulation term collects each component distribution over n p fluid phases in a summation form 2 m k ϕ p 1 n p x p k ρ p s p k 1 n c where ϕ is porosity s p is phase saturation and ρ p is phase density kg m 3 and x p k is molar fraction of k component in p phase the energy accumulation term contains the internal energy of fluid and rock 3 m n c 1 ϕ p 1 n p s p u p 1 ϕ u r where u p is fluid phase internal energy per unit volume kj m 3 and u r is rock internal energy per unit volume kj m 3 we assume that the rock is compressible and represented by the change of porosity through 4 ϕ ϕ 0 1 c r p p ref where ϕ 0 is the initial porosity c r is the rock compressibility 1 bars and p ref is the reference pressure bars the mass flux of each component is represented by the summation over n p fluid phases 5 f k p 1 n p x p k ρ p u p k 1 n c here the velocity follows the extension of darcy s law

transmissibility evaluation the capability of discretizing complex fractured reservoirs in darts has been extended with the dfm karimi fard et al 2004 this model represents the fracture geometry in the grid domain explicitly as a lower dimensional feature specifically a 3d model contains 2d fractures planes while a 2d model contains 1d fractures lines this is depicted in fig 1 for a 2d example to calculate transmissibilities each fracture is assigned a specific aperture therefore it will have a certain volume in the computational domain the transmissibility between neighboring grid blocks is expressed as 9 t 12 α 1 α 2 α 1 α 2 with α i a i k i d i n i f i where a i is the contact area between two neighboring blocks k i is the permeability of grid block i d i is the distance between the centroid of the interface and the centroid of the grid block i n i is the unit normal of the interface pointing inside block i f i is the unit vector along the direction of the line joining the grid block i to the centroid of the interface this equation holds true for matrix matrix fracture matrix and fracture fracture connections when more than two fractures intersect in the same point 2d or line 3d a star delta transformation is used to calculate the transmissibility between each of the intersecting fractures see karimi fard et al 2004 for more details fracture networks usually contain complex fracture intersections that result in difficult meshing requirements the generated mesh therefore often contains artifacts that negatively impact the performance of the reservoir simulation i e convergence problems and numerical inaccuracies due to non uniformity of the control volumes and large angles between f i and n i this is solved by using a pre processing step in which we sequentially discretize each fracture using the desired discretization scale predefined size of the segment for fracture pre processing we adapted a procedure suggested by karimi fard and durlofsky 2016 during the sequential procedure we check at every iteration if the newly placed discretized fracture segment conflicts with any previously added segment a conflict is defined here as two fracture nodes end points of each discretized fracture segment that fall within a certain radius half the discretization accuracy of each other the conflicting fracture nodes will be merged and represented by one node this pre processing step is computationally insignificant with respect to the main fluid flow simulation time while still greatly improving the simulation results accuracy and computational time this method also allows for a fast and reliable way of creating the discretized fracture network at any desired resolution while maintaining the main characteristics of the original fracture characterization 2 3 operator based linearization obl the molar formulation faust and mercer 1979 wong et al 2015 is taken as the system nonlinear formulation where pressure and enthalpy are chosen as the primary variables the newton raphson method is usually adopted to linearize the nonlinear equations in conventional reservoir simulation the resulting linear system of equations on each nonlinear iteration can be expressed in the following form 10 j ω k ω k 1 ω k r ω k where j ω k is the jacobian matrix defined at the k th nonlinear iteration ω k and ω k 1 represent the physical state or nonlinear unknowns at the k th and k 1 th iteration the conventional linearization approach involves the jacobian assembly with an accurate evaluation of property values and their derivatives to the nonlinear unknowns the properties and their derivatives are usually directly based on either piece wise approximations e g some fluid properties or solutions of nonlinear system e g multiphase flash with partial derivatives reconstructed using the chain rule and inverse theorem voskov and tchelepi 2012 due to the complex combination of these properties in the governing equations the nonlinear solver has to perform extra iterations to capture small variations in solution because of the mixed property representation here the obl approach is utilized to improve the nonlinear behavior for the obl approach the physical properties in mass and energy governing equations are agglomerated into state dependent operators voskov 2017 khait and voskov 2018b pressure and enthalpy are taken as the unified state variables for a given control volume flux related fluid properties are defined by the physical state of the upstream block determined at interface l the discretized mass conservation equation in operator form reads as 11 ϕ 0 v α ω α ω n l δ t γ l φ p i j β ω 0 where ω is the physical state of block i at the current timestep and γ l is the fluid transmissibility state dependent operators are defined as 12 α ω 1 c r p p r e f p 1 n p ρ p s p β ω p 1 n p ρ p l k r p l μ p l the discretized energy conservation equation in turn can be written in operator form as 13 ϕ 0 v α e f ω

1 n p h p l ρ p l k r p l μ p l γ e f ω 1 c r p p r e f p 1 n p s p κ p γ e r ω α e r ω this agglomeration of different physical terms into a single nonlinear operator simplifies the implementation of nonlinear solution framework instead of performing complex evaluations of each property and its derivatives to nonlinear unknowns one can parameterize operators in physical space in the supporting points of mesh introduced in the physical space the evaluation of operators during the simulation is based on multi linear interpolation which simplifies the linearization stage besides due to the unified piece wise representation of operators the nonlinearity of the system is reduced which improves the nonlinear behavior khait and voskov 2018a 2018b 3 optimal spatial discretization in general high resolution grids are necessary to capture details of fast convective flow in high permeable regions such as fractures hui et al 2018 while thermal conductive flow may require a lower level of grid discretization additionally the computational efficiency depends on the number of degrees of freedom of the model faigle et al 2015 correlating directly with the grid resolution the first step in our study is to propose an optimal spatial discretization with enough accuracy and efficiency for modeling geothermal applications in naturally fractured reservoirs this section describes the parameters of the selected fracture network explains the model construction with predefined resolutions shows the results of the numerical convergence study and proposes the optimal grid resolution 3 1 models description a synthetic fracture configuration is selected to perform an analysis on grid discretization and heat transfer mechanisms a doublet for injection and production is placed in the model see fig 2 for details for simplicity of the analysis we assume that the matrix is isotropic and homogeneous with a permeability of 0 001 md the aperture of the fracture is 3 e 4 m and the cubic law berkowitz 2002 is used to describe the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture the fracture permeability with an aperture b is expressed as k f b 2 12 two different initial conditions are selected one is with vapor and liquid coexistence from the start of the simulation the initial pressure is 100 bars the initial enthalpy is 1 500 kj kg which corresponds to the initial temperature of 588 k at these conditions the initial steam saturation is 0 47 the injection well condition is set with flow rate control of 350 m 3 day the production well condition is set with bottom hole pressure bhp control of 80 bars this reference conditions correspond to the typical case from a hot spot area e g the geysers geysers 2019 another type of conditions corresponds to an ultra deep geothermal reservoir filled with critical water the initial pressure is 450 bars the initial enthalpy is 660 kj kg which corresponds to the temperature of 423 k the injection well condition is set with flow rate control of 300 m 3 day the production well condition is set with bottom hole pressure bhp control of 400 bars 3 2 spatial discretization at different resolutions an optimal grid resolution is essential for both accurately presenting the fracture network and improving computational performance de hoop et al 2019 2020 here four levels of discretized models increasing resolution from grid 1 to 4 as shown in fig 3 are selected to characterize the fracture network table 1 lists the detailed grid numbers of different grid sets the sensitivity of simulation results to the grid resolution will be identified with different models to capture the fast convective flow in the fracture the number of grid cells utilized to discretize the fractures has to stay dense across different levels of resolutions comparing the numerical solutions of different discretization ratios will help to propose an optimal grid resolution for thermal flow in fractured reservoirs the temporal variation of production temperature in conjunction with the parameter distribution e g the temperature saturation and pressure at the selected time is utilized to quantitatively compare the results between different models the solutions for the grid with the highest resolution fig 3d are taken as the reference and compared with solutions generated from models at lower resolutions fig 3a to c 3 3 resolution study direct comparison of production temperature gives evidence to the accuracy of different levels of discretization fig 4 displays the temperature profile of the production well for the two test cases two phase and critical water conditions under different grid resolutions with the grid refinement the temperature curve approaches the reference solution gradually grid 3 solid green line can closely capture the referenced temperature drop for both cases the temperature decline fig 4 can be simply divided into two consecutive parts along with time the short rapid drop at the early period i e 7 000 days fig 4a and the following elongated mild drop figs 5 to 7 display the distribution of the temperature pressure and water saturation at certain selected simulation time for the two phase system the temperature map for coarser resolutions e g fig 5a show more dispersed cold water distribution than the finer ones e g fig 5c which results from the assumption of instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium within one control volume for coarser resolutions the averaged size of computational control volumes is larger than that under finer resolutions for the same amount of matrix volume surrounded by several fractures the energy depletion under a coarser grid representation will be faster than its counterpart under finer resolutions a coarse grid block represented by several control volumes under finer resolution will deplete integrally when the temperature gradient exists which enables faster energy depletion the same amount of energy depletion under finer resolutions will however experience several transitional steps between control volumes whereby the energy depletion will slow down and conform to the referenced process following a similar logic the multiple interacting continua minc model pruess and narasimhan 1985 wu and pruess 1988 has been proposed for approximately modeling mass and heat transport in fractured systems overall the spreading of the cold water plume for different resolutions is similar and converges with refinement the grid set 3 fig 5c can already accurately represent the solution of temperature in the computational domain since the initially distributed two phase high enthalpy geothermal system is the focus of this study the solutions of pressure and saturation also need to be checked while comparing different grid sets it is obvious from figs 6 and 7 that the pressure and saturation distributions present higher sensitivity to grid resolutions than the temperature at the thermal front the pore pressure will decrease subject to the steam condensation triggered by the energy depletion wong et al 2018 which is a highly nonlinear process and can impact the solution of pressure in the entire domain in comparison with the referenced pressure distribution fig 6d the pressure gradient buildup looks slower for models with coarser discretization fig 6a and b this can be explained by the larger averaged volume of computational grids as for the temperature difference mentioned above saturation as a function of enthalpy and pressure is also sensitive to the grid resolution fig 7 restricted by the solution of pressure the propagation of water saturation with coarser resolutions fig 7a and b cannot precisely capture the phase distribution under the reference resolution as it is observed in figs 6c and 7c the distributions of pressure and saturation for grid 3 closely match with the finest resolution of grid 4 3 4 computational performance and accuracy the computation time of each run is measured during the simulation as an indicator for numerical performance fig 8 a displays the simulation time of both two phase and critical water systems under various grid resolutions the performance is scalable with the grid resolution as an almost linear relationship is observed between the logarithm of cpu time and control volumes numbers in the serial runs grid 3 can run about 10 times faster than grid 4 the finest resolution with reasonable accuracy as shown in fig 8b it is worth noticing that the accuracy of solution depends on fractured network modification and the accuracy of nonlinear physics representation as can be seen in fig 8b as well here the more linear critical water model converged to the reference solution faster than the two phase model considering the fact that solutions at coarser resolutions grid 1 and 2 are not accurate the resolution of grid 3 is proposed for farther analysis besides because of the heavier numerical nonlinearity associated with the two phase system more nonlinear iterations are needed than for the one with critical water and therefore computation is more time consuming for the two phase system table 2 shows the nonlinear iterations needed for both cases the number inside the bracket represents the number of wasted nonlinear iterations 4 heat and mass transfer thermal convection and conduction are the two main mechanisms governing heat transfer in the subsurface a thermal péclet number pe is defined to quantify the interplay between thermal convection and conduction whereby the heat transfer dynamics is studied and discussed the optimal grid discretization grid 3 of the synthetic fractured reservoir is utilized in the following analysis 4 1 thermal péclet number for mass transfer the péclet number characterizes the interplay between the convective and diffusive flow as the energy analog of mass transport the thermal péclet number quantifies the relative strength of convection and conduction during heat transport the dimensionless thermal péclet number is defined as follows 15 pe p 1 n p t h p ρ p q p d t i 1 n f t ω fi d i v κ t d ω d t where q p refers to the flow rate of a specific phase p w s for water and steam phase at the production well ω fi denotes the control volumes representing the i th fracture this interpretation is only suitable for fractured systems with low permeable matrix as of this study where the thermal convective flow can be considered as dominating in the fracture network while the fracture matrix heat exchange is through thermal conduction the dimensionless time is defined as follows 16 t d t q i d t i 1 n ϕ i v i where q i refers to the flow rate at the injection well ϕ i denotes the porosity of grid block i v i denotes the volume of grid block i n denotes the number of grid blocks 4 2 heat transfer regimes fig 9 a displays the temporal evolution of the péclet number four stages are detected on the péclet curve representing different heat and mass transfer dynamics correspondingly the dynamic simulation statistics for different stages are recognized in fig 9b overall the péclet number increases as simulation proceeds which demonstrates the relative strength of thermal convection grows during the simulation 4 2 1 stable two phase flow a constant thermal péclet number stage ① is observed fig 9a for the first 100 days which indicates a stable interplay between convection and conduction since the energy production rate is almost constant during this period fig 9b the thermal conductive flow stays stable as well fig 10 image 1 displays the temperature map of the model at 100 days only a small region of the matrix near the injection well shows a minor temperature change as enthalpy and temperature are independent in the two phase state the matrix temperature stays unchanged while the enthalpy drops until the two phases transit to a single phase the phase transition fig 11 image 1 is a faster process than the temperature propagation since phase transition is more sensitive to pressure variations in this period stabilized two phase flow occurs in the fractures which can be deduced from the stable water and steam flow rates observed at the production well the injected cold water heated up by the hot rock vaporizes in the fractures because of the existence of highly compressible steam the pressure buildup within the fracture network does not take place instantaneously which is quite different for the quasi incompressible fluid system correspondingly the needed injection pressure to sustain the operation scheme is stable fig 9b 4 2 2 transient two phase flow as the simulation proceeds the péclet number increases quickly stage ② which mainly results from the condensed water breakthrough in fractures as it is shown in fig 9b the energy and water rates increase drastically during this period due to heat exploitation the produced energy cannot support water vaporization under the fixed production pressure therefore the steam rate decreases to zero and the energy production curve reaches the maximum energy rate fig 9b the water production rate increases owing to the pressure buildup in the fractured system which can also be observed in fig 9b the cold water plume penetrates deeper towards the producer fig 10 image 2 a larger volume near the injection well depletes by thermal conduction the production temperature fig 4d remains unchanged at the end of this period 2 000 days which indicates the thermal front has not reached the production well yet however the fractures are fully saturated with condensed water fig 9b the saturation profile fig 11 image 2 shows the phase transition of the matrix cells along the fracture cells between injection and production wells at 2 000 days 4 2 3 transient single phase flow from 2 000 to 10 000 days the increment of the péclet number becomes mild stage ③ the heat transferred by both the thermal convection and conduction decreases as the time proceeds the energy contained in unit volume of fluid drastically decreases since the energy rate reduces sharply with just a mild decrease in water flow rate fig 9b the heat transferred by thermal conduction is expected to reduce more than by convection as the péclet number keeps increasing during this period from fig 10 image 3 the temperature of the matrix surrounding the fractures decreases a lot at 10 000 days since thermal conduction is proportional to the temperature gradient and inversely proportional to grid distance the thermal recharge of the fluids in the fractures by the matrix weakens along time this can also be verified from the production temperature curve fig 4a the temperature decline in this period is sharp and steep due to the fast temperature drop in the matrix adjacent to the fractures as the average temperature of the fracture fluid drops the fluid density and viscosity increase correspondingly which leads to higher flow resistance within the fractures the pressure needed to maintain the constant injection rate keeps increasing fig 9b another interesting observation is the phase transition in the regions without direct contact with cold water owing to the pressure elevation within the model the steam phase in the matrix condensates to water phase fig 11 image 3 4 2 4 stable single phase flow after 10 000 days the péclet number rapidly increases stage ④ as is shown in fig 10 image 4 the matrix energy has widely depleted at 30 000 days the thermal convective flow becomes dominant as the conduction turns less influential in heat transfer due to energy extraction the water production stabilizes in this period with only a minor decrease in the energy production rate in parallel the increase of injection pressure slows down simply because the temperature change of the fluids slows down after 10 000 days fig 4a 5 realistic fractured network 5 1 background the fracture network used in this section is taken from an outcrop of the whitby mudstone formation boersma et al 2015 the horizontal network was first captured from birds eye view imagery of the pavement with an extent of about 15m at sub cm resolution the imagery was interpreted in the aspect of fracture orientation length and density individual fractures were manually traced from and assembled on the constructed digital map 2 148 fracture segments were recognized from the images the fracture network is scaled up to the size of 1200 m 1600 m 50 m for simulations the geometry of the fracture network is depicted in fig 12 a 5 2 grid discretization a reasonable grid resolution is essential for both accurately presenting the fracture network and enhancing the computational performance here a grid discretization fig 12b with characteristic length of 7 5 m the same as fig 3c is selected to characterize the fracture network compared to wang et al 2020a the mesh quality is improved by the optimized treatment at the model boundary in addition a benchmark study against state of the art research simulators has been conducted in wang et al 2020b 5 3 numerical experiments and discussions in this section we compare the heat transfer dynamics inside the model with different parameter settings fracture matrix permeability ratio flow rate rock heat conductivity and heat capacity the parameter settings of the base case are listed in table 3 5 3 1 fracture matrix permeability ratio permeability is one of the key factors strongly influencing thermal flow and transport depending on the geological formation the matrix permeability can vary from high porous sandstone to low almost impermeable basalt the permeability contrast between fracture and matrix reflects their relative ability for fluid flow to percolate it is important to analyze the cold front propagation under different realistic permeability ratios ijeje et al 2019 a set of fracture matrix permeability ratios is chosen and examined to observe the thermal response for different scenarios the variation of permeability contrast is achieved by adjusting the matrix permeability while the fracture aperture for simplicity of interpretation is fixed here we choose typical matrix permeability for different types of rocks sandstone 100 md carbonate 1 md and basalt 0 001 md where the fracture matrix permeability ratio will be 7 5 e 4 7 5 e 6 and 7 5 e 9 fig 13 displays the temperature distribution for different permeability ratios where large differences of the cold front propagation can be observed for the lowest permeability contrast fig 13a the cold front propagates surrounding the injection well since the matrix permeability is higher in this case the preferential heat transport along fractures is not prominent with the increase in permeability ratio the fluid flow predominantly occurs within the fractures instead of through the matrix therefore the cold front spreads following the branches of the fractures towards the production well fig 14 shows the impact of fracture matrix permeability ratio on the production temperature with a large permeability ratio the injected water is pushed to flow through the fractures and the heat exchanges between fracture and matrix mainly through thermal conduction therefore the amount of depleted energy is lower in fracture dominated flow and the temperature declines faster than for lower permeability ratios in addition due to the diversion effect of the high permeable matrix fluid flow in the fractures is reduced which facilitates heating the fluids within the fractures consequently the shape of the temperature curve with the lowest permeability ratio blue line in fig 14 becomes largely different from the rest 5 3 2 flow rate the flow rate directly associates with mass and heat transport for real field applications the flow rate is a key focus that will determine the thermal breakthrough time wang et al 2019a therefore it is crucial to determine how the heat transfer dynamics change with the flow rate in fractured porous media five different injection flow rates are utilized to investigate their influence on thermal propagation fig 15 displays the temperature distribution at different flow rates larger volumes deplete with the increase of flow rate fig 16 a shows the production temperature for different flow rates the temperature drops earlier and faster with the elevated flow rates resulting from the more powerful convective flow in the fractures the cumulative energy production is displayed in fig 16b here 500 k is selected as the checking point to compare the cumulative energy production with different flow rates the amount of cumulative energy slightly increases with the reduction in flow rate which is different from similar observations in fluvial systems wang et al the highly preferential convective flow in fractures makes the fracture matrix heat exchange less efficient under higher flow rates besides no extra flow paths get involved in heat production with the increase of flow rate as indicated in fig 15 fig 16 c shows the thermal péclet number for different flow rates the péclet number is constant at the early stable two phase flow regime where the thermal conduction is stronger than the convection under any flow rate as the dimensionless time proceeds the relative strength of convection exceeds that of conduction gradually the péclet curves overlap with each other which means with the same amount of water injected the relative contributions of convection and conduction to heat production are the same under different flow rates 5 3 3 rock heat conduction conduction plays a vital role in heat extraction during geothermal development especially in the case of low permeable rocks conductive heat flow happens when the temperature gradient builds up between control volumes the strength of thermal conduction is proportional to the magnitude of temperature gradient and heat conductivity in this section various rock heat conductivity values are selected within a realistic range to study the sensitivity of thermal propagation to heat conductivity in fractured reservoirs fig 17 shows the temperature distribution with different heat conductivity with the same amount of water injected the cold front propagation is more confined with larger heat conductivity fig 17e since stronger conductive heat exchange happens under larger conductivity values the reservoir energy close to the injection well largely depletes when conductivity decreases it will need more contact with the matrix to heat the fracture fluids and therefore the temperature front spreads deeper towards the production well correspondingly the region near the injection well weakly depletes e g fig 17a the influence of rock conductivity to thermal propagation is clearly nonlinear since the variations shrink as the conductivity increases the production temperature for different heat conductivity is shown in fig 18 a consistent with the temperature distribution an earlier temperature drop is observed at the production well with lower heat conductivity the temperature decline converges as conductivity increases as is shown for κ 200 300 400 kj m day k which demonstrates the conduction effect approaches its upper bound further increase of conductivity is unable to heat the fluids even more because either the fluid has already been heated up or the rock has been cooled down overall the variation of production temperature with conductivity is not as significant as with permeability ratio or flow rate the péclet curves are similar under different heat conductivity fig 18b as a multiplier in conduction calculation smaller heat conductivity will limit the conductive rate however the broader spreading of the cold front along fractures with low conductivity enlarges the contact area for heat conduction consequently quite similar péclet profiles are observed for different cases 5 3 4 rock heat capacity volumetric heat capacity proportionally correlates with the amount of energy contained in the rock larger heat capacity simply means a larger amount of energy is contained in the reservoir here five values of rock heat capacity within a realistic range are selected to investigate its influence on heat production as shown in fig 19 the thermal propagation is largely different from the variation in rock heat capacity reflecting the different capabilities of reservoir rock resisting energy depletion with the same amount of cold water injection a larger portion of the reservoir depletes with lower heat capacity e g fig 19a this is because the cold water quickly depletes its bypassed reservoir via conduction and therefore a larger reservoir volume is involved in the energy depletion process at the selected time or for certain specific simulation time fig 20 a displays the changes in production temperature with heat capacity the production temperature shows a similar two stage decline for all considered cases sharp decrease and mild drop the faster temperature drop with lower heat capacity corresponds closely with the observation in fig 19 overall the heat capacity shows a roughly linear influence on production temperature since the difference between curves keeps almost the same with the linear change of heat capacity the difference in thermal péclet numbers fig 20b becomes noticeable as the temperature starts decreasing rock with larger heat capacity will supply stronger energy to the injected cold water via thermal conduction while the convective flow can be taken as the same for different cases therefore the péclet number is smaller under larger heat capacity 6 conclusion in this paper the multiphase mass and heat transport in fractured reservoirs is numerically investigated using the delft advanced research terra simulator darts fractures are explicitly depicted with the discrete fracture model dfm and the mesh quality of the dfm discretization is improved through a pre processing procedure based on the numerically converged model a sensitivity study of heat transfer in fractured reservoirs with different numerical and physical parameters is performed to guide the uncertainty quantification and optimization processes first a simulation framework is presented to comprehensively investigate the sensitivity of simulation results to mesh resolution with a synthetic fractured model the dfm discretization is based on conformal coarsening of fine scale fractured network the numerical convergence of the solutions is achieved with mesh refinement under high enthalpy condition with the presence of both single and two phase fluids the simulation time and error statistics are summarized for different sets of mesh discretization the optimal mesh discretization is selected out of several resolutions it is highly recommended to qualify the mesh discretization when modeling geothermal transport within fractured systems using accurate fractured models which will both guarantee precise simulation results and greatly improve computational performance subsequently a thermal péclet number is defined for fractured systems with low permeable matrix four different flow stages and relative strength between thermal convection and conduction are recognized from the péclet curves our results show that geothermal development in a fractured system becomes less efficient when heat transport is mostly convection dominated as clearly indicated by the thermal péclet number analysis next a fracture model sketched from a direct image interpretation of a realistic outcrop is discretized with the optimal characteristic length and utilized for parameter sensitivity analysis almost linear impact of flow rate and rock heat capacity to production temperature is observed whereas rock heat conductivity displays a clearly nonlinear influence which is difficult to predict without the direct numerical simulation additionally the fracture matrix permeability ratio can largely alter the propagation of cold water front these notable impacts of investigated parameters on thermal propagation and heat transfer dynamics can help to better design and layout the system and estimate the project economics with further uncertainty analyses the proposed numerical methodology for finding an optimal grid resolution is of great importance for improving the computation time without compromising the accuracy therefore our approach is recommended for sensitivity studies or uncertainty quantification of geothermal energy production from fractured reservoirs in addition the coarser resolution though yielding less accurate solutions demonstrates the more efficient computational performance and can be used for effective clustering of realizations in uncertainty quantification studies see examples in de hoop et al 2019 2020 the defined péclet number provides a way to theoretically quantify the characteristics of flow and heat transport in fractured geothermal reservoirs besides utilizing a fracture network generated from real outcrop observations helps to understand the complex thermal transport in realistic fractured systems since there are not many publications on two phase thermal transport in highly resolved fractured high enthalpy geothermal system this paper fills a gap in the literature and highlights the basic influential factors for an optimal development of such resources this study is performed under the assumption of constant fracture aperture in van der kooij et al 2020 we demonstrated that the statistical variability in fracture aperture for a fixed fracture network can lead to different connectivity between injection and production wells which in turn yields different optimal production rate in addition rigorous consideration of the effect of thermoporoelastic deformation of rock on heat production stefansson et al 2020 berge et al 2020 can be essential for geothermal applications

286,multiphase mass and heat transfer are ubiquitous in the subsurface within manifold applications the presence of fractures over several scales and complex geometry magnifies the uncertainty of the

exchanger hein et al 2016 etc following the cold water injection thermal convection and conduction jointly govern the heat propagation in the geothermal reservoirs pruess 1983 1990 o sullivan et al 2010 therefore the quantitative analysis of the interplay between convection and conduction in complex geological structures e g with the presence of fractures is not only of theoretical interest but also of practical significance among the geothermal resources limberger et al 2018 high enthalpy geothermal fields are given special attention owing to their substantial energy potential aravena et al 2016 kivanc ates and serpen 2016 serpen et al 2009 simpson and bignall 2016 for a high enthalpy geothermal system either single phase vapor or a two phase mixture vapor and liquid can be present at the reservoir condition the geysers field geysers 2019 an epitome of high enthalpy geothermal systems is the worlds largest exploited geothermal complex producing hot steam from more than 350 wells to generate electricity in 22 power plants the development of geothermal systems can be assisted by the inherent or induced fracture networks especially for reservoirs with a low permeable matrix wang et al 2019c due to their high conductivity open fractures behave as preferential flow channels for the injected cold water most high enthalpy geothermal systems either contain naturally developed fractures or require induced fractures for fluid flow to accurately simulate mass and heat transport in fractured geothermal systems a suitable fracture model is critical to capture the reservoir response two approaches are commonly used in the representation of fractured reservoir systems berre et al 2019 one is based on the continuum model of which the typical examples are the dual porosity model proposed by warren and root 1963 and the dual permeability model presented by gerke and van genuchten 1993a b the continuum model is an efficient simplification of the fracture system but is not accurate enough when dealing with discontinuous fractures and large scale fractures dominating fluid flow jiang and younis 2015 another approach is the discrete fracture model dfm where the fracture networks are explicitly characterized by individual control volumes karimi fard et al 2004 proposed the dfm method which is suitable for general purpose reservoir simulators this approach captures the pressure response generated by flow in fractured networks in a robust and accurate manner flemisch et al 2018 berre et al 2021 glser et al 2017 nissen et al 2018 however it is computationally more expensive due to the introduction of additional degrees of freedom in the computational domain another approach proposed by lee et al 2000 entails an effective representation of fractures in a computational domain and called embedded discrete fracture model edfm this approach has been greatly extended recently using multiscale techniques by hajibeygi et al 2011 and helps to control the computational performance and accuracy however the edfm may not be as accurate as the dfm in some practical situations li and voskov 2021 while operating a high enthalpy geothermal reservoir with cold water re injection complicated phase behavior water vaporization and steam condensation will take place at the thermal front pruess et al 1987 the multiphase flow and transport with complex phase changes that appear in high enthalpy geothermal systems introduce significant challenges for numerical simulations coats 1980 several advanced techniques were proposed recently to overcome these challenges wong et al 2018 wang et al 2019b in geothermal simulations the mass and energy formulations are often tightly coupled because of the fluid thermodynamic properties coats et al 1974 chen et al 2019 the fully coupled fully implicit approach is generally adopted to solve the system of equations in a robust way during a numerical simulation the governing equations need to be discretized in both space and time to get approximate solutions usually the formulation in discretized form is nonlinear and should be linearized to facilitate solving iteratively a newton raphson based process is generally adopted to linearize the discretized formulation which requires the values of fluid properties and their derivatives when complex physics e g multiphase compositional flow with complex chemical reactions is required in a model a multiphase flash calculation is often necessary for the evaluation of accurate fluid rock properties during each newton iteration in the molar formulation collins et al 1992 voskov and tchelepi 2012 therefore the linearization of nonlinear equations becomes a complex problem that can take up a large portion of the overall simulation time voskov 2017 proposed the operator based linearization obl approach to simplify this procedure and accelerate the linearization process like discretization in space and time the main idea of obl is to discretize the physics within the space of nonlinear unknowns the obl approach has been utilized in the recently introduced delft advanced research terra simulator darts 2019 the darts framework for geothermal modeling khait and voskov 2018b wang et al 2019a 2020b has been validated against the state of the art numerical simulators tough2 pruess et al 1999 and ad gprs garipov et al 2018 which have been widely used in geothermal energy and verified against experimental and pilot test results moreover all correlations used in our code are based on the robust industrial equation of state kretzschmar and wagner 2019 and experimental work saeid et al 2014 in this study we present a computational framework to numerically simulate multiphase mass and heat transport within fractured high enthalpy geothermal systems the dfm model is used to characterize the reservoir all simulations are run in darts with the obl approach to linearize the physics in the following description we first introduce the adopted nonlinear formulation and the basics of the obl approach then a comprehensive study on grid optimization and heat transfer dynamics is conducted within a synthetic fracture model next a realistic model based on practical outcrop measurements is utilized to perform numerical experiments with different parameters and different scenarios are discussed 2 methodology mass and heat transfer in a fractured reservoir involves a thermal multiphase flow system which requires a set of equations to depict the flow dynamics in this section we introduce the governing equations and detailed spatial and temporal discretization and linearization procedures further details related to the darts implementation can be found in khait 2019 2 1 governing equations for the investigated domain with volume ω bounded by surface γ the mass and energy conservation can be expressed in a uniformly integral way as 1 t ω m k d ω γ f k n d γ ω q k d ω here m k denotes the accumulation term for the k th component k 1 2 n indexing for the mass components e g water co 2 and k n 1 for the energy quantity f k refers to the flux term of the k th component n refers to the unit normal pointing outward to the domain boundary q k denotes the source sink term of the k th component the mass accumulation term collects each component distribution over n p fluid phases in a summation form 2 m k ϕ p 1 n p x p k ρ p s p k 1 n c where ϕ is porosity s p is phase saturation and ρ p is phase density kg m 3 and x p k is molar fraction of k component in p phase the energy accumulation term contains the internal energy of fluid and rock 3 m n c 1 ϕ p 1 n p s p u p 1 ϕ u r where u p is fluid phase internal energy per unit volume kj m 3 and u r is rock internal energy per unit volume kj m 3 we assume that the rock is compressible and represented by the change of porosity through 4 ϕ ϕ 0 1 c r p p ref where ϕ 0 is the initial porosity c r is the rock compressibility 1 bars and p ref is the reference pressure bars the mass flux of each component is represented by the summation over n p fluid phases 5 f k p 1 n p x p k ρ p u p k 1 n c here the velocity follows the extension of darcy s law

transmissibility evaluation the capability of discretizing complex fractured reservoirs in darts has been extended with the dfm karimi fard et al 2004 this model represents the fracture geometry in the grid domain explicitly as a lower dimensional feature specifically a 3d model contains 2d fractures planes while a 2d model contains 1d fractures lines this is depicted in fig 1 for a 2d example to calculate transmissibilities each fracture is assigned a specific aperture therefore it will have a certain volume in the computational domain the transmissibility between neighboring grid blocks is expressed as 9 t 12 α 1 α 2 α 1 α 2 with α i a i k i d i n i f i where a i is the contact area between two neighboring blocks k i is the permeability of grid block i d i is the distance between the centroid of the interface and the centroid of the grid block i n i is the unit normal of the interface pointing inside block i f i is the unit vector along the direction of the line joining the grid block i to the centroid of the interface this equation holds true for matrix matrix fracture matrix and fracture fracture connections when more than two fractures intersect in the same point 2d or line 3d a star delta transformation is used to calculate the transmissibility between each of the intersecting fractures see karimi fard et al 2004 for more details fracture networks usually contain complex fracture intersections that result in difficult meshing requirements the generated mesh therefore often contains artifacts that negatively impact the performance of the reservoir simulation i e convergence problems and numerical inaccuracies due to non uniformity of the control volumes and large angles between f i and n i this is solved by using a pre processing step in which we sequentially discretize each fracture using the desired discretization scale predefined size of the segment for fracture pre processing we adapted a procedure suggested by karimi fard and durlofsky 2016 during the sequential procedure we check at every iteration if the newly placed discretized fracture segment conflicts with any previously added segment a conflict is defined here as two fracture nodes end points of each discretized fracture segment that fall within a certain radius half the discretization accuracy of each other the conflicting fracture nodes will be merged and represented by one node this pre processing step is computationally insignificant with respect to the main fluid flow simulation time while still greatly improving the simulation results accuracy and computational time this method also allows for a fast and reliable way of creating the discretized fracture network at any desired resolution while maintaining the main characteristics of the original fracture characterization 2 3 operator based linearization obl the molar formulation faust and mercer 1979 wong et al 2015 is taken as the system nonlinear formulation where pressure and enthalpy are chosen as the primary variables the newton raphson method is usually adopted to linearize the nonlinear equations in conventional reservoir simulation the resulting linear system of equations on each nonlinear iteration can be expressed in the following form 10 j ω k ω k 1 ω k r ω k where j ω k is the jacobian matrix defined at the k th nonlinear iteration ω k and ω k 1 represent the physical state or nonlinear unknowns at the k th and k 1 th iteration the conventional linearization approach involves the jacobian assembly with an accurate evaluation of property values and their derivatives to the nonlinear unknowns the properties and their derivatives are usually directly based on either piece wise approximations e g some fluid properties or solutions of nonlinear system e g multiphase flash with partial derivatives reconstructed using the chain rule and inverse theorem voskov and tchelepi 2012 due to the complex combination of these properties in the governing equations the nonlinear solver has to perform extra iterations to capture small variations in solution because of the mixed property representation here the obl approach is utilized to improve the nonlinear behavior for the obl approach the physical properties in mass and energy governing equations are agglomerated into state dependent operators voskov 2017 khait and voskov 2018b pressure and enthalpy are taken as the unified state variables for a given control volume flux related fluid properties are defined by the physical state of the upstream block determined at interface l the discretized mass conservation equation in operator form reads as 11 ϕ 0 v α ω α ω n l δ t γ l φ p i j β ω 0 where ω is the physical state of block i at the current timestep and γ l is the fluid transmissibility state dependent operators are defined as 12 α ω 1 c r p p r e f p 1 n p ρ p s p β ω p 1 n p ρ p l k r p l μ p l the discretized energy conservation equation in turn can be written in operator form as 13 ϕ 0 v α e f ω

1 n p h p l ρ p l k r p l μ p l γ e f ω 1 c r p p r e f p 1 n p s p κ p γ e r ω α e r ω this agglomeration of different physical terms into a single nonlinear operator simplifies the implementation of nonlinear solution framework instead of performing complex evaluations of each property and its derivatives to nonlinear unknowns one can parameterize operators in physical space in the supporting points of mesh introduced in the physical space the evaluation of operators during the simulation is based on multi linear interpolation which simplifies the linearization stage besides due to the unified piece wise representation of operators the nonlinearity of the system is reduced which improves the nonlinear behavior khait and voskov 2018a 2018b 3 optimal spatial discretization in general high resolution grids are necessary to capture details of fast convective flow in high permeable regions such as fractures hui et al 2018 while thermal conductive flow may require a lower level of grid discretization additionally the computational efficiency depends on the number of degrees of freedom of the model faigle et al 2015 correlating directly with the grid resolution the first step in our study is to propose an optimal spatial discretization with enough accuracy and efficiency for modeling geothermal applications in naturally fractured reservoirs this section describes the parameters of the selected fracture network explains the model construction with predefined resolutions shows the results of the numerical convergence study and proposes the optimal grid resolution 3 1 models description a synthetic fracture configuration is selected to perform an analysis on grid discretization and heat transfer mechanisms a doublet for injection and production is placed in the model see fig 2 for details for simplicity of the analysis we assume that the matrix is isotropic and homogeneous with a permeability of 0 001 md the aperture of the fracture is 3 e 4 m and the cubic law berkowitz 2002 is used to describe the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture the fracture permeability with an aperture b is expressed as k f b 2 12 two different initial conditions are selected one is with vapor and liquid coexistence from the start of the simulation the initial pressure is 100 bars the initial enthalpy is 1 500 kj kg which corresponds to the initial temperature of 588 k at these conditions the initial steam saturation is 0 47 the injection well condition is set with flow rate control of 350 m 3 day the production well condition is set with bottom hole pressure bhp control of 80 bars this reference conditions correspond to the typical case from a hot spot area e g the geysers geysers 2019 another type of conditions corresponds to an ultra deep geothermal reservoir filled with critical water the initial pressure is 450 bars the initial enthalpy is 660 kj kg which corresponds to the temperature of 423 k the injection well condition is set with flow rate control of 300 m 3 day the production well condition is set with bottom hole pressure bhp control of 400 bars 3 2 spatial discretization at different resolutions an optimal grid resolution is essential for both accurately presenting the fracture network and improving computational performance de hoop et al 2019 2020 here four levels of discretized models increasing resolution from grid 1 to 4 as shown in fig 3 are selected to characterize the fracture network table 1 lists the detailed grid numbers of different grid sets the sensitivity of simulation results to the grid resolution will be identified with different models to capture the fast convective flow in the fracture the number of grid cells utilized to discretize the fractures has to stay dense across different levels of resolutions comparing the numerical solutions of different discretization ratios will help to propose an optimal grid resolution for thermal flow in fractured reservoirs the temporal variation of production temperature in conjunction with the parameter distribution e g the temperature saturation and pressure at the selected time is utilized to quantitatively compare the results between different models the solutions for the grid with the highest resolution fig 3d are taken as the reference and compared with solutions generated from models at lower resolutions fig 3a to c 3 3 resolution study direct comparison of production temperature gives evidence to the accuracy of different levels of discretization fig 4 displays the temperature profile of the production well for the two test cases two phase and critical water conditions under different grid resolutions with the grid refinement the temperature curve approaches the reference solution gradually grid 3 solid green line can closely capture the referenced temperature drop for both cases the temperature decline fig 4 can be simply divided into two consecutive parts along with time the short rapid drop at the early period i e 7 000 days fig 4a and the following elongated mild drop figs 5 to 7 display the distribution of the temperature pressure and water saturation at certain selected simulation time for the two phase system the temperature map for coarser resolutions e g fig 5a show more dispersed cold water distribution than the finer ones e g fig 5c which results from the assumption of instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium within one control volume for coarser resolutions the averaged size of computational control volumes is larger than that under finer resolutions for the same amount of matrix volume surrounded by several fractures the energy depletion under a coarser grid representation will be faster than its counterpart under finer resolutions a coarse grid block represented by several control volumes under finer resolution will deplete integrally when the temperature gradient exists which enables faster energy depletion the same amount of energy depletion under finer resolutions will however experience several transitional steps between control volumes whereby the energy depletion will slow down and conform to the referenced process following a similar logic the multiple interacting continua minc model pruess and narasimhan 1985 wu and pruess 1988 has been proposed for approximately modeling mass and heat transport in fractured systems overall the spreading of the cold water plume for different resolutions is similar and converges with refinement the grid set 3 fig 5c can already accurately represent the solution of temperature in the computational domain since the initially distributed two phase high enthalpy geothermal system is the focus of this study the solutions of pressure and saturation also need to be checked while comparing different grid sets it is obvious from figs 6 and 7 that the pressure and saturation distributions present higher sensitivity to grid resolutions than the temperature at the thermal front the pore pressure will decrease subject to the steam condensation triggered by the energy depletion wong et al 2018 which is a highly nonlinear process and can impact the solution of pressure in the entire domain in comparison with the referenced pressure distribution fig 6d the pressure gradient buildup looks slower for models with coarser discretization fig 6a and b this can be explained by the larger averaged volume of computational grids as for the temperature difference mentioned above saturation as a function of enthalpy and pressure is also sensitive to the grid resolution fig 7 restricted by the solution of pressure the propagation of water saturation with coarser resolutions fig 7a and b cannot precisely capture the phase distribution under the reference resolution as it is observed in figs 6c and 7c the distributions of pressure and saturation for grid 3 closely match with the finest resolution of grid 4 3 4 computational performance and accuracy the computation time of each run is measured during the simulation as an indicator for numerical performance fig 8 a displays the simulation time of both two phase and critical water systems under various grid resolutions the performance is scalable with the grid resolution as an almost linear relationship is observed between the logarithm of cpu time and control volumes numbers in the serial runs grid 3 can run about 10 times faster than grid 4 the finest resolution with reasonable accuracy as shown in fig 8b it is worth noticing that the accuracy of solution depends on fractured network modification and the accuracy of nonlinear physics representation as can be seen in fig 8b as well here the more linear critical water model converged to the reference solution faster than the two phase model considering the fact that solutions at coarser resolutions grid 1 and 2 are not accurate the resolution of grid 3 is proposed for farther analysis besides because of the heavier numerical nonlinearity associated with the two phase system more nonlinear iterations are needed than for the one with critical water and therefore computation is more time consuming for the two phase system table 2 shows the nonlinear iterations needed for both cases the number inside the bracket represents the number of wasted nonlinear iterations 4 heat and mass transfer thermal convection and conduction are the two main mechanisms governing heat transfer in the subsurface a thermal péclet number pe is defined to quantify the interplay between thermal convection and conduction whereby the heat transfer dynamics is studied and discussed the optimal grid discretization grid 3 of the synthetic fractured reservoir is utilized in the following analysis 4 1 thermal péclet number for mass transfer the péclet number characterizes the interplay between the convective and diffusive flow as the energy analog of mass transport the thermal péclet number quantifies the relative strength of convection and conduction during heat transport the dimensionless thermal péclet number is defined as follows 15 pe p 1 n p t h p ρ p q p d t i 1 n f t ω fi d i v κ t d ω d t where q p refers to the flow rate of a specific phase p w s for water and steam phase at the production well ω fi denotes the control volumes representing the i th fracture this interpretation is only suitable for fractured systems with low permeable matrix as of this study where the thermal convective flow can be considered as dominating in the fracture network while the fracture matrix heat exchange is through thermal conduction the dimensionless time is defined as follows 16 t d t q i d t i 1 n ϕ i v i where q i refers to the flow rate at the injection well ϕ i denotes the porosity of grid block i v i denotes the volume of grid block i n denotes the number of grid blocks 4 2 heat transfer regimes fig 9 a displays the temporal evolution of the péclet number four stages are detected on the péclet curve representing different heat and mass transfer dynamics correspondingly the dynamic simulation statistics for different stages are recognized in fig 9b overall the péclet number increases as simulation proceeds which demonstrates the relative strength of thermal convection grows during the simulation 4 2 1 stable two phase flow a constant thermal péclet number stage ① is observed fig 9a for the first 100 days which indicates a stable interplay between convection and conduction since the energy production rate is almost constant during this period fig 9b the thermal conductive flow stays stable as well fig 10 image 1 displays the temperature map of the model at 100 days only a small region of the matrix near the injection well shows a minor temperature change as enthalpy and temperature are independent in the two phase state the matrix temperature stays unchanged while the enthalpy drops until the two phases transit to a single phase the phase transition fig 11 image 1 is a faster process than the temperature propagation since phase transition is more sensitive to pressure variations in this period stabilized two phase flow occurs in the fractures which can be deduced from the stable water and steam flow rates observed at the production well the injected cold water heated up by the hot rock vaporizes in the fractures because of the existence of highly compressible steam the pressure buildup within the fracture network does not take place instantaneously which is quite different for the quasi incompressible fluid system correspondingly the needed injection pressure to sustain the operation scheme is stable fig 9b 4 2 2 transient two phase flow as the simulation proceeds the péclet number increases quickly stage ② which mainly results from the condensed water breakthrough in fractures as it is shown in fig 9b the energy and water rates increase drastically during this period due to heat exploitation the produced energy cannot support water vaporization under the fixed production pressure therefore the steam rate decreases to zero and the energy production curve reaches the maximum energy rate fig 9b the water production rate increases owing to the pressure buildup in the fractured system which can also be observed in fig 9b the cold water plume penetrates deeper towards the producer fig 10 image 2 a larger volume near the injection well depletes by thermal conduction the production temperature fig 4d remains unchanged at the end of this period 2 000 days which indicates the thermal front has not reached the production well yet however the fractures are fully saturated with condensed water fig 9b the saturation profile fig 11 image 2 shows the phase transition of the matrix cells along the fracture cells between injection and production wells at 2 000 days 4 2 3 transient single phase flow from 2 000 to 10 000 days the increment of the péclet number becomes mild stage ③ the heat transferred by both the thermal convection and conduction decreases as the time proceeds the energy contained in unit volume of fluid drastically decreases since the energy rate reduces sharply with just a mild decrease in water flow rate fig 9b the heat transferred by thermal conduction is expected to reduce more than by convection as the péclet number keeps increasing during this period from fig 10 image 3 the temperature of the matrix surrounding the fractures decreases a lot at 10 000 days since thermal conduction is proportional to the temperature gradient and inversely proportional to grid distance the thermal recharge of the fluids in the fractures by the matrix weakens along time this can also be verified from the production temperature curve fig 4a the temperature decline in this period is sharp and steep due to the fast temperature drop in the matrix adjacent to the fractures as the average temperature of the fracture fluid drops the fluid density and viscosity increase correspondingly which leads to higher flow resistance within the fractures the pressure needed to maintain the constant injection rate keeps increasing fig 9b another interesting observation is the phase transition in the regions without direct contact with cold water owing to the pressure elevation within the model the steam phase in the matrix condensates to water phase fig 11 image 3 4 2 4 stable single phase flow after 10 000 days the péclet number rapidly increases stage ④ as is shown in fig 10 image 4 the matrix energy has widely depleted at 30 000 days the thermal convective flow becomes dominant as the conduction turns less influential in heat transfer due to energy extraction the water production stabilizes in this period with only a minor decrease in the energy production rate in parallel the increase of injection pressure slows down simply because the temperature change of the fluids slows down after 10 000 days fig 4a 5 realistic fractured network 5 1 background the fracture network used in this section is taken from an outcrop of the whitby mudstone formation boersma et al 2015 the horizontal network was first captured from birds eye view imagery of the pavement with an extent of about 15m at sub cm resolution the imagery was interpreted in the aspect of fracture orientation length and density individual fractures were manually traced from and assembled on the constructed digital map 2 148 fracture segments were recognized from the images the fracture network is scaled up to the size of 1200 m 1600 m 50 m for simulations the geometry of the fracture network is depicted in fig 12 a 5 2 grid discretization a reasonable grid resolution is essential for both accurately presenting the fracture network and enhancing the computational performance here a grid discretization fig 12b with characteristic length of 7 5 m the same as fig 3c is selected to characterize the fracture network compared to wang et al 2020a the mesh quality is improved by the optimized treatment at the model boundary in addition a benchmark study against state of the art research simulators has been conducted in wang et al 2020b 5 3 numerical experiments and discussions in this section we compare the heat transfer dynamics inside the model with different parameter settings fracture matrix permeability ratio flow rate rock heat conductivity and heat capacity the parameter settings of the base case are listed in table 3 5 3 1 fracture matrix permeability ratio permeability is one of the key factors strongly influencing thermal flow and transport depending on the geological formation the matrix permeability can vary from high porous sandstone to low almost impermeable basalt the permeability contrast between fracture and matrix reflects their relative ability for fluid flow to percolate it is important to analyze the cold front propagation under different realistic permeability ratios ijeje et al 2019 a set of fracture matrix permeability ratios is chosen and examined to observe the thermal response for different scenarios the variation of permeability contrast is achieved by adjusting the matrix permeability while the fracture aperture for simplicity of interpretation is fixed here we choose typical matrix permeability for different types of rocks sandstone 100 md carbonate 1 md and basalt 0 001 md where the fracture matrix permeability ratio will be 7 5 e 4 7 5 e 6 and 7 5 e 9 fig 13 displays the temperature distribution for different permeability ratios where large differences of the cold front propagation can be observed for the lowest permeability contrast fig 13a the cold front propagates surrounding the injection well since the matrix permeability is higher in this case the preferential heat transport along fractures is not prominent with the increase in permeability ratio the fluid flow predominantly occurs within the fractures instead of through the matrix therefore the cold front spreads following the branches of the fractures towards the production well fig 14 shows the impact of fracture matrix permeability ratio on the production temperature with a large permeability ratio the injected water is pushed to flow through the fractures and the heat exchanges between fracture and matrix mainly through thermal conduction therefore the amount of depleted energy is lower in fracture dominated flow and the temperature declines faster than for lower permeability ratios in addition due to the diversion effect of the high permeable matrix fluid flow in the fractures is reduced which facilitates heating the fluids within the fractures consequently the shape of the temperature curve with the lowest permeability ratio blue line in fig 14 becomes largely different from the rest 5 3 2 flow rate the flow rate directly associates with mass and heat transport for real field applications the flow rate is a key focus that will determine the thermal breakthrough time wang et al 2019a therefore it is crucial to determine how the heat transfer dynamics change with the flow rate in fractured porous media five different injection flow rates are utilized to investigate their influence on thermal propagation fig 15 displays the temperature distribution at different flow rates larger volumes deplete with the increase of flow rate fig 16 a shows the production temperature for different flow rates the temperature drops earlier and faster with the elevated flow rates resulting from the more powerful convective flow in the fractures the cumulative energy production is displayed in fig 16b here 500 k is selected as the checking point to compare the cumulative energy production with different flow rates the amount of cumulative energy slightly increases with the reduction in flow rate which is different from similar observations in fluvial systems wang et al the highly preferential convective flow in fractures makes the fracture matrix heat exchange less efficient under higher flow rates besides no extra flow paths get involved in heat production with the increase of flow rate as indicated in fig 15 fig 16 c shows the thermal péclet number for different flow rates the péclet number is constant at the early stable two phase flow regime where the thermal conduction is stronger than the convection under any flow rate as the dimensionless time proceeds the relative strength of convection exceeds that of conduction gradually the péclet curves overlap with each other which means with the same amount of water injected the relative contributions of convection and conduction to heat production are the same under different flow rates 5 3 3 rock heat conduction conduction plays a vital role in heat extraction during geothermal development especially in the case of low permeable rocks conductive heat flow happens when the temperature gradient builds up between control volumes the strength of thermal conduction is proportional to the magnitude of temperature gradient and heat conductivity in this section various rock heat conductivity values are selected within a realistic range to study the sensitivity of thermal propagation to heat conductivity in fractured reservoirs fig 17 shows the temperature distribution with different heat conductivity with the same amount of water injected the cold front propagation is more confined with larger heat conductivity fig 17e since stronger conductive heat exchange happens under larger conductivity values the reservoir energy close to the injection well largely depletes when conductivity decreases it will need more contact with the matrix to heat the fracture fluids and therefore the temperature front spreads deeper towards the production well correspondingly the region near the injection well weakly depletes e g fig 17a the influence of rock conductivity to thermal propagation is clearly nonlinear since the variations shrink as the conductivity increases the production temperature for different heat conductivity is shown in fig 18 a consistent with the temperature distribution an earlier temperature drop is observed at the production well with lower heat conductivity the temperature decline converges as conductivity increases as is shown for κ 200 300 400 kj m day k which demonstrates the conduction effect approaches its upper bound further increase of conductivity is unable to heat the fluids even more because either the fluid has already been heated up or the rock has been cooled down overall the variation of production temperature with conductivity is not as significant as with permeability ratio or flow rate the péclet curves are similar under different heat conductivity fig 18b as a multiplier in conduction calculation smaller heat conductivity will limit the conductive rate however the broader spreading of the cold front along fractures with low conductivity enlarges the contact area for heat conduction consequently quite similar péclet profiles are observed for different cases 5 3 4 rock heat capacity volumetric heat capacity proportionally correlates with the amount of energy contained in the rock larger heat capacity simply means a larger amount of energy is contained in the reservoir here five values of rock heat capacity within a realistic range are selected to investigate its influence on heat production as shown in fig 19 the thermal propagation is largely different from the variation in rock heat capacity reflecting the different capabilities of reservoir rock resisting energy depletion with the same amount of cold water injection a larger portion of the reservoir depletes with lower heat capacity e g fig 19a this is because the cold water quickly depletes its bypassed reservoir via conduction and therefore a larger reservoir volume is involved in the energy depletion process at the selected time or for certain specific simulation time fig 20 a displays the changes in production temperature with heat capacity the production temperature shows a similar two stage decline for all considered cases sharp decrease and mild drop the faster temperature drop with lower heat capacity corresponds closely with the observation in fig 19 overall the heat capacity shows a roughly linear influence on production temperature since the difference between curves keeps almost the same with the linear change of heat capacity the difference in thermal péclet numbers fig 20b becomes noticeable as the temperature starts decreasing rock with larger heat capacity will supply stronger energy to the injected cold water via thermal conduction while the convective flow can be taken as the same for different cases therefore the péclet number is smaller under larger heat capacity 6 conclusion in this paper the multiphase mass and heat transport in fractured reservoirs is numerically investigated using the delft advanced research terra simulator darts fractures are explicitly depicted with the discrete fracture model dfm and the mesh quality of the dfm discretization is improved through a pre processing procedure based on the numerically converged model a sensitivity study of heat transfer in fractured reservoirs with different numerical and physical parameters is performed to guide the uncertainty quantification and optimization processes first a simulation framework is presented to comprehensively investigate the sensitivity of simulation results to mesh resolution with a synthetic fractured model the dfm discretization is based on conformal coarsening of fine scale fractured network the numerical convergence of the solutions is achieved with mesh refinement under high enthalpy condition with the presence of both single and two phase fluids the simulation time and error statistics are summarized for different sets of mesh discretization the optimal mesh discretization is selected out of several resolutions it is highly recommended to qualify the mesh discretization when modeling geothermal transport within fractured systems using accurate fractured models which will both guarantee precise simulation results and greatly improve computational performance subsequently a thermal péclet number is defined for fractured systems with low permeable matrix four different flow stages and relative strength between thermal convection and conduction are recognized from the péclet curves our results show that geothermal development in a fractured system becomes less efficient when heat transport is mostly convection dominated as clearly indicated by the thermal péclet number analysis next a fracture model sketched from a direct image interpretation of a realistic outcrop is discretized with the optimal characteristic length and utilized for parameter sensitivity analysis almost linear impact of flow rate and rock heat capacity to production temperature is observed whereas rock heat conductivity displays a clearly nonlinear influence which is difficult to predict without the direct numerical simulation additionally the fracture matrix permeability ratio can largely alter the propagation of cold water front these notable impacts of investigated parameters on thermal propagation and heat transfer dynamics can help to better design and layout the system and estimate the project economics with further uncertainty analyses the proposed numerical methodology for finding an optimal grid resolution is of great importance for improving the computation time without compromising the accuracy therefore our approach is recommended for sensitivity studies or uncertainty quantification of geothermal energy production from fractured reservoirs in addition the coarser resolution though yielding less accurate solutions demonstrates the more efficient computational performance and can be used for effective clustering of realizations in uncertainty quantification studies see examples in de hoop et al 2019 2020 the defined péclet number provides a way to theoretically quantify the characteristics of flow and heat transport in fractured geothermal reservoirs besides utilizing a fracture network generated from real outcrop observations helps to understand the complex thermal transport in realistic fractured systems since there are not many publications on two phase thermal transport in highly resolved fractured high enthalpy geothermal system this paper fills a gap in the literature and highlights the basic influential factors for an optimal development of such resources this study is performed under the assumption of constant fracture aperture in van der kooij et al 2020 we demonstrated that the statistical variability in fracture aperture for a fixed fracture network can lead to different connectivity between injection and production wells which in turn yields different optimal production rate in addition rigorous consideration of the effect of thermoporoelastic deformation of rock on heat production stefansson et al 2020 berge et al 2020 can be essential for geothermal applications

system isoms approach was developed for assessing adaptive strategies in response to coupled impacts of climate and landuse variations the isoms can not only reflect future hydrological trends under changing environment but also provide water allocation plans under various uncertainties expressed as random or fuzzy feature systematically a case study of anning river basin with dry and warm characteristics in the upper yangtze river was applied to inspect the model s applicability a range of alternatives to adaptive strategies were generated under combinations of climate and landuse scenarios with different satisfaction levels results reveal that i there exist increasing trend of temperature and precipitation in future period 2021 2050 ii the streamflow variation is more sensitive to climate change than landuse change iii the hydrologic system uncertainties would lead to changes in water resources allocation iv a low level of uncertainty satisfaction or a high level of violation risk would reduce the system reliability for the water resources system the isoms approach has tremendous significance for evaluating hydrologic variations with complicated uncertainties and providing optimal water allocation schemes responding to the coupled impacts of climate and landuse variations among society economy and environment keywords climate projection landuse projection hydrological simulation ecology uncertain optimization adaptive management 1 introduction global change incorporating climate and landuse were confirmed to have a significant influence on the hydrological cycle transforming the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability and stability of the ecosystem basheer et al 2016 zarch et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zipper et al 2018 increasing water demand and changing natural environment have caused anabatic water resource conflicts in the context of shrinking water availability subsequently intimidating the sustainability of the environment and human beings andersson et al 2006 thompson et al 2014 wagena et al 2016 water resources management has become a challenging task under changing climate and landuse thus projection of climate and landuse variations and evaluating their impacts on water resources availability can contribute to formulating adaptive strategies or strategic investment for water resources managers rheinheimer et al 2016 reshmidevi et al 2018 however due to the uncertainty of climate and landuse projections and the complexity of the hydrological process it is usually difficult to evaluate the influence of climate and landuse variations moreover there are many uncertain parameters in the water resources system and their interrelationships could be highly complicated li et al 2009a previously numerous explorations and prominent achievements have been developed to deal with the uncertainty in modeling and optimizing water resources systems kotir et al 2016 zhuang et al 2018 for example dessai and hulme 2007 proposed an assessment framework to identify the robustness of adaptation strategies to climate change uncertainties indicating that water resources management strategies are susceptible to uncertainties in the regional climate response kotir et al 2016 constructed an integrated dynamics simulation model to examine the feedback processes and interaction among the sub sectors of water resource population and agricultural production demonstrating that the model is reliable and robust to uncertainties in model inputs structure and parameters generally the researches were mainly about integrating future climate change with hydrological models to evaluate the impacts on hydrology which have already been identified as great challenges for application li et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 due to various uncertainties that existed in the input output and structure of hydrological models many studies integrating with climate and landuse projections were widely adopted to assess the potential influences on hydrological process ha et al 2016 zhuang et al 2018 for instance ahiablame et al 2017 designed several scenarios of landuse and climate patterns for analyzing the corresponding possible streamflow responses in the james river watershed moran tejeda 2015 combined climate and landuse scenarios into two hydrological models for a mountainous watershed and two models have a different sensibility to climate and land cover variations luo et al 2016 quantified the contribution of landuse and climatic variation on the hydrologic process in the heihe river basin and climate change was one of the dominant factors and contributed a sharp increase several studies also revealed that the hydrological process variation was sensitive to climate change than landuse change ji and yuan 2018 chen et al 2019 recently integrated simulation optimization from hydrological modeling of natural system to optimization management of social system has been applied to real world problems zhuang et al 2018 developed an integrated simulation optimization approach for assessing climate change impacts on water resources and results show that the system uncertainties would significantly affect water resources allocation patterns including target and shortage actually the water resources system is a complex problem containing diverse uncertain and dynamic factors in the context of long term prediction the dynamic characteristics are mainly from climatic and lanuse projections the simplification of hydrological model the random character of water availability and the estimated socioeconomic parameters e g water demand net benefits and penalties huang and loucks 2000 asong et al 2016 zhuang et al 2018 nematian 2016 such dynamic uncertainties pose significant challenges to real world hydrological prediction and water resources planning consequently making adaptation strategies under changing environment are particularly problematic as the uncertainties are relevant not merely to climate and landuse projections but also to water availability and demand correspondingly numerous stochastic and fuzzy mathematical programming methods were developed to deal with the uncertainty of water resources management system huang and loucks 2000 loucks et al 2005 multi stage stochastic programming msp is effective in dealing with dynamic uncertainties expressed as probability distributions based on a multi layer scenario tree azaiez 2002 sun et al 2017 the primary advantage of msp is the flexibility in the decision process where deciders can make water supply schemes timely under discrete probability level at each stage li et al 2006 chance constrained programming ccp was usually proposed to settle uncertainties of the right constraints charnes and cooper 1959 du et al 2013 fuzzy mathematical programming fmp was raised for dealing with uncertainty parameters expressed as fuzzy sets while it was challenging to acquire a determined value zadeh 1975 zhuang et al 2018 li and huang 2009a generally the individual fuzzy or stochastic method would not meet the complexities and robustness for water resources management integrating multiple uncertain methods may contribute to water resources optimization fan et al 2016 furthermore previous water resources optimization mainly emphasizes domestic industrial and agricultural water demand without considering ecosystem water demand causing unsustainable development and environmental deterioration additionally as the accumulation effect of bias and downscaling methods would enlarge the uncertainties several studies have found the general circulation model gcm ensembles are superior to the individual gcm for hydrological forecasting zhu et al 2019 reshmidevi et al 2018 it is desired that more innovative methods are developed in propagating uncertainties of hydrologic modeling from climate and landuse projections to the uncertain analysis of water resources therefore the objective of this study is to develop an integrated simulation optimization modeling system isoms approach for exploring multiple adaptive strategies in response to coupled impacts of climate and landuse variations under uncertainty in the isoms framework a cross combination of four climate ensembles based on 31 gcms and three ca markov based landuse projections were utilized as inputs for a distributed hydrological model of mike she to predict the hydrological variations then a multi stage flexible stochastic chance constrained programming mfscp method were integrated to optimize the available water resources a case study of anning river basin arb in the upper yangtze river was applied to inspect how the developed approach made connections from the hydrological model in natural system to the application analysis of social system under changing environment this study is the first attempt to apply a framework with consideration of coupled impacts of climate and landuse variabilities in a mountainous area with strong spatial heterogeneity and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework has general applicability the results can not only improve the accuracy of hydrological forecast by overcoming individual input of changing environment in previous studies but also help decision makers generate resilient water allocation strategies to random interval and fuzzy uncertainties this study is crucial to meet the sustainable development among water resource society economy and ecology in the yangtze river 2 methodology 2 1 framework of isoms for hydrologic modeling and water management to assess adaptive strategies in response to the coupled impacts of climatic and landuse variations the isoms was developed it consists of four components i climatic projections from multi gcms ii landuse projections iii hydrologic modeling and forecasting iv optimization model of multi stage flexible stochastic chance constrained programming mfscp a framework diagram is presented in fig 1 firstly according to the available data the mike she was calibrated with daily streamflow from 1977 to 1983 and then validated for the periods of 1984 1986 and 2006 2007 secondly a deep learning neural network model of long short term memory lstm and traditional multi model ensemble mean mmem methods were adopted to ensemble climate data with 31 gcms and the ca markov based model combined with mce and logisticreg modules were used to project three kinds of landuse projections thirdly we employed four sets of climate data and three sets of landuse projections as inputs to assess the hydrologic variations in the future period 2021 2050 then future supplying water qtk was acquired finally mfscp was developed for allocating available water resources to each water user wit under coupled impacts of climate and landuse variabilities generally the isoms can tackle random qtk and fuzzy variables bit cit in objective function and constraints and evaluate various water release plans under different violation risks qi and α cut levels which will help quantify influences of climate and landuse change and support adaptive strategies for water resources managers 2 2 climate and landuse projections for this research a total of 31 gcms at daily scale for each meteorological station were obtained from liu and zuo 2012 by a statistical downscaling model of nwai wg the data set includes three variables of precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 represents a medium greenhouse gas emission scenario while rcp8 5 represents a high concentration greenhouse gas emission scenario ouyang et al 2015 several studies showed that rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are representative for studying the influence of climatic change on hydrology rogelj et al 2012 since the scale of gcm is much larger than the spatial scale required for hydrology and water resources analysis in the catchment area the climate projection has certain deviations and uncertainties especially for precipitation mehrotra et al 2014 reshmidevi et al 2018 multi gcm ensembles containing multiple model information are proved to be better than a single model which can effectively reduce the bias and uncertainty of future climate output woldemeskel et al 2016 lstm aims to obtain the relationship among long term series data which was proved better than conventional methods hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 therefore this research adopted a traditional mmem method and an advanced lstm method to integrate 31 gcms for improving and comparing the prediction accuracy for this study the lstm was firstly used to build a nonlinearity correlation between downscaled climate data from gcms and historical observation data then the temporal signals and information were detected and propagated by sigmoid function with a multiplication operation to a future period specifically the monthly observed and downscaled climate data precipitation and temperature from 1961 to 2000 were adopted as training dataset to formulate paired dataset and the data from 2001 to 2010 was used for testing then climate projections from 2021 to 2050 would be propagated separately based on the aforementioned developed lstm considering the focus of the article the specific operation process of lstm were not described in this text comparatively the precipitation and temperature from 2021 to 2050 were directly averaged from 31 gcms by mmem as there exist multiple uncertainties in future climatic and hydrological variation these two ensemble methods lstm and mmem were helpful to acquire the general range and stochastic probability distribution of future streamflow through a stochastic process analysis method hu et al 2018 there exist few models to project landuse variation due to the spatial characteristics and diversity of landuse types and the cellular automata ca model markov model and clue s are common methods currently the clue s has wide application for small scale but there exist limits on the number of type and grids wang et al 2018 the ca model can identify the spatial dynamic evolution process for complex systems while the markov model can be used to predict types and transfer rates between different landuse arsanjani et al 2011 a ca markov model assembles the powerful spatial computing ability of ca model and the long term prediction of markov model and has a great advantage for spatial and temporal projections of landuse patterns kamusoko et al 2009 the idrisi software with ca markov module was used to simulate the changes in landuse patterns based on historical landuse data from 1995 2005 and 2015 with transition matrix per decade the specific process can be described as follows i calculate the transition area matrix and transition probability matrix from 1995 to 2005 and 2005 to 2015 ii select altitude slope precipitation temperature rivers roads and population density as the driving factors of landuse change then multi criteria assessment mce and multiple spatial regression logisticreg modules were applied to create transitional adaptability images for each landuse type iii project the landuse change according to the spatial distribution and driving factors in the reference year and the simulation results were compared with actual landuse data of 2015 to validate the reliability finally three landuse projections were acquired according to three methods markov mce and logisticreg and various driving factors afterwards a combination of twelve scenarios under four sets of climate projections and three sets of landuse projections were utilized as inputs for assessing the hydrological trend in future periods under climate and landuse variations 2 3 hydrological modeling as a typical representative of the distributed hydrological model mike she can evaluate the impact of climate and landuse variations on hydrology which has presented strong application potential in humid and arid regions smerdon et al 2009 wijesekara et al 2014 the main difference from other distributed hydrological models e g swat vic and topmoeldel is that researchers can select suitable modules for modeling from mike she based on the available data of climate and geological characteristics thompson et al 2013 by using the observed and downscaled monthly scale data of climate variables as inputs the daily scale streamflow variation of the basin was simulated in the area given the available data the mike she model was calibrated and verified based on measured daily scale streamflow to evaluate its applicability in dry and warm valleys and mountains the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and the correlation coefficient r are usually adopted for assessing the goodness of fit which are both sensitive to the mean and variance for the simulated and measured values the evaluation criteria for nse and r are defined as follows nash and sutcliffe 1970 1a n s e 1 i 1 k q m q s 2 i 1 k q m q m 2 1b r i 1 n q m q m q s q s i 1 n q m q m 2 i 1 n q s q s 2 s s s s s where qm represents observed value qs represents the value of simulation and q m represents the observed average value the closer the values of nse and r to 1 the better the model performance in general the model can be used for calculation when r is great than 0 6 and the simulation results reach a better level while nse ranges between 0 5 and 0 95 legates and mccabe 1999 sun et al 2016 2 4 multi stage flexible stochastic chance constrained programming in the context of long term climate and landuse variations water resources management is confronted with dynamic uncertainties and difficulties consider water resources management s objective is to make water allocation schemes timely under discrete probability level in each stage to maximize the system benefit and minimize losses by identifying optimized water allocation schemes over the planning horizon li et al 2018 xiao et al 2021 such kind of issue can be formulated as an msp which can not only reflect the uncertainties in water allocation problems where interactive and dynamic relationships exist within a multi stage context but also permit revised decisions in each stage gulpinar et al 2002 the msp can be formulated as follows li et al 2009b ouyang et al 2015 2a max f t 1 t i 1 i b i t w i t t 1 t i 1 i k 1 k t p t k c i t d i t k water availability constraint 2b i 1 i w i t d i t k q t k t k

whole period ptkis the probability for scenario k in period t qtkis available water with fuzziness and randomness wit is target water for each user ditkis the shortage when water allocation target wit is not met with the flow qtk bit is the net benefit cit is penalty while water is not delivered cit bit miwit is the minimum amount that should be allocated i is water user while t is the period due to the dynamic characteristics of water supply and demand social and economic data may be difficult for deciders to receive a deterministic value such as net benefits bit and penalties cit the lower and upper bounds of many interval parameters given as subjective information can be expressed as fuzzy sets chen et al 2020 in response to the above concerns fmp was introduced to handle uncertain parameters with unknown membership or distribution functions sun et al 2013 for example the frequently used triangular fuzzy number c under each α cut level i e degree of confidence α 0 1 can be represented as an interval c c 1 α cl αcm 1 α ch αcm an α cut can be defined as a set of elements that belong to a fuzzy set at least to a membership grade of α the above model can reflect the fuzzy uncertainty in constraints and objective functions represents fuzzy inequality among them flexible fuzzy programming can reflect the fuzzy characteristics in the inequality which determines the possible violation of each flexible constraint arfanuzzaman and rahman 2017 according to the flexible programming algorithm proposed by peidro the constraint 2b can thus be reformulated as follows peidro et al 2009 pishvaee and khalaf 2016 3a i 1 i w i t d i t k q t k r i m φ t φ t 3 1 α i t k 3b r i r i m φ t φ t 3 3c φ t r i h r i m 3d φ t r i m r i l to translate the optimization model into a solvable model the ccp method was introduced to solve the right side random variable of constraints within probability at least γi which can be expressed by the following charnes et al 1972 loucks et al 2005 4a pr t i x i γ i i 4b t i x i t q i i t where x i t q i f i t 1 q i ti represents uncertain decision variable an allocation target ti will be met at least γi of the time xi represents random variable γi is the probability level qi i e qi 1 γi is the probability level of violating the constraint x i t q i represents the value of xi that is equaled or exceeded at time t for instance assuming three firms may want to set allocation targets t not expecting to have those targets met 100 of the time to ensure that an allocation target ti of firm i will be met at least γi of the time then the chance constraint can be transformed into a linear constraint with a given probability level based on the flexible fuzzy chance constraint programming methods and the vertex interactive algorithm the mfscp method can effectively solve such complicated management problems cai et al 2018 in the above models model 2 is generally nonlinear and non convex due to joint probabilities with multiple random variables consequently the formulas w it w δ w i t y i t δ w it w it w it and decision variablesy it 0 1 were introduced for the solution correspondingly the above model can be disassembled into upper and lower bound linear sub models as follows huang and loucks 2000 li and huang 2009a 5a m a x f t 1 t i 1 i b i t w i t δ w i t y i t t 1 t i 1 i k 1 k t p t k c i t d i t k

acquired by the formula a itkopt w itopt ditkopt generally solutions including system benefit water shortages and water allocation schemes of different users under a set of a cut levels were produced through solving a series of deterministic submodels of mfscp it can make real time decisions based on the realization of random variables and previous decision information at each stage and modify the pre determined water distribution objectives over a multiperiod planning horizon the optimal allocation can be stated to evaluate how water availability shifted under climate and landuse variations will affect water resource management 3 study area and data acquisition 3 1 overview of the study area as a primary tributary of the upper yangtze river there are four counties and cities i e mianning dechang xichang and miyi running through the arb fig 2 it is an ecotone of agriculture animal husbandry in the dry and warm valley with a drainage area of about 11 150 km2 and a mainstream length of 303 km the river drop is 936 m while the gradient is 3 1 arb is surrounded by mountains on three sides forming a high terrain on three sides from east to west and low terrain on the south the annual average precipitation at each station of the basin has little interannual variation but the distribution of precipitation is uneven during the year the precipitation from december to april is less than 10 of the annual average for many years which is the dry season of the basin the heavy rains mostly occur from june to september which accounts for more than 75 of the whole year the rainstorm is characterized by high intensity and short duration as an ecologically fragile region in the upper yangtze river the social and economic activities of arb are relatively concentrated the planning of water conservancy and hydropower projects the construction of large scale irrigation districts and cities have brought increasing uncertainty and difficulties to the systematic management of the basin sun et al 2021 as a specific ecologically degraded area and a substantial agricultural production base in china the influence study of climate and landuse variation on hydrological processes contributes to developing crop systems biological resources and ecological restoration 3 2 data collection the constructed hydrological model and optimization modeling system were adopted to demonstrate the applicability in arb the modeling system requires data incorporating the digital elevation model dem meteorology landuse soil hydrological data available water water supply and demand socioeconomic data etc the specific names and resolution of 31 gcms downscaled by liu were presented in the attached table for the study area daily observed data of three meteorological stations mianning xichang and miyi and one hydrological station wantan were collected from national meteorological center then the thiessen polygon was utilized to interpolate the station based meteorological data into regional data the dem 30m 30 m came from the geospatial data cloud platform the landuse map 30m 30 m was obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform the soil data 1km 1 km was from the world harmonized soil database hwsd then arcgis tools were employed to process the data and convert it into the appropriate format for the mike she model the water supply and demand primarily include four users domestic ecological industrial and agricultural water users the time horizon during 2021 and 2050 was divided into six planning periods i e every five years represents a period through field research expert consultation literature review statistical yearbooks and related websites socioeconomic water and soil data were obtained as shown in table 1 we got the net benefits when water demand was satisfied or the penalty if not satisfied through a comprehensive analysis of watershed planning and public surveys decision makers set the target value and minimum order of different water users in different planning periods firstly table 2 however in real world problems it is often difficult to build a probability distribution for socioeconomic data including benefits penalties water supply and demand due to limited human cognition or inaccurate expression this kind of fuzzy phenomenon can be expressed by the membership grade function in fuzzy mathematics the range of membership grade 0 1 was discretized into a finite number of α cut levels 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 and the fuzzy tolerance measures γ i i e 1 q i in model 4 were assumed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers i e γ i 0 9 0 92 0 95 the water supply data was derived from the predicted streamflow groundwater and red line of the policy reports along with the mean and variance of the calculated water resources monte carlo technology was used for the future six periods the water resources under different climate and landuse scenarios were simulated many times to obtain the cumulative distribution function thus the water resources under different inflow levels and the corresponding probability levels were obtained ecological environmental water demand includes in and outside the river channel according to the spatial location cai et al 2011 li and zhang 2013 the tennant method was utilized to calculate the ecological water demand in the river channel this method is simple and fast and is suitable for any river with seasonal changes for this study 30 of the average annual discharge was taken as a reasonable ecological water demand which can satisfy the water demand of aquatic organisms mainly for fish during the general growth and reproduction period as a whole tennant 1976 part of the ecological water demand outside the river was met by natural precipitation in the process of water resource allocation the amount of ecological water demand that cannot be met by effective rainfall needs to be supplemented by humans the actual evapotranspiration et was acquired from the output result of mike she by two layer uz et model based on empirically derived equations from yan and smith the results showed that the regional precipitation was greater than the actual et which indicated that the natural rainfall could meet the requirements of forestland and grassland no additional allocation was required wan et al 2008 besides the urban ecological water requirement also needs to be considered as a constraint in the process of water resource allocation 4 results and discussion 4 1 future climate and landuse projections as for lstm the training period was determined as 40 years from 1961 to 2000 and for testing was 10 years from 2001 to 2010 the temperature or precipitation of the thirty one gcms from 2021 to 2050 were fed into the developed lstm model to predict the corresponding future temperature or precipitation the mmem was used to obtain the average value of thirty one gcms the r of lstm are all greater than 0 8 in the training and testing periods for every station while r of mmem is about 0 7 and the nse values of lstm are greater than mmem statistics indicate that the lstm method has a strong ability to integrate multiple gcms and can better reflect the climatic changes in the arb over the years the monthly average precipitation and temperature predicted by lstm have a stronger correlation with the overall observation data results show that advanced deep learning methods are more effective than traditional methods in processing time signals misra et al 2018 the developed isoms method was employed to obtain climate projections under a site based scale during the base period 1961 2010 and the future period 2021 2050 fig 3 shows the simulation results and variation tendency of monthly average temperature and precipitation in the future period for the mianning and xichang stations the average annual temperature under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 both rose compared with the historical period 1961 2010 and the latter has an increase of about 1 4 than the former which is consistent with the results predicted in the ipcc5 report the average annual precipitation under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 has increased relative to the historical period and the former has an increase of 1 9 mm than the latter especially for the flood season of june to october for the future period mianning and xichang may face the risk of increasing temperature in dry season and increasing rainfall in rainy season effective measures should be taken to prevent the occurrence of drought and flood disaster the annual average temperature of miyi station has decreased while the annual precipitation has increased compared to the historical period the increased temperature in the watershed will inevitably lead to the rapid melting of glaciers and snow at the headstream of arb and changes in runoff generation mechanisms which will bring new opportunities and challenges to the management and utilization of local water resources especially during the flood season sun et al 2019 the results show that the climate projections vary for different stations which proves that there are differences and uncertainties for the climate change projection at the study area with unique terrain conditions the landuse was mainly divided into five types farmland forestland grassland water body and built up land the forestland has the largest area among these types followed by farmland and grassland the crosstab module in the idrisi software was utilized to compare the projections and actual landuse maps with the kappa coefficients of 0 96 0 89 and 0 91 respectively then the ca markov model was implemented to project landuse changes in 2025 2035 and 2045 table 3 we can see clearly that most of the landuse types decreased except the built up land increased the construction land mainly expanded into three situations of residential industrial and transportation land in the middle and lower reaches the primary shift is from natural types to artificial types which seem reasonable and feasible under the influence of regional economic development population growth and other factors even there is no future evidence to evaluate and verify the projected results all landuse scenarios are possible with the diversification and the complexity of the spatial pattern land conversion there is an urgent need to protect forestland farmland and water body for rational use of land in the future 4 2 future water resource conditions as mentioned above the hydrological model was calibrated and validated by adopting measured daily meteorological data i e temperature and precipitation and landuse data sets as inputs fig 4 presents the daily measured and simulated streamflow in the calibration period 1977 1983 and the validation period 1984 1986 and 2006 2007 for daily simulation the r and nse values were 0 85 and 0 72 respectively in the calibration period while they were 0 87 0 73 and 0 84 0 70 during the two validation periods respectively the two validation periods with corresponding inputs were primarily utilized to inspect the robustness of hydrological model results show that the simulated streamflow by mike she has satisfactory consistency with the observed value which indicates good applicability and strong robustness in the entire mountainous area for the extreme value the simulated streamflow is smaller than the observation at times based on four sets of climate projections and three sets of landuse projections a cross combination of twelve scenarios were utilized as inputs to project the process and trend of streamflow from 2021 to 2050 under the same climate scenario the streamflow changed little for three different landuse scenarios while obvious changes existed under different climate scenarios and the same landuse scenario the comparative results show that streamflow response is more sensitive to climate variation than landuse variation and the dominant factor leading to streamflow variations which is consistent with the previous studies chen et al 2019 the monthly mean streamflow is likely to increase in the rainy season and we should pay attention to prevent the occurrence of flood disasters especially from may to august the streamflow is likely to increase from february to april for the dry season but decrease in november indicating an increased risk of drought in november generally we can also conclude that the annual runoff increased significantly with the increase of precipitation according to the above streamflow prediction from multiple scenarios the available water resources were calculated by combining with the red line of water resources development the random historical data fits the maximum extreme value distribution well through the a d k s and chi square tests along with the mean and variance of the calculated water resources monte carlo technology was used for running 30 000 times to obtain the cumulative distribution function fig 5 thus we have the available water resources under different inflow levels very low low medium high and very high and related occurrence probabilities during six planning periods in arb table 4 in the study system the streamflow were random variables with known probability distributions 4 3 water deficit under uncertain conditions the isoms can help identify a series of optimized water allocation schemes by maximizing the system benefit and minimizing losses under water deficit conditions the interval format of ditk demonstrates the decision variables are sensitive to uncertain input parameters of nit cit and qtk which bring a fundamental change to the overall system li et al 2018 fig 6 visualizes each user sector s water shortage under very low l low lm medium m high mh and very high h levels for different α cut levels fig 6 shows the water shortage under rcp4 5 is lower than rcp8 5 during the same period indicating that the uncertainty arising from climatic scenarios influences future water availability when the streamflow is at a low level there will appear more water shortages moreover climate and landuse variation may bring about extreme droughts at a very low level while present abundant water resources under high flow levels for example there is little water resource scarcity under rcp4 5 at a high flow level especially for the lower bound of water demand during the whole period however there still exists water shortage under the rcp8 5 scenario even at very high flow level water shortage has an interactive correlation with the targeted water and water availability fig 7 presents the variation range of water shortage under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for six planning periods results indicate that diverse climatic scenarios bring about diverse water shortages mean values and variability ranges of water shortages are varied over the planning period for instance the water shortage under rcp4 5 has reduced from period 1 to period six as a whole the risk of water shortage would be decreased with the increase of water use efficiency however there is a greater water shortage during periods 3 4 and 6 under rcp8 5 which may be caused by reducing available water during these periods generally water conflicts in dry periods and regions would be further strengthened 4 4 optimized results of water allocation different water availability and water demand would bring about numerous alternatives under diverse confidence and violation level the adaptive strategies to water users with consideration of ecology are of great significance for the study area which can not only satisfy the ecological water demand but also allocate limited water resources reasonably according to different α cut levels and violation risk a series of solutions about the system benefits and optimal water allocation under plenty of scenarios over the time horizon can be presented in the following figures fig 8 shows the lower and upper bound of the system benefits under different α levels providing a series of beneficial decision schemes concerning system benefits and reliability diverse combinations on water availability water demand and allocation target would bring about various objective values for instance while α 0 5 the system benefit s interval value would be 676 79 835 15 billion under rcp4 5 and 596 02 758 56 billion under rcp4 5 respectively the lower benefits under rcp4 5 compared with rcp8 5 may be resulted from the more water resources shortage though the optimized system benefits vary under different climate scenarios the common trend is that the system benefit s interval is wider under a lower α cut level conversely a narrower interval under a higher α cut level while α 0 there may appear the highest benefit and lowest benefit correspondingly while α 1 the system would receive an increased system certainty decision makers would favor allocating water resources that will carry higher benefits which will lead to a higher violation risk and higher penalties accordingly similarly a higher level of violation risk will bring a higher upper bound of system benefits this change also corresponds to an increase in system risk and a decrease in system reliability fig 9 and fig 10 show the optimal water allocation patterns to the municipality industry and agriculture with α 0 and α 1 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during the planning period respectively we can see that the allocation for the agricultural sector would be first reduced under the premise of meeting the minimum targeted water the allotment for the municipality takes top priority as it can create great benefits and ensure harmonious development otherwise it will bring the highest penalty for the municipal sector and result in disharmony the results represent diverse water allocation projects under different α cut levels for instance for the flow levels under α 0 of rcp4 5 the optimal water allocation for agriculture would be 19 83 19 84 108 m3 19 33 24 61 108 m3 19 42 23 86 108 m3 22 79 27 48 108 m3 22 84 28 23 108 m3 24 86 29 22 108 m3 respectively while α 1 the optimal water allocation for agriculture would be 19 84 108 m3 22 28 22 29 108 m3 22 7 22 71 108 m3 24 65 24 67 108 m3 24 98 24 99 108 m3 26 59 26 6 108 m3 respectively the water allocation range under α 0 is wider than α 1 different water availability under different climate scenarios would also bring about various water allocation plans for rcp8 5 under α 0 the optimal water allocation for agriculture would be 19 84 108 m3 19 33 23 96 108 m3 19 42 108 m3 18 56 108 m3 23 12 28 81 108 m3 13 38 20 16 108 m3 respectively additionally we can also conclude that the optimized water allocation under rcp8 5 is lower than rcp4 5 consequently there would be no water shortage for the municipal sector in most scenarios a lower α cut level would bring about a wider interval for optimized water allocation besides the allocated water projects of industry and agriculture have a strong correlation with streamflow and less water availability may acquire less allotment for further analyzing the water allocation change boxplots of allocated water for each user in the planning horizon were presented fig 11 we can clearly see that both the lower and upper bound of the allocated water for municipality increase during the periods while a decrease in the industry for the agricultural sector the allocated water resources varied during different planning horizons two reasons can be included to illustrate the phenomena the first possible reasons for different water allocations are that climatic and landuse variations pose significant influences on future water availability also the living standard s growth and the improvement of water use efficiency may increase the municipality and a decrease in the industry generally the isoms realized the comprehensive regulation among water resources society economy and ecology from the establishment of hydrological model in natural system to the application analysis for social system although the integration framework of climate and landuse projections hydrological model and optimization model was an enormous project it is significant to try and verify the applicability in real world problems li et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 combined with successful applications of integrated simulation optimization framework in previous studies the application with consideration of coupled impacts of climate and landuse variabilities in mountainous area indicates general applicability to other regions for exploration of hydrologic impacts under climate and landuse changes sun et al 2017 zhuang et al 2018 this framework can not only reveal hydrologic variation under multi projections of gcms and landuse effectively but also handle randomness and fuzziness of available water resources and water users systematically as some studies revealed that there may exist nonlinear relationships in real world water resources management systems nonlinear programming models should be extended for dealing with nonlinear problems in the following research zhang and li 2019 results show that climatic change is the dominant factor leading to hydrologic variation which is consistent with previous studies chen et al 2019 a series of adaptive strategies were generated from this framework under changing conditions and the water shortage was related to the available water water demand supply and efficiency li et al 2018 this framework would help provide scientific guidance for random forecast under extreme conditions and provide decision services for adaptive management of water resources under complex changing environment 5 conclusions this study has developed a new framework of integrated simulation optimization modeling system isoms for exploring adaptive strategies of water resources management to climate and landuse change under uncertainty the isoms incorporates four sets of climate projections from 31 gcm ensembles and three sets of landuse scenarios a distributed hydrologic model mike she hydrological model and multi stage flexible stochastic chance constrained programming mfscp model within a framework generally the isoms has several superiorities in comprehensive regulation of water resources under climate and landuse variations i helping identify the changing trend of future climate and landuse projections ii revealing a changing trend of water resources under coupled impacts of climate and landuse iii adequately tackling dynamic uncertainties reflected in water supply and demand benefit and penalty iv identifying adaptive strategies to climatic and landuse variations the results indicate the mike she model has good applicability for hydrological modeling to the mountainous dry warm valley the lstm method would be better for establishing relations among multiple gcms than the traditional method of mmem however there still exists a difficulty in predicting high floating and regular low data for lstm the future temperature projection under rcp4 5 is a little lower than rcp8 5 while the average annual precipitation under rcp4 5 has a greater increase than rcp8 5 especially from june to october the result showed the streamflow variation is more sensitive to climate change than landuse change the simulation results of multiple scenarios simulation show the streamflow variation is more sensitive to climate change than landuse change and the annual runoff increased significantly with the increase of precipitation the study area may face the risk of increased flood in rainy season and increased drought in november presenting new challenges and effective measures should be taken to guarantee environmentally sustainable development for the ethnic neighborhood and downstream cities the optimization model can produce a series of allocated water projects based on water availability and demand under climatic and landuse variations the system uncertainties would lead to significant changes in water resources allocation including water availability and shortage there is a lower water shortage under rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 because of a high streamflow prediction under rcp4 5 a low level of uncertainty satisfaction or a high level of violation risk would reduce the reliability of the water resources system results specify that the isams can help deciders think systematically with diverse options available for supporting in depth and desiring analyses among water resource society economy and ecology generally the developed model provides a successful application for the mountainous area and long term planning horizon indicating general applicability for this framework however lack of measured data is a difficult problem in current hydrological simulation field test data of multi scale and multi process is the premise and guarantee for realizing hydrological simulation and water resource optimal allocation besides nonlinear programming models should be extended for dealing with nonlinear management problems among many system components furthermore hybrid uncertainties from water availability water demand and socioeconomic data would generate a great deal of combinations and more advanced solution techniques are anticipated for further exploring long term optimum proposals under future changing environment credit authorship contribution statement congcong

system isoms approach was developed for assessing adaptive strategies in response to coupled impacts of climate and landuse variations the isoms can not only reflect future hydrological trends under changing environment but also provide water allocation plans under various uncertainties expressed as random or fuzzy feature systematically a case study of anning river basin with dry and warm characteristics in the upper yangtze river was applied to inspect the model s applicability a range of alternatives to adaptive strategies were generated under combinations of climate and landuse scenarios with different satisfaction levels results reveal that i there exist increasing trend of temperature and precipitation in future period 2021 2050 ii the streamflow variation is more sensitive to climate change than landuse change iii the hydrologic system uncertainties would lead to changes in water resources allocation iv a low level of uncertainty satisfaction or a high level of violation risk would reduce the system reliability for the water resources system the isoms approach has tremendous significance for evaluating hydrologic variations with complicated uncertainties and providing optimal water allocation schemes responding to the coupled impacts of climate and landuse variations among society economy and environment keywords climate projection landuse projection hydrological simulation ecology uncertain optimization adaptive management 1 introduction global change incorporating climate and landuse were confirmed to have a significant influence on the hydrological cycle transforming the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability and stability of the ecosystem basheer et al 2016 zarch et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zipper et al 2018 increasing water demand and changing natural environment have caused anabatic water resource conflicts in the context of shrinking water availability subsequently intimidating the sustainability of the environment and human beings andersson et al 2006 thompson et al 2014 wagena et al 2016 water resources management has become a challenging task under changing climate and landuse thus projection of climate and landuse variations and evaluating their impacts on water resources availability can contribute to formulating adaptive strategies or strategic investment for water resources managers rheinheimer et al 2016 reshmidevi et al 2018 however due to the uncertainty of climate and landuse projections and the complexity of the hydrological process it is usually difficult to evaluate the influence of climate and landuse variations moreover there are many uncertain parameters in the water resources system and their interrelationships could be highly complicated li et al 2009a previously numerous explorations and prominent achievements have been developed to deal with the uncertainty in modeling and optimizing water resources systems kotir et al 2016 zhuang et al 2018 for example dessai and hulme 2007 proposed an assessment framework to identify the robustness of adaptation strategies to climate change uncertainties indicating that water resources management strategies are susceptible to uncertainties in the regional climate response kotir et al 2016 constructed an integrated dynamics simulation model to examine the feedback processes and interaction among the sub sectors of water resource population and agricultural production demonstrating that the model is reliable and robust to uncertainties in model inputs structure and parameters generally the researches were mainly about integrating future climate change with hydrological models to evaluate the impacts on hydrology which have already been identified as great challenges for application li et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 due to various uncertainties that existed in the input output and structure of hydrological models many studies integrating with climate and landuse projections were widely adopted to assess the potential influences on hydrological process ha et al 2016 zhuang et al 2018 for instance ahiablame et al 2017 designed several scenarios of landuse and climate patterns for analyzing the corresponding possible streamflow responses in the james river watershed moran tejeda 2015 combined climate and landuse scenarios into two hydrological models for a mountainous watershed and two models have a different sensibility to climate and land cover variations luo et al 2016 quantified the contribution of landuse and climatic variation on the hydrologic process in the heihe river basin and climate change was one of the dominant factors and contributed a sharp increase several studies also revealed that the hydrological process variation was sensitive to climate change than landuse change ji and yuan 2018 chen et al 2019 recently integrated simulation optimization from hydrological modeling of natural system to optimization management of social system has been applied to real world problems zhuang et al 2018 developed an integrated simulation optimization approach for assessing climate change impacts on water resources and results show that the system uncertainties would significantly affect water resources allocation patterns including target and shortage actually the water resources system is a complex problem containing diverse uncertain and dynamic factors in the context of long term prediction the dynamic characteristics are mainly from climatic and lanuse projections the simplification of hydrological model the random character of water availability and the estimated socioeconomic parameters e g water demand net benefits and penalties huang and loucks 2000 asong et al 2016 zhuang et al 2018 nematian 2016 such dynamic uncertainties pose significant challenges to real world hydrological prediction and water resources planning consequently making adaptation strategies under changing environment are particularly problematic as the uncertainties are relevant not merely to climate and landuse projections but also to water availability and demand correspondingly numerous stochastic and fuzzy mathematical programming methods were developed to deal with the uncertainty of water resources management system huang and loucks 2000 loucks et al 2005 multi stage stochastic programming msp is effective in dealing with dynamic uncertainties expressed as probability distributions based on a multi layer scenario tree azaiez 2002 sun et al 2017 the primary advantage of msp is the flexibility in the decision process where deciders can make water supply schemes timely under discrete probability level at each stage li et al 2006 chance constrained programming ccp was usually proposed to settle uncertainties of the right constraints charnes and cooper 1959 du et al 2013 fuzzy mathematical programming fmp was raised for dealing with uncertainty parameters expressed as fuzzy sets while it was challenging to acquire a determined value zadeh 1975 zhuang et al 2018 li and huang 2009a generally the individual fuzzy or stochastic method would not meet the complexities and robustness for water resources management integrating multiple uncertain methods may contribute to water resources optimization fan et al 2016 furthermore previous water resources optimization mainly emphasizes domestic industrial and agricultural water demand without considering ecosystem water demand causing unsustainable development and environmental deterioration additionally as the accumulation effect of bias and downscaling methods would enlarge the uncertainties several studies have found the general circulation model gcm ensembles are superior to the individual gcm for hydrological forecasting zhu et al 2019 reshmidevi et al 2018 it is desired that more innovative methods are developed in propagating uncertainties of hydrologic modeling from climate and landuse projections to the uncertain analysis of water resources therefore the objective of this study is to develop an integrated simulation optimization modeling system isoms approach for exploring multiple adaptive strategies in response to coupled impacts of climate and landuse variations under uncertainty in the isoms framework a cross combination of four climate ensembles based on 31 gcms and three ca markov based landuse projections were utilized as inputs for a distributed hydrological model of mike she to predict the hydrological variations then a multi stage flexible stochastic chance constrained programming mfscp method were integrated to optimize the available water resources a case study of anning river basin arb in the upper yangtze river was applied to inspect how the developed approach made connections from the hydrological model in natural system to the application analysis of social system under changing environment this study is the first attempt to apply a framework with consideration of coupled impacts of climate and landuse variabilities in a mountainous area with strong spatial heterogeneity and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework has general applicability the results can not only improve the accuracy of hydrological forecast by overcoming individual input of changing environment in previous studies but also help decision makers generate resilient water allocation strategies to random interval and fuzzy uncertainties this study is crucial to meet the sustainable development among water resource society economy and ecology in the yangtze river 2 methodology 2 1 framework of isoms for hydrologic modeling and water management to assess adaptive strategies in response to the coupled impacts of climatic and landuse variations the isoms was developed it consists of four components i climatic projections from multi gcms ii landuse projections iii hydrologic modeling and forecasting iv optimization model of multi stage flexible stochastic chance constrained programming mfscp a framework diagram is presented in fig 1 firstly according to the available data the mike she was calibrated with daily streamflow from 1977 to 1983 and then validated for the periods of 1984 1986 and 2006 2007 secondly a deep learning neural network model of long short term memory lstm and traditional multi model ensemble mean mmem methods were adopted to ensemble climate data with 31 gcms and the ca markov based model combined with mce and logisticreg modules were used to project three kinds of landuse projections thirdly we employed four sets of climate data and three sets of landuse projections as inputs to assess the hydrologic variations in the future period 2021 2050 then future supplying water qtk was acquired finally mfscp was developed for allocating available water resources to each water user wit under coupled impacts of climate and landuse variabilities generally the isoms can tackle random qtk and fuzzy variables bit cit in objective function and constraints and evaluate various water release plans under different violation risks qi and α cut levels which will help quantify influences of climate and landuse change and support adaptive strategies for water resources managers 2 2 climate and landuse projections for this research a total of 31 gcms at daily scale for each meteorological station were obtained from liu and zuo 2012 by a statistical downscaling model of nwai wg the data set includes three variables of precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 represents a medium greenhouse gas emission scenario while rcp8 5 represents a high concentration greenhouse gas emission scenario ouyang et al 2015 several studies showed that rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are representative for studying the influence of climatic change on hydrology rogelj et al 2012 since the scale of gcm is much larger than the spatial scale required for hydrology and water resources analysis in the catchment area the climate projection has certain deviations and uncertainties especially for precipitation mehrotra et al 2014 reshmidevi et al 2018 multi gcm ensembles containing multiple model information are proved to be better than a single model which can effectively reduce the bias and uncertainty of future climate output woldemeskel et al 2016 lstm aims to obtain the relationship among long term series data which was proved better than conventional methods hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 therefore this research adopted a traditional mmem method and an advanced lstm method to integrate 31 gcms for improving and comparing the prediction accuracy for this study the lstm was firstly used to build a nonlinearity correlation between downscaled climate data from gcms and historical observation data then the temporal signals and information were detected and propagated by sigmoid function with a multiplication operation to a future period specifically the monthly observed and downscaled climate data precipitation and temperature from 1961 to 2000 were adopted as training dataset to formulate paired dataset and the data from 2001 to 2010 was used for testing then climate projections from 2021 to 2050 would be propagated separately based on the aforementioned developed lstm considering the focus of the article the specific operation process of lstm were not described in this text comparatively the precipitation and temperature from 2021 to 2050 were directly averaged from 31 gcms by mmem as there exist multiple uncertainties in future climatic and hydrological variation these two ensemble methods lstm and mmem were helpful to acquire the general range and stochastic probability distribution of future streamflow through a stochastic process analysis method hu et al 2018 there exist few models to project landuse variation due to the spatial characteristics and diversity of landuse types and the cellular automata ca model markov model and clue s are common methods currently the clue s has wide application for small scale but there exist limits on the number of type and grids wang et al 2018 the ca model can identify the spatial dynamic evolution process for complex systems while the markov model can be used to predict types and transfer rates between different landuse arsanjani et al 2011 a ca markov model assembles the powerful spatial computing ability of ca model and the long term prediction of markov model and has a great advantage for spatial and temporal projections of landuse patterns kamusoko et al 2009 the idrisi software with ca markov module was used to simulate the changes in landuse patterns based on historical landuse data from 1995 2005 and 2015 with transition matrix per decade the specific process can be described as follows i calculate the transition area matrix and transition probability matrix from 1995 to 2005 and 2005 to 2015 ii select altitude slope precipitation temperature rivers roads and population density as the driving factors of landuse change then multi criteria assessment mce and multiple spatial regression logisticreg modules were applied to create transitional adaptability images for each landuse type iii project the landuse change according to the spatial distribution and driving factors in the reference year and the simulation results were compared with actual landuse data of 2015 to validate the reliability finally three landuse projections were acquired according to three methods markov mce and logisticreg and various driving factors afterwards a combination of twelve scenarios under four sets of climate projections and three sets of landuse projections were utilized as inputs for assessing the hydrological trend in future periods under climate and landuse variations 2 3 hydrological modeling as a typical representative of the distributed hydrological model mike she can evaluate the impact of climate and landuse variations on hydrology which has presented strong application potential in humid and arid regions smerdon et al 2009 wijesekara et al 2014 the main difference from other distributed hydrological models e g swat vic and topmoeldel is that researchers can select suitable modules for modeling from mike she based on the available data of climate and geological characteristics thompson et al 2013 by using the observed and downscaled monthly scale data of climate variables as inputs the daily scale streamflow variation of the basin was simulated in the area given the available data the mike she model was calibrated and verified based on measured daily scale streamflow to evaluate its applicability in dry and warm valleys and mountains the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and the correlation coefficient r are usually adopted for assessing the goodness of fit which are both sensitive to the mean and variance for the simulated and measured values the evaluation criteria for nse and r are defined as follows nash and sutcliffe 1970 1a n s e 1 i 1 k q m q s 2 i 1 k q m q m 2 1b r i 1 n q m q m q s q s i 1 n q m q m 2 i 1 n q s q s 2 s s s s s where qm represents observed value qs represents the value of simulation and q m represents the observed average value the closer the values of nse and r to 1 the better the model performance in general the model can be used for calculation when r is great than 0 6 and the simulation results reach a better level while nse ranges between 0 5 and 0 95 legates and mccabe 1999 sun et al 2016 2 4 multi stage flexible stochastic chance constrained programming in the context of long term climate and landuse variations water resources management is confronted with dynamic uncertainties and difficulties consider water resources management s objective is to make water allocation schemes timely under discrete probability level in each stage to maximize the system benefit and minimize losses by identifying optimized water allocation schemes over the planning horizon li et al 2018 xiao et al 2021 such kind of issue can be formulated as an msp which can not only reflect the uncertainties in water allocation problems where interactive and dynamic relationships exist within a multi stage context but also permit revised decisions in each stage gulpinar et al 2002 the msp

and upper bounds of many interval parameters given as subjective information can be expressed as fuzzy sets chen et al 2020 in response to the above concerns fmp was introduced to handle uncertain parameters with unknown membership or distribution functions sun et al 2013 for example the frequently used triangular fuzzy number c under each α cut level i e degree of confidence α 0 1 can be represented as an interval c c 1 α cl αcm 1 α ch αcm an α cut can be defined as a set of elements that belong to a fuzzy set at least to a membership grade of α the above model can reflect the fuzzy uncertainty in constraints and objective functions represents fuzzy inequality among them flexible fuzzy programming can reflect the fuzzy characteristics in the inequality which determines the possible violation of each flexible constraint arfanuzzaman and rahman 2017 according to the flexible programming algorithm proposed by peidro the constraint 2b can thus be reformulated as follows peidro et al 2009 pishvaee and khalaf 2016 3a i 1 i w i t d i t k q t k r i m φ t φ t 3 1 α i t k 3b r i r i m φ t φ t 3 3c φ t r i h r i m 3d φ t r i m r i l to translate the optimization model into a solvable model the ccp method was introduced to solve the right side random variable of constraints within probability at least γi which can be expressed by the following charnes et al 1972 loucks et al 2005 4a pr t i x i γ i i 4b t i x i t q i i t where x i t q i f i t 1 q i ti represents uncertain decision variable an allocation target ti will be met at least γi of the time xi represents random variable γi is the probability level qi i e qi 1 γi is the probability level of violating the constraint x i t q i represents the value of xi that is equaled or exceeded at time t for instance assuming three firms may want to set allocation targets t not expecting to have those targets met 100 of the time to ensure that an allocation target ti of firm i will be met at least γi of the time then the chance constraint can be transformed into a linear constraint with a given probability level based on the flexible fuzzy chance constraint programming methods and the vertex interactive algorithm the mfscp method can effectively solve such complicated management problems cai et al 2018 in the above models model 2 is generally nonlinear and non convex due to joint probabilities with multiple random variables consequently the formulas w it w δ w i t y i t δ w it w it w it and decision variablesy it 0 1 were introduced for the solution correspondingly the above model can be disassembled into upper and lower bound linear sub models as follows huang and loucks 2000 li and huang 2009a 5a m a x f t 1 t i 1 i b i t w i t δ w i t y i t t 1 t i 1 i k 1 k t p t k c i t d i t k

through solving a series of deterministic submodels of mfscp it can make real time decisions based on the realization of random variables and previous decision information at each stage and modify the pre determined water distribution objectives over a multiperiod planning horizon the optimal allocation can be stated to evaluate how water availability shifted under climate and landuse variations will affect water resource management 3 study area and data acquisition 3 1 overview of the study area as a primary tributary of the upper yangtze river there are four counties and cities i e mianning dechang xichang and miyi running through the arb fig 2 it is an ecotone of agriculture animal husbandry in the dry and warm valley with a drainage area of about 11 150 km2 and a mainstream length of 303 km the river drop is 936 m while the gradient is 3 1 arb is surrounded by mountains on three sides forming a high terrain on three sides from east to west and low terrain on the south the annual average precipitation at each station of the basin has little interannual variation but the distribution of precipitation is uneven during the year the precipitation from december to april is less than 10 of the annual average for many years which is the dry season of the basin the heavy rains mostly occur from june to september which accounts for more than 75 of the whole year the rainstorm is characterized by high intensity and short duration as an ecologically fragile region in the upper yangtze river the social and economic activities of arb are relatively concentrated the planning of water conservancy and hydropower projects the construction of large scale irrigation districts and cities have brought increasing uncertainty and difficulties to the systematic management of the basin sun et al 2021 as a specific ecologically degraded area and a substantial agricultural production base in china the influence study of climate and landuse variation on hydrological processes contributes to developing crop systems biological resources and ecological restoration 3 2 data collection the constructed hydrological model and optimization modeling system were adopted to demonstrate the applicability in arb the modeling system requires data incorporating the digital elevation model dem meteorology landuse soil hydrological data available water water supply and demand socioeconomic data etc the specific names and resolution of 31 gcms downscaled by liu were presented in the attached table for the study area daily observed data of three meteorological stations mianning xichang and miyi and one hydrological station wantan were collected from national meteorological center then the thiessen polygon was utilized to interpolate the station based meteorological data into regional data the dem 30m 30 m came from the geospatial data cloud platform the landuse map 30m 30 m was obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform the soil data 1km 1 km was from the world harmonized soil database hwsd then arcgis tools were employed to process the data and convert it into the appropriate format for the mike she model the water supply and demand primarily include four users domestic ecological industrial and agricultural water users the time horizon during 2021 and 2050 was divided into six planning periods i e every five years represents a period through field research expert consultation literature review statistical yearbooks and related websites socioeconomic water and soil data were obtained as shown in table 1 we got the net benefits when water demand was satisfied or the penalty if not satisfied through a comprehensive analysis of watershed planning and public surveys decision makers set the target value and minimum order of different water users in different planning periods firstly table 2 however in real world problems it is often difficult to build a probability distribution for socioeconomic data including benefits penalties water supply and demand due to limited human cognition or inaccurate expression this kind of fuzzy phenomenon can be expressed by the membership grade function in fuzzy mathematics the range of membership grade 0 1 was discretized into a finite number of α cut levels 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 and the fuzzy tolerance measures γ i i e 1 q i in model 4 were assumed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers i e γ i 0 9 0 92 0 95 the water supply data was derived from the predicted streamflow groundwater and red line of the policy reports along with the mean and variance of the calculated water resources monte carlo technology was used for the future six periods the water resources under different climate and landuse scenarios were simulated many times to obtain the cumulative distribution function thus the water resources under different inflow levels and the corresponding probability levels were obtained ecological environmental water demand includes in and outside the river channel according to the spatial location cai et al 2011 li and zhang 2013 the tennant method was utilized to calculate the ecological water demand in the river channel this method is simple and fast and is suitable for any river with seasonal changes for this study 30 of the average annual discharge was taken as a reasonable ecological water demand which can satisfy the water demand of aquatic organisms mainly for fish during the general growth and reproduction period as a whole tennant 1976 part of the ecological water demand outside the river was met by natural precipitation in the process of water resource allocation the amount of ecological water demand that cannot be met by effective rainfall needs to be supplemented by humans the actual evapotranspiration et was acquired from the output result of mike she by two layer uz et model based on empirically derived equations from yan and smith the results showed that the regional precipitation was greater than the actual et which indicated that the natural rainfall could meet the requirements of forestland and grassland no additional allocation was required wan et al 2008 besides the urban ecological water requirement also needs to be considered as a constraint in the process of water resource allocation 4 results and discussion 4 1 future climate and landuse projections as for lstm the training period was determined as 40 years from 1961 to 2000 and for testing was 10 years from 2001 to 2010 the temperature or precipitation of the thirty one gcms from 2021 to 2050 were fed into the developed lstm model to predict the corresponding future temperature or precipitation the mmem was used to obtain the average value of thirty one gcms the r of lstm are all greater than 0 8 in the training and testing periods for every station while r of mmem is about 0 7 and the nse values of lstm are greater than mmem statistics indicate that the lstm method has a strong ability to integrate multiple gcms and can better reflect the climatic changes in the arb over the years the monthly average precipitation and temperature predicted by lstm have a stronger correlation with the overall observation data results show that advanced deep learning methods are more effective than traditional methods in processing time signals misra et al 2018 the developed isoms method was employed to obtain climate projections under a site based scale during the base period 1961 2010 and the future period 2021 2050 fig 3 shows the simulation results and variation tendency of monthly average temperature and precipitation in the future period for the mianning and xichang stations the average annual temperature under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 both rose compared with the historical period 1961 2010 and the latter has an increase of about 1 4 than the former which is consistent with the results predicted in the ipcc5 report the average annual precipitation under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 has increased relative to the historical period and the former has an increase of 1 9 mm than the latter especially for the flood season of june to october for the future period mianning and xichang may face the risk of increasing temperature in dry season and increasing rainfall in rainy season effective measures should be taken to prevent the occurrence of drought and flood disaster the annual average temperature of miyi station has decreased while the annual precipitation has increased compared to the historical period the increased temperature in the watershed will inevitably lead to the rapid melting of glaciers and snow at the headstream of arb and changes in runoff generation mechanisms which will bring new opportunities and challenges to the management and utilization of local water resources especially during the flood season sun et al 2019 the results show that the climate projections vary for different stations which proves that there are differences and uncertainties for the climate change projection at the study area with unique terrain conditions the landuse was mainly divided into five types farmland forestland grassland water body and built up land the forestland has the largest area among these types followed by farmland and grassland the crosstab module in the idrisi software was utilized to compare the projections and actual landuse maps with the kappa coefficients of 0 96 0 89 and 0 91 respectively then the ca markov model was implemented to project landuse changes in 2025 2035 and 2045 table 3 we can see clearly that most of the landuse types decreased except the built up land increased the construction land mainly expanded into three situations of residential industrial and transportation land in the middle and lower reaches the primary shift is from natural types to artificial types which seem reasonable and feasible under the influence of regional economic development population growth and other factors even there is no future evidence to evaluate and verify the projected results all landuse scenarios are possible with the diversification and the complexity of the spatial pattern land conversion there is an urgent need to protect forestland farmland and water body for rational use of land in the future 4 2 future water resource conditions as mentioned above the hydrological model was calibrated and validated by adopting measured daily meteorological data i e temperature and precipitation and landuse data sets as inputs fig 4 presents the daily measured and simulated streamflow in the calibration period 1977 1983 and the validation period 1984 1986 and 2006 2007 for daily simulation the r and nse values were 0 85 and 0 72 respectively in the calibration period while they were 0 87 0 73 and 0 84 0 70 during the two validation periods respectively the two validation periods with corresponding inputs were primarily utilized to inspect the robustness of hydrological model results show that the simulated streamflow by mike she has satisfactory consistency with the observed value which indicates good applicability and strong robustness in the entire mountainous area for the extreme value the simulated streamflow is smaller than the observation at times based on four sets of climate projections and three sets of landuse projections a cross combination of twelve scenarios were utilized as inputs to project the process and trend of streamflow from 2021 to 2050 under the same climate scenario the streamflow changed little for three different landuse scenarios while obvious changes existed under different climate scenarios and the same landuse scenario the comparative results show that streamflow response is more sensitive to climate variation than landuse variation and the dominant factor leading to streamflow variations which is consistent with the previous studies chen et al 2019 the monthly mean streamflow is likely to increase in the rainy season and we should pay attention to prevent the occurrence of flood disasters especially from may to august the streamflow is likely to increase from february to april for the dry season but decrease in november indicating an increased risk of drought in november generally we can also conclude that the annual runoff increased significantly with the increase of precipitation according to the above streamflow prediction from multiple scenarios the available water resources were calculated by combining with the red line of water resources development the random historical data fits the maximum extreme value distribution well through the a d k s and chi square tests along with the mean and variance of the calculated water resources monte carlo technology was used for running 30 000 times to obtain the cumulative distribution function fig 5 thus we have the available water resources under different inflow levels very low low medium high and very high and related occurrence probabilities during six planning periods in arb table 4 in the study system the streamflow were random variables with known probability distributions 4 3 water deficit under uncertain conditions the isoms can help identify a series of optimized water allocation schemes by maximizing the system benefit and minimizing losses under water deficit conditions the interval format of ditk demonstrates the decision variables are sensitive to uncertain input parameters of nit cit and qtk which bring a fundamental change to the overall system li et al 2018 fig 6 visualizes each user sector s water shortage under very low l low lm medium m high mh and very high h levels for different α cut levels fig 6 shows the water shortage under rcp4 5 is lower than rcp8 5 during the same period indicating that the uncertainty arising from climatic scenarios influences future water availability when the streamflow is at a low level there will appear more water shortages moreover climate and landuse variation may bring about extreme droughts at a very low level while present abundant water resources under high flow levels for example there is little water resource scarcity under rcp4 5 at a high flow level especially for the lower bound of water demand during the whole period however there still exists water shortage under the rcp8 5 scenario even at very high flow level water shortage has an interactive correlation with the targeted water and water availability fig 7 presents the variation range of water shortage under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for six planning periods results indicate that diverse climatic scenarios bring about diverse water shortages mean values and variability ranges of water shortages are varied over the planning period for instance the water shortage under rcp4 5 has reduced from period 1 to period six as a whole the risk of water shortage would be decreased with the increase of water use efficiency however there is a greater water shortage during periods 3 4 and 6 under rcp8 5 which may be caused by reducing available water during these periods generally water conflicts in dry periods and regions would be further strengthened 4 4 optimized results of water allocation different water availability and water demand would bring about numerous alternatives under diverse confidence and violation level the adaptive strategies to water users with consideration of ecology are of great significance for the study area which can not only satisfy the ecological water demand but also allocate limited water resources reasonably according to different α cut levels and violation risk a series of solutions about the system benefits and optimal water allocation under plenty of scenarios over the time horizon can be presented in the following figures fig 8 shows the lower and upper bound of the system benefits under different α levels providing a series of beneficial decision schemes concerning system benefits and reliability diverse combinations on water availability water demand and allocation target would bring about various objective values for instance while α 0 5 the system benefit s interval value would be 676 79 835 15 billion under rcp4 5 and 596 02 758 56 billion under rcp4 5 respectively the lower benefits under rcp4 5 compared with rcp8 5 may be resulted from the more water resources shortage though the optimized system benefits vary under different climate scenarios the common trend is that the system benefit s interval is wider under a lower α cut level conversely a narrower interval under a higher α cut level while α 0 there may appear the highest benefit and lowest benefit correspondingly while α 1 the system would receive an increased system certainty decision makers would favor allocating water resources that will carry higher benefits which will lead to a higher violation risk and higher penalties accordingly similarly a higher level of violation risk will bring a higher upper bound of system benefits this change also corresponds to an increase in system risk and a decrease in system reliability fig 9 and fig 10 show the optimal water allocation patterns to the municipality industry and agriculture with α 0 and α 1 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during the planning period respectively we can see that the allocation for the agricultural sector would be first reduced under the premise of meeting the minimum targeted water the allotment for the municipality takes top priority as it can create great benefits and ensure harmonious development otherwise it will bring the highest penalty for the municipal sector and result in disharmony the results represent diverse water allocation projects under different α cut levels for instance for the flow levels under α 0 of rcp4 5 the optimal water allocation for agriculture would be 19 83 19 84 108 m3 19 33 24 61 108 m3 19 42 23 86 108 m3 22 79 27 48 108 m3 22 84 28 23 108 m3 24 86 29 22 108 m3 respectively while α 1 the optimal water allocation for agriculture would be 19 84 108 m3 22 28 22 29 108 m3 22 7 22 71 108 m3 24 65 24 67 108 m3 24 98 24 99 108 m3 26 59 26 6 108 m3 respectively the water allocation range under α 0 is wider than α 1 different water availability under different climate scenarios would also bring about various water allocation plans for rcp8 5 under α 0 the optimal water allocation for agriculture would be 19 84 108 m3 19 33 23 96 108 m3 19 42 108 m3 18 56 108 m3 23 12 28 81 108 m3 13 38 20 16 108 m3 respectively additionally we can also conclude that the optimized water allocation under rcp8 5 is lower than rcp4 5 consequently there would be no water shortage for the municipal sector in most scenarios a lower α cut level would bring about a wider interval for optimized water allocation besides the allocated water projects of industry and agriculture have a strong correlation with streamflow and less water availability may acquire less allotment for further analyzing the water allocation change boxplots of allocated water for each user in the planning horizon were presented fig 11 we can clearly see that both the lower and upper bound of the allocated water for municipality increase during the periods while a decrease in the industry for the agricultural sector the allocated water resources varied during different planning horizons two reasons can be included to illustrate the phenomena the first possible reasons for different water allocations are that climatic and landuse variations pose significant influences on future water availability also the living standard s growth and the improvement of water use efficiency may increase the municipality and a decrease in the industry generally the isoms realized the comprehensive regulation among water resources society economy and ecology from the establishment of hydrological model in natural system to the application analysis for social system although the integration framework of climate and landuse projections hydrological model and optimization model was an enormous project it is significant to try and verify the applicability in real world problems li et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 combined with successful applications of integrated simulation optimization framework in previous studies the application with consideration of coupled impacts of climate and landuse variabilities in mountainous area indicates general applicability to other regions for exploration of hydrologic impacts under climate and landuse changes sun et al 2017 zhuang et al 2018 this framework can not only reveal hydrologic variation under multi projections of gcms and landuse effectively but also handle randomness and fuzziness of available water resources and water users systematically as some studies revealed that there may exist nonlinear relationships in real world water resources management systems nonlinear programming models should be extended for dealing with nonlinear problems in the following research zhang and li 2019 results show that climatic change is the dominant factor leading to hydrologic variation which is consistent with previous studies chen et al 2019 a series of adaptive strategies were generated from this framework under changing conditions and the water shortage was related to the available water water demand supply and efficiency li et al 2018 this framework would help provide scientific guidance for random forecast under extreme conditions and provide decision services for adaptive management of water resources under complex changing environment 5 conclusions this study has developed a new framework of integrated simulation optimization modeling system isoms for exploring adaptive strategies of water resources management to climate and landuse change under uncertainty the isoms incorporates four sets of climate projections from 31 gcm ensembles and three sets of landuse scenarios a distributed hydrologic model mike she hydrological model and multi stage flexible stochastic chance constrained programming mfscp model within a framework generally the isoms has several superiorities in comprehensive regulation of water resources under climate and landuse variations i helping identify the changing trend of future climate and landuse projections ii revealing a changing trend of water resources under coupled impacts of climate and landuse iii adequately tackling dynamic uncertainties reflected in water supply and demand benefit and penalty iv identifying adaptive strategies to climatic and landuse variations the results indicate the mike she model has good applicability for hydrological modeling to the mountainous dry warm valley the lstm method would be better for establishing relations among multiple gcms than the traditional method of mmem however there still exists a difficulty in predicting high floating and regular low data for lstm the future temperature projection under rcp4 5 is a little lower than rcp8 5 while the average annual precipitation under rcp4 5 has a greater increase than rcp8 5 especially from june to october the result showed the streamflow variation is more sensitive to climate change than landuse change the simulation results of multiple scenarios simulation show the streamflow variation is more sensitive to climate change than landuse change and the annual runoff increased significantly with the increase of precipitation the study area may face the risk of increased flood in rainy season and increased drought in november presenting new challenges and effective measures should be taken to guarantee environmentally sustainable development for the ethnic neighborhood and downstream cities the optimization model can produce a series of allocated water projects based on water availability and demand under climatic and landuse variations the system uncertainties would lead to significant changes in water resources allocation including water availability and shortage there is a lower water shortage under rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 because of a high streamflow prediction under rcp4 5 a low level of uncertainty satisfaction or a high level of violation risk would reduce the reliability of the water resources system results specify that the isams can help deciders think systematically with diverse options available for supporting in depth and desiring analyses among water resource society economy and ecology generally the developed model provides a successful application for the mountainous area and long term planning horizon indicating general applicability for this framework however lack of measured data is a difficult problem in current hydrological simulation field test data of multi scale and multi process is the premise and guarantee for realizing hydrological simulation and water resource optimal allocation besides nonlinear programming models should be extended for dealing with nonlinear management problems among many system components furthermore hybrid uncertainties from water availability water demand and socioeconomic data would generate a great deal of combinations and more advanced solution techniques are anticipated for further exploring long term optimum proposals under future changing environment credit authorship contribution statement congcong

288,enhanced weathering ew resulting from soil amendment with highly reactive silicate minerals is regarded as one of the most effective techniques for carbon sequestration while in laboratory conditions silicate minerals dissolution rates are well characterized in field conditions the rate of the dissolution reaction is more difficult to predict not least because it interacts with soil plant and hydrologic processes here we present a dynamic mass balance model connecting biogeochemical and ecohydrological dynamics to shed light on these intertwined processes involved in ew we focus on the silicate mineral olivine for its faster laboratory dissolution rate and pay particular attention to understanding the role of plants and hydrological fluctuations and their propagation into soil biogeochemical processes including cation exchange and ew dynamics a companion paper cipolla et al 2021 presents specific applications with the main purpose of understanding the carbon sequestration potential under different climate scenarios keywords enhanced weathering carbon sequestration climate change 1 introduction to avoid climatic tipping points the ipcc intergovernamental panel on climate change advocates for net zero co 2 emissions by 2030 arneth et al 2019 lenton 2011 achieving such goals might require a combination of low emitting and cdr carbon dioxide removal technologies hartmann et al 2013 generally referred to as climate geoengineering among them ew is considered as one of the most promising however a more in depth knowledge of the interaction and feedbacks among the processes involving hydrology and soil biogeochemistry is necessary for large scales applications in natural environments since co 2 is the reactant of the weathering chemical reaction ew is a negative emission technology taylor et al 2017 ten berge et al 2012 renforth et al 2015 that sequesters atmospheric carbon and stores it in the oceans by leveraging key processes in soil formation whereby primary minerals from the bedrock react with co 2 dissolve and generate secondary minerals because these reactions are mostly effective under hot and humid climates hartmann et al 2013 weil and brady 2017 the presence of soil moisture is crucial to produce high mineral dissolution rates sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 hartmann et al 2013 chemical weathering is also favored by a high soil acidity since h ions are reactants in the weathering reactions hartmann et al 2013 weil and brady 2017 and soil ph in turn is strongly dependent on soil moisture the resulting processes thus form an interestingly intricate dynamical system defined by soil plant conditions and forced by hydro climatic conditions ew is achieved by adding highly reactive minerals such as silicate minerals to the soil hartmann et al 2013 because of its high dissolution rate constant lasaga 1984 and relative abundance forsterite or mg olivine mg 2 sio 4 is one of the best choices ten berge et al 2012 hartmann et al 2013 in general olivine may be a silicate of fe 2 i e fayalite or mg 2 i e forsterite but the latter is the most common choice hartmann et al 2013 renforth et al 2015 ten berge et al 2012 and is the one considered in this study hereafter we will refer to it as olivine based on the reaction stoichiometry the theoretical limit of sequestered co 2 per given amount of olivine is equal to 1 25 g co 2 g oliv ten berge et al 2012 hartmann et al 2013 to increase the exposed surface areas of particles and their dissolution rate olivine is ground to diameters of a few hundred μ m renforth et al 2015 averaging the costs of mining grinding and transport operations köhler et al 2010 report a total cost of about 20 usd per ton of olivine while the overall cost for sequestering co 2 of about 20 usd per ton of sequestered co 2 as an added cobenefit olivine amendment leads to an increase of nutrients availability especially mg 2 and ca 2 thus sustaining plant growth and in turn the weathering reaction itself renforth et al 2015 even if olivine dissolution dynamics in laboratory conditions is quite well known palandri and kharaka 2004 rimstidt 2015 understanding and modeling the olivine dissolution in field conditions is still a challenge especially in relation to the observed reduced dissolution rates white and brantley 2003 to help address this gap renforth et al 2015 and ten berge et al 2012 conducted pot experiments to estimate the olivine weathering rate in soils extracted from agricultural fields they found dissolution rates much lower around 10 11 mol m 2 s 1 than those of laboratory experiments around 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 given the urgency of the problem models can play a very important role for extrapolating results of laboratory and field experiments in both time and space as well as for quantifying the impact of hydroclimatic fluctuations on the involved biogeochemical processes in this paper we present a mathematical model coupling the key ecohydrological and biogeochemical aspects of ew to predict both carbon sequestration and increased nutrient availability in soil water the model consists of interconnected components in terms of related differential equations describing the mass balance and the chemical reactions of the involved elements particular attention is paid to the soil moisture soil ph dynamics their connections to plant growth mccauley et al 2017 as well as the relevance of the cation exchange process and plants uptake release of ions on soil chemistry and weathering rate the long term role of hydrological processes on ew is captured by stochastic rainfall forcing which induces multiple combinations of wetting and drying phases which in time are responsible for the averaged weathering rates the model can be forced with either actual precipitation measurements or with stochastic precipitation for long term simulations e g porporato et al 2003 the main motivation that inspired the development of this model was to understand the long term role of hydrologic i e soil moisture variability coupled to plant organic matter and cation exchange dynamics on olivine weathering in the past reactive transport models have been used to simulate the interactions among plants and soil biogeochemistry taking into account in some cases the ew process taylor et al 2017 in most of the reactive transport models not all these processes are considered at the same time and the demanding numerical constraints of the vertically explicit formulation may limit the time horizon of their simulations the model presented here is an attempt to go beyond these models by explicitly including the interactions between biotic and abiotic soil processes while capturing long term dynamics and climate scenarios uncertainties with explicit inclusion of stochastic hydroclimatic forcing within an agile and relatively parsimonious modeling framework the paper is structured as follows after an introduction to the structure of the model section 2 presents the core of the model with a detailed description of all its components in section 3 a reduced order version of the model is presented section 4 provides the resolution of the model and some applications highlighting the relevance of the wetting and drying phases on olivine weathering rate and the importance of modeling the cation exchange process and plants action on soil chemistry section 5 presents some discussions related to the novelty of this model compared to the existing reactive transport models and discusses some possible future improvements finally in section 6 some conclusions concerning the model and its further applications are drawn cipolla et al 2021 describes specific applications of the model aimed at understanding the role of hydrological processes on olivine ew and provide useful information to guide the development of ew as a natural climate solution 2 modeling scheme the weathering process is strongly influenced by surface hydrological processes fig 1 highlights the main interactions with reference to the main model components where the soil moisture dynamics resulting from the interaction between rainfall soil and vegetation influence soil biogeochemistry i e the organic matter decomposition and the dissolved ions concentration in soil water plants dynamics i e uptake release of ions which in turn regulate ph levels in soil and the olivine weathering rates to account for long term hydrologic variability in present and future climates a probabilistic rainfall description is used where the rainfall characteristics namely the average storm depth and frequency are prescribed for the sake of simplicity the soil and vegetation parameters such as the soil porosity the typical water retention curve parameters the cation exchange capacity parameters and the added litter from vegetation are also given a more detailed description of all the parameters of the model is provided in the companion paper which is specifically devoted to the applications cipolla et al 2021 referring to a unit ground area of homogeneous soil comprising the root zone the processes are resolved typically at a daily time scale a flow chart representative of the model structure is shown in fig 2 the central role of soil moisture on the whole system is clearly evident plants also play a relevant role on weathering since the dissolved ions concentrations are regulated on the base of hydrological fluxes i e leaching and evapotranspiration and plants uptake release of ions the relevance of vegetation on ew and on soil chemistry is further highlighted in section 4 the organic matter component is related to the balance of soil organic carbon which is one of the co 2 sources in the system the dissolved inorganic carbon dic component includes the co 2 in the gas phase and the part of it that reacts with water i e green box within dic the dissolved minerals component is related to all the dissolved elements which do not contain carbon including the products of olivine dissolution i e silicates and mg 2 the cation exchange capacity cec describes the equilibrium exchanges between soil organic and inorganic colloids and the dissolved ions 2 1 olivine weathering reactions and balance the olivine weathering reaction can be written as follows 1 mg 2 sio 4 4 co 2 4 h 2 o 2 mg 2 4 hco 3 h 4 sio 4 or to make the dependence on ph explicit as morel and hering 1993 2 mg 2 sio 4 4 h 2 mg 2 h 2 o h 2 sio 3 according to which one mole of olivine reacts with four moles of h ions and results in two moles of mg 2 and one mole of silicic acid h 2 sio 3 the dissolution rate of olivine particles expressed in number of moles of olivine per unit of reactive surface and per unit of time white and brantley 2003 is a function of soil moisture and ph maher et al 2009 maher 2010 taylor et al 2016 3 w r s p h s k s i l h 1 θ k e q where k s i l is the dissolution rate constant of forsterite lasaga 1984 to represent an average weathering rate at the darcy scale considered here such constant can be calibrated so as to obtain weathering rates of the same order of magnitude as those presented by renforth et al 2015 and ten berge et al 2012 about 10 11 mol m 2 s 1 which are related to soil samples extracted from field the linear dependence between weathering rate and soil moisture s is justified by the fact that soil moisture influences the fraction of surface areas of olivine particles exposed to weathering sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 the dependence between weathering rate and ph is also defined by the ion activity product θ which is the ratio between the product and reactant ions concentrations elevated to their stoichiometric coefficients in the chemical reaction 2 the equilibrium constant of reaction 2 k e q is from morel and hering 1993 4 θ mg 2 1 2 h 2 sio 3 1 4 h to account for the particle size distribution resulting from grinding operations we consider an effective diameter ϕ which can be defined as the mean diameter of a particle size distribution this is consistent with the observation that the difference between the weathering rate integrated to the particle size distribution and the one calculated by only considering a single effective diameter is very low this happens because particles with a diameter larger than the effective diameter are characterized by a higher reactive surface area resulting in a higher ph increase at a certain time step and in a lower weathering rate than the one related to the effective diameter due to the higher ph since an opposite behavior characterizes those particles having a diameter lower than the effective diameter weathering rates of higher and lower particles diameters tend to compensate justifying the adoption of an effective diameter the reduction of the effective diameter can be modeled as the product between the weathering rate and the molar volume of olivine v m lasaga 1984 5 d ϕ d t w r s p h v m 2 2 co 2 source the co 2 that reacts with olivine comes partly from the atmosphere see section 2 3 and partly from the respiration component of the soil organic matter decomposition the latter is linked to mass balance of organic matter as porporato et al 2003 d odorico et al 2003 6 d c d t a d d r d e c where fig 2 a d d is the added carbon e g litterall organic amendment and r d e c is the fraction of decomposed carbon that goes into respiration the a d d term can be either constant or a time series the term d e c is assumed to linearly depend on the carbon concentration in soil c and on the carbon concentration of the microbial biomass c b here assumed constant 7 d e c k d e c f d s c c b where k d e c is a first order kinetic parameter representative of the carbon consumption and f d s is a nondimensional factor expressing the effects of soil moisture on carbon decomposition porporato et al 2003 8 f d s s s f c s s f c s f c s s s f c 2 3 co 2 reactions and balance in water the co 2 in the gas phase quickly reaches equilibrium with the dissolved co 2 in the soil water according to henry s law 9 in general the total concentration of dissolved co 2 defined as h 2 co 3 can be expressed as the product of the henry s constant k h and the partial pressure of co 2 p co 2 the term h 2 co 3 was introduced since only a part of the dissolved co 2 reacts with water and creates the carbonic acid h 2 co 3 as it is expressed by eq 10 9 h 2 co 3 k h p co 2 10 h 2 co 3 h 2 co 3 co 2 a q the balance of gas plus dissolved co 2 in the soil can be written as 11 d co 2 d t r d e c f s r h a d v the input of co 2 in the dic component is the output term of the organic matter component r d e c described in section 2 2 the term f s represents the amount of co 2 released to the atmosphere due to soil respiration r h is the mass flux of co 2 due to the equilibrium of the gas liquid phases while a d v is the advection flux of co 2 meaning the co 2 entering the soil during the drying process and out of the soil during the wetting process according to daly et al 2008 f s can be estimated through the fick s law considering a one dimensional flow 12 f s d co 2 co 2 a t m z r 2 where d is the co 2 diffusivity in the soil while co 2 a t m is the atmospheric co 2 concentration and z r 2 is the average length of the diffusion path d can be evaluated as a function of the air filled porosity which summed to soil moisture equals 1 and the total porosity n riley et al 2011 13 d d 0 1 s 10 3 n 2 where the term d 0 is the free air diffusion coefficient of co 2 the term a d v can be estimated through the following equations 14 a d v n z r d s d t co 2 atm d s d t 0 n z r d s d t co 2 air d s d t 0 during soil drying air with co 2 atm enters the soil pores during wetting part of the soil air at co 2 air concentration is pumped out the system 2 4 differential balance equations of ions in water 2 4 1 carbonate ions and ph balance equations the dic component regulates the time evolution of soil ph and in turn the weathering reaction the carbonic acid produced by the co 2 dissolution rapidly dissociates in its deprotonated forms 15 h 2 co 3 k 1 h hco 3 16 hco 3 k 2 h co 3 2 these two reactions are strictly connected to the weathering reaction 2 since they provide the h ions that react with olivine another source of h ions is the self ionization of water 17 h 2 o k w h oh based on the chemical reactions 15 17 the mass balance equations for the dic system can be written as 18 n z r d s h 2 co 3 d t l h 2 co 3 r 1 r h 19 n z r d s hco 3 d t l hco 3 r 1 r 2 20 n z r d s co 3 2 d t

ph time dynamics the p i plant input term stands for the input concentration of h ions from vegetation while the r i rainfall input term represents the input of h connected to the infiltration rate the term w b g is the background weathering illustrative of the h losses due to naturally present soil minerals excluding olivine while the h losses due to olivine weathering are represented by the term w o l i v the two time derivatives of x h om and x h clay are related to the cation exchanges of dissolved h with soil organic and clay colloids the terms r j of eqs 18 22 are the mass fluxes of the dissolved minerals due to the related chemical reactions the subscripts of the terms r j are the same of those of the equilibrium constants in the corresponding reactions dic ions are all affected by leaching generally written as 23 l x l s s n z r x where x indicates the concentration of the dissolved ion of interest the passive uptake of macro nutrients such as magnesium calcium and potassium and of the micro nutrient sodium is here modeled as proportional to the transpiration rate t s porporato et al 2003 24 u p x t s s n z r x since plants tend to maintain a neutral charge weil and brady 2017 if they take up from the soil water more cations than anions they release h ions to balance the charges the release of plant h can thus be calculated based on the uptake of cations and their corresponding valence as 25 p i 2 u p mg 2 2 u p ca 2 u p k u p na typically rain is characterized by a slightly acidic ph about 5 6 because of the presence of carbonic acid due to the chemical reaction between co 2 and water in the atmosphere rice et al 2007 therefore the term r i can be written as proportional to the dimensionless infiltration rate i s defined by the soil water balance see section 2 5 and to the h concentration at a ph level of 5 6 26 r i i s s n z r 10 5 6 the weathering of all naturally present soil minerals is accounted for in eq 21 by the background weathering w b g the latter groups in a single sink term the consumption of h by the dissolution of various minerals 27 w b g s k b g h a d b g f b g ρ b 1 n z r ρ b g v b g which is proportional to the reactive surface areas of the mineral particles the product between soil moisture s and the geometric surface area of particles a d b g the effective dissolution rate constant k b g the h concentration and the mass of the minerals in the soil which can be estimated for the sake of simplicity as a percentage of the total mass of the soil the effective dissolution rate constant and the geometric surface area should take into account the composition of the soil in particular the minerals contributing more to the consumption of h for example pedogenic carbonate minerals i e mgco 3 and caco 3 can be the dominant h sink in very dry soils due to the low leaching of co 3 2 in this case the effective dissolution rate constant should reflect more the dissolution of carbonates rather than silicates in general w b g is a flexible term that should be calibrated based on the estimated composition of the soil under study the term w o l i v representative of the h loss due to olivine dissolution can be written as 28 w o l i v a ϕ w r m o l i v ρ o l i v v o l i v by writing w r as in eq 3 the product between soil moisture and the geometric surface area of olivine particles is recognized as the reactive surface area as explained by sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 in eq 21 w o l i v is multiplied by a coefficient equal to 4 since one mole of olivine reacts with four moles of h as highlighted in the reaction 2 the last two terms of eq 21 are related to the cation exchanges between soil colloids and solution the cec is a measure of the amount of moles of cations that can be adsorbed on soil colloids due to their negatively charged surface coleman and mehlich 1957 and can be described by the following equilibrium reactions where x and m are two generic cations that are dissolved and adsorbed respectively the terms x and m are the respective charges of the two cations 29 1 x x x 1 m m m c e c o m sc om x m 1 x x x c e c o m 1 m m m 30 1 x x x 1 m m m c e c c l a y sc c l a y x m 1 x x x c e c c l a y 1 m m m the total cec of the soil includes the organic matter c e c o m and the clay components c e c c l a y which represent respectively the exchanges occurring in organic and inorganic sites of the soil better known as organic and clay colloids the first is evaluated as the product between the typical specific cec of organic colloids weil and brady 2017 and the total mass of organic carbon in the soil obtained through eq 6 similarly the c e c c l a y is the product between the typical specific cec of clay colloids and the total mass of clay in the soil fixed as a percentage of the total mass of the soil here we consider explicitly the exchange of h na ca 2 k al 3 and mg 2 because of their widespread presence in soils and because k ca 2 and mg 2 are the most common macro nutrients for plants depending on the exchange processes and particularly on the amount of h adsorbed on soil colloids there is a change in soil ph which influences the olivine weathering reaction we compute the amount of adsorbed ions in the soil sites based on the gapon equation suarez and ŝimunek 1997 which considers equilibrium reactions between dissolved and adsorbed ions and assumes a fixed number of exchanges adsorption sites mau and porporato 2015 with reference to the binary exchange between h and ca 2 one can write the mass of exchanged hydrogen ions in the organic and clay colloids as 31 x h om c e c o m x na om x mg om 2 x k o m x al o m 3 1 1 s c o m h ca 2 h ca 2 1 2 32 x h clay c e c c l a y x na clay x mg clay 2 x k c l a y x al c l a y 3 1 1 s c c l a y h ca 2 h ca 2 1 2 in eqs 31 and 32 the exchanged na k al 3 and mg 2 are subtracted to the c e c o m and c e c c l a y since the portions of colloids occupied by these cations cannot be used for the exchange between h and ca 2 this aspect highlights the competition among all the dissolved ions in this case h ca 2 mg 2 k al 3 and na in the neutralization of the negative charges of soil colloids the terms s c o m h ca 2 and s c c l a y h ca 2 are the binary selectivity constants between h and ca 2 while in square brackets there are the concentrations of dissolved h and ca 2 2 4 2 aluminum hydrolysis and exchange aluminum hydrolysis represents one of the major h sources in acid soils weil and brady 2017 the dissolution of parent materials such as gibbsite releases al 3 ions in soil water that react as 33 al 3 h 2 o al oh 2 h al oh 2 h 2 o al oh 2 h al oh 2 h 2 o al oh 3 h if combined these reactions result in 34 al 3 3 h 2 o r al 3 al oh 3 3 h the balance of al 3 can thus be expressed as 35 n z r d s al 3 d t i al 3 l al 3 r al 3 d x al o m 3 d t d x al c l a y 3 d t where i a l 3 represents the input concentration of al 3 in the system this is related to the dissolution of parent materials and can be expressed through an expression similar to 27 i e as a function of the dissolution rate of the parent material the output of al 3 is related to leaching l al 3 while r al 3 is the mass flux due to the hydrolysis reaction 34 the last two terms of eq 35 are related to the cation exchanges with organic matter and clay colloids the moles of exchanged al 3 per unit mass

the soil these three terms vary according to different time scales for instance the return of cations from vegetation should be linked to the decomposition of the soil litter i e the term dec while the input from minerals should be defined based on the corresponding dissolution rates however because these inputs are small and we are interested in the long term i e the scale of the olivine weathering process they may be grouped in a single constant furthermore mg 2 has an additional input due to the weathering of olivine i e one mole of olivine releases two moles of mg 2 according to reaction 2 for all the ions losses are represented by leaching plant uptake and cation exchange terms the moles of exchanged mg 2 k and na per unit of mass of reactive soil are related by 42 x mg om 2

the sum between the total amount of exchanged ions taken into account in our system 2 4 4 silicates balance equations the silicic acid dissociation depends on ph more specifically if ph is less than 8 silicic acid remains in the form of the undissociated h 2 sio 3 if ph is within the range 8 13 silicic acid deprotonates in the form of hsio 3 while if the ph is higher than 13 the second dissociation occurs and silicic acid will also be in the form of sio 3 2 50 h 2 sio 3 p h 8 h 2 sio 3 k 3 hsio 3 h 8 p h 13 hsio 3 k 4 sio 3 2 h p h 13 the balance of silicates can be written as 51 n z r d s h 2

to the weathering of olivine it reflects the fact that for one mole of olivine that reacts one mole of h 2 sio 3 is produced according to the weathering reaction 2 2 5 soil moisture dynamics soil moisture dynamics for a root zone depth z r is porporato et al 2003 54 n z r d s d t i s t e s t s l s the infiltration rate from rainfall i s t is a function of soil moisture and time and is evaluated as the minimum value among the rainfall depth and the amount of water that can be stored in the soil at a certain soil moisture value rainfall can be obtained from time series or modeled as a marked poisson process in which the frequency of rainfall events is represented by the parameter λ and the mean rainfall depth by the parameter α rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 bare soil evaporation is e s and the transpiration rate t s are evaluated as in porporato et al 2003 the term l s is representative of the leakage losses evaluated as a function of soil moisture through an exponential law which includes the hydraulic conductivity at saturation k s the soil moisture at the field capacity s f c and the pore size distribution index 3 reduced order model the equations representative of the biogeochemical ecohydrological and ew processes constitute a complex system of equations which are partly differential and partly algebraic several of these equations can be combined to obtain a reduced order version of the model in particular analyzing eqs 55 and 56 one can notice that an equation for the total carbon c t is obtained by combining eqs 11 18 19 and 20 55 c d i c h 2 co 3 hco 3 co 3 2 56 c t co 2 air c d i c 57 d c t d t r d e c f s a d v l c d i c which allows us to simplify the equilibrium terms r j and reduce four equations into only one the equilibrium constants of the dissolved inorganic carbon reactions can be written as hartmann et al 2013 58 k h a d h 2 co 3 co 2 air 59 k 1 hco 3 h h 2 co 3 60 k 2 co 3 2 h hco 3 in eq 58 the ratio between the concentration of carbonic acid and the co 2 concentration in the gas phase is the dimensionless henry s constant equal to 0 83 the equilibrium constants of the first and the second order of carbonic acid dissociation are indicated with k 1 and k 2 respectively by combining the expressions 58 60 it is possible to write each element of the dissolved inorganic carbon as a fraction of c d i c stumm and morgan 1995 61 h 2 co 3 α 0 c d i c 62 hco 3 α 1 c d i c 63 co 3 2 α 2 c d i c where the coefficients α 0 α 1 and α 2 depend on ph as shown by the following equations 64 α 0 1 k 1 h k 1 k 2 h 2 1 65 α 1 h k 1 1 k 2 h 1 66 α 2 h 2 k 1 k 2 h k 2 1 1 another important parameter is the alkalinity 67 a hco 3 2 co 3 2 h 3 al 3 oh that considering eqs 61 63 can be written as 68 a c d i c α 1 2 α 2 h 3 al 3 oh since in the mass balance differential equations related to h eq 21 and al 3 eq 35 there are also the cation exchange capacity terms the alkalinity expression can be modified by introducing the total h and al 3 instead of the dissolved h and al 3 defined as the sum between the dissolved and adsorbed moles of h and al 3 in soil colloids 69 h t h x h om x h clay 70 al t 3 al 3 x al o m 3 x al c l a y 3 the expression for the total alkalinity is thus 71 a t c d i c α 1 2 α 2 h t 3 al t 3 oh whose balance equation reads 72 d a t dt l hco 3 2 l co 3 2 ri pi l h l oh w bg 4 w oliv 3 i al 3 3 l al 3 similarly we introduce the total masses of calcium magnesium potassium sodium and aluminum and the corresponding mass balance differential equations 73 ca t 2 ca 2 x ca om 2 x ca clay 2 74 mg t 2 mg 2

take stock and present here a synopsis of the model the time dynamics of the total carbon the total alkalinity and the mass of the total calcium sodium magnesium potassium aluminum and silicates are described by the following mass balance differential equations 84 d c t d t r d e c f s a d v l c d i c d a t d t l hco 3 2 l co 3 2 r i p i l h l oh w b g 4 w o l i v 3 i al 3 3 l al 3 d ca t 2 d t i

here solved in an explicit way with a forward scheme once the initial conditions for c t a t ca t 2 mg t 2 na t k t al t 3 and s i t are fixed the concentration of the considered dissolved ions ca 2 na mg 2 h k al 3 and other individual variables are obtained by solving an implicit algebraic system see appendix a for the derivation the initial condition of the total carbon c t has been defined as the sum of the concentrations of co 2 in the gas phase and of the total dissolved inorganic carbon at the first step eq 56 according to stumm and morgan 1995 c d i c at the first step has been fixed equal to 10 6 mol l 1 this value has also been used to assess the initial concentration of co 2 in the gas phase through eq 58 the total alkalinity a t at the first step has been defined through eq 71 as a function of the initial condition of c d i c h ca 2 na k al 3 and mg 2 eqs 65 and 66 highlight that the terms α 1 and α 2 are a function of h thus of the initial soil ph which as a generic value has been fixed equal to 7 the amount of adsorbed moles of h on organic and clay colloids x h om and x h clay at the first step has been calculated by solving an implicit system constituted by the algebraic equations related to the cec component thus by solving the system a 1 excluding eqs 4 56 58 and 71 solving this algebraic implicit system resulted in the evaluation of x ca om 2 x ca clay 2 x mg om 2 x mg clay 2 x na om x na clay x k om x k clay x al om 3 and x al clay 3 at the first step therefore the initial al t 3 ca t 2 mg t 2 k t and na t have been defined on the base of eqs 70 73 76 with reference to the initial total silicon in the system a basic value of 10 11 mol l 1 has been set a schematic representation of the numerical resolution of the model is provided in fig 3 at each time step after solving the soil water balance forced with a stochastic rainfall the output soil moisture infiltration leaching and evapotranspiration rates are coupled to the organic carbon balance to obtain the decomposition rate and organic carbon concentration for the sake of simplicity the characteristics of vegetation are considered fixed in time thus the amount of litter added to the soil a d d is assumed as constant under a certain climate scenario fixed values of α and λ the output variables of these two balances are used to solve the explicit system once the initial conditions are fixed the explicit system is firstly solved and its output variables namely c t a t ca t 2 na t mg t 2 k t al t 3 and si t can be passed to the implicit algebraic system a 1 once the implicit system is solved some of its output variables such as the dissolved ions concentrations can be used to solve the explicit system at the next time step since it is solved with a forward scheme this goes on until the simulation end time is reached it is worth recalling that the explicit system can be solved independently from the implicit one indeed the resolution of the implicit part of the model can be carried out to obtain the time series of individual variables not combined such as those of ph mg 2 na k al 3 and ca 2 that are very useful to see the effects of olivine on soil chemistry which could reflect on land management the time series of hco 3 and co 3 2 are very relevant as well since they can be used to calculate the mass of carbon translated into the equivalent mass of co 2 on the base of the mass of carbon contained in a unit mass of co 2 which is sequestered by olivine in a certain amount of time 4 1 the role of wetness on weathering rate to shed light on the importance of soil moisture plants and cec on weathering we analyzed the time series resulting from numerical solutions of the model while here we consider more general characteristics more specific applications will be presented in cipolla et al 2021 a first important result shown in fig 4 is that the relationship between olivine weathering rate and soil moisture is not single valued this is due to the nonlinearities in the relationship between soil moisture and soil biogeochemistry i e the soil water balance and the implicit system of eq a 1 the non linear relationship between weathering rate and soil moisture fig 4 reflects a typical hysteretic behavior fig 4a displays a time series of soil moisture and fig 4b the corresponding time series of ph fig 4c shows the related olivine weathering rate while the pattern of weathering rate with soil moisture with some grey arrows representative of the trajectories is plotted in fig 4d the hysteretic pattern of weathering rate with soil moisture highlights that the process maintains a memory of past events such as the drying and wetting events for a single soil moisture value there are two or more different weathering rate values the lower ones related to the wetting period and the higher ones related to the drying one this confirms that wetness is one of the most relevant factors controlling soil biogeochemistry and in turn weathering rate calabrese et al 2017 calabrese and porporato 2020 4 2 the role of cation exchange processes on ew as it can be seen from the previous sections the cation exchange plays an important role in the model depending on the equilibrium reactions regulating the exchanges between the dissolved ions in soil water and those adsorbed on soil colloids 29 30 significant variations in soil ph can be expected in turn impacting the olivine weathering rate to understand the role of the cation exchange process on ew it was instructive to look at the one year time series of soil water ph of the sum of ca 2 mg 2 na and k concentrations indicated for brevity as nutrients and of weathering rate for three different cation exchange capacity levels the first one indicated as no cec represents the condition in which cec effects are negligible the other one represents a typical cation exchange value see e g weil and brady 2017 indicated as cec and the last one named as double cec represents an exceptionally high cation exchange capacity in this last case the cec parameters values are the double of those presented in weil and brady 2017 related to the cec scenario as seen in fig 5 b in correspondence of the high values of the nutrients concentration in soil water under the no cec level approximately from day 200 to 365 there is a strong adsorption process as long as the cation exchange process is included which becomes more relevant as the cation exchange capacity level increases this happens because the cation exchanges are regulated by equilibrium reactions thus if the concentration of dissolved ions is high the adsorption process will be strong on the other hand in correspondence of the low values of the dissolved ions concentration under the no cec level there is a weak adsorption of cations on soil colloids resulting in a higher concentration in soil water the same aspect can be found for the ph time series fig 5a the ph variations due to different cec levels reflect on weathering rate fig 5c indeed especially in correspondence of minimum ph values e g approximately from day 30 to 90 a greater cec results in a ph reduction hence in a more accentuated peak of weathering rate all these aspects show the importance of a dynamical model which explicitly takes into account the cation exchange processes the effects of these exchanges regulated by equilibrium reactions on soil biogeochemistry and in turn on ew dynamics become prominent over long time scales as they amplificate due to the nonlinearities 4 3 the role of plants on soil biogeochemistry affecting ew plants take up magnesium calcium potassium and sodium from soil water as common important nutrients in order to maintain a neutral balance the excess of cation uptake is counteracted by a release of hydrogen ions in soil water increasing soil water ph to highlight the importance of this process in soil biogeochemical dynamics a comparison of ph weathering rate and nutrients concentration time series with and without plants uptake release of ions is provided in fig 6 without plants uptake the nutrients concentration in soil water is generally higher and less variable than in the case where the nutrients uptake is taken into account in the latter case the greater variability can be explained by the fact that the uptake is proportional to the transpiration rate whose variability is inherited from rainfall consequently without the release of hydrogen ions soil ph is generally higher this affects olivine weathering rate since higher ph values correspond to lower weathering rates these aspects clearly demonstrate the importance of correctly capturing the plants uptake release of ions when modeling ew applications 5 discussions the inclusion of soil moisture plant and soil organic matter nutrient interactions in a biogeochemical ew model provides a novel perspective on the key processes controlling the dissolution dynamics of olivine in field conditions the resulting mathematical model constituted by a system of eight differential equations and an implicit algebraic system consisting of twenty two equations simultaneously considers stochasticity in soil moisture time dynamics of organic matter decomposition and soil chemistry soil cation exchange capacity olivine dissolution and co 2 consumption to highlight the fundamental interactions between water soil chemistry and plants ew was investigated in somewhat idealized conditions simplifying assumptions related to constant properties of rainfall soil and vegetation can be easily relaxed detailed applications will be presented in cipolla et al 2021 the model can be extended in several directions in this study only the most common macro nutrients for plants namely mg 2 k and the micro nutrient na have been taken into account however the model can be expanded to include the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles e g porporato et al 2003 d odorico et al 2003 in fact a significant percentage of global natural land area is nitrogen and phosphorus limited du et al 2020 and the demand of nitrogen and phosphorus is generally considered to be high on a stoichiometric basis the carbon module of the model assumes a simple balance between an input of carbon from vegetation and a first order decomposition term with constant carbon concentration in the biomass pool more detailed carbon models can be analyzed and considered for example the recent non linear microbial models may be used to couple microbial biomass extracellular enzymes and carbon substrate pools and take into account variations in the microbial carbon use efficiency in response to environmental conditions wieder et al 2015 however even if non linear decomposition models may be more detailed over short time scales simple linear parameterizations may be more suitable when considering long timescales manzoni and porporato 2009 one important source of uncertainty in ew is related to the estimation of weathering rates in the field for instance in the laboratory water quality and water mineral contacts are well controlled whereas in the field their characterization is rather difficult additionally mineral weathering can be accelerated or slowed down by bacteria and fungi uroz et al 2009 bonneville et al 2009 a process that remains largely unexplored in both lab and field settings here we calibrated the rate constant based on renforth et al 2015 in order to obtain a realistic order of magnitude for the weathering rates however further work in this direction is needed from both the experimental and modeling fronts to improve estimates of field reaction rates another source of uncertainty that affects the estimation of field weathering rate is connected to the distribution of olivine particles diameter resulting from the grinding operation in our model we considered a single effective diameter mainly for the sake of simplicity in fact tracking the actual evolution of particle size distributions would considerably increase the complexity and computational cost of the model as an illustration we show in fig 7 how different particle diameters affect olivine weathering rate considering three particle sizes based on the particle size distribution of renforth et al 2015 as the particle size decreases the weathering rate tends to increase at a quadratic rate due to its quadratic relationship with the specific surface area see eq 28 while it is tempting to use small particle sizes one should bear in mind that reducing particle size leads to higher grinding costs and co 2 emissions i e greater amount of energy needed to grind particles to a smaller size in view of practical ew applications a balance between these factors is fundamental to ensure that the carbon sink of ew more than compensates for the co 2 emissions and that the intervention is cost effective it would also be important to analyze the role of temporal e g seasonal and interannual variability of the rainfall forcing and vegetation dynamics e g litter and potential transpiration rate in agroecosystems for example crop growth and harvest should be taken into account including how they affect nutrient cycling other land management practices e g organic amendment via manure or compost should also be analyzed in terms of its synergies with ew several components considered here could be included in reactive transport models for example the apsim model keating et al 2003 simulates at a site scale crop growth soil organic matter ph time dynamics and soil water balance however it does not consider the cation exchange capacity and all the weathering processes of the naturally present minerals in soil the sheffield model taylor et al 2016 instead is able to simulate at a global scale the co 2 consumption for ew and the soil chemistry dynamics also taking into account the effects of ew on ocean acidification however due to the spatial scale of interest it does not consider crop growth and cation exchange processes our model considers the cation exchange processes which are very important in the evaluation of the dissolved ions concentrations in soil water and is also able to calculate the net sink of co 2 from a certain mass of added olivine at a site scale it considers unpredictable variability in soil moisture in the form of a stochastic process this is fundamental to understand the role of hydrological variability on ew as our results showed the interaction between these processes largely controls the trajectory of olivine dissolution over time and if not accounted for uncertainties and errors may amplify over time due to nonlinearities in the relationship between hydrology soil biogeochemistry and plants 6 conclusions this paper presents a model that couples biogeochemical and ecohydrological processes involved in the weathering process of olivine placing special attention to field conditions the main scope of the model is to simulate the dynamics of olivine weathering rate within a vegetated soil and to understand co 2 sequestration potential of ew the model is structured in different interconnected components and the resulting scheme consists of an explicit system of eight mass balance total differential equations and an implicit part with twenty two algebraic equations in twenty two unknown variables the model stresses the pivotal role of hydrology on the soil biogeochemistry plants dynamics and in turn the olivine weathering rate we also paid particular attention to the time dynamics of soil water ph both with and without olivine since this is an important parameter for many aspects such as the dissolved ions concentration dynamics and the suitability of the environment for plants the results highlight how the dependence between weathering rate and soil moisture is characterized by a hysteretic behavior due to nonlinearities and memory effects and that cation exchange and plants uptake release of ions processes which are not always included in the existing reactive transport models exert a strong control on olivine weathering rates cipolla et al 2021 describes a first application of the proposed model to evaluate olivine dissolution dynamics and its effects on carbon sequestration under different climate scenarios and land carbon managements e g organic amendment credit authorship

288,enhanced weathering ew resulting from soil amendment with highly reactive silicate minerals is regarded as one of the most effective techniques for carbon sequestration while in laboratory conditions silicate minerals dissolution rates are well characterized in field conditions the rate of the dissolution reaction is more difficult to predict not least because it interacts with soil plant and hydrologic processes here we present a dynamic mass balance model connecting biogeochemical and ecohydrological dynamics to shed light on these intertwined processes involved in ew we focus on the silicate mineral olivine for its faster laboratory dissolution rate and pay particular attention to understanding the role of plants and hydrological fluctuations and their propagation into soil biogeochemical processes including cation exchange and ew dynamics a companion paper cipolla et al 2021 presents specific applications with the main purpose of understanding the carbon sequestration potential under different climate scenarios keywords enhanced weathering carbon sequestration climate change 1 introduction to avoid climatic tipping points the ipcc intergovernamental panel on climate change advocates for net zero co 2 emissions by 2030 arneth et al 2019 lenton 2011 achieving such goals might require a combination of low emitting and cdr carbon dioxide removal technologies hartmann et al 2013 generally referred to as climate geoengineering among them ew is considered as one of the most promising however a more in depth knowledge of the interaction and feedbacks among the processes involving hydrology and soil biogeochemistry is necessary for large scales applications in natural environments since co 2 is the reactant of the weathering chemical reaction ew is a negative emission technology taylor et al 2017 ten berge et al 2012 renforth et al 2015 that sequesters atmospheric carbon and stores it in the oceans by leveraging key processes in soil formation whereby primary minerals from the bedrock react with co 2 dissolve and generate secondary minerals because these reactions are mostly effective under hot and humid climates hartmann et al 2013 weil and brady 2017 the presence of soil moisture is crucial to produce high mineral dissolution rates sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 hartmann et al 2013 chemical weathering is also favored by a high soil acidity since h ions are reactants in the weathering reactions hartmann et al 2013 weil and brady 2017 and soil ph in turn is strongly dependent on soil moisture the resulting processes thus form an interestingly intricate dynamical system defined by soil plant conditions and forced by hydro climatic conditions ew is achieved by adding highly reactive minerals such as silicate minerals to the soil hartmann et al 2013 because of its high dissolution rate constant lasaga 1984 and relative abundance forsterite or mg olivine mg 2 sio 4 is one of the best choices ten berge et al 2012 hartmann et al 2013 in general olivine may be a silicate of fe 2 i e fayalite or mg 2 i e forsterite but the latter is the most common choice hartmann et al 2013 renforth et al 2015 ten berge et al 2012 and is the one considered in this study hereafter we will refer to it as olivine based on the reaction stoichiometry the theoretical limit of sequestered co 2 per given amount of olivine is equal to 1 25 g co 2 g oliv ten berge et al 2012 hartmann et al 2013 to increase the exposed surface areas of particles and their dissolution rate olivine is ground to diameters of a few hundred μ m renforth et al 2015 averaging the costs of mining grinding and transport operations köhler et al 2010 report a total cost of about 20 usd per ton of olivine while the overall cost for sequestering co 2 of about 20 usd per ton of sequestered co 2 as an added cobenefit olivine amendment leads to an increase of nutrients availability especially mg 2 and ca 2 thus sustaining plant growth and in turn the weathering reaction itself renforth et al 2015 even if olivine dissolution dynamics in laboratory conditions is quite well known palandri and kharaka 2004 rimstidt 2015 understanding and modeling the olivine dissolution in field conditions is still a challenge especially in relation to the observed reduced dissolution rates white and brantley 2003 to help address this gap renforth et al 2015 and ten berge et al 2012 conducted pot experiments to estimate the olivine weathering rate in soils extracted from agricultural fields they found dissolution rates much lower around 10 11 mol m 2 s 1 than those of laboratory experiments around 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 given the urgency of the problem models can play a very important role for extrapolating results of laboratory and field experiments in both time and space as well as for quantifying the impact of hydroclimatic fluctuations on the involved biogeochemical processes in this paper we present a mathematical model coupling the key ecohydrological and biogeochemical aspects of ew to predict both carbon sequestration and increased nutrient availability in soil water the model consists of interconnected components in terms of related differential equations describing the mass balance and the chemical reactions of the involved elements particular attention is paid to the soil moisture soil ph dynamics their connections to plant growth mccauley et al 2017 as well as the relevance of the cation exchange process and plants uptake release of ions on soil chemistry and weathering rate the long term role of hydrological processes on ew is captured by stochastic rainfall forcing which induces multiple combinations of wetting and drying phases which in time are responsible for the averaged weathering rates the model can be forced with either actual precipitation measurements or with stochastic precipitation for long term simulations e g porporato et al 2003 the main motivation that inspired the development of this model was to understand the long term role of hydrologic i e soil moisture variability coupled to plant organic matter and cation exchange dynamics on olivine weathering in the past reactive transport models have been used to simulate the interactions among plants and soil biogeochemistry taking into account in some cases the ew process taylor et al 2017 in most of the reactive transport models not all these processes are considered at the same time and the demanding numerical constraints of the vertically explicit formulation may limit the time horizon of their simulations the model presented here is an attempt to go beyond these models by explicitly including the interactions between biotic and abiotic soil processes while capturing long term dynamics and climate scenarios uncertainties with explicit inclusion of stochastic hydroclimatic forcing within an agile and relatively parsimonious modeling framework the paper is structured as follows after an introduction to the structure of the model section 2 presents the core of the model with a detailed description of all its components in section 3 a reduced order version of the model is presented section 4 provides the resolution of the model and some applications highlighting the relevance of the wetting and drying phases on olivine weathering rate and the importance of modeling the cation exchange process and plants action on soil chemistry section 5 presents some discussions related to the novelty of this model compared to the existing reactive transport models and discusses some possible future improvements finally in section 6 some conclusions concerning the model and its further applications are drawn cipolla et al 2021 describes specific applications of the model aimed at understanding the role of hydrological processes on olivine ew and provide useful information to guide the development of ew as a natural climate solution 2 modeling scheme the weathering process is strongly influenced by surface hydrological processes fig 1 highlights the main interactions with reference to the main model components where the soil moisture dynamics resulting from the interaction between rainfall soil and vegetation influence soil biogeochemistry i e the organic matter decomposition and the dissolved ions concentration in soil water plants dynamics i e uptake release of ions which in turn regulate ph levels in soil and the olivine weathering rates to account for long term hydrologic variability in present and future climates a probabilistic rainfall description is used where the rainfall characteristics namely the average storm depth and frequency are prescribed for the sake of simplicity the soil and vegetation parameters such as the soil porosity the typical water retention curve parameters the cation exchange capacity parameters and the added litter from vegetation are also given a more detailed description of all the parameters of the model is provided in the companion paper which is specifically devoted to the applications cipolla et al 2021 referring to a unit ground area of homogeneous soil comprising the root zone the processes are resolved typically at a daily time scale a flow chart representative of the model structure is shown in fig 2 the central role of soil moisture on the whole system is clearly evident plants also play a relevant role on weathering since the dissolved ions concentrations are regulated on the base of hydrological fluxes i e leaching and evapotranspiration and plants uptake release of ions the relevance of vegetation on ew and on soil chemistry is further highlighted in section 4 the organic matter component is related to the balance of soil organic carbon which is one of the co 2 sources in the system the dissolved inorganic carbon dic component includes the co 2 in the gas phase and the part of it that reacts with water i e green box within dic the dissolved minerals component is related to all the dissolved elements which do not contain carbon including the products of olivine dissolution i e silicates and mg 2 the cation exchange capacity cec describes the equilibrium exchanges between soil organic and inorganic colloids and the dissolved ions 2 1 olivine weathering reactions and balance the olivine weathering reaction can be written as follows 1 mg 2 sio 4 4 co 2 4 h 2 o 2 mg 2 4 hco 3 h 4 sio 4 or to make the dependence on ph explicit as morel and hering 1993 2 mg 2 sio 4 4 h 2 mg 2 h 2 o h 2 sio 3 according to which one mole of olivine reacts with four moles of h ions and results in two moles of mg 2 and one mole of silicic acid h 2 sio 3 the dissolution rate of olivine particles expressed in number of moles of olivine per unit of reactive surface and per unit of time white and brantley 2003 is a function of soil moisture and ph maher et al 2009 maher 2010 taylor et al 2016 3 w r s p h s k s i l h 1 θ k e q where k s i l is the dissolution rate constant of forsterite lasaga 1984 to represent an average weathering rate at the darcy scale considered here such constant can be calibrated so as to obtain weathering rates of the same order of magnitude as those presented by renforth et al 2015 and ten berge et al 2012 about 10 11 mol m 2 s 1 which are related to soil samples extracted from field the linear dependence between weathering rate and soil moisture s is justified by the fact that soil moisture influences the fraction of surface areas of olivine particles exposed to weathering sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 the dependence between weathering rate and ph is also defined by the ion activity product θ which is the ratio between the product and reactant ions concentrations elevated to their stoichiometric coefficients in the chemical reaction 2 the equilibrium constant of reaction 2 k e q is from morel and hering 1993 4 θ mg 2 1 2 h 2 sio 3 1 4 h to account for the particle size distribution resulting from grinding operations we consider an effective diameter ϕ which can be defined as the mean diameter of a particle size distribution this is consistent with the observation that the difference between the weathering rate integrated to the particle size distribution and the one calculated by only considering a single effective diameter is very low this happens because particles with a diameter larger than the effective diameter are characterized by a higher reactive surface area resulting in a higher ph increase at a certain time step and in a lower weathering rate than the one related to the effective diameter due to the higher ph since an opposite behavior characterizes those particles having a diameter lower than the effective diameter weathering rates of higher and lower particles diameters tend to compensate justifying the adoption of an effective diameter the reduction of the effective diameter can be modeled as the product between the weathering rate and the molar volume of olivine v m lasaga 1984 5 d ϕ d t w r s p h v m 2 2 co 2 source the co 2 that reacts with olivine comes partly from the atmosphere see section 2 3 and partly from the respiration component of the soil organic matter decomposition the latter is linked to mass balance of organic matter as porporato et al 2003 d odorico et al 2003 6 d c d t a d d r d e c where fig 2 a d d is the added carbon e g litterall organic amendment and r d e c is the fraction of decomposed carbon that goes into respiration the a d d term can be either constant or a time series the term d e c is assumed to linearly depend on the carbon concentration in soil c and on the carbon concentration of the microbial biomass c b here assumed constant 7 d e c k d e c f d s c c b where k d e c is a first order kinetic parameter representative of the carbon consumption and f d s is a nondimensional factor expressing the effects of soil moisture on carbon decomposition porporato et al 2003 8 f d s s s f c s s f c s f c s s s f c 2 3 co 2 reactions and balance in water the co 2 in the gas phase quickly reaches equilibrium with the dissolved co 2 in the soil water according to henry s law 9 in general the total concentration of dissolved co 2 defined as h 2 co 3 can be expressed as the product of the henry s constant k h and the partial pressure of co 2 p co 2 the term h 2 co 3 was introduced since only a part of the dissolved co 2 reacts with water and creates the carbonic acid h 2 co 3 as it is expressed by eq 10 9 h 2 co 3 k h p co 2 10 h 2 co 3 h 2 co 3 co 2 a q the balance of gas plus dissolved co 2 in the soil can be written as 11 d co 2 d t r d e c f s r h a d v the input of co 2 in the dic component is the output term of the organic matter component r d e c described in section 2 2 the term f s represents the amount of co 2 released to the atmosphere due to soil respiration r h is the mass flux of co 2 due to the equilibrium of the gas liquid phases while a d v is the advection flux of co 2 meaning the co 2 entering the soil during the drying process and out of the soil during the wetting process according to daly et al 2008 f s can be estimated through the fick s law considering a one dimensional flow 12 f s d co 2 co 2 a t m z r 2 where d is the co 2 diffusivity in the soil while co 2 a t m is the atmospheric co 2 concentration and z r 2 is the average length of the diffusion path d can be evaluated as a function of the air filled porosity which summed to soil moisture equals 1 and the total porosity n riley et al 2011 13 d d 0 1 s 10 3 n 2 where the term d 0 is the free air diffusion coefficient of co 2 the term a d v can be estimated through the following equations 14 a d v n z r d s d t co 2 atm d s d t 0 n z r d s d t co 2 air d s d t 0 during soil drying air with co 2 atm enters the soil pores during wetting part of the soil air at co 2 air concentration is pumped out the system 2 4 differential balance equations of ions in water 2 4 1 carbonate ions and ph balance equations the dic component regulates the time evolution of soil ph and in turn the weathering reaction the carbonic acid produced by the co 2 dissolution rapidly dissociates in its deprotonated forms 15 h 2 co 3 k 1 h hco 3 16 hco 3 k 2 h co 3 2 these two reactions are strictly connected to the weathering reaction 2 since they provide the h ions that react with olivine another source of h ions is the self ionization of water 17 h 2 o k w h oh based on the chemical reactions 15 17 the mass balance equations for the dic system can be written as 18 n z r d s h 2 co 3 d t l h 2 co 3 r 1 r h 19 n z r d s hco 3 d t l hco 3 r 1 r 2 20 n z r d s co 3 2 d t

ph time dynamics the p i plant input term stands for the input concentration of h ions from vegetation while the r i rainfall input term represents the input of h connected to the infiltration rate the term w b g is the background weathering illustrative of the h losses due to naturally present soil minerals excluding olivine while the h losses due to olivine weathering are represented by the term w o l i v the two time derivatives of x h om and x h clay are related to the cation exchanges of dissolved h with soil organic and clay colloids the terms r j of eqs 18 22 are the mass fluxes of the dissolved minerals due to the related chemical reactions the subscripts of the terms r j are the same of those of the equilibrium constants in the corresponding reactions dic ions are all affected by leaching generally written as 23 l x l s s n z r x where x indicates the concentration of the dissolved ion of interest the passive uptake of macro nutrients such as magnesium calcium and potassium and of the micro nutrient sodium is here modeled as proportional to the transpiration rate t s porporato et al 2003 24 u p x t s s n z r x since plants tend to maintain a neutral charge weil and brady 2017 if they take up from the soil water more cations than anions they release h ions to balance the charges the release of plant h can thus be calculated based on the uptake of cations and their corresponding valence as 25 p i 2 u p mg 2 2 u p ca 2 u p k u p na typically rain is characterized by a slightly acidic ph about 5 6 because of the presence of carbonic acid due to the chemical reaction between co 2 and water in the atmosphere rice et al 2007 therefore the term r i can be written as proportional to the dimensionless infiltration rate i s defined by the soil water balance see section 2 5 and to the h concentration at a ph level of 5 6 26 r i i s s n z r 10 5 6 the weathering of all naturally present soil minerals is accounted for in eq 21 by the background weathering w b g the latter groups in a single sink term the consumption of h by the dissolution of various minerals 27 w b g s k b g h a d b g f b g ρ b 1 n z r ρ b g v b g which is proportional to the reactive surface areas of the mineral particles the product between soil moisture s and the geometric surface area of particles a d b g the effective dissolution rate constant k b g the h concentration and the mass of the minerals in the soil which can be estimated for the sake of simplicity as a percentage of the total mass of the soil the effective dissolution rate constant and the geometric surface area should take into account the composition of the soil in particular the minerals contributing more to the consumption of h for example pedogenic carbonate minerals i e mgco 3 and caco 3 can be the dominant h sink in very dry soils due to the low leaching of co 3 2 in this case the effective dissolution rate constant should reflect more the dissolution of carbonates rather than silicates in general w b g is a flexible term that should be calibrated based on the estimated composition of the soil under study the term w o l i v representative of the h loss due to olivine dissolution can be written as 28 w o l i v a ϕ w r m o l i v ρ o l i v v o l i v by writing w r as in eq 3 the product between soil moisture and the geometric surface area of olivine particles is recognized as the reactive surface area as explained by sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 in eq 21 w o l i v is multiplied by a coefficient equal to 4 since one mole of olivine reacts with four moles of h as highlighted in the reaction 2 the last two terms of eq 21 are related to the cation exchanges between soil colloids and solution the cec is a measure of the amount of moles of cations that can be adsorbed on soil colloids due to their negatively charged surface coleman and mehlich 1957 and can be described by the following equilibrium reactions where x and m are two generic cations that are dissolved and adsorbed respectively the terms x and m are the respective charges of the two cations 29 1 x x x 1 m m m c e c o m sc om x m 1 x x x c e c o m 1 m m m 30 1 x x x 1 m m m c e c c l a y sc c l a y x m 1

inorganic sites of the soil better known as organic and clay colloids the first is evaluated as the product between the typical specific cec of organic colloids weil and brady 2017 and the total mass of organic carbon in the soil obtained through eq 6 similarly the c e c c l a y is the product between the typical specific cec of clay colloids and the total mass of clay in the soil fixed as a percentage of the total mass of the soil here we consider explicitly the exchange of h na ca 2 k al 3 and mg 2 because of their widespread presence in soils and because k ca 2 and mg 2 are the most common macro nutrients for plants depending on the exchange processes and particularly on the amount of h adsorbed on soil colloids there is a change in soil ph which influences the olivine weathering reaction we compute the amount of adsorbed ions in the soil sites based on the gapon equation suarez and ŝimunek 1997 which considers equilibrium reactions between dissolved and adsorbed ions and assumes a fixed number of exchanges adsorption sites mau and porporato 2015 with reference to the binary exchange between h and ca 2 one can write the mass of exchanged hydrogen ions in the organic

exchange between h and ca 2 this aspect highlights the competition among all the dissolved ions in this case h ca 2 mg 2 k al 3 and na in the neutralization of the negative charges of soil colloids the terms s c o m h ca 2 and s c c l a y h ca 2 are the binary selectivity constants between h and ca 2 while in square brackets there are the concentrations of dissolved h and ca 2 2 4 2 aluminum

the input from minerals should be defined based on the corresponding dissolution rates however because these inputs are small and we are interested in the long term i e the scale of the olivine weathering process they may be grouped in a single constant furthermore mg 2 has an additional input due to the weathering of olivine i e one mole of olivine releases two moles of mg 2 according to

silicic acid remains in the form of the undissociated h 2 sio 3 if ph is within the range 8 13 silicic acid deprotonates in the form of hsio 3 while if the ph is higher than 13 the second dissociation

moisture dynamics for a root zone depth z r is porporato et al 2003 54 n z r d s d t i s t e s t s l s the infiltration rate from rainfall i s t is a function of soil moisture and time and is evaluated as the minimum value among the rainfall depth and the amount of water that can be stored in the soil at a certain soil moisture value rainfall can be obtained from time series or modeled as a marked poisson process in which the frequency of rainfall events is represented by the parameter λ and the mean rainfall depth by the parameter α rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 bare soil evaporation is e s and the transpiration rate t s are evaluated as in porporato et al 2003 the term l s is representative of the leakage losses evaluated as a function of soil moisture through an exponential law which includes the hydraulic conductivity at saturation k s the soil moisture at the field capacity s f c and the pore size distribution index 3 reduced order model the equations representative of the biogeochemical ecohydrological and ew processes constitute a complex system of equations which are partly differential and partly algebraic several of these equations can be combined to obtain a reduced order version of the model in particular analyzing eqs 55 and 56 one can notice that an equation for the total carbon c t is obtained by combining eqs 11 18 19 and 20 55 c d i c h 2 co 3 hco 3 co 3 2 56 c t co 2 air c d i c 57 d c t d t r d e c f s a d v l c d i c which allows us to simplify the equilibrium terms r j and reduce four equations into only one the equilibrium constants of the dissolved inorganic carbon reactions can be written as hartmann et al 2013 58 k h a d h 2 co 3 co 2 air 59 k 1 hco 3 h h 2 co 3 60 k 2 co 3 2 h hco 3 in eq 58 the ratio between the concentration of carbonic acid and the co 2 concentration in the gas phase is the dimensionless henry s constant equal to 0 83 the equilibrium constants of the first and the second order of carbonic acid dissociation are indicated with k 1 and k 2 respectively by combining the expressions 58 60 it is possible to write each element of the dissolved inorganic carbon as a fraction of c d i c stumm and morgan 1995 61 h 2 co 3 α 0 c d i c 62 hco 3 α 1 c d i c 63 co 3 2 α 2 c d i c where the coefficients α 0 α 1 and α 2 depend on ph as shown by the following equations 64 α 0 1 k 1 h k 1 k 2 h 2 1 65 α 1 h k 1 1 k 2 h 1 66 α 2 h 2 k 1 k 2 h k 2 1 1 another important parameter is the alkalinity 67 a hco 3 2 co 3 2 h 3 al 3 oh that considering eqs 61 63 can be written as 68 a c d i c α 1 2 α 2 h 3 al 3 oh since in the mass balance differential equations related to h eq 21 and al 3 eq 35 there are also the cation exchange capacity terms the alkalinity expression can be modified by introducing the total h and al

take stock and present here a synopsis of the model the time dynamics of the total carbon the total alkalinity and the mass of the total calcium sodium magnesium potassium aluminum and silicates are described by the following mass balance differential equations 84 d c t d t r d e c f s a d v l c d i c d a t d t l hco 3 2 l co 3 2 r i p i l h l oh w b g 4 w o l i v 3 i al 3 3 l al 3 d ca t 2 d t i

here solved in an explicit way with a forward scheme once the initial conditions for c t a t ca t 2 mg t 2 na t k t al t 3 and s i t are fixed the concentration of the considered dissolved ions ca 2 na mg 2 h k al 3 and other individual variables are obtained by solving an implicit algebraic system see appendix a for the derivation the initial condition of the total carbon c t has been defined as the sum of the concentrations of co 2 in the gas phase and of the total dissolved inorganic carbon at the first step eq 56 according to stumm and morgan 1995 c d i c at the first step has been fixed equal to 10 6 mol l 1 this value has also been used to assess the initial concentration of co 2 in the gas phase through eq 58 the total alkalinity a t at the first step has been defined through eq 71 as a function of the initial condition of c d i c h ca 2 na k al 3 and mg 2 eqs 65 and 66 highlight that the terms α 1 and α 2 are a function of h thus of the initial soil ph which as a generic value has been fixed equal to 7 the amount of adsorbed moles of h on organic and clay colloids x h om and x h clay at the first step has been calculated by solving an implicit system constituted by the algebraic equations related to the cec component thus by solving the system a 1 excluding eqs 4 56 58 and 71 solving this algebraic implicit system resulted in the evaluation of x ca om 2 x ca clay 2 x mg om 2 x mg clay 2 x na om x na clay x k om x k clay x al om 3 and x al clay 3 at the first step therefore the initial al t 3 ca t 2 mg t 2 k t and na t have been defined on the base of eqs 70 73 76 with reference to the initial total silicon in the system a basic value of 10 11 mol l 1 has been set a schematic representation of the numerical resolution of the model is provided in fig 3 at each time step after solving the soil water balance forced with a stochastic rainfall the output soil moisture infiltration leaching and evapotranspiration rates are coupled to the organic carbon balance to obtain the decomposition rate and organic carbon concentration for the sake of simplicity the characteristics of vegetation are considered fixed in time thus the amount of litter added to the soil a d d is assumed as constant under a certain climate scenario fixed values of α and λ the output variables of these two balances are used to solve the explicit system once the initial conditions are fixed the explicit system is firstly solved and its output variables namely c t a t ca t 2 na t mg t 2 k t al t 3 and si t can be passed to the implicit algebraic system a 1 once the implicit system is solved some of its output variables such as the dissolved ions concentrations can be used to solve the explicit system at the next time step since it is solved with a forward scheme this goes on until the simulation end time is reached it is worth recalling that the explicit system can be solved independently from the implicit one indeed the resolution of the implicit part of the model can be carried out to obtain the time series of individual variables not combined such as those of ph mg 2 na k al 3 and ca 2 that are very useful to see the effects of olivine on soil chemistry which could reflect on land management the time series of hco 3 and co 3 2 are very relevant as well since they can be used to calculate the mass of carbon translated into the equivalent mass of co 2 on the base of the mass of carbon contained in a unit mass of co 2 which is sequestered by olivine in a certain amount of time 4 1 the role of wetness on weathering rate to shed light on the importance of soil moisture plants and cec on weathering we analyzed the time series resulting from numerical solutions of the model while here we consider more general characteristics more specific applications will be presented in cipolla et al 2021 a first important result shown in fig 4 is that the relationship between olivine weathering rate and soil moisture is not single valued this is due to the nonlinearities in the relationship between soil moisture and soil biogeochemistry i e the soil water balance and the implicit system of eq a 1 the non linear relationship between weathering rate and soil moisture fig 4 reflects a typical hysteretic behavior fig 4a displays a time series of soil moisture and fig 4b the corresponding time series of ph fig 4c shows the related olivine weathering rate while the pattern of weathering rate with soil moisture with some grey arrows representative of the trajectories is plotted in fig 4d the hysteretic pattern of weathering rate with soil moisture highlights that the process maintains a memory of past events such as the drying and wetting events for a single soil moisture value there are two or more different weathering rate values the lower ones related to the wetting period and the higher ones related to the drying one this confirms that wetness is one of the most relevant factors controlling soil biogeochemistry and in turn weathering rate calabrese et al 2017 calabrese and porporato 2020 4 2 the role of cation exchange processes on ew as it can be seen from the previous sections the cation exchange plays an important role in the model depending on the equilibrium reactions regulating the exchanges between the dissolved ions in soil water and those adsorbed on soil colloids 29 30 significant variations in soil ph can be expected in turn impacting the olivine weathering rate to understand the role of the cation exchange process on ew it was instructive to look at the one year time series of soil water ph of the sum of ca 2 mg 2 na and k concentrations indicated for brevity as nutrients and of weathering rate for three different cation exchange capacity levels the first one indicated as no cec represents the condition in which cec effects are negligible the other one represents a typical cation exchange value see e g weil and brady 2017 indicated as cec and the last one named as double cec represents an exceptionally high cation exchange capacity in this last case the cec parameters values are the double of those presented in weil and brady 2017 related to the cec scenario as seen in fig 5 b in correspondence of the high values of the nutrients concentration in soil water under the no cec level approximately from day 200 to 365 there is a strong adsorption process as long as the cation exchange process is included which becomes more relevant as the cation exchange capacity level increases this happens because the cation exchanges are regulated by equilibrium reactions thus if the concentration of dissolved ions is high the adsorption process will be strong on the other hand in correspondence of the low values of the dissolved ions concentration under the no cec level there is a weak adsorption of cations on soil colloids resulting in a higher concentration in soil water the same aspect can be found for the ph time series fig 5a the ph variations due to different cec levels reflect on weathering rate fig 5c indeed especially in correspondence of minimum ph values e g approximately from day 30 to 90 a greater cec results in a ph reduction hence in a more accentuated peak of weathering rate all these aspects show the importance of a dynamical model which explicitly takes into account the cation exchange processes the effects of these exchanges regulated by equilibrium reactions on soil biogeochemistry and in turn on ew dynamics become prominent over long time scales as they amplificate due to the nonlinearities 4 3 the role of plants on soil biogeochemistry affecting ew plants take up magnesium calcium potassium and sodium from soil water as common important nutrients in order to maintain a neutral balance the excess of cation uptake is counteracted by a release of hydrogen ions in soil water increasing soil water ph to highlight the importance of this process in soil biogeochemical dynamics a comparison of ph weathering rate and nutrients concentration time series with and without plants uptake release of ions is provided in fig 6 without plants uptake the nutrients concentration in soil water is generally higher and less variable than in the case where the nutrients uptake is taken into account in the latter case the greater variability can be explained by the fact that the uptake is proportional to the transpiration rate whose variability is inherited from rainfall consequently without the release of hydrogen ions soil ph is generally higher this affects olivine weathering rate since higher ph values correspond to lower weathering rates these aspects clearly demonstrate the importance of correctly capturing the plants uptake release of ions when modeling ew applications 5 discussions the inclusion of soil moisture plant and soil organic matter nutrient interactions in a biogeochemical ew model provides a novel perspective on the key processes controlling the dissolution dynamics of olivine in field conditions the resulting mathematical model constituted by a system of eight differential equations and an implicit algebraic system consisting of twenty two equations simultaneously considers stochasticity in soil moisture time dynamics of organic matter decomposition and soil chemistry soil cation exchange capacity olivine dissolution and co 2 consumption to highlight the fundamental interactions between water soil chemistry and plants ew was investigated in somewhat idealized conditions simplifying assumptions related to constant properties of rainfall soil and vegetation can be easily relaxed detailed applications will be presented in cipolla et al 2021 the model can be extended in several directions in this study only the most common macro nutrients for plants namely mg 2 k and the micro nutrient na have been taken into account however the model can be expanded to include the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles e g porporato et al 2003 d odorico et al 2003 in fact a significant percentage of global natural land area is nitrogen and phosphorus limited du et al 2020 and the demand of nitrogen and phosphorus is generally considered to be high on a stoichiometric basis the carbon module of the model assumes a simple balance between an input of carbon from vegetation and a first order decomposition term with constant carbon concentration in the biomass pool more detailed carbon models can be analyzed and considered for example the recent non linear microbial models may be used to couple microbial biomass extracellular enzymes and carbon substrate pools and take into account variations in the microbial carbon use efficiency in response to environmental conditions wieder et al 2015 however even if non linear decomposition models may be more detailed over short time scales simple linear parameterizations may be more suitable when considering long timescales manzoni and porporato 2009 one important source of uncertainty in ew is related to the estimation of weathering rates in the field for instance in the laboratory water quality and water mineral contacts are well controlled whereas in the field their characterization is rather difficult additionally mineral weathering can be accelerated or slowed down by bacteria and fungi uroz et al 2009 bonneville et al 2009 a process that remains largely unexplored in both lab and field settings here we calibrated the rate constant based on renforth et al 2015 in order to obtain a realistic order of magnitude for the weathering rates however further work in this direction is needed from both the experimental and modeling fronts to improve estimates of field reaction rates another source of uncertainty that affects the estimation of field weathering rate is connected to the distribution of olivine particles diameter resulting from the grinding operation in our model we considered a single effective diameter mainly for the sake of simplicity in fact tracking the actual evolution of particle size distributions would considerably increase the complexity and computational cost of the model as an illustration we show in fig 7 how different particle diameters affect olivine weathering rate considering three particle sizes based on the particle size distribution of renforth et al 2015 as the particle size decreases the weathering rate tends to increase at a quadratic rate due to its quadratic relationship with the specific surface area see eq 28 while it is tempting to use small particle sizes one should bear in mind that reducing particle size leads to higher grinding costs and co 2 emissions i e greater amount of energy needed to grind particles to a smaller size in view of practical ew applications a balance between these factors is fundamental to ensure that the carbon sink of ew more than compensates for the co 2 emissions and that the intervention is cost effective it would also be important to analyze the role of temporal e g seasonal and interannual variability of the rainfall forcing and vegetation dynamics e g litter and potential transpiration rate in agroecosystems for example crop growth and harvest should be taken into account including how they affect nutrient cycling other land management practices e g organic amendment via manure or compost should also be analyzed in terms of its synergies with ew several components considered here could be included in reactive transport models for example the apsim model keating et al 2003 simulates at a site scale crop growth soil organic matter ph time dynamics and soil water balance however it does not consider the cation exchange capacity and all the weathering processes of the naturally present minerals in soil the sheffield model taylor et al 2016 instead is able to simulate at a global scale the co 2 consumption for ew and the soil chemistry dynamics also taking into account the effects of ew on ocean acidification however due to the spatial scale of interest it does not consider crop growth and cation exchange processes our model considers the cation exchange processes which are very important in the evaluation of the dissolved ions concentrations in soil water and is also able to calculate the net sink of co 2 from a certain mass of added olivine at a site scale it considers unpredictable variability in soil moisture in the form of a stochastic process this is fundamental to understand the role of hydrological variability on ew as our results showed the interaction between these processes largely controls the trajectory of olivine dissolution over time and if not accounted for uncertainties and errors may amplify over time due to nonlinearities in the relationship between hydrology soil biogeochemistry and plants 6 conclusions this paper presents a model that couples biogeochemical and ecohydrological processes involved in the weathering process of olivine placing special attention to field conditions the main scope of the model is to simulate the dynamics of olivine weathering rate within a vegetated soil and to understand co 2 sequestration potential of ew the model is structured in different interconnected components and the resulting scheme consists of an explicit system of eight mass balance total differential equations and an implicit part with twenty two algebraic equations in twenty two unknown variables the model stresses the pivotal role of hydrology on the soil biogeochemistry plants dynamics and in turn the olivine weathering rate we also paid particular attention to the time dynamics of soil water ph both with and without olivine since this is an important parameter for many aspects such as the dissolved ions concentration dynamics and the suitability of the environment for plants the results highlight how the dependence between weathering rate and soil moisture is characterized by a hysteretic behavior due to nonlinearities and memory effects and that cation exchange and plants uptake release of ions processes which are not always included in the existing reactive transport models exert a strong control on olivine weathering rates cipolla et al 2021 describes a first application of the proposed

289,the bedload transport system of equations composed by the two dimensional shallow water equations for the free surface flow motion and the 2d exner or bedload transport equation for the erodible bed layer is used for a wide range of sediment transport processes in environmental surface flows in this work the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system the first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations fcm leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local riemann problem rp at the edges the stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled jacobian matrix at each intercell edge on the second hand an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled jacobian matrix eigenvalues this method called approximate coupled acm allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme both strategies are based on the finite volume fv method using roe s approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same cpu based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency the acm can only guarantee non oscillatory results when the bed flow interaction factor is small g o 10 3 if the interaction factor g is medium or high g o 10 2 the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness furthermore for highly erosive flows the fcm scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the acm one of the key points for large scale and long term bedload transport realistic applications keywords bedload transport models hydro morphodynamical coupled equations augmented roe schemes efficiency and robustness 1 introduction sediment transport is a common process in environmental surface flows such as rivers coasts or estuaries the sediment particles can be transported by two basic mechanisms suspended load that consists of the particles moving in the water column with the same velocity as the fluid and bedload transport which accounts for the sediment mass moving by rolling ans saltation mechanisms in a relatively thin layer over the static erodible stratum in this thin layer called bedload or transport layer the sediment particles are generally in contact with the static bed and their velocity is much lower than the flow velocity wu 2007 despite the total sediment mass transported by the suspension mechanism can be much larger than that moving in the transport layer the bedload mechanism plays a key role in sand gravel alluvial beds and it can cause rapid and marked changes in the bed bathymetry two dimensional bedload transport mathematical models are composed by the shallow water equations supplemented with the bedload transport equation for the erodible bed layer also called exner equation exner 1925 accounting for the bed level evolution although numerical modelling of erosive free surface flows in realistic situations involves transient conditions and movable boundaries most of the computational methods for bedload simulations decouple the resolution of the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system struiksma 1999 tingsanchali and chinnarasri 2001 juez et al 2014 caviedes voullième et al 2017 theoretically decoupled resolution has two important advantages hudson and sweby 2003 first it allows the usage of well validated numerical schemes for the hydrodynamical component i e 2d shallow water solvers murillo and garcía navarro 2010b 2012 able to deal with complex topography and wet dry fronts second decoupled strategies lead to simpler algebraical algorithms reducing the computational effort in large scale and long term realistic bedload simulations in order to ensure the stability of the explicitly computed numerical solution the time step should be small enough to avoid the interaction of waves from neighbouring riemann problems in most decoupled numerical models for bedload transport the limitation of the time step at each intercell edge is usually addressed using the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and assuming that the fastest wave celerity corresponds to the absolute maximum of the hydrodynamical jacobian matrix eigenvalues when the morphodynamical and the hydrodynamical components of the mathematical system are considered coupled the celerities of the characteristic waves i e the eigenvalues of the convective fluxes jacobian matrix are affected by the interaction between flow and bed elevation changes if the characteristic time of the bed evolution process is small enough in comparison with the characteristic time of the flow the stability region of the coupled system can be approximated using only the eigenvalues of the flow jacobian however for highly erosive flows the characteristic time of the bed evolution process can be as fast as the characteristic time of the flow and the stability region of the coupled system is reduced castro díaz et al 2008 martínez aranda et al 2019a therefore decoupled strategies suffer from numerical stability problems since the presence of rapid bed elevation changes can affect considerably the propagation celerity of the characteristic waves and hence reduce the stability region of the bed flow system cordier et al 2011 in order to improve the stability of the decoupled explicit schemes in fast bed evolution problems juez et al 2014 caviedes voullième et al 2017 have proposed a weakly coupled strategy including a virtual bedload celerity for the estimation of the maximum time step in this way it brings in some coupling through the choice of the time step although this strategy improves the stability of the scheme it also overestimates the virtual bedload celerity for near flat bed condition leading to an important reduction on the time step and hence of the scheme performance contrarily fully coupled bedload strategies ensure the stability of the numerical solution even for highly erosive flows but the complexity of the numerical algorithms usually complicates their application to realistic scenarios most of the fully coupled schemes reported in the last years are limited to 1d frameworks martínez aranda et al 2019a fernández nieto et al 2014 2017 martínez aranda et al 2019b zhang and duan 2011 hudson and sweby 2003 are based on highly diffusive numerical solvers fraccarollo et al 2003 wu and wang 2007 goutière et al 2008 soares frazao et al 2012 or require complex numerical algorithm hardly applicable to realistic environmental flows murillo and garcía navarro 2010a liu and beljadid 2017 furthermore one of the assumed drawbacks of the fully coupled strategies is their high computational cost couple formulations involve a larger number of algebraic calculation compared with decoupled schemes reducing their computational efficiency in realistic application nevertheless objective comparison of coupled and decoupled methods are rarely found in literature cordier et al 2011 juez et al 2014 meurice and soares frazão 2020 and usually do not provide detailed data in terms of computational effort in this work two different strategies for the coupling of the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the 2d bedload transport system are proposed both strategies are based on the finite volume method fvm using the roe s approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells on the one hand a fully coupled scheme fcm for the 2d shallow water and bedload transport equations is proposed leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local riemann problem rp at the edges new explicit expressions are provided for the wave and source strengths the stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled jacobian matrix at each intercell edge on the other hand an alternative approximate coupled strategy acm is proposed the shallow water and the bed transport equations are solved independently at each time step but the maximum time step required to ensure the scheme stability is controlled by an approximation of the coupled jacobian matrix eigenvalues this method allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges than those of the fully coupled method the main goal is to perform a thorough quantitative comparison of both kind of strategies for 2d bedload transport systems in terms of robustness accuracy and computational efficiency additionally a new set of experimental tests carried out in a laboratory flume using rgb d sensors is provided for benchmarking numerical bedload models this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the two dimensional equations for the free surface water flow and the bedload solid transport with different sediment size classes are introduced section 3 is devoted to the finite volume method and the detailed description of the fcm and acm riemann solvers the extension of the methods to realistic empirical relationships for the bedload solid transport rate is reported in section 4 in section 5 both numerical schemes are validated using analytical idealized and transient experimental benchmarking cases involving low medium and high flow bed interaction finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 depth averaged two dimensional model for bedload transport the depth averaged model for the multi grain bedload transport is derived from the integration of the navier stokes equations along the vertical direction throughout the flow and bed layer assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution and includes the mass and momentum conservation

bedload transport layer is expressed as 4 t z b x q b x y q b y 0 where q b x q b y are the components of the bulk volumetric bedload rate q b along the x y horizontal coordinates respectively for multi grain bed layer composed by n different sediment classes q b can be estimated as wu 2007 juez et al 2013 martínez aranda et al 2020 5 q b 1 1 ξ p 1 n f b p g p u 2 u being ξ is the bulk porosity of the bed layer f b p the bed fraction of the p th sediment class which is here considered constant in time and uniform in space with p 1 n f b p 1 and g p a grass type factor accounting for the

method system 7 is time dependent non linear and contains source terms under the hypothesis of dominant advection it can be classified as belonging to the family of hyperbolic systems in order to obtain a numerical solution using a finite volume fv technique the spatial domain is divided in computational cells using a mesh fixed in time and system 7 is integrated in each cell ω i using the

area of the i cell associated to the k th edge the theory of riemann problems rp can be used to solve the intercell fluxes in the 2d problem 17 for each k th cell edge it is possible to define a local 1d rp by projecting 7 along n murillo and navas montilla 2016 martínez aranda et al 2020 furthermore 7 satisfies the rotation invariance property godlewski and raviart 1996 castro et al 2009 and hence can be expressed in the local framework x y corresponding to normal and tangential directions to each cell edge respectively defining a rotation matrix t k for the k th cell edge as 18 t k 1 0 0 0 0 n x n y 0 0 n y n x 0 0 0 0 1 k which satisfies the condition 19 e n k f u n x g u n y k t k 1 f t k u being t k 1 the inverse matrix of t k the local rp normal to the k th cell edge can be expressed in

indicate the left and right cells of the k th edge respectively therefore the set of local conserved variables u t k u at the cell edge is defined as 21 u t k u h h u h v z b t where u u n x v n y and v u n y v n x are the flow velocities along the x and y coordinates respectively and the local convective fluxes f u f t k u can be expressed as 22 f u f t k u h u h u 2 1 2 g h 2 h u v 1 1 ξ g u 2 u allowing to define the jacobian matrix of the convective fluxes as 23 j k f u u 0 1 0 0 g h u 2 2 u 0 0 u v v u 0 u a v b a b 0 k where 24 a q b h u 1 1 ξ g 3 u 2 v 2 1 h 0 b q b h v 1 1 ξ g 2 u v 1 h

transport rate increases as the normal discharge grows second when the bedload transport flux q b is computed by means of empirical relationships these derivatives require a suitable treatment to ensure solid mass conservation across the cell edge as it is detailed in section 4 the augmented value of the fluxes through the k th cell edge in 17 incorporates the non conservative contribution of the momentum source terms s b and s τ into the convective fluxes e n k using the rotation invariance property 25 t k s b t k h x u x n x h y u y n y k h k u x where h k h x u and the bed pressure

normal distance d n k between cell centers sharing k th cell edge including momentum source terms 26 and 28 into the solution of the local plane rp 20 it is possible to rewrite 17 as 30 d d t ω i u d ω k 1 n e t k 1 f u s b s τ k l k where f u k are the convective fluxes at the edge resulting from the homogenous rp whereas s b and s τ are the upwind contribution of the bed slope and friction momentum terms respectively to the numerical flux at the left side of the k th edge corresponding to the i cell therefore it is possible to define an augmented numerical flux f k for the i cell at the k th edge which incorporates the integrated bed pressure and friction dissipation terms into the homogeneous fluxes at the cell edge ensuring the well balance property for steady states murillo and garcía navarro 2010b 31 f k f u s b s τ k replacing 31 into 30 the updating formula for the conserved variables u at the cells is obtained 32 u i n 1 u i n δ t a i k 1 n e t k 1 f k l k where δ t t n

augmented roe solver a roe approach roe 1981 toro 1997 murillo and garcía navarro 2010b to solve the augmented numerical fluxes at the cell edges leading to two different fv methods for coupling flow and bedload transport the main goal of this work is to compare robustness accuracy and efficiency of both fv methods 3 1 fully coupled riemann solver fcm the plane rp 20 defined in the local framework x y of the k th edge separating the left i cell and the right j cell can be approximated by using the following constant coefficient linear rp toro 1997 33 u t j k u x h k u x s τ k u x 0 u i t k u i

matrix which approximates the jacobian of the non linear rp therefore a pseudo jacobian matrix m k can be defined for the linear rp at the k th cell edge coupling the jacobian of the convective fluxes

g is proposed in martínez aranda et al 2019b the approximate matrix m k 34 is diagonalizable with four approximate real eigenvalues λ m k for m 1 4 resulting from the resolution of the characteristic polynomial p λ det m λ i 0 being i the 4 4 identity matrix 37 p λ u λ λ u λ 2 c 2 c 2 a λ u 0 where c g h is the averaged celerity of the infinitesimal waves one of the approximate eigenvalues λ m k takes the value of the normal velocity u corresponding to the tangential shear wave in the rp structure the remaining three eigenvalues referred as a b and c can be computed exactly applying the cardano vieta formula to solve the roots of the cubic polynomial r λ λ u λ 2 c 2 c 2 a λ u 0 considering right going motion u 0 regardless of the flow regime subcritical supercritical the eigenvalues λ m k can be sorted as follows 38 λ 1 k a 0 λ 2 k b λ 3 k u k λ 4 k c where a b and c are the roots of r λ similarly for left going flow u 0 the coupled eigenvalues are 39 λ 1 k a λ 2 k u k λ 3 k b 0 λ 4 k c and in addition it can be demonstrated that 40 λ 1 k u c k λ 4 k u c k therefore it is possible to conclude that i one of the eigenvalues has always opposite direction to the flow transporting information upstream and the remaining three eigenvalues have the same direction as the flow ii the maximum wave celerity in the coupled eigenstructure is higher than the pure hydrodynamic wave celerity reducing the actual stability region of the local rp from now on we consider right going flow u 0 for sake of clarity but the following results can be straightforward derived for left going flow u 0 the associated orthogonal basis of eigenvectors e m k of m k is used to built the matrix p k e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 k as 41 p k 1 1 c 2 b 1 λ 1 λ 2 c 2 b u λ 4 v v c 2 v b u v λ 1 u 2 c 2 c 2 λ 2 u

main diagonal one result of roe s linearization is that the approximate riemann solution consists of only discontinuities and u x t is constructed as a sum of jumps or shocks the solution for u x t is governed by the celerities in λ k and consists of four regions connected by 5 waves one of them a contact wave with null celerity accounting for the integrated resistance source term s τ k at x 0 according to the godunov type method it is sufficient to provide the solution for u x t at the intercell position x 0 in order to obtain the updating numerical fluxes f k 31 the numerical flux at the left and right side of the k th cell edge can be estimated using an approximate flux function f x t 43 f k lim x 0 f x t f u i f k lim x 0 f x t f u j being u i and u j the intermediate states of the approximated solution at the corresponding side of the k th edge 44 u i lim x 0 u x t u j lim x 0 u x t following toro 1997 the conserved variable differences δ u k and the integrated resistance source terms s τ k at the cell edge are projected on the eigenvector basis in order to obtain the wave and source strength vectors a k and b k respectively 45 a k α 1 α 4 k t p 1 k δ u k δ u k m 1 4 α

control volume corresponding to the cell edge 29 the reconstruction of the approximated solution at the left and right sides of the cell edge murillo and garcía navarro 2010b u i and u j respectively can be expressed as 49 u i u i m γ m e m k u j u j m γ m e m k where γ m α m β m λ m and the subscript m and m under the sums indicate waves travelling inward and outward the i cell therefore the approximated solution for the flux function f x t can also be constructed by defining appropriate rankine hugoniot rh relations across each moving wave the solution of the approximate flux function provides the definition of the numerical fluxes at the left and right sides f k and f j respectively of the k th cell edge 50 f k f u i m λ m γ m e m k f k f u j m λ m γ m e m k where the subscript m and m under the sums indicate waves travelling inward and outward the i cell note that when momentum source terms are incorporated into the riemann solver it is no longer possible to define a unique value of the numerical flux at both sides of the cell edge the relation between the approximate fluxes f k and f k can be analyzed using the rankine hugoniot rh relation at x 0 which includes a steady contact wave rosatti and begnudelli 2010 li and chen 2006 between the approximate solutions u i and u j the corresponding flux jump for the approximate solution is given by 51 f k f k m 1 4 β m e m k s τ k and hence the updating formula 32 can be applied using the augmented numerical flux f k in 50 finally in order to ensure the stability of the explicitly computed numerical solution the time step should be small enough to avoid the interaction of waves from neighbouring rp s the dynamical limitation of the time step at each k edge is addressed here assuming that the fastest wave celerity

exist a jump between the left and right inner states of the approximated flux function at x 0 therefore it possible to assess f k 4 f k 4 allowing to compute the bedload numerical flux at the k cell edge as 64 f k 4 q b i n if λ b k 0 q b j n if λ b k 0 and the morphodynamical conserved variables z b is also updated using formula 32 with the intercell solid flux 64 this separate formulation and the corresponding separate numerical resolution would lead to a decoupled model it is known that totally decoupled schemes suffer from oscillations and instabilities in many flow conditions previous works juez et al 2014 caviedes voullième et al 2017 defined a weakly coupled strategy by controlling the global numerical stability by means of the most restrictive among the hydrodynamic eigenvalues 56 and the virtual bed load celerity 63 this approach was useful but can be improved in order to ensure the stability of this decoupled scheme without reducing the computational performance even for fast bed evolution conditions a new strategy for the restriction of the time step is also proposed this strategy leads to an approximate coupling of the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system for each k cell edge the maximum time step is limited considering the characteristic eigenstructure of the coupled pseudo jacobin matrix m k 34 following cordier et al 2011 even without calculating the exact eigenvalues λ m k their minimum and maximum values can be bounded into an approximated range λ 1 λ 4 k using the mathematical properties of the characteristic polynomial p λ 37 the eigenvalues a b and c of the sub polynomial r λ 38 39 can be analyzed graphically as intersection of a cubic curve f 1 λ λ u λ 2 c 2 representing the hydrodynamical component of the system with a straight line f 2 λ c 2 a λ u accounting for the morphodynamic component this is shown in fig 1 considering right going flow u 0 and subcritical flow regime but the procedure can bed extended to supercritical conditions and left going flow u 0 without loss of generality the lower and upper bounds λ 1 and λ 4 respectively can be estimated as the intersection of the straight line f 2 λ with two auxiliary straight lines t 1 λ and t 4 λ these auxiliary straight lines are tangential to the cubic function f 1 λ at the points u c k and u c k respectively hence the upper and lower bounds are computed as 65 lower bound t 1 λ f 2 λ λ 1 k u c θ 1 c 2 a u θ 1 c 2 a k upper bound t 4 λ f 2 λ λ 4 k u c θ 4 c 2 a u θ 4 c 2 a k being the parameter θ 1 f 1 λ λ u c k the value of the first derivative of the cubic curve f 1 λ at λ u c k and similarly θ 4 f 1 λ λ u c k the value of the first derivative of f 1 λ at λ u c k finally the limiting time step at k th cell edge is computed using 66 δ t k min a i a j l k max λ 1 k λ 4 k and the global time step δ t t n 1 t n is limited using the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition as 67 δ t cfl min k δ t k with cfl 1 4 extension to empirical bedload transport rate formulations in this work the factors g p are calculated using the generalized model proposed in martínez aranda et al 2019b 2020 and assuming capacity state for the solid transport at the bedload layer hence g p is not uniform in space and can be expressed as a function of the flow depth h the dimensionless size specific shields stress θ p and the transport layer thickness η p for the p th sediment class 68 g p γ 1 h γ 2 θ p γ 3 η p expressions for functions γ 1 γ 2 and γ 3 are provided in martínez aranda et al 2019b 2020 for some of the empirical capacity

density ratio being ρ p the density of the sediment grains n p is the specific manning roughness coefficient which is calculated as n p d p 1 6 21 1 strickler 1923 k d and k e are two constants accounting for the deposition and erosion exchange fluxes respectively between the transport layer and the underlying static bed stratum θ c is the incipient motion shields stress threshold and δ θ j is the excess of shields stress for the p th sediment class calculated as 69 δ θ p θ p θ c if θ p θ c 0 otherwise here θ p is calculated using the balance between the turbulent shear force exerted by the flow on the sediment grains at the top of the bed layer and the gravitational force 70 θ p n p 2 u 2 s 1 d p h 1 3 under capacity transport state the thickness of the bedload transport layer for

22 varies spatially as a function of the local flow features at the left and right cells following murillo and garcía navarro 2010a martínez aranda et al 2019a b the discrete jump in the solid flux

u j g being the averaged interaction factor at the k th cell edge incorporating this solid flux splitting into the numerical scheme requires to consider δ q b g u i u j as the solid discharge discrete jump in both the fully and approximate coupled riemann solvers furthermore a corrector term must be added to the computation of the numerical intercell fluxes this corrector term accounts for the variation of the bulk grass interaction factor between the cell center and the averaged value g used at the edge the extended numerical fluxes referred as f k are defined as 74 f k f k f i δ where f k is calculated using 50 in the fcm solver and 61 64 in the acm solver and f i δ is the corrector term computed as 75 f i δ 0 0 0 1 1 p g g i u i 2 v i 2 u i k for both fv methods the final updating

both numerical methods to converge to the exact solution of a transient bedload transport problem an exact solution for the 1d shallow water bedload system was proposed by berthon et al 2012 considering a frictionless case with constant flow discharge q h u throughout the spatial domain and the grass formulation for the bedload discharge q b a g u 2 u with a g 1 1 ξ g c o n s t the 1d transient exact solution for system 1 4 can be expressed as 77 u α x β a g 2 3 h q u z b 0 z b t 0 u 3 2 gq 2 gu γ z b t z b 0 α t being α β and γ constant parameters g the gravity acceleration and z b 0 the initial bed elevation for this test case α 0 005 β 0 005 γ 2 q 1 m 2 s and a g 0 01 s 2 m are set considering a 1d spatial domain x 0 10 m the transient exact solution 77 for both the free surface elevation h z b and the bed elevation z b at t 10 s is shown in fig 2 in order to analyze the convergence of both numerical schemes fcm and acm to the exact solution six one dimensional square cell meshes are considered increasing the number of cells from the coarsest m100 with 100 cells of edge length δ x 0 1 m to the finest m3200 with 3200 cells of edge length δ x 0 003125 m constant flow and bedload solid discharges q 1 m 2 s and q b 0 005 m 2 s respectively are set as boundary conditions at the inlet section whereas the normal flow depth h 0 5665 m is imposed at the outlet boundary the cfl is set to 1 0 for all the simulations the computed results at t 10 s for the free surface and bed elevations using fcm and the mesh m100 have been depicted in fig 2 the convergence of the fcm and acm method to the exact solution is analyzed using the l 1 and l error norms fig 3 left shows the l 1 norm for the water depth h and bed elevation z b with both fcm and acm whereas fig 3 right shows the l error norm for h and z b the acm solver obtains a smaller l 1 norm than the fcm method whereas the values of the l norm are similar for both numerical schemes the values of the l 1 and l error norms of the water depth h and the bed elevation z b have been summarized in tables 2 and 3 for the fcm and acm schemes respectively the convergence order of both methods between refinement steps has also been computed based on the error norms values both the fcm and the acm riemann solvers are able to converge to the exact solution of the test with a similar convergence order 5 2 synthetic tests 5 2 1 test a 1d subcritical symmetric dambreak this synthetic test aims at assessing the stability of both fcm and acm as the bedload transport component increases its importance a frictionless 1d symmetrical dambreak over flat bed is considered with the following initial conditions 78 h x 0 1 m if 0 5 x 0 5 0 2 m otherwise u x 0 0 m s x v x 0 0 m s x z b x 0 1 m x which allow subcritical flow f r u g h 1 during the whole test all the simulations are performed using a one dimensional square cell mesh with δ x 0 01 m edge length and cfl 1 the bedload transport rate is calculated considering one sediment class with porosity ξ 0 40 and a constant flow bed interaction factor g 0 001 s 2 m low interaction g 0 01 s 2 m medium interaction and g 0 1 s 2 m high interaction the final time is t 1 0 s for all the simulations fig 4 shows the free surface and bed elevation profiles at t 0 1 s t 0 3 s and t 0 6 s for both fcm and acm numerical schemes on both sides of the symmetric dambreak the solution is characterized by a frontal shock wave which affects the flow and erodible bed layers followed by a rarefaction wave between the domain center and the front wave which creates a highly eroded region as the interaction factor g grows the magnitude of the sediment sock wave and the highly eroded region also increases affecting greatly the flow structure for low interaction g 0 001 s 2 m see fig 4 a both methods remain stable and show quite similar solutions for the free surface and bed elevation as g increases differences between the fcm and the acm schemes appear for medium interaction factor g 0 01 s 2 m fig 4 b although both schemes offer a stable behaviour some differences appear at the bed level profile as time progresses especially at the transition between the shock wave and the rarefaction region when the value of g is increased to 0 1 s 2 m representing a high interaction between the flow and the bedload layer see fig 4 c the acm scheme becomes oscillatory at the shock rarefaction transition at the first stages of the dambreak as time progresses these spurious oscillations grow and cause the acm solution to lose its symmetric behaviour however the fcm solution remains stable smooth and symmetrical even for high interaction factor values although the solution obtained with the acm scheme loses symmetry and shows local spurious oscillations for high flow bed interaction the proposed approximate coupled time step limitation applied in the acm method demonstrates to improve greatly the stability of the scheme fig 5 shows the bed and flow levels at t 0 6 s using the acm scheme compared with the results obtained if only the flow eigenvalues 56 are taken into account for limiting the time step totally decoupled scheme low g 0 1 s 2 m medium g 0 1 s 2 m and high g 0 1 s 2 m values for the grass interaction factor are analysed for low and medium interaction factors the acm and the totally decoupled methods perform almost similar in this synthetic test however if high interaction values are considered the totally decoupled scheme fails and the solution loses the stability whereas the acm method only shows some local deviations from the fcm solution although in this synthetic case the decoupled method only shows stability loss for grass factors of order g o 10 1 the totally decoupled resolution can fail in the wide range of flow conditions which involves medium or even low bed flow interaction cordier et al 2011 furthermore table 4 shows the computational time required for both numerical schemes to complete the simulation the acm method shows a slightly smaller computational effort for low and medium flow bed interaction factor since the fcm scheme requires more complicated algebraical operations to compute the solution nevertheless for high interaction factor the appearance of spurious oscillations in the acm solution causes an important loss of efficiency of the decoupled scheme whereas the fcm solver remains stable and requires a much smaller computational time to perform the simulation the speed up of the fcm solver is near 1 5 for g 0 1 s 2 m test 5 2 2 test a 1d supercritical symmetric dambreak the goal of this synthetic test is to demonstrate the capability of both schemes to deal with regime changes in the flow and to asses their stability in these configurations as in the previous synthetic test a frictionless 1d symmetrical dambreak over flat bed is considered with the following initial conditions 79 h x 0 50 m if 5 x 5 0 2 m otherwise u x 0 0 m s x v x 0 0 m s x z b x 0 10 m x which allow the flow to change from subcritical f r u g h 1 at the center of the domain to supercritical f r u g h 1 at the dambreak wave fronts all the simulations are performed using a one dimensional square cell mesh with δ x 0 1 m edge length and cfl 1 the bedload transport rate is calculated considering one sediment class with porosity ξ 0 40 and a constant flow bed iteration factor g 0 01 s 2 m the final time is t 1 0 s for all the simulations fig 6 left shows the free surface and bed elevation profiles at t 0 1 s t 0 3 s and t 0 6 s for both fcm and acm numerical schemes whereas the froude number of the flow throughout the right side of the symmetric dambreak is depicted in fig 6 right for both schemes at the same times at t 0 1 s the flow structure is characterized by a supercritical shock wave which strongly affects the erodible bed layer followed by a transcritical rarefaction wave where the flow changes from subcritical to supercritical at x 5 m at t 0 3 s the transcritical region behind the supercritical wave front increases and two critical points can be distinguished at x 3 5 m and x 6 5 m respectively with a slightly subcritical region between them the appearance of two critical points in the flow structure is a direct consequence of the high interaction between the flow and the movable bed as the dambreak progresses this double critical point structure disappears and only one regime change is observed separating the supercritical wave front and the rarefaction wave x 9 m at t 0 6 s both numerical methods demonstrate to be stable when dealing with flow regime changes however the acm shows spurious oscillations in the water depth h and bed elevation z b generated around the critical points furthermore the acm scheme predicts a slower advance of the dambreak wave front than that of the fcm scheme this difference could be related to a slower characteristic wave celerity for the flow motion since the decoupled approach does not take into account the influence of the bed changes in the jacobian eigenvalues contrarily to the fcm method it is worth noting that the predicted froude numbers at the dambreak wave front are also smaller for the acm simulation f r 4 than that computed using the fcm scheme f r 5 as in the previous subcritical dambreak case for high flow bed interaction although the solution obtained with the acm scheme shows local spurious oscillations the approximated coupled time step estimation improves greatly the stability of the scheme fig 7 shows the bed and flow levels at t 0 6 s using the acm scheme compared with the results obtained by the totally decoupled strategy also in this test involving a medium flow bed interaction factor g 0 01 s 2 m the totally decoupled scheme fails and loses the stability whereas the acm method only shows local oscillation and does not loss the solution symmetry furthermore the high interaction between the flow and the movable bed leads to a slower computational time for the fully coupled method compared with the acm scheme even though the fcm method requires more complicated algebraical operations to compute numerical fluxes at the intercell edges the speed up of the fcm solver against the acm approach is near 1 4 for this test see table 5 5 2 3 test c 2d supercritical symmetric dambreak the aim of this synthetic test is to assess the capability of both schemes to deal with structured and unstructured meshes regardless of the number of edges of the cells the idealized supercritical symmetric dambreak reported above for synthetic test b see 79 is considered here but over a two dimensional 50 10 m domain discretized using three different kind of mesh an orthogonal square cell mesh sq a structured triangle cell mesh ts and an unstructured triangle cell mesh tu details of the three mesh topologies are shown in fig 8 and their geometrical characteristics have been reported in table 6 all the simulations are performed considering one sediment class with porosity ξ 0 40 and a constant flow bed interaction factor g 0 01 s 2 m as in the above synthetic test b the final time is t 1 0 s and the cfl is set to 0 5 for the three meshes in order to compare computational times fig 9 shows a view of the free surface and bed elevation at t 0 3 s using the fcm scheme the color scale denotes the free surface level and the bed changes magnitude respectively regardless of the kind of mesh the scheme is able to compute correctly the evolution of the symmetric dambreak with the same flow structure as in the above one dimensional test b furthermore the longitudinal free surface and bed level profiles along the right side of the symmetric dambreak x 0 m have been plotted in fig 10 with the three meshes at t 0 1 s t 0 3 s and t 0 6 s the left column depicts the results obtained with the fcm scheme whereas the right column shows those predicted by the acm approach regarding the fcm results small differences appear in the free surface and bed level depending on the mesh selected but these can be considered negligible and mainly related to the differences on the numerical diffusion between the three mesh topologies contrarily the acm scheme shows a more marked dependence on the mesh topology since the spurious oscillations observed in the above one dimensional test b also appear for the orthogonal square mesh sq whereas the higher numerical diffusion associated to the triangular meshes especially in the unstructured topology tu reduces this spurious oscillations therefore differences in the solution depending on the mesh topology arise with the acm method although they can be considered small table 7 shows the computational times required to complete the simulation with each mesh for both fv methods the computational effort increases for the triangular meshes ts and tu especially for the unstructured topology with respect to the orthogonal square mesh sq this increment is mainly caused by the larger number of cells for the triangular meshes ts and tu interestingly despite the acm scheme does not show important spurious oscillations in the solution its efficiency is lower than that of the fcm method for all the mesh topologies tested the speed up of the fcm is about 1 5 times that of the decoupled scheme this loss of efficiency of the acm is related to more restricted stability conditions fig 11 shows the time step restriction for the fcm and acm schemes along the simulated time with the three meshes considered sq ts and tu moreover for the approximate coupled simulations the global time step limitations associated to both the hydrodynamical eigenvalues λ m k 56 and the virtual bed celerity λ b k 63 at the cell edges are also depicted on the one hand regardless of the mesh topology the maximum time steps allowed for the fcm method are slightly smaller than those obtained considering only the hydrodynamical component of the flow because of the influence of the movable bed in the local rp eigenstructure on the other hand the approximate coupled strategy leads to a more restricted time step limitation than the fully coupled approach since as the flow bed interaction increases the approximated bounds λ 1 k λ 4 k 65 move away from the exact eigenvalues see fig 1 nevertheless the maximum time step associated to these approximated bounds is several orders of magnitude higher than the time step limitation derived from considering the virtual bed celerity λ b k therefore the usage of this approximate coupled strategy to limit the maximum time step ensures the stability of the decoupled numerical scheme even for high flow bed interaction problems as well as it avoids unsuitable time step limitations associated to including the virtual bed celerity λ b k in the stability determination 5 3 experimental tests in this section both numerical schemes are faced to two dimensional highly erosive flow experiments carried out at the laboratory of hydraulics of the university of zaragoza martínez aranda et al 2020 these experiments consist of a dambreak wave moving along a 3 25 m long and 24 c m wide flume over a 5 c m depth erodible flat bed made of non cohesive sand the cross section of the flume was modified by creating a 11 c m long and 13 c m wide narrowing using both 11 c m diameter semi circular case 1 and 11 5 5 c m rectangular case 2 pieces centered at 150 c m from the flume beginning allowing the generation of two dimensional flow at the measurement region the dambreak wave was triggered by lifting a pneumatic gate which separates the flume from a 157 c m long and 81 c m wide upstream reservoir where the initial height of the water was 8 c m over the dry flume floor downstream the flume a 275 c m long sediment trap stored the eroded material before a recovery tank a rgb d sensor kinect microsoft 2010 was used to perform instantaneous measurements of the 2d transient water surface height during the wave propagation throughout the narrowing this device records the distance to the water free surface using an infrared light projection technique with 30 hz acquisition rate 1 4 mm spatial resolution and 1 2 mm precision approximately after the dambreak wave the 2d bed surface elevation was also recorded using the same rgb d sensor in order to determine the morphodynamical changes generated by the flow a skecth of the experiments setup is showed in fig 12 the erodible bed consisted of a mix of two uniform sand size classes with characteristic parameters shown in table 8 the global bed porosity is estimated as ξ 0 34 the deposition and erosion constant are set to k d 0 02 and k e 0 3 respectively and the manning resistance factor is calibrated to n 0 012 at the fixed bed regions and n 0 026 throughout the movable bed region 5 3 1 mesh refinement calibration in order to determine the mesh refinement level required to reduce the associated error maximizing the computational efficiency a previous blind study is performed using the semicircular narrowing geometry and five different unstructured triangular meshes with different refinement levels throughout the erodible bed region it is worth noting that the base mesh mb is maintained unchanged at the upstream reservoir and the fixed bed regions regardless of the refinement level at the movable bed region table 9 shows the geometrical characteristics of the five meshes considered the simulations are performed using the fcm scheme cfl 0 95 and the meyer peter müller formulation to estimate the bedload solid rate see table 1 the numerical results obtained with the different meshes at t 10 s are compared in terms of bed change error and computational efficiency in order to determine the optimal refinement level taking the finest mesh mr results as reference fig 13 left shows the root mean square error rmse for the bed level z b obtained with the meshes m1 m2 m3 and m4 respect to the those obtained with the reference mesh mr furthermore fig 13 right depicts the efficiency ratio between the rmse for z b and the computational time required by the model the rmse shows a uniform decrease with the mesh refinement whereas the ratio tends to an asymptotic behavior based on these results the mesh m4 is selected for the simulation of the experimental cases 5 3 2 case 1 semicircular narrowing case 1 considers the dambreak propagation throughout the flume with the semicircular narrowing geometry the simulations are performed using both the fcm and the acm models the meyer peter müller and the wu relationships are considered to estimate the bedload solid rate the simulations run until a time t 25 s so that the bedload transport totally stops fig 14 shows the two dimensional water depth h fields measured with the kinect sensor at different times after the gate opening the water depth h is expressed in c m referred to the original flat bed the dambreak wave front reaches the narrowing 1 6 s after the gate opening approximately initially two water columns rise up near the narrowing walls see t 1 8351 s image caused by the impact of the wave front on the semicircular walls this violent impact leads to marked vertical accelerations in the flow near the semicircular walls at the first stages after the wave arrival then these water columns disappear progressively images t 2 0355 s and t 2 3354 s as the wave front moves downstream a triangle shaped hydraulic jump appears upstream the narrowing and moves progressively to the flume beginning whereas the characteristic diamond structure is created downstream the narrowing region see t 2 7695 s and t 3 2035 s images the temporal evolution of the water depth over the initial flat bed computed with the fcm is shown fig 15 using the mpm left column and wu right column relationships for the bedload transport rate estimation results obtained with the acm shows a quite similar water depth evolution both numerical models are able to predict the arrival time of the wave front to the narrowing as well as the appearance and evolution of both the upstream hydraulic jump and the diamond structure downstream the narrowing region nevertheless the appearance of marked vertical acceleration during the first stages after the wave front arrival to the narrowing region shows the limitations of both models hydrostatic pressure assumption since they can not correctly predict the growth of the water columns near the semicircular narrowing walls after the wave front impact furthermore the triangular shape of the upstream hydraulic jump observed in the laboratory is not fully captured by the numerical models with respect to the influence of the bedload transport rate formulation in the water depth temporal evolution the simulation performed using the wu relationship shows a slightly slower wave front progression than that performed using the mpm formula as well as thinner diamond structures downstream the narrowing furthermore the triangular shape of the upstream hydraulic jump is also slightly better predicted using the wu formula than with the mpm relationship the temporal evolution of the water depth h over the initial flat bed is extracted from the two dimensional kinect sensor measurements at different gauge points upstream the narrowing p1 x 140 c m y 12 c m at the center of the narrowing p2 x 150 c m y 12 c m downstream the narrowing p3 x 165 c m y 12 c m and near the semicircular walls p4 right x 144 5 c m y 6 5 c m and p4 left x 144 5 c m y 17 5 c m fig 16 shows the measured water depth evolution at the considered gauge points and the comparison with the data obtained from the numerical simulations using the fcm scheme the numerical results obtained with the acm model are rather similar in general both the fcm and the acm schemes predict well the water depth tendency at all the gauge points considered regardless of the empirical relationship used for the bedload rate estimation but some differences appear and should be commented upstream the narrowing p1 both models predict a water depth increment sharper than was measured in the laboratory at the center of the narrowing p2 the numerical water depth evolution obtained with the mpm formula for the bedload transport rate shows a sharp increment at t 8 s which is not shown in the experimental data whereas the numerical results with the wu relationship show a more acceptable behaviour however the maximum water depth obtained with the wu formula at this gauge point is lower in the numerical simulations than in the experiments downstream the narrowing p3 both numerical schemes show again a sharper water depth increase than in the experimental data near the narrowing walls p4 right and p4 left the numerical results are in agreement with the measured water depth regardless of the formulation used for the bedload rate computation fig 17 depicts the bed changes measured in laboratory after the bed layer was totally dry and the comparison with the numerical results obtained at the end of the simulations the bathymetry after the dambreak wave observed in the experiments is characterized by high erosion at the center of the narrowing especially near the semicircular walls and by the appearance of a marked diamond shape deposition bar downstream the narrowing both the fully coupled and the approximate coupled models are able to predict these characteristic structures in the bed layer level regardless of the empirical formulation selected for the bedload transport however the length of the erosion region and the diamond shape deposition bar are better predicted with wu formula than using the mpm relation leading to lower rmse for the numerical bed elevation z b respect to the experimental results with the wu expression see table 10 furthermore the fcm scheme shows lower rmse for z b than the approximate coupled method whereas regarding the computational effort the fcm method is slightly more expensive than the acm scheme table 10 although those differences are practically negligible 5 3 3 case 2 rectangular narrowing case 2 considers the dambreak propagation throughout the flume with the rectangular narrowing geometry the simulations are performed following the same procedure and using the same parameters as in case 1 fig 18 shows the two dimensional water depth h fields measured with the kinect sensor at different times after the gate opening as in the previous case the wave reaches the narrowing 1 6 s after the gate opening and two marked water columns rise up near the narrowing walls see t 1 8661 s image caused by the impact of the wave front leading to marked vertical accelerations in the flow near the narrowing walls at the first stages after the front arrival then these water columns evolve progressively image t 2 0364 s and create a hydraulic jump upstream the narrowing which moves to the flume beginning see t 2 3364 s t 2 7705 s and t 3 3699 s images for this case the hydraulic jump is perpendicular to the flume axis almost from the first stages also the characteristic diamond structure appears downstream the narrowing region image t 3 3699 s although less maker than in case 1 the two dimensional water depth h fields over the initial flat bed computed with the fcm scheme at times t 1 6 s t 1 8 s t 2 0 s t 2 3 s and t 2 6 s is shown fig 19 using the mpm left column and wu right column formulations for the bedload transport rate estimation the results obtained with the acm shows a quite similar water depth evolution hence they are not shown both schemes are again able to predict the arrival time of the wave front to the narrowing as well as the appearance and evolution of both the upstream hydraulic jump and the diamond structure downstream the narrowing region with respect to the influence of the bedload transport rate formulation in the water depth temporal evolution the simulation performed using the wu relationship shows a slightly slower wave front progression than that performed using the mpm formula as in previous case 1 fig 20 depicts the temporal evolution of the water depth h extracted from the two dimensional kinect measurements at the same gauge points as in case 1 upstream the narrowing p1 at the center of the narrowing p2 downstream the narrowing p3 and near to the upstream corner of the rectangular narrowing pieces p4 right and p4 left data obtained from the numerical simulations using the fcm scheme are also plotted for comparison regardless of the empirical formulation chosen for the bedload transport rate estimation the proposed numerical schemes predict well the water depth h at all the gauge points considered with the exception of the first stages after the wave front arrival at the gauge points p4 where the vertical accelerations are again huge and hence the hydrostatic hypothesis is not fully valid fig 21 depicts the bed changes measured in laboratory after the bed layer was totally dry and the comparison with the numerical results obtained at the end of the simulations the bathymetry after the dambreak wave observed in the experiments is again characterized by high erosion at the center of the narrowing especially near to the upstream corner of the narrowing walls and by the appearance of a diffused diamond shape deposition bar downstream both the fcm and the acm schemes are able to predict these characteristic structures in the bed layer regardless of the empirical formulation selected for the bedload transport nevertheless the erosion region is much more pronounced with the wu bedload rate formulation and also the length and shape of the deposition bar is better predicted this leads to much lower rmse for the numerical bed elevation z b with the wu expression compared with those obtained with the mpm formula see table 11 furthermore the fcm scheme shows lower rmse for z b and computational times than the approximate coupled method for this experimental case 6 conclusions in this work the numerical resolution of the bedload sediment transport system composed by the two dimensional shallow water equations and the mass conservation for the bed layer have been implemented using two different coupled strategies between the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system both strategies for transient simulations are based on the finite volume method fvm using the roe s approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells on the one hand the first strategy called fcm is based on the full coupling of the 2d shallow water and bedload transport equations leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation z b into the resolution of the approximated local riemann problem rp at the edges new explicit expressions have been provided for the wave and source strengths the stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the approximate jacobian matrix at each intercell edge on the other hand an alternative approximate coupled strategy called acm is proposed based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the maximum time step allowed by means of an approximation of the bounds of the coupled jacobian matrix eigenvalues this method allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges than those of the fcm and the approximate coupled time step limitation improves the stability of the scheme both resolution strategies have been implemented into the same cpu based computational kernel and hence a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and efficiency of both method can be performed without the influence of external factors the proposed fcm and acm strategies have been compared to exact solution idealized tests and experimental transient data in order to analyse their behaviour first the convergence property has been studied using a transient 1d bedload transport case with exact solution both models demonstrate to converge to the exact solution of the problem as the mesh is refined with a similar error order then both schemes have been tested against 1d symmetrical dambreak tests to assess their stability and efficiency dealing with highly transient flows in case of subcritical dambreak for small bed flow interaction factors g the fully coupled and the approximate coupled scheme performed similarly showing the fcm method a slightly larger computational time due to the higher number of algebraical operations required nevertheless for medium grass factors small differences appeared between the fcm and the acm solutions but both model remained non oscillatory and stable when high grass interaction factors take place the acm model showed spurious oscillations from the first stages of the dambreak flow especially at the bed rarefaction wave region whereas the fcm scheme remained non oscillatory furthermore this spurious oscillation caused the 50 efficiency reduction of the approximate coupled method when the dambreak flow occurred in supercritical regime the appearance of spurious oscillations with the acm scheme occurred also with medium bed flow interaction factors g being the lost of efficiency 40 approximately respect to the fcm scheme furthermore the wave front propagation also was slower with the acm than that with the fcm method it is worth mentioning that the incorrect predictions of wave speeds observed for the approximate coupled scheme in these short term synthetic cases as well as for totally decoupled scheme will affect increasingly the quality of the numerical results when these models are faced to real scale long term simulations the capability of both proposed scheme to deal with structured and unstructured meshes regardless of the number of edges of the cells has been demonstrated using a 2d idealized supercritical symmetrical dambreak case and setting a medium grass interaction factor the results obtained with the fcm scheme did not depend on the mesh topology whereas using unstructured triangular meshes helps the acm method to reduce the spurious oscillation observed in square orthogonal meshes due to the higher numerical diffusion however the approximate coupled model was approximately 50 less efficient than the fcm scheme regardless of the mesh topology and also underestimated the advance velocity of the dambreak wave front finally the proposed numerical schemes have been faced to two highly unsteady erosive experimental cases both experiments consist of a dambreak wave progressing over a movable flat bed throughout a narrowing created with semi cylindrical case 1 and rectangular case 2 pieces to generate a fully two dimensional flow the grass interaction factor was estimated using the meyer peter müller and the wu relationships for the bedload transport rate both schemes were able to predict with an acceptable accuracy the bed changes caused by the dambreak wave propagation and the flow structured generated during the experiments in this case both model have shown a almost similar performance in terms of efficiency robustness and accuracy summarizing it is worthy to state that decoupled or weakly coupled strategies such as acm scheme for the bedload transport system of equations which are widespread because of their simple implementation can only guarantee non oscillatory results when the bed flow interaction is very small if the grass factor is medium or high g o 10 2 the acm scheme loses its accuracy and robustness furthermore for highly erosive flows the fcm scheme demonstrated to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the

289,the bedload transport system of equations composed by the two dimensional shallow water equations for the free surface flow motion and the 2d exner or bedload transport equation for the erodible bed layer is used for a wide range of sediment transport processes in environmental surface flows in this work the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system the first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations fcm leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local riemann problem rp at the edges the stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled jacobian matrix at each intercell edge on the second hand an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled jacobian matrix eigenvalues this method called approximate coupled acm allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme both strategies are based on the finite volume fv method using roe s approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same cpu based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency the acm can only guarantee non oscillatory results when the bed flow interaction factor is small g o 10 3 if the interaction factor g is medium or high g o 10 2 the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness furthermore for highly erosive flows the fcm scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the acm one of the key points for large scale and long term bedload transport realistic applications keywords bedload transport models hydro morphodynamical coupled equations augmented roe schemes efficiency and robustness 1 introduction sediment transport is a common process in environmental surface flows such as rivers coasts or estuaries the sediment particles can be transported by two basic mechanisms suspended load that consists of the particles moving in the water column with the same velocity as the fluid and bedload transport which accounts for the sediment mass moving by rolling ans saltation mechanisms in a relatively thin layer over the static erodible stratum in this thin layer called bedload or transport layer the sediment particles are generally in contact with the static bed and their velocity is much lower than the flow velocity wu 2007 despite the total sediment mass transported by the suspension mechanism can be much larger than that moving in the transport layer the bedload mechanism plays a key role in sand gravel alluvial beds and it can cause rapid and marked changes in the bed bathymetry two dimensional bedload transport mathematical models are composed by the shallow water equations supplemented with the bedload transport equation for the erodible bed layer also called exner equation exner 1925 accounting for the bed level evolution although numerical modelling of erosive free surface flows in realistic situations involves transient conditions and movable boundaries most of the computational methods for bedload simulations decouple the resolution of the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system struiksma 1999 tingsanchali and chinnarasri 2001 juez et al 2014 caviedes voullième et al 2017 theoretically decoupled resolution has two important advantages hudson and sweby 2003 first it allows the usage of well validated numerical schemes for the hydrodynamical component i e 2d shallow water solvers murillo and garcía navarro 2010b 2012 able to deal with complex topography and wet dry fronts second decoupled strategies lead to simpler algebraical algorithms reducing the computational effort in large scale and long term realistic bedload simulations in order to ensure the stability of the explicitly computed numerical solution the time step should be small enough to avoid the interaction of waves from neighbouring riemann problems in most decoupled numerical models for bedload transport the limitation of the time step at each intercell edge is usually addressed using the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and assuming that the fastest wave celerity corresponds to the absolute maximum of the hydrodynamical jacobian matrix eigenvalues when the morphodynamical and the hydrodynamical components of the mathematical system are considered coupled the celerities of the characteristic waves i e the eigenvalues of the convective fluxes jacobian matrix are affected by the interaction between flow and bed elevation changes if the characteristic time of the bed evolution process is small enough in comparison with the characteristic time of the flow the stability region of the coupled system can be approximated using only the eigenvalues of the flow jacobian however for highly erosive flows the characteristic time of the bed evolution process can be as fast as the characteristic time of the flow and the stability region of the coupled system is reduced castro díaz et al 2008 martínez aranda et al 2019a therefore decoupled strategies suffer from numerical stability problems since the presence of rapid bed elevation changes can affect considerably the propagation celerity of the characteristic waves and hence reduce the stability region of the bed flow system cordier et al 2011 in order to improve the stability of the decoupled explicit schemes in fast bed evolution problems juez et al 2014 caviedes voullième et al 2017 have proposed a weakly coupled strategy including a virtual bedload celerity for the estimation of the maximum time step in this way it brings in some coupling through the choice of the time step although this strategy improves the stability of the scheme it also overestimates the virtual bedload celerity for near flat bed condition leading to an important reduction on the time step and hence of the scheme performance contrarily fully coupled bedload strategies ensure the stability of the numerical solution even for highly erosive flows but the complexity of the numerical algorithms usually complicates their application to realistic scenarios most of the fully coupled schemes reported in the last years are limited to 1d frameworks martínez aranda et al 2019a fernández nieto et al 2014 2017 martínez aranda et al 2019b zhang and duan 2011 hudson and sweby 2003 are based on highly diffusive numerical solvers fraccarollo et al 2003 wu and wang 2007 goutière et al 2008 soares frazao et al 2012 or require complex numerical algorithm hardly applicable to realistic environmental flows murillo and garcía navarro 2010a liu and beljadid 2017 furthermore one of the assumed drawbacks of the fully coupled strategies is their high computational cost couple formulations involve a larger number of algebraic calculation compared with decoupled schemes reducing their computational efficiency in realistic application nevertheless objective comparison of coupled and decoupled methods are rarely found in literature cordier et al 2011 juez et al 2014 meurice and soares frazão 2020 and usually do not provide detailed data in terms of computational effort in this work two different strategies for the coupling of the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the 2d bedload transport system are proposed both strategies are based on the finite volume method fvm using the roe s approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells on the one hand a fully coupled scheme fcm for the 2d shallow water and bedload transport equations is proposed leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local riemann problem rp at the edges new explicit expressions are provided for the wave and source strengths the stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled jacobian matrix at each intercell edge on the other hand an alternative approximate coupled strategy acm is proposed the shallow water and the bed transport equations are solved independently at each time step but the maximum time step required to ensure the scheme stability is controlled by an approximation of the coupled jacobian matrix eigenvalues this method allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges than those of the fully coupled method the main goal is to perform a thorough quantitative comparison of both kind of strategies for 2d bedload transport systems in terms of robustness accuracy and computational efficiency additionally a new set of experimental tests carried out in a laboratory flume using rgb d sensors is provided for benchmarking numerical bedload models this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the two dimensional equations for the free surface water flow and the bedload solid transport with different sediment size classes are introduced section 3 is devoted to the finite volume method and the detailed description of the fcm and acm riemann solvers the extension of the methods to realistic empirical relationships for the bedload solid transport rate is reported in section 4 in section 5 both numerical schemes are validated using analytical idealized and transient experimental benchmarking cases involving low medium and high flow bed interaction finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 depth averaged two dimensional model for bedload transport the depth averaged model for the multi grain bedload transport is derived from the integration of the navier stokes equations along the vertical direction throughout the flow and bed layer assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution and includes the mass and momentum conservation

bedload transport layer is expressed as 4 t z b x q b x y q b y 0 where q b x q b y are the components of the bulk volumetric bedload rate q b along the x y horizontal coordinates respectively for

method system 7 is time dependent non linear and contains source terms under the hypothesis of dominant advection it can be classified as belonging to the family of hyperbolic systems in order to obtain a numerical solution using a finite volume fv technique the spatial domain is divided in computational cells using a mesh fixed in time and system 7 is integrated in each cell ω i using the

area of the i cell associated to the k th edge the theory of riemann problems rp can be used to solve the intercell fluxes in the 2d problem 17 for each k th cell edge it is possible to define a local 1d rp by projecting 7 along n murillo and navas montilla 2016 martínez aranda et al 2020 furthermore 7 satisfies the rotation invariance property godlewski and raviart 1996 castro et al 2009 and hence can be expressed in the local framework x y corresponding to normal and tangential directions to each cell edge respectively defining a rotation matrix t k for the k th cell edge as 18 t k 1 0 0 0 0 n x n y 0 0 n y n x 0 0 0 0 1 k which satisfies the condition 19 e n k f u n x g u n y k t k 1 f t k u being t k 1 the inverse matrix of t k the local rp normal to the k th cell edge can be expressed in

v u n y v n x are the flow velocities along the x and y coordinates respectively and the local convective fluxes f u f t k u can be expressed as 22 f u f t k u h u h u 2 1 2 g h 2 h u v 1 1 ξ g u 2 u allowing to define the jacobian matrix of the convective fluxes as 23 j k f u u 0 1 0 0 g h u 2 2 u 0 0 u v v u 0 u a v b a b 0 k where 24 a q b h u 1 1 ξ g 3 u 2 v 2 1 h 0 b q b h v 1 1 ξ g 2 u v 1 h

transport rate increases as the normal discharge grows second when the bedload transport flux q b is computed by means of empirical relationships these derivatives require a suitable treatment to ensure solid mass conservation across the cell edge as it is detailed in section 4 the augmented value of the fluxes through the k th cell edge in 17 incorporates the non conservative contribution of the momentum source terms s b and s τ into the convective fluxes e n k using the rotation invariance property 25 t k s b t k h x u x n x h y u y n y k h k u x where h k h x u and the bed pressure

n x t n y 0 0 k t being t k τ b k d n k the friction momentum contribution spatially integrated over the control volume it can be estimated as the average of the boundary shear stress τ b k times the normal distance d n k between cell centers sharing k th cell edge including momentum source terms 26 and 28 into the solution of the local plane rp 20 it is possible to rewrite 17 as 30 d d t ω i u d ω k 1 n e t k 1 f u s b s τ k l k where f u k are the convective fluxes at the edge resulting from the homogenous rp whereas s b and s τ are the upwind contribution of the bed slope and friction momentum terms respectively to the numerical flux at the left side of the k th edge corresponding to the i cell therefore it is possible to define an augmented numerical flux f k for the i cell at the k th edge which incorporates the integrated bed pressure and friction dissipation terms into the homogeneous fluxes at the cell edge ensuring the well balance property for steady states murillo and garcía navarro 2010b 31 f k f u s b s τ k replacing 31 into 30 the updating formula for the conserved variables u at the cells is obtained 32 u i n 1 u i n δ t a i k 1 n e t k 1 f k l k where δ t t n

augmented roe solver a roe approach roe 1981 toro 1997 murillo and garcía navarro 2010b to solve the augmented numerical fluxes at the cell edges leading to two different fv methods for coupling flow and bedload transport the main goal of this work is to compare robustness accuracy and efficiency of both fv methods 3 1 fully coupled riemann solver fcm the plane rp 20 defined in the local framework

takes the value of the normal velocity u corresponding to the tangential shear wave in the rp structure the remaining three eigenvalues referred as a b and c can be computed exactly applying the cardano vieta formula to solve the roots of the cubic polynomial r λ λ u λ 2 c 2 c 2 a λ u 0 considering right going motion u 0 regardless of the flow regime subcritical supercritical the eigenvalues λ m k can be sorted as follows 38 λ 1 k a 0 λ 2 k b λ 3 k u k λ 4 k c where a b and c are the roots of r λ similarly for left going flow u 0 the coupled eigenvalues are 39 λ 1 k a λ 2 k u k λ 3 k b 0 λ 4 k c and in addition it can be demonstrated that 40 λ 1 k u c k λ 4 k u c k therefore it is possible to conclude that i one of the eigenvalues has always opposite direction to the flow transporting information upstream and the remaining three eigenvalues have the same direction as the flow ii the maximum wave celerity in the coupled eigenstructure is higher than the pure hydrodynamic wave celerity reducing the actual stability region of the local rp from now on we consider right going flow u 0 for sake of clarity but the following results can be straightforward derived for left going flow u 0 the associated orthogonal basis of eigenvectors e m k of m k is used to built the matrix p k e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 k as 41 p k 1 1 c 2 b 1 λ 1 λ 2 c 2 b u λ 4 v v c 2 v b u v λ 1 u 2 c 2 c 2 λ 2 u

main diagonal one result of roe s linearization is that the approximate riemann solution consists of only discontinuities and u x t is constructed as a sum of jumps or shocks the solution for u x t is governed by the celerities in λ k and consists of four regions connected by 5 waves one of them a contact wave with null celerity accounting for the integrated resistance source term s τ k at x 0 according to the godunov type method it is sufficient to provide the solution for u x t at the intercell position x 0 in order to obtain the updating numerical fluxes f k 31 the numerical flux at the left and right side of the k th cell edge can be estimated using an approximate flux function f x t 43 f k lim x 0 f x t f u i f k lim x 0 f x t f u j being u i and u j the intermediate states of the

can be expressed as 49 u i u i m γ m e m k u j u j m γ m e m k where γ m α m β m λ m and the subscript m and m under the sums indicate waves travelling inward and outward the i cell therefore the approximated solution for the flux function f x t can also be constructed by defining appropriate rankine hugoniot rh relations across each moving wave the solution of the approximate flux function

contact wave rosatti and begnudelli 2010 li and chen 2006 between the approximate solutions u i and u j the corresponding flux jump for the approximate solution is given by 51 f k f k m 1 4 β m e m k s τ k and hence the updating formula 32 can be applied using the augmented numerical flux f k in 50 finally in order to ensure the stability of the explicitly computed numerical solution the time step

fluxes 61 the numerical flux for the bed layer continuity equation 4 referred as f k 4 is computed separately at each time step by solving the following approximated scalar rp juez et al 2014 62 z b t λ b k z b x 0 z b x 0 z b i n if x 0 z b j n if x 0 where a virtual bedload wave celerity λ b k is defined as 63 λ b k δ q b δ z b k note that the scalar rp 62 is homogeneous and hence there does not exist a jump between the left and right inner states of the approximated flux function at x 0 therefore it possible to assess f k 4 f k 4 allowing to compute the bedload numerical flux at the k cell edge as 64 f k 4 q b i n if λ b k 0 q b j n if λ b k 0 and the morphodynamical conserved variables z b is also updated using formula 32 with the intercell solid flux 64 this separate formulation and the corresponding separate numerical resolution would lead to a decoupled model it is known that totally decoupled schemes suffer from oscillations and instabilities in many flow conditions previous works juez et al 2014 caviedes voullième et al 2017 defined a weakly coupled strategy by controlling the global numerical stability by means of the most restrictive among the hydrodynamic eigenvalues 56 and the virtual bed load celerity 63 this approach was useful but can be improved in order to ensure the stability of this decoupled scheme without reducing the computational performance even for fast bed evolution conditions a new strategy for the restriction of the time step is also proposed this strategy leads to an approximate coupling of the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system for each k cell edge the maximum time step is limited considering the characteristic eigenstructure of the coupled pseudo jacobin matrix m k 34 following cordier et al 2011 even without calculating the exact eigenvalues λ m k their minimum and maximum values can be bounded into an approximated range λ 1 λ 4 k using the mathematical properties of the characteristic polynomial p λ 37 the eigenvalues a b and c of the sub polynomial r λ 38 39 can be analyzed graphically as intersection of a cubic curve f 1 λ λ u λ 2 c 2 representing the hydrodynamical component of the system with a straight line f 2 λ c 2 a λ u accounting for the morphodynamic component this is shown in fig 1 considering right going flow u 0 and subcritical flow regime but the procedure can bed extended to supercritical conditions and left going flow u 0 without loss of generality the lower and upper bounds λ 1 and λ 4 respectively can be estimated as the intersection of the straight line f 2 λ with two auxiliary straight lines t 1 λ and t 4 λ these auxiliary straight lines are tangential to the cubic function f 1 λ at the points u c k and u c k respectively hence the upper and lower bounds are computed as 65 lower bound t 1 λ f 2 λ λ 1 k u c θ 1 c 2 a u θ 1 c 2 a k upper bound t 4 λ f 2 λ λ 4 k u c θ 4 c 2 a u θ 4 c 2 a k being the parameter θ 1 f 1 λ λ u c k the value of the first derivative of the cubic curve f 1 λ at λ u c k and similarly θ 4 f 1 λ λ u c k the value of the first derivative of f 1 λ at λ u c k finally the limiting time step at k th cell edge is computed using 66 δ t k min a i a j l k max λ 1 k λ 4 k and the global time step δ t t n 1 t n is limited using the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition as 67 δ t cfl min k δ t k with cfl 1 4 extension to empirical bedload transport rate formulations in this work the factors g p are calculated using the generalized model proposed in martínez aranda et al 2019b 2020 and assuming capacity state for the solid transport at the bedload layer hence g p is not uniform in space and can be expressed as a function of the flow depth h the dimensionless size specific shields stress θ p and the transport layer thickness η p for the p th sediment class 68 g p γ 1 h γ 2 θ p γ 3 η p expressions for functions γ 1 γ 2 and γ 3 are provided in martínez aranda et al 2019b 2020 for some of the empirical capacity

density ratio being ρ p the density of the sediment grains n p is the specific manning roughness coefficient which is calculated as n p d p 1 6 21 1 strickler 1923 k d and k e are two constants accounting for the deposition and erosion exchange fluxes respectively between the transport layer and the underlying static bed stratum θ c is the incipient motion shields stress threshold and δ θ j is the excess of shields stress for the p th sediment class calculated as 69 δ θ p θ p θ c if θ p θ c 0 otherwise here θ p is calculated using the balance between the turbulent shear force exerted by the flow on the sediment grains at the top of the bed layer and the gravitational force 70 θ p n p 2 u 2 s 1 d p h 1 3 under capacity transport state the thickness of the bedload transport layer for the p th sediment class η p is estimated as 71 η p k e s k d δ θ p d p therefore the bulk grass type interaction factor g used to compute the bedload transport rate q b normal to the k th cell edge in 22 varies spatially as a function of the local flow features at the left and right cells following murillo and garcía navarro 2010a martínez aranda et al 2019a b the discrete jump in the solid flux

u j g being the averaged interaction factor at the k th cell edge incorporating this solid flux splitting into the numerical scheme requires to consider δ q b g u i u j as the solid discharge discrete jump in both the fully and approximate coupled riemann solvers furthermore a corrector term must be added to the computation of the numerical intercell fluxes this corrector term accounts for the variation of the bulk grass interaction factor between the cell center and the averaged value g used at the edge the extended numerical fluxes referred as f k are defined as 74 f k f k f i δ where f k is calculated using 50 in the fcm solver and 61 64 in the acm solver and f i δ is the corrector term computed as 75 f i δ 0 0 0 1 1 p g g i u i 2 v i 2 u i k for both fv methods the final updating formula for the conserved variables can be expressed as 76 u i n 1 u i n δ t a i k 1 n e t k 1 f k l k 5 numerical results 5 1 exact solution case the goal of this test is to assess the capability of both numerical methods to converge to the exact solution of a transient bedload transport problem an exact solution for the 1d shallow water bedload system was proposed by berthon et al 2012 considering a frictionless case with constant flow discharge q h u throughout the spatial domain and the grass formulation for the bedload discharge q b a g u 2 u with a g 1 1 ξ g c o n s t the 1d transient exact solution for system 1 4 can be expressed as 77 u α x β a g 2 3 h q u z b 0 z b t 0 u 3 2 gq 2 gu γ z b t z b 0 α t being α β and γ constant parameters g the gravity acceleration and z b 0 the initial bed elevation for this test case α 0 005 β 0 005 γ 2 q 1 m 2 s and a g 0 01 s 2 m are set considering a 1d spatial domain x 0 10 m the transient exact solution 77 for both the free surface elevation h z b and the bed elevation z b at t 10 s is shown in fig 2 in order to analyze the convergence of both numerical schemes fcm and acm to the exact solution six one dimensional square cell meshes are considered increasing the number of cells from the coarsest m100 with 100 cells of edge length δ x 0 1 m to the finest m3200 with 3200 cells of edge length δ x 0 003125 m constant flow and bedload solid discharges q 1 m 2 s and q b 0 005 m 2 s respectively are set as boundary conditions at the inlet section whereas the normal flow depth h 0 5665 m is imposed at the outlet boundary the cfl is set to 1 0 for all the simulations the computed results at t 10 s for the free surface and bed elevations using fcm and the mesh m100 have been depicted in fig 2 the convergence of the fcm and acm method to the exact solution is analyzed using the l 1 and l error norms fig 3 left shows the l 1 norm for the water depth h and bed elevation z b with both fcm and acm whereas fig 3 right shows the l error norm for h and z b the acm solver obtains a smaller l 1 norm than the fcm method whereas the values of the l norm are similar for both numerical schemes the values of the l 1 and l error norms of the water depth h and the bed elevation z b have been summarized in tables 2 and 3 for the fcm and acm schemes respectively the convergence order of both methods between refinement steps has also been computed based on the error norms values both the fcm and the acm riemann solvers are able to converge to the exact solution of the test with a similar convergence order 5 2 synthetic tests 5 2 1 test a 1d subcritical symmetric dambreak this synthetic test aims at assessing the stability of both fcm and acm as the bedload transport component increases its importance a frictionless 1d symmetrical dambreak over flat bed is considered with the following initial conditions 78 h x 0 1 m if 0 5 x 0 5 0 2 m otherwise u x 0 0 m s x v x 0 0 m s x z b x 0 1 m x which allow subcritical flow f r u g h 1 during the whole test all the simulations are performed using a one dimensional square cell mesh with δ x 0 01 m edge length and cfl 1 the bedload transport rate is calculated considering one sediment class with porosity ξ 0 40 and a constant flow bed interaction factor g 0 001 s 2 m low interaction g 0 01 s 2 m medium interaction and g 0 1 s 2 m high interaction the final time is t 1 0 s for all the simulations fig 4 shows the free surface and bed elevation profiles at t 0 1 s t 0 3 s and t 0 6 s for both fcm and acm numerical schemes on both sides of the symmetric dambreak the solution is characterized by a frontal shock wave which affects the flow and erodible bed layers followed by a rarefaction wave between the domain center and the front wave which creates a highly eroded region as the interaction factor g grows the magnitude of the sediment sock wave and the highly eroded region also increases affecting greatly the flow structure for low interaction g 0 001 s 2 m see fig 4 a both methods remain stable and show quite similar solutions for the free surface and bed elevation as g increases differences between the fcm and the acm schemes appear for medium interaction factor g 0 01 s 2 m fig 4 b although both schemes offer a stable behaviour some differences appear at the bed level profile as time progresses especially at the transition between the shock wave and the rarefaction region when the value of g is increased to 0 1 s 2 m representing a high interaction between the flow and the bedload layer see fig 4 c the acm scheme becomes oscillatory at the shock rarefaction transition at the first stages of the dambreak as time progresses these spurious oscillations grow and cause the acm solution to lose its symmetric behaviour however the fcm solution remains stable smooth and symmetrical even for high interaction factor values although the solution obtained with the acm scheme loses symmetry and shows local spurious oscillations for high flow bed interaction the proposed approximate coupled time step limitation applied in the acm method demonstrates to improve greatly the stability of the scheme fig 5 shows the bed and flow levels at t 0 6 s using the acm scheme compared with the results obtained if only the flow eigenvalues 56 are taken into account for limiting the time step totally decoupled scheme low g 0 1 s 2 m medium g 0 1 s 2 m and high g 0 1 s 2 m values for the grass interaction factor are analysed for low and medium interaction factors the acm and the totally decoupled methods perform almost similar in this synthetic test however if high interaction values are considered the totally decoupled scheme fails and the solution loses the stability whereas the acm method only shows some local deviations from the fcm solution although in this synthetic case the decoupled method only shows stability loss for grass factors of order g o 10 1 the totally decoupled resolution can fail in the wide range of flow conditions which involves medium or even low bed flow interaction cordier et al 2011 furthermore table 4 shows the computational time required for both numerical schemes to complete the simulation the acm method shows a slightly smaller computational effort for low and medium flow bed interaction factor since the fcm scheme requires more complicated algebraical operations to compute the solution nevertheless for high interaction factor the appearance of spurious oscillations in the acm solution causes an important loss of efficiency of the decoupled scheme whereas the fcm solver remains stable and requires a much smaller computational time to perform the simulation the speed up of the fcm solver is near 1 5 for g 0 1 s 2 m test 5 2 2 test a 1d supercritical symmetric dambreak the goal of this synthetic test is to demonstrate the capability of both schemes to deal with regime changes in the flow and to asses their stability in these configurations as in the previous synthetic test a frictionless 1d symmetrical dambreak over flat bed is considered with the following initial conditions 79 h x 0 50 m if 5 x 5 0 2 m otherwise u x 0 0 m s x v x 0 0 m s x z b x 0 10 m x which allow the flow to change from subcritical f r u g h 1 at the center of the domain to supercritical f r u g h 1 at the dambreak wave fronts all the simulations are performed using a one dimensional square cell mesh with δ x 0 1 m edge length and cfl 1 the bedload transport rate is calculated considering one sediment class with porosity ξ 0 40 and a constant flow bed iteration factor g 0 01 s 2 m the final time is t 1 0 s for all the simulations fig 6 left shows the free surface and bed elevation profiles at t 0 1 s t 0 3 s and t 0 6 s for both fcm and acm numerical schemes whereas the froude number of the flow throughout the right side of the symmetric dambreak is depicted in fig 6 right for both schemes at the same times at t 0 1 s the flow structure is characterized by a supercritical shock wave which strongly affects the erodible bed layer followed by a transcritical rarefaction wave where the flow changes from subcritical to supercritical at x 5 m at t 0 3 s the transcritical region behind the supercritical wave front increases and two critical points can be distinguished at x 3 5 m and x 6 5 m respectively with a slightly subcritical region between them the appearance of two critical points in the flow structure is a direct consequence of the high interaction between the flow and the movable bed as the dambreak progresses this double critical point structure disappears and only one regime change is observed separating the supercritical wave front and the rarefaction wave x 9 m at t 0 6 s both numerical methods demonstrate to be stable when dealing with flow regime changes however the acm shows spurious oscillations in the water depth h and bed elevation z b generated around the critical points furthermore the acm scheme predicts a slower advance of the dambreak wave front than that of the fcm scheme this difference could be related to a slower characteristic wave celerity for the flow motion since the decoupled approach does not take into account the influence of the bed changes in the jacobian eigenvalues contrarily to the fcm method it is worth noting that the predicted froude numbers at the dambreak wave front are also smaller for the acm simulation f r 4 than that computed using the fcm scheme f r 5 as in the previous subcritical dambreak case for high flow bed interaction although the solution obtained with the acm scheme shows local spurious oscillations the approximated coupled time step estimation improves greatly the stability of the scheme fig 7 shows the bed and flow levels at t 0 6 s using the acm scheme compared with the results obtained by the totally decoupled strategy also in this test involving a medium flow bed interaction factor g 0 01 s 2 m the totally decoupled scheme fails and loses the stability whereas the acm method only shows local oscillation and does not loss the solution symmetry furthermore the high interaction between the flow and the movable bed leads to a slower computational time for the fully coupled method compared with the acm scheme even though the fcm method requires more complicated algebraical operations to compute numerical fluxes at the intercell edges the speed up of the fcm solver against the acm approach is near 1 4 for this test see table 5 5 2 3 test c 2d supercritical symmetric dambreak the aim of this synthetic test is to assess the capability of both schemes to deal with structured and unstructured meshes regardless of the number of edges of the cells the idealized supercritical symmetric dambreak reported above for synthetic test b see 79 is considered here but over a two dimensional 50 10 m domain discretized using three different kind of mesh an orthogonal square cell mesh sq a structured triangle cell mesh ts and an unstructured triangle cell mesh tu details of the three mesh topologies are shown in fig 8 and their geometrical characteristics have been reported in table 6 all the simulations are performed considering one sediment class with porosity ξ 0 40 and a constant flow bed interaction factor g 0 01 s 2 m as in the above synthetic test b the final time is t 1 0 s and the cfl is set to 0 5 for the three meshes in order to compare computational times fig 9 shows a view of the free surface and bed elevation at t 0 3 s using the fcm scheme the color scale denotes the free surface level and the bed changes magnitude respectively regardless of the kind of mesh the scheme is able to compute correctly the evolution of the symmetric dambreak with the same flow structure as in the above one dimensional test b furthermore the longitudinal free surface and bed level profiles along the right side of the symmetric dambreak x 0 m have been plotted in fig 10 with the three meshes at t 0 1 s t 0 3 s and t 0 6 s the left column depicts the results obtained with the fcm scheme whereas the right column shows those predicted by the acm approach regarding the fcm results small differences appear in the free surface and bed level depending on the mesh selected but these can be considered negligible and mainly related to the differences on the numerical diffusion between the three mesh topologies contrarily the acm scheme shows a more marked dependence on the mesh topology since the spurious oscillations observed in the above one dimensional test b also appear for the orthogonal square mesh sq whereas the higher numerical diffusion associated to the triangular meshes especially in the unstructured topology tu reduces this spurious oscillations therefore differences in the solution depending on the mesh topology arise with the acm method although they can be considered small table 7 shows the computational times required to complete the simulation with each mesh for both fv methods the computational effort increases for the triangular meshes ts and tu especially for the unstructured topology with respect to the orthogonal square mesh sq this increment is mainly caused by the larger number of cells for the triangular meshes ts and tu interestingly despite the acm scheme does not show important spurious oscillations in the solution its efficiency is lower than that of the fcm method for all the mesh topologies tested the speed up of the fcm is about 1 5 times that of the decoupled scheme this loss of efficiency of the acm is related to more restricted stability conditions fig 11 shows the time step restriction for the fcm and acm schemes along the simulated time with the three meshes considered sq ts and tu moreover for the approximate coupled simulations the global time step limitations associated to both the hydrodynamical eigenvalues λ m k 56 and the virtual bed celerity λ b k 63 at the cell edges are also depicted on the one hand regardless of the mesh topology the maximum time steps allowed for the fcm method are slightly smaller than those obtained considering only the hydrodynamical component of the flow because of the influence of the movable bed in the local rp eigenstructure on the other hand the approximate coupled strategy leads to a more restricted time step limitation than the fully coupled approach since as the flow bed interaction increases the approximated bounds λ 1 k λ 4 k 65 move away from the exact eigenvalues see fig 1 nevertheless the maximum time step associated to these approximated bounds is several orders of magnitude higher than the time step limitation derived from considering the virtual bed celerity λ b k therefore the usage of this approximate coupled strategy to limit the maximum time step ensures the stability of the decoupled numerical scheme even for high flow bed interaction problems as well as it avoids unsuitable time step limitations associated to including the virtual bed celerity λ b k in the stability determination 5 3 experimental tests in this section both numerical schemes are faced to two dimensional highly erosive flow experiments carried out at the laboratory of hydraulics of the university of zaragoza martínez aranda et al 2020 these experiments consist of a dambreak wave moving along a 3 25 m long and 24 c m wide flume over a 5 c m depth erodible flat bed made of non cohesive sand the cross section of the flume was modified by creating a 11 c m long and 13 c m wide narrowing using both 11 c m diameter semi circular case 1 and 11 5 5 c m rectangular case 2 pieces centered at 150 c m from the flume beginning allowing the generation of two dimensional flow at the measurement region the dambreak wave was triggered by lifting a pneumatic gate which separates the flume from a 157 c m long and 81 c m wide upstream reservoir where the initial height of the water was 8 c m over the dry flume floor downstream the flume a 275 c m long sediment trap stored the eroded material before a recovery tank a rgb d sensor kinect microsoft 2010 was used to perform instantaneous measurements of the 2d transient water surface height during the wave propagation throughout the narrowing this device records the distance to the water free surface using an infrared light projection technique with 30 hz acquisition rate 1 4 mm spatial resolution and 1 2 mm precision approximately after the dambreak wave the 2d bed surface elevation was also recorded using the same rgb d sensor in order to determine the morphodynamical changes generated by the flow a skecth of the experiments setup is showed in fig 12 the erodible bed consisted of a mix of two uniform sand size classes with characteristic parameters shown in table 8 the global bed porosity is estimated as ξ 0 34 the deposition and erosion constant are set to k d 0 02 and k e 0 3 respectively and the manning resistance factor is calibrated to n 0 012 at the fixed bed regions and n 0 026 throughout the movable bed region 5 3 1 mesh refinement calibration in order to determine the mesh refinement level required to reduce the associated error maximizing the computational efficiency a previous blind study is performed using the semicircular narrowing geometry and five different unstructured triangular meshes with different refinement levels throughout the erodible bed region it is worth noting that the base mesh mb is maintained unchanged at the upstream reservoir and the fixed bed regions regardless of the refinement level at the movable bed region table 9 shows the geometrical characteristics of the five meshes considered the simulations are performed using the fcm scheme cfl 0 95 and the meyer peter müller formulation to estimate the bedload solid rate see table 1 the numerical results obtained with the different meshes at t 10 s are compared in terms of bed change error and computational efficiency in order to determine the optimal refinement level taking the finest mesh mr results as reference fig 13 left shows the root mean square error rmse for the bed level z b obtained with the meshes m1 m2 m3 and m4 respect to the those obtained with the reference mesh mr furthermore fig 13 right depicts the efficiency ratio between the rmse for z b and the computational time required by the model the rmse shows a uniform decrease with the mesh refinement whereas the ratio tends to an asymptotic behavior based on these results the mesh m4 is selected for the simulation of the experimental cases 5 3 2 case 1 semicircular narrowing case 1 considers the dambreak propagation throughout the flume with the semicircular narrowing geometry the simulations are performed using both the fcm and the acm models the meyer peter müller and the wu relationships are considered to estimate the bedload solid rate the simulations run until a time t 25 s so that the bedload transport totally stops fig 14 shows the two dimensional water depth h fields measured with the kinect sensor at different times after the gate opening the water depth h is expressed in c m referred to the original flat bed the dambreak wave front reaches the narrowing 1 6 s after the gate opening approximately initially two water columns rise up near the narrowing walls see t 1 8351 s image caused by the impact of the wave front on the semicircular walls this violent impact leads to marked vertical accelerations in the flow near the semicircular walls at the first stages after the wave arrival then these water columns disappear progressively images t 2 0355 s and t 2 3354 s as the wave front moves downstream a triangle shaped hydraulic jump appears upstream the narrowing and moves progressively to the flume beginning whereas the characteristic diamond structure is created downstream the narrowing region see t 2 7695 s and t 3 2035 s images the temporal evolution of the water depth over the initial flat bed computed with the fcm is shown fig 15 using the mpm left column and wu right column relationships for the bedload transport rate estimation results obtained with the acm shows a quite similar water depth evolution both numerical models are able to predict the arrival time of the wave front to the narrowing as well as the appearance and evolution of both the upstream hydraulic jump and the diamond structure downstream the narrowing region nevertheless the appearance of marked vertical acceleration during the first stages after the wave front arrival to the narrowing region shows the limitations of both models hydrostatic pressure assumption since they can not correctly predict the growth of the water columns near the semicircular narrowing walls after the wave front impact furthermore the triangular shape of the upstream hydraulic jump observed in the laboratory is not fully captured by the numerical models with respect to the influence of the bedload transport rate formulation in the water depth temporal evolution the simulation performed using the wu relationship shows a slightly slower wave front progression than that performed using the mpm formula as well as thinner diamond structures downstream the narrowing furthermore the triangular shape of the upstream hydraulic jump is also slightly better predicted using the wu formula than with the mpm relationship the temporal evolution of the water depth h over the initial flat bed is extracted from the two dimensional kinect sensor measurements at different gauge points upstream the narrowing p1 x 140 c m y 12 c m at the center of the narrowing p2 x 150 c m y 12 c m downstream the narrowing p3 x 165 c m y 12 c m and near the semicircular walls p4 right x 144 5 c m y 6 5 c m and p4 left x 144 5 c m y 17 5 c m fig 16 shows the measured water depth evolution at the considered gauge points and the comparison with the data obtained from the numerical simulations using the fcm scheme the numerical results obtained with the acm model are rather similar in general both the fcm and the acm schemes predict well the water depth tendency at all the gauge points considered regardless of the empirical relationship used for the bedload rate estimation but some differences appear and should be commented upstream the narrowing p1 both models predict a water depth increment sharper than was measured in the laboratory at the center of the narrowing p2 the numerical water depth evolution obtained with the mpm formula for the bedload transport rate shows a sharp increment at t 8 s which is not shown in the experimental data whereas the numerical results with the wu relationship show a more acceptable behaviour however the maximum water depth obtained with the wu formula at this gauge point is lower in the numerical simulations than in the experiments downstream the narrowing p3 both numerical schemes show again a sharper water depth increase than in the experimental data near the narrowing walls p4 right and p4 left the numerical results are in agreement with the measured water depth regardless of the formulation used for the bedload rate computation fig 17 depicts the bed changes measured in laboratory after the bed layer was totally dry and the comparison with the numerical results obtained at the end of the simulations the bathymetry after the dambreak wave observed in the experiments is characterized by high erosion at the center of the narrowing especially near the semicircular walls and by the appearance of a marked diamond shape deposition bar downstream the narrowing both the fully coupled and the approximate coupled models are able to predict these characteristic structures in the bed layer level regardless of the empirical formulation selected for the bedload transport however the length of the erosion region and the diamond shape deposition bar are better predicted with wu formula than using the mpm relation leading to lower rmse for the numerical bed elevation z b respect to the experimental results with the wu expression see table 10 furthermore the fcm scheme shows lower rmse for z b than the approximate coupled method whereas regarding the computational effort the fcm method is slightly more expensive than the acm scheme table 10 although those differences are practically negligible 5 3 3 case 2 rectangular narrowing case 2 considers the dambreak propagation throughout the flume with the rectangular narrowing geometry the simulations are performed following the same procedure and using the same parameters as in case 1 fig 18 shows the two dimensional water depth h fields measured with the kinect sensor at different times after the gate opening as in the previous case the wave reaches the narrowing 1 6 s after the gate opening and two marked water columns rise up near the narrowing walls see t 1 8661 s image caused by the impact of the wave front leading to marked vertical accelerations in the flow near the narrowing walls at the first stages after the front arrival then these water columns evolve progressively image t 2 0364 s and create a hydraulic jump upstream the narrowing which moves to the flume beginning see t 2 3364 s t 2 7705 s and t 3 3699 s images for this case the hydraulic jump is perpendicular to the flume axis almost from the first stages also the characteristic diamond structure appears downstream the narrowing region image t 3 3699 s although less maker than in case 1 the two dimensional water depth h fields over the initial flat bed computed with the fcm scheme at times t 1 6 s t 1 8 s t 2 0 s t 2 3 s and t 2 6 s is shown fig 19 using the mpm left column and wu right column formulations for the bedload transport rate estimation the results obtained with the acm shows a quite similar water depth evolution hence they are not shown both schemes are again able to predict the arrival time of the wave front to the narrowing as well as the appearance and evolution of both the upstream hydraulic jump and the diamond structure downstream the narrowing region with respect to the influence of the bedload transport rate formulation in the water depth temporal evolution the simulation performed using the wu relationship shows a slightly slower wave front progression than that performed using the mpm formula as in previous case 1 fig 20 depicts the temporal evolution of the water depth h extracted from the two dimensional kinect measurements at the same gauge points as in case 1 upstream the narrowing p1 at the center of the narrowing p2 downstream the narrowing p3 and near to the upstream corner of the rectangular narrowing pieces p4 right and p4 left data obtained from the numerical simulations using the fcm scheme are also plotted for comparison regardless of the empirical formulation chosen for the bedload transport rate estimation the proposed numerical schemes predict well the water depth h at all the gauge points considered with the exception of the first stages after the wave front arrival at the gauge points p4 where the vertical accelerations are again huge and hence the hydrostatic hypothesis is not fully valid fig 21 depicts the bed changes measured in laboratory after the bed layer was totally dry and the comparison with the numerical results obtained at the end of the simulations the bathymetry after the dambreak wave observed in the experiments is again characterized by high erosion at the center of the narrowing especially near to the upstream corner of the narrowing walls and by the appearance of a diffused diamond shape deposition bar downstream both the fcm and the acm schemes are able to predict these characteristic structures in the bed layer regardless of the empirical formulation selected for the bedload transport nevertheless the erosion region is much more pronounced with the wu bedload rate formulation and also the length and shape of the deposition bar is better predicted this leads to much lower rmse for the numerical bed elevation z b with the wu expression compared with those obtained with the mpm formula see table 11 furthermore the fcm scheme shows lower rmse for z b and computational times than the approximate coupled method for this experimental case 6 conclusions in this work the numerical resolution of the bedload sediment transport system composed by the two dimensional shallow water equations and the mass conservation for the bed layer have been implemented using two different coupled strategies between the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system both strategies for transient simulations are based on the finite volume method fvm using the roe s approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells on the one hand the first strategy called fcm is based on the full coupling of the 2d shallow water and bedload transport equations leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation z b into the resolution of the approximated local riemann problem rp at the edges new explicit expressions have been provided for the wave and source strengths the stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the approximate jacobian matrix at each intercell edge on the other hand an alternative approximate coupled strategy called acm is proposed based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the maximum time step allowed by means of an approximation of the bounds of the coupled jacobian matrix eigenvalues this method allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges than those of the fcm and the approximate coupled time step limitation improves the stability of the scheme both resolution strategies have been implemented into the same cpu based computational kernel and hence a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and efficiency of both method can be performed without the influence of external factors the proposed fcm and acm strategies have been compared to exact solution idealized tests and experimental transient data in order to analyse their behaviour first the convergence property has been studied using a transient 1d bedload transport case with exact solution both models demonstrate to converge to the exact solution of the problem as the mesh is refined with a similar error order then both schemes have been tested against 1d symmetrical dambreak tests to assess their stability and efficiency dealing with highly transient flows in case of subcritical dambreak for small bed flow interaction factors g the fully coupled and the approximate coupled scheme performed similarly showing the fcm method a slightly larger computational time due to the higher number of algebraical operations required nevertheless for medium grass factors small differences appeared between the fcm and the acm solutions but both model remained non oscillatory and stable when high grass interaction factors take place the acm model showed spurious oscillations from the first stages of the dambreak flow especially at the bed rarefaction wave region whereas the fcm scheme remained non oscillatory furthermore this spurious oscillation caused the 50 efficiency reduction of the approximate coupled method when the dambreak flow occurred in supercritical regime the appearance of spurious oscillations with the acm scheme occurred also with medium bed flow interaction factors g being the lost of efficiency 40 approximately respect to the fcm scheme furthermore the wave front propagation also was slower with the acm than that with the fcm method it is worth mentioning that the incorrect predictions of wave speeds observed for the approximate coupled scheme in these short term synthetic cases as well as for totally decoupled scheme will affect increasingly the quality of the numerical results when these models are faced to real scale long term simulations the capability of both proposed scheme to deal with structured and unstructured meshes regardless of the number of edges of the cells has been demonstrated using a 2d idealized supercritical symmetrical dambreak case and setting a medium grass interaction factor the results obtained with the fcm scheme did not depend on the mesh topology whereas using unstructured triangular meshes helps the acm method to reduce the spurious oscillation observed in square orthogonal meshes due to the higher numerical diffusion however the approximate coupled model was approximately 50 less efficient than the fcm scheme regardless of the mesh topology and also underestimated the advance velocity of the dambreak wave front finally the proposed numerical schemes have been faced to two highly unsteady erosive experimental cases both experiments consist of a dambreak wave progressing over a movable flat bed throughout a narrowing created with semi cylindrical case 1 and rectangular case 2 pieces to generate a fully two dimensional flow the grass interaction factor was estimated using the meyer peter müller and the wu relationships for the bedload transport rate both schemes were able to predict with an acceptable accuracy the bed changes caused by the dambreak wave propagation and the flow structured generated during the experiments in this case both model have shown a almost similar performance in terms of efficiency robustness and accuracy summarizing it is worthy to state that decoupled or weakly coupled strategies such as acm scheme for the bedload transport system of equations which are widespread because of their simple implementation can only guarantee non oscillatory results when the bed flow interaction is very small if the grass factor is medium or high g o 10 2 the acm scheme loses its accuracy and robustness furthermore for highly erosive flows the fcm scheme demonstrated to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the approximate couple strategy one of the key points for realistic bedload transport application credit authorship contribution statement s martínez aranda conceptualization methodology software
