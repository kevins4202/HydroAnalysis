3730,in this study a framework is proposed to estimate the nonstationary bivariate design flood which includes three key steps first a nonstationary copula model was constructed to analyze the temporal variation in the bivariate joint distribution second the equivalent reliability method was used to calculate the design value of the dominant variable for a return period and the design lifespan length under non stationarity third the design value of the secondary variable that was conditioned on the design value of the dominant variable was calculated using the conditional most likely combination and conditional expectation combination strategies through the above three steps the typical design value combination of the nonstationary bivariate was obtained for a specific design standard a case study based on the nonstationary annual maximum 1 day am1 and 15 day am15 flood volume at the yichang station was conducted to illustrate the framework the results indicate that the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes varied over time for a specific design standard the design values of the am15 and am1 flood volumes decreased with an increase in the design lifespan length moreover the conditional most likely estimation of the design value for the am1 flood volume that was conditioned on the design value for the am15 flood volume was greater than its conditional expectation estimation keywords nonstationary bivariate design flood nonstationary copula model conditional most likely combination conditional expectation combination equivalent reliability method 1 introduction the stationary hydrological frequency analysis hfa has been widely applied to infer the design flood for a specified design standard which is vital for hydraulic engineering construct and water resources planning and management for example the hfa was used to estimate the 100 year design flood peak and such estimation uncertainty was assessed in the light of model and parameter uncertainties by using bayesian method liang et al 2012b climate change and human activities are noticeably influencing the spatial temporal distribution of rainfall and the natural process of river flooding in regions around the world and leading to nonstationary variations in hydrological series groisman et al 2001 andersson et al 2006 liu et al 2008 milly et al 2008 bormann et al 2011 ingram 2016 over the last years significantly increasing attention has been paid to the nonstationary hfa because the stationary hfa is no longer theoretically applicable for a nonstationary situation strupczewski et al 2001 khaliq et al 2006 villarini et al 2009 vogel et al 2011 lópez and francés 2013 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2019 françois et al 2019 several studies have been carried out to propose typical approaches for the design flood estimation under non stationarity such as sample reconstruction based mixture distribution based and time varying distribution based approaches however these studies mainly focused on nonstationary univariate design flood estimation the sample reconstruction based approaches aim to reconstruct the nonstationary extreme flood series to ensure that the reconstructed series meets the stationarity requirements followed by calculation of the design flood using the stationary hfa xie et al 2005 chen et al 2017 liang et al 2018 in the mixture distribution based approaches the entire extreme flood series is first divided into several sub series based on the location of the change points or is classified into several subcategory samples based on the differences in the physical conditions of flood formation to ensure that each sub sample series is stationary finally a mixture distribution is derived by weighted synthesis of the distribution of each sub sample to infer the design flood alila and mtiraoui 2002 singh et al 2005 yan et al 2017a time varying distribution based approaches model one or more distribution parameters as a function of time or other factors to describe the distribution of a nonstationary extreme flood strupczewski et al 2001 jiang et al 2019 the distribution functions are different in different years which result in the design flood for a specific design standard being different in different years vogel et al 2011 cooley 2013 lópez and francés 2013 li and tan 2015 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2019 to estimate the nonstationary univariate design flood in the time varying distribution based approaches several methods have been proposed such as expected waiting time until a given exceedance event occurs olsen et al 1998 cooley 2013 expected occurrence number of a given event over the return period parey et al 2010 design life level rootzén and katz 2013 average design life level read and vogel 2015 expected occurrence number of a given event over the engineering design life obeysekera and salas 2016 and the equivalent reliability er method liang et al 2016 hu et al 2018 the univariate hfa based design flood cannot fully represent the flood characteristics because a complete flood event contains multiple flood features e g flood peak and flood volume thus the multivariate hfa which allows the marginal distribution of different flood variables and the dependence structure among these variables has been widely used to estimate the multivariate design flood favre et al 2004 salvadori and de michele 2010 chebana and ouarda 2011 liang et al 2012a volpi and fiori 2014 jane et al 2020 tosunoglu et al 2020 wu et al 2021 compared to the stationary multivariate hfa which has an evident theoretical and application foundation the nonstationary multivariate hfa is in the development stage and has been receiving increasing attention over the past few years bender et al 2014 kwon and lall 2016 bracken et al 2018 sarhadi et al 2018 in the stationary multivariate hfa the marginal distributions of flood variables as well as their dependent structures are time invariant the joint distribution of multiple flood features does not vary over time the multivariate design values corresponding to a design standard can be calculated in multiple ways such as the or or and joint return period based approaches salvadori et al 2007 2011 bender et al 2014 moftakhari et al 2019 tosunoglu et al 2020 the or joint return period is defined as the return period of either x or y that exceeds a given threshold whereas the and joint return period is defined as the return period of both x and y that exceed a given threshold salvadori and de michele 2004 for a given joint return period t there are infinite possible combinations of multivariate design values among them point x t y t with the largest joint probability density along the isoline curve of the t year return period is usually considered as the typical and most likely multivariate design value combination salvadori et al 2011 jiang et al 2019 moftakhari et al 2019 jane et al 2020 lucey and gallien 2021 in case of x is a dominant flood variable and y is a secondary flood variable their conditional most likely combination also can be considered as a typical combination that is univariate hfa is first applied to calculate the design value x p of x with a specified return period and then to estimate the design values y p of y based on the conditional distribution function f y x x p y p is the point with the largest probability density value of f y x x p additionally selecting one typical combination event e g the most likely combination sensibly reduces the amount of information that can be obtained by the multivariate approach therefore the idea of using an ensemble of possible design events as an alternative to a single design event has received much attention gräler et al 2013 in the nonstationary multivariate hfa the nonstationary copula model is a widely used tool to describe the non stationarity of the marginal distribution of each variable and or the dependent structure among the different variables in a nonstationary copula model the parameters in the marginal distribution and or the dependent structure of the copula are modeled as a function of time or other factors which leads to variable joint distribution bender et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 kwon and lall 2016 sarhadi et al 2016 2018 bracken et al 2018 the most likely combination of multivariate design flood related to a return period is different in different years because the joint distribution changes over time determining a typical multivariate design combination is important to understand the nonstationary multivariate hfa this study proposes a framework to estimate the nonstationary bivariate design flood the objectives of this study were 1 to construct a nonstationary copula model to analyze the temporal variation of the multivariate joint distribution 2 to establish the conditional relationship of the most likely and the expected combinations of the design values for the dominant and secondary flood variables under non stationarity and 3 to estimate the most likely and expectation combinations of the nonstationary bivariate design values by coupling the er method with the aforementioned conditional combination relationship a case study based on the nonstationary annual maximum 1 day am1 and 15 day am15 flood volume at the yichang station was implemented to illustrate the proposed framework the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodologies section 3 introduces the flood data section 4 presents the results section 5 contains the discussion finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 methods this section contains the methodologies for estimating the nonstationary bivariate design flood including the nonstationary marginal distribution model nonstationary copula model parameter estimation and model selection and design value estimation fig 1 2 1 nonstationary marginal distribution model the time varying nonstationary pearson type three pe3 and generalized extreme value gev distributions were used to model the marginal distribution of the flood variables the stationary pe3 and gev models were also fitted for comparison the time varying pe3 density function can be expressed as hu et al 2017 1 f x λ t β t γ t β t γ t γ γ t x λ t γ t 1 e x p β t x λ t where x denotes the random variable to be modeled λ t 0 β t 0 and γ t 0 are the time varying location scale and shape parameters respectively and γ γ t is a gamma function two nonstationary marginal models pe3 l and pe3 ls were developed according to the time varying pe3 distribution in pe3 l the location parameter changes over time λ t exp a 0 a 1 t while the other two parameters are constant in pe3 ls the location and scale parameters change over time λ t exp a 0 a 1 t β t exp b 0 b 1 t while the shape parameter is constant the time varying gev distribution function can be written as bender et al 2014 2 f x α t σ t δ t e x p 1 δ t x α t σ t 1 δ t δ t x α t σ t 0 where is α t 0 σ t 0 and δ t are the time varying location scale and shape parameters respectively two nonstationary marginal models gev l and gev ls were developed according to the time varying gev distribution in gev l the location parameter changes with time α t exp a 0 a 1 t while the other two parameters are constant in the gev ls the location and scale parameters change with time α t exp a 0 a 1 t σ t exp b 0 b 1 t while the shape parameter is constant 2 2 nonstationary copula model copula is a popular tool for multivariate hfa in hydrology salvadori and de michele 2004 moftakhari et al 2019 jane et al 2020 tosunoglu et al 2020 in this study a nonstationary bivariate copula was constructed to model the joint distribution of nonstationary extreme flood variables x and y if the nonstationary marginal distribution of x and y are f x x θ xt and f y y θ yt respectively the nonstationary bivariate copula can be described as 3 f xy x y θ xt θ yt θ ct c f x x θ xt f y y θ yt θ ct c μ t v t θ ct 4 μ t f x x t θ xt 5 v t f y y t θ yt θ ct θ 0 θ 1 t or θ ct θ c 6 where f xy is the joint distribution function of x and y c is a cumulative distribution function of a copula θ ct denote the copula structure parameter at a given time t θ xt and θ yt indicate the parameters in the distribution f x x θ xt and f y y θ yt respectively at a given time t μ t and v t are the marginal probabilities in the unit hypercube with uniform marginal distributions the corresponding time varying nonstationary joint density function f xy can be written as 7 f xy x y θ xt θ yt θ ct c 2 μ t v t θ ct μ t v t μ t x v t y c μ t v t θ ct f x x θ xt f y y θ yt where f x x θ xt and f y y θ yt are density functions of x and y respectively at a given time t the time varying

bivariate nonstationary copula models were used which were developed based on the gumbel clayton and frank copula with one structure parameter bb1 bb2 bb3 bb4 bb5 bb6 bb7 bb8 copula with two structure parameters and tawn copula with three structure parameters table 1 2 3 parameter estimation and model selection nonstationary marginal distribution and structure parameters in the nonstationary copula are estimated by implementing a bayesian inference framework and inference function for margins scheme with a two step parameter estimation sarhadi et al 2016 first the marginal distribution parameters of each flood variable are estimated second to infer the copula structure parameters prior distributions for the parameters are assumed to be independent cheng et al 2014 the prior distribution of each parameter was described using a normal distribution sarhadi et al 2016 hu et al 2017 bracken et al 2018 a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler was used to generate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution of each parameter in parallel hu et al 2017 the sample number in each parallel was set to 10 000 and the parallel number was set to five the convergence test criterion r was used to verify whether the sampling approach converged gelman and shirley 2011 11 r ϕ ω where 12 ϕ n 1 n ω m 1 nm 1 m 1 j 1 m e j e 13 ω 1 m j 1 m 1 n 1 i 1 n ϑ j i e j 2 where 14 e j

parameter ϑ when the r is 1 1 the sampling approach can satisfy the convergence requirement gelman and shirley 2011 the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic were used for selecting the marginal and copula models gräler et al 2013 hu et al 2017 2 4 design value estimation under nonstationary bivariate situation in multivariate hfa infinite combinations of variables x and y can be obtained with an identical joint return period among them the most likely combination is usually selected as the typical realization of multivariate design values jiang et al 2019 if a water related project is designed to protect against heavy flood volume and is insensitive to flood peak it would be inappropriate to use the most likely combination as the typical design flood realization before using the multivariate hfa it is vital to clarify which flood features are dominant in affecting flood management serinaldi 2015 for example numerous small reservoirs mainly focus on flood peaks as they can be easily flooded whereas for large reservoirs flood volume is often more critical as they have a larger storage capacity to reduce the peak flow the goal of this study was to apply univariate hfa to calculate the design value of the dominant flood variable to guarantee that the project meets the design standards for protection against floods next we applied the interplay between the primary flood variables to infer the design values of the secondary flood variables which were conditioned based on the design value of the dominant flood variable supposing x and y represented the dominant and secondary flood variables respectively two strategies will be used to calculate the typical realization of the design flood combination of x and y 1 conditional most likely combination approach and 2 conditional expectation combination approach 2 4 1 conditional most likely combination approach in this approach the most likely estimation y ml of the secondary variable y which was conditioned on the quantile x p of the dominant variable x with a non exceedance probability p was calculated by maximizing the conditional probability density of function f y x i e the derivative of the function f y x should be zero 16 d f y x y x p θ yt θ ct dy dc μ p ν t θ ct f y y θ yt dy c μ p ν t θ ct ν t ν t y f y y θ yt c μ p ν t θ ct d f y y θ yt dy c μ p ν t θ ct ν t f y y θ yt 2 c μ p ν t θ ct d f y y θ yt dy 0 the pair of x p and y ml t is the most likely combination of the design values of x and y notably the most likely estimation y ml t conditioned on the x p changed through time because the function f y x varied over time under non stationarity 2 4 2 conditional expectation combination approach in this approach the expectation estimation y e of the secondary variable y which was conditioned on the quantile x p of the dominant variable x with a non exceedance probability p can be calculated as follows 17 y e t e y x p θ yt θ ct y f y x y x p θ yt θ ct d y yc μ p ν t θ ct f y y θ yt d y c μ p ν t θ ct f y 1 v t θ yt d ν the pair of x p and y e t is called the expectation combination of the design values of x and y the expectation estimation y e t conditioned on x p also changed through time due to the temporal variability of function f y x under non stationarity 2 4 3 nonstationary bivariate design value estimation the nonstationary marginal functions f x x θ xt and f y y θ yt as well as the nonstationary copula f xy x y θ xt θ yt θ ct could be calibrated based on the n year nonstationary observations of the dominant and secondary variables x and y respectively furthermore the marginal and copula function in any future year covering the l year design lifespan of a water related project from n 1 to n l could be predicted fig 2 the quantile x p of x from n 1 to n l with a probability p could be calculated using its distribution f x x θ xt for example 18 x p t f x 1 p θ xt t n 1 n 2 n l next the corresponding most likely y ml t and expectation y e t t n 1 n 2 n l estimations of y conditioned on x p t in time t could be calculated using equations 16 and 17 respectively the relationship between the p quantile of x its corresponding most likely estimation of y was quantified using the pairs x p t y ml t t n 1 n 2 n l and could be expressed as 19 y ml f x p equation 19 represents the most likely combination relationship between the design values of the x and y corresponding to a probability p under non stationarity the relationship between the p quantile of x the corresponding expectation estimation of y was quantified using the pairs x p t y e t t n 1 n 2 n l which could be expressed as 20 y e f x p equation 20 represents the expectation combination relationship between the design values of x and y corresponding to a probability p under non stationarity once the design value x t of x was obtained with a return period t the most likely y t ml and expectation y t e estimations of y conditioned on x t can be calculated as 21 y t ml f x t 22 y t e f x t the pairs x t y t ml and x t y t e are the most likely and expectation combination estimations of the design flood for x and y within the t year return period of x several typical methods section 1 were used to estimate the design value x t of x under non stationarity cooley 2013 parey et al 2010 rootzén and katz 2013 read and vogel 2015 liang et al 2016 this study used the er method which considers the impact of the design lifespan length on the design value estimation liang et al 2016 yan et al 2017b hu et al 2018 according to this method the t year design value x t of x corresponding to the design lifespan from t 1 to t 2 can be calculated as follows 23 t 1 t 2 f x x t θ xt 1 1 t t 2 t 1 1 3 flood data for application to illustrate the proposed method for estimating the nonstationary bivariate design flood am1 and am15 flood volumes of the yichang hydrological station during 1946 2018 were used regarding the selection of extreme series in the multivariate frequency analysis there are two methods that can be adopted the first method requires different extreme events in a year from the same flood the second one is to follow the annual maximum principle to select the extreme events regardless of whether it comes from the same flood in the second method the different extreme events in a year may come from the different floods with respect to flood prevention and engineering safety in order to ensure that each event of the extreme series is the largest in the year the second method annual maximum principle is commonly adopted for selecting the annual maximum extreme sample of each variable respectively using the second method to select the extreme events is a conservative approach that is biased towards engineering safety considerations difference between the 15 day flood volume events selected based on the above mentioned two methods are given as a supplementary explanation in the supporting material spm1 the yichang hydrological station is located 40 km downstream of the three gorges reservoir which affects its streamflow along with other upstream water related projects the am1 flood volume series ranges from 2 367 to 6 005 billion cubic meters with an average value of 4 173 billion cubic meters the am15 flood volume series ranges from 28 927 to 78 512 billion cubic meters with an average value of 49 279 billion cubic meters the am1 and am15 flood volumes exhibit a decreasing trend fig 3 the statistics of the mann kendell test are 4 5337 and 3 3193 for the am1 and am15 flood volumes respectively the absolute values of the mann kendell statistic 4 5337 and 3 3193 are larger than the threshold value of 1 96 that corresponds to 0 05 significant level which suggests a significant decreasing trend of the two series pettitt s test shows that the points of the flood volumes of am1 and am15 changed in 1989 and 1968 respectively since several water related projects built in different years and continuous human activity impacts the upper reaches of the yichang station comprehensive changes occur in flood characteristics the downward trend slowed between 1968 and 1989 but remained within the downward trend channel fig 3 thus the decreasing trend was used as the dominant changing feature of the two series in this study 4 results 4 1 assessment of nonstationary marginal distributions and joint distribution six marginal distribution models four nonstationary and two stationary were used to fit the am1 and am15 flood volumes respectively the posterior distribution of each parameter in different marginal distributions was estimated using the bayesian method hu et al 2017 sarhadi et al 2016 the aic and bic values were calculated based on the maximum posterior estimation of the parameters the pe3 l with its location varying over time was found to be the optimal marginal distribution for the am1 flood volume table 2 for the am15 flood volume pe3 l and pe3 ls with their location and scale varying over time outperformed the other candidate distributions to further analyze the performance of the pe3 l and pe3 ls model for the am15 flood volume its pe3 l and pe3 ls based quantiles with annual exceedance probabilities of 0 01 and 0 02 were computed in each year during 1946 2118 the impact of parameter estimation uncertainty of pe3l and pe3ls on quantile calculations was also considered according to the bayesian method hu et al 2017 the quantile estimation uncertainty of pe3 ls was found to be larger than that of pe3 l fig 4 since a more complex nonstationary distribution model increases the uncertainty the simpler pe3 l model was selected as the optimal marginal distribution for the am15 flood volume the 15 continuous nonstationary copula models table 1 were used to fit the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes the posterior distribution of each parameter in these copula models was estimated using the bayesian method the aic and bic of these copula models were calculated based on the maximum posterior estimation of the parameters the aic and bic indicate that the gumbel n model outperforms the other copulas table 3 given that there is a significant change point in the am1 1989 and am15 1968 flood volumes three change point nonstationary copula models developed based on the gumbel clayton and frank copula were also used to fit the am1 am15 joint distribution in a change point nonstationary copula model the parameters before and after the change point were different based on the change point of the am1 and am15 series they were divided into two separate sub series table 4 the goodness of fit of the pe3 and gev distributions for the sub series shows that gev is an optimal distribution for each sub series table 4 the am1 am15 pairs were divided into three sub pairs series 1946 1968 1969 1989 and 1990 2018 the performance of the three change point nonstationary models was assessed by the aic and bic the frank c3 model outperforms the other two change point nonstationary models table 4 the parameters of the gev distribution and frank copula before and after the change points were given in the supporting material spm2 however the performance of the three change point nonstationary copula models was worse than that of the continuous nonstationary copula model gumbel n therefore the gumbel n model was selected to describe the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes 4 2 temporal variation analysis of bivariate joint distribution features based on the optimal nonstationary marginal distribution model pe3 l and the nonstationary copula model gumbel n temporal variation of the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes was assessed fig 5 shows the evolution characteristics of the joint distribution in the form of probability isolines during 1946 2030 with four different joint probabilities of 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 0 95 it was observed that for a specified joint probability such as 0 95 the probability isolines substantially varied from 1946 to 2030 which shifted to the bottom left since 1946 and covered a large range interval this was mainly due to the decreasing trend in the two series the shift to the bottom left suggests that the hydraulic conditions were becoming less severe the results in fig 6 show the difference in the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes in the years 1950 1980 2010 and 2030 in the form of joint probability under the same joint probability the joint distributions were different in different years taking the 0 95 joint probability as an example the most likely combination of the am1 and am15 flood volumes were 49 60 519 45 in 1950 48 92 518 55 in 1980 48 24 517 70 in 2010 and 47 80 517 11 in 2030 respectively the design values of the am1 and am15 flood volumes were different in different years and decreased over time the temporal variation of the or joint return period of the am1 and am15 flood volumes was also investigated fig 7 illustrates the change characteristics of the joint return period in the form of return period isolines during 1946 2030 with four different return periods of 20 50 100 and 200 year for a given return period the isolines varied from 1946 to 2030 this implies that for a given return period the most likely combination of the am1 and am15 flood volumes in different years is different due to the non stationarity of the two series fig 8 presents the difference in the joint return period of am1 and am15 for the years 1950 1980 2010 and 2030 the results are similar to the analysis results based on the joint probability presented in fig 5 further supporting the position that under the same joint return period their joint distributions are different in different years taking the 100 year joint return period as an example the most likely combinations of the am1 and am15 flood volumes were 55 25 591 78 in 1950 54 58 590 94 in 1980 53 90 590 14 in 2010 and 53 46 589 63 in 2030 respectively the design values of the am1 and am15 flood volumes under the same joint return period decreased over time 4 3 design value estimation for nonstationary bivariate flood characteristics in this study the am15 flood volume was considered as the dominant flood variable whereas the am1 flood volume was the secondary flood variable distributions of the am15 flood volume during 2019 2118 were predicted based on the model pe3 l the quantiles of the am15 flood volume corresponding to exceedance probabilities of 0 05 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 during 2019 2118 were calculated based on the quantiles of the am15 flood volume in different years and different exceedance probabilities the corresponding conditional most likely and conditional expectation estimations of the am1 flood volume were calculated using the conditional most likely section 2 4 1 and conditional expectation section 2 4 2 combination approaches the two estimations of the am1 flood volume varied over time because the quantiles of the am15 flood volume changed from 2019 to 2118 based on the pair of the most likely and expectation combinations of the am1 and am15 flood volumes from 2019 to 2118 the most likely and expectation combination relationships between the am1 and am15 flood volume was quantified fig 9 shows the two combination relationship curves related to the exceedance probabilities of 0 05 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 of the am15 flood volume the most likely combination curve was observed to be different from the expectation combination curve for an am15 flood volume value the corresponding conditional expectation estimation of the am1 flood volume was smaller than its corresponding conditional most likely estimation fig 10 presents the difference formed by subtracting the conditional expectation estimation from the conditional most likely estimation of the am1 flood volume during 2019 2118 related to the exceedance probabilities of 0 05 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 of the am15 flood volume the differences between them increased with a decrease in the exceedance probabilities from 0 05 to 0 005 while such differences decreased over time from 2019 to 2118 this suggests that smaller exceedance probability of the am15 flood volume quantile causes more significant difference between the corresponding conditional most likely and conditional expectation estimations of the am1 flood volume based on the er method the design values of the am15 flood volume related to 20 50 100 and 200 year return periods under the design lifespan length of 10 to 100 with an interval of 10 were estimated the conditional most likely and conditional expectation estimations of the am1 flood volume design value conditioned on the design value of the am15 flood volume were then calculated fig 11 shows the design value estimation of the am15 flood volume and the two estimations of the am1 flood volume design value the design values of am15 and the corresponding am1 flood volume both decreased with an increase in the design lifespan length from 10 to 100 years for a given return period fig 11 which is consistent with the decreasing trend of the two series additionally for an am15 flood volume design value related to a given return period and design lifespan length the conditional most likely estimation of the design value of the am1 flood volume was different from its corresponding conditional expectation estimation as the former was greater than the latter the differences between the conditional expectation estimation from the conditional most likely estimation of the design value for the am1 flood volume were calculated under a given return period of the am15 flood volume this difference decreased with an increase in the design lifespan length fig 12 furthermore for a specific design lifespan length the differences between the two estimations increased with the return period from 20 to 100 years this implies that the differences between the conditional most likely and conditional expectation estimations were comprehensively influenced by the design return period and design lifespan length 5 discussion nonstationary multivariate design flood estimation is a challenging and unsolved problem that needs detailed study the nonstationary multivariate hfa is much more complicated than the stationary multivariate hfa under stationary conditions the parameters of the joint distribution did not change over time the typical combination of multivariate design values for a joint return period can be calculated using either the most likely or the expectation combination approach salvadori et al 2011 moftakhari et al 2019 for a joint return period the aforementioned typical combination of multivariate design values was unique however under non stationarity one or more parameters of the joint distribution were modeled to change over time i e the joint distribution between different variables was different in different years fig 2 which led to the typical combination of the multivariate design values for a joint return period to be different in different years fig 7 from the perspective of design flood a unique combination of flood design values for a given design standard is expected there is still a lack of theories and methods that can be used to practically guide the hydrological design and an in depth exploration of how to derive the multivariate design flood under non stationarity is required the nonstationary copula is a popular tool for constructing a nonstationary multivariate joint distribution in which the parameters in the marginal distribution or the dependent structure are modeled as a function of time or other factors bender et al 2014 sarhadi et al 2016 bracken et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 in the model construction and optimization stage a more complex model leads to a better goodness of fit but it may introduce greater uncertainty fig 4 therefore improving the model performance by complicating the model or introducing more covariates to drive the changes in model parameters change should not be overemphasized instead we need to pay more attention to the predictive ability and robustness of the model because the distribution function used for estimating the design value in nonstationary conditions are those in the future conditions it is not certain that a more complex model will enhance its predictive capability it should be acknowledged that fitting model parameters against historical events is different from building a model that can predict an unknown future distribution there are infinite possible combinations of the multivariate design values for a joint return period determining a typical combination with respect to engineering design is extremely important for engineering practitioners we propose that design flood calculation should consider the design function of the project and clarify which flood features are the dominant variables for example if a larger reservoir is designed to protect against heavy flood volume the flood volume can be treated as the dominant variable and other flood features e g flood peak can be treated as secondary variables the conditional most likely or conditional expectation strategies can be used to estimate the typical combination for the design value of dominant and secondary variables in this study the proposed method was only used to calculate the nonstationary bivariate design flood for a multivariate case the method of estimating the design value combination needs to be further studied as a demonstrative example the parameters in the nonstationary marginal distributions were modeled as only a linear function of time without considering the impact of other covariates e g precipitation due to changes in climatic conditions and human interventions the extrapolation of past trends may not robustly represent the future conditions hu et al 2018 wu et al 2021 thus using only the time as a factor to drive the changes in the marginal distribution parameter is not ideal in future studies more reasonable covariates and different distributions need to be used to establish other nonstationary marginal distribution models that fit the flood variables out of which the optimal model can be selected based on an appropriate goodness index e g aic and bic however more attention must be paid to the predictive ability and robustness of the nonstationary model to avoid it from being too complicated and uncertain an extrapolation of the nonstationary marginal and joint distribution obtained from historical observations is risky because the deterministic causes of flood non stationarity in future years are not known moreover many parameters are introduced when applying a nonstationary copula model to construct the nonstationary joint distribution which will lead to uncertainty in the design value calculation because of the estimation uncertainty of the parameter the results show that the design flood volume of am1 and am15 for a design standard as well as the design flood combination including the conditional most likely and conditional expectation combinations change with the design lifespan length fig 11 i e even with the same design standard the aforementioned design values would be different for different lengths of the design lifespan this indicates that it is necessary to consider the impact of design lifespan length on the design flood estimation under non stationarity because the distributions used for estimating the design value in non stationarity are in the future years fig 2 therefore determining the period in which the project should be planned to be operative is vital for design flood estimation under non stationarity conditions hu et al 2018 6 conclusions we constructed nonstationary copula models to model the non stationarity of the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes including non stationarity of marginal distributions and copula dependence structure a framework for nonstationary bivariate design flood estimation is proposed the nonstationary model pe3 l in which the location parameter of the pe3 distribution varied over time was selected to model the marginal distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes the nonstationary copula model gumbel n in which the copula dependence structure varied over time was selected to simulate the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes the temporal variation of the joint distribution was analyzed in terms of the joint probability and joint return period the results indicated that joint distribution changed over time and the am1 and am15 combinations associated with a given joint return period became less serve further into the future the typical combinations of the design values for the am1 and am15 flood volume including the conditional most likely and conditional expectation combinations were calculated for the return periods of 20 50 100 and 200 years under the design lifespan length from 10 to 100 years under non stationarity in the abovementioned combinations the design values of the am15 flood volume for a return period and design lifespan length were calculated using the er method the design values of the am1 flood volume conditioned on the am15 design value were calculated using the conditional most likely and conditional expectation combination strategies the results indicated that for a specific return period the design value of the am15 flood volume as well as the conditional most likely and conditional expectation design values of the am1 flood volume were affected by the design lifespan length the design values of the am1 and am15 flood volumes decreased with increase in the design lifespan length which conforms with the decrease of the two series the conditional most likely estimation of the design value of the am1 flood volume that was conditioned on the design value of the am15 flood volume was different from its conditional expectation estimation as the former was greater than the latter with respect to flood prevention and engineering safety the conditional most likely estimation approach was found to be more conservative and can be prioritized in future applications credit authorship contribution statement yiming hu conceptualization methodology

3730,in this study a framework is proposed to estimate the nonstationary bivariate design flood which includes three key steps first a nonstationary copula model was constructed to analyze the temporal variation in the bivariate joint distribution second the equivalent reliability method was used to calculate the design value of the dominant variable for a return period and the design lifespan length under non stationarity third the design value of the secondary variable that was conditioned on the design value of the dominant variable was calculated using the conditional most likely combination and conditional expectation combination strategies through the above three steps the typical design value combination of the nonstationary bivariate was obtained for a specific design standard a case study based on the nonstationary annual maximum 1 day am1 and 15 day am15 flood volume at the yichang station was conducted to illustrate the framework the results indicate that the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes varied over time for a specific design standard the design values of the am15 and am1 flood volumes decreased with an increase in the design lifespan length moreover the conditional most likely estimation of the design value for the am1 flood volume that was conditioned on the design value for the am15 flood volume was greater than its conditional expectation estimation keywords nonstationary bivariate design flood nonstationary copula model conditional most likely combination conditional expectation combination equivalent reliability method 1 introduction the stationary hydrological frequency analysis hfa has been widely applied to infer the design flood for a specified design standard which is vital for hydraulic engineering construct and water resources planning and management for example the hfa was used to estimate the 100 year design flood peak and such estimation uncertainty was assessed in the light of model and parameter uncertainties by using bayesian method liang et al 2012b climate change and human activities are noticeably influencing the spatial temporal distribution of rainfall and the natural process of river flooding in regions around the world and leading to nonstationary variations in hydrological series groisman et al 2001 andersson et al 2006 liu et al 2008 milly et al 2008 bormann et al 2011 ingram 2016 over the last years significantly increasing attention has been paid to the nonstationary hfa because the stationary hfa is no longer theoretically applicable for a nonstationary situation strupczewski et al 2001 khaliq et al 2006 villarini et al 2009 vogel et al 2011 lópez and francés 2013 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2019 françois et al 2019 several studies have been carried out to propose typical approaches for the design flood estimation under non stationarity such as sample reconstruction based mixture distribution based and time varying distribution based approaches however these studies mainly focused on nonstationary univariate design flood estimation the sample reconstruction based approaches aim to reconstruct the nonstationary extreme flood series to ensure that the reconstructed series meets the stationarity requirements followed by calculation of the design flood using the stationary hfa xie et al 2005 chen et al 2017 liang et al 2018 in the mixture distribution based approaches the entire extreme flood series is first divided into several sub series based on the location of the change points or is classified into several subcategory samples based on the differences in the physical conditions of flood formation to ensure that each sub sample series is stationary finally a mixture distribution is derived by weighted synthesis of the distribution of each sub sample to infer the design flood alila and mtiraoui 2002 singh et al 2005 yan et al 2017a time varying distribution based approaches model one or more distribution parameters as a function of time or other factors to describe the distribution of a nonstationary extreme flood strupczewski et al 2001 jiang et al 2019 the distribution functions are different in different years which result in the design flood for a specific design standard being different in different years vogel et al 2011 cooley 2013 lópez and francés 2013 li and tan 2015 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2019 to estimate the nonstationary univariate design flood in the time varying distribution based approaches several methods have been proposed such as expected waiting time until a given exceedance event occurs olsen et al 1998 cooley 2013 expected occurrence number of a given event over the return period parey et al 2010 design life level rootzén and katz 2013 average design life level read and vogel 2015 expected occurrence number of a given event over the engineering design life obeysekera and salas 2016 and the equivalent reliability er method liang et al 2016 hu et al 2018 the univariate hfa based design flood cannot fully represent the flood characteristics because a complete flood event contains multiple flood features e g flood peak and flood volume thus the multivariate hfa which allows the marginal distribution of different flood variables and the dependence structure among these variables has been widely used to estimate the multivariate design flood favre et al 2004 salvadori and de michele 2010 chebana and ouarda 2011 liang et al 2012a volpi and fiori 2014 jane et al 2020 tosunoglu et al 2020 wu et al 2021 compared to the stationary multivariate hfa which has an evident theoretical and application foundation the nonstationary multivariate hfa is in the development stage and has been receiving increasing attention over the past few years bender et al 2014 kwon and lall 2016 bracken et al 2018 sarhadi et al 2018 in the stationary multivariate hfa the marginal distributions of flood variables as well as their dependent structures are time invariant the joint distribution of multiple flood features does not vary over time the multivariate design values corresponding to a design standard can be calculated in multiple ways such as the or or and joint return period based approaches salvadori et al 2007 2011 bender et al 2014 moftakhari et al 2019 tosunoglu et al 2020 the or joint return period is defined as the return period of either x or y that exceeds a given threshold whereas the and joint return period is defined as the return period of both x and y that exceed a given threshold salvadori and de michele 2004 for a given joint return period t there are infinite possible combinations of multivariate design values among them point x t y t with the largest joint probability density along the isoline curve of the t year return period is usually considered as the typical and most likely multivariate design value combination salvadori et al 2011 jiang et al 2019 moftakhari et al 2019 jane et al 2020 lucey and gallien 2021 in case of x is a dominant flood variable and y is a secondary flood variable their conditional most likely combination also can be considered as a typical combination that is univariate hfa is first applied to calculate the design value x p of x with a specified return period and then to estimate the design values y p of y based on the conditional distribution function f y x x p y p is the point with the largest probability density value of f y x x p additionally selecting one typical combination event e g the most likely combination sensibly reduces the amount of information that can be obtained by the multivariate approach therefore the idea of using an ensemble of possible design events as an alternative to a single design event has received much attention gräler et al 2013 in the nonstationary multivariate hfa the nonstationary copula model is a widely used tool to describe the non stationarity of the marginal distribution of each variable and or the dependent structure among the different variables in a nonstationary copula model the parameters in the marginal distribution and or the dependent structure of the copula are modeled as a function of time or other factors which leads to variable joint distribution bender et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 kwon and lall 2016 sarhadi et al 2016 2018 bracken et al 2018 the most likely combination of multivariate design flood related to a return period is different in different years because the joint distribution changes over time determining a typical multivariate design combination is important to understand the nonstationary multivariate hfa this study proposes a framework to estimate the nonstationary bivariate design flood the objectives of this study were 1 to construct a nonstationary copula model to analyze the temporal variation of the multivariate joint distribution 2 to establish the conditional relationship of the most likely and the expected combinations of the design values for the dominant and secondary flood variables under non stationarity and 3 to estimate the most likely and expectation combinations of the nonstationary bivariate design values by coupling the er method with the aforementioned conditional combination relationship a case study based on the nonstationary annual maximum 1 day am1 and 15 day am15 flood volume at the yichang station was implemented to illustrate the proposed framework the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodologies section 3 introduces the flood data section 4 presents the results section 5 contains the discussion finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 methods this section contains the methodologies for estimating the nonstationary bivariate design flood including the nonstationary marginal distribution model nonstationary copula model parameter estimation and model selection and design value estimation fig 1 2 1 nonstationary marginal distribution model the time varying nonstationary pearson type three pe3 and generalized extreme value gev distributions were used to model the marginal distribution of the flood variables the stationary pe3 and gev models were also fitted for comparison the time varying pe3 density function can be expressed as hu et al 2017 1 f x λ t β t γ t β t γ t γ γ t x λ t γ t 1 e x p β t x λ t where x denotes the random variable to be modeled λ t 0 β t 0 and γ t 0 are the time varying location scale and shape parameters respectively and γ γ t is a gamma function two nonstationary marginal models pe3 l and pe3 ls were developed according to the time varying pe3 distribution in pe3 l the location parameter changes over time λ t exp a 0 a 1 t while the other two parameters are constant in pe3 ls the location and scale parameters change over time λ t exp a 0 a 1 t β t exp b 0 b 1 t while the shape parameter is constant the time varying gev distribution function can be written as bender et al 2014 2 f x α t σ t δ t e x p 1 δ t x α t σ t 1 δ t δ t x α t σ t 0 where is α t 0 σ t 0 and δ t are the time varying location scale and shape parameters respectively two nonstationary marginal models gev l and gev ls were developed according to the time varying gev distribution in gev l the location parameter changes with time α t exp a 0 a 1 t while the other two parameters are constant in the gev ls the location and scale parameters change with time α t exp a 0 a 1 t σ t exp b 0 b 1 t while the shape parameter is constant 2 2 nonstationary copula model copula is a popular tool for multivariate hfa in hydrology salvadori and de michele 2004 moftakhari et al 2019 jane et al 2020 tosunoglu et al 2020 in this study a nonstationary bivariate copula was constructed to model the joint distribution of nonstationary extreme flood variables x and y if the nonstationary marginal distribution of x and y are f x x θ xt and f y y θ yt respectively the nonstationary bivariate copula can be described as 3 f xy x y θ xt θ yt θ ct c f x x θ xt f y y θ yt θ ct c μ t v t θ ct 4 μ t f x x t θ xt 5 v t f y y t θ yt θ ct θ 0 θ 1 t or θ ct θ c 6 where f xy is the joint distribution function of x and y c is a cumulative distribution function of a copula θ ct denote the copula structure parameter at a given time t θ xt and θ yt indicate the parameters in the distribution f x x θ xt and f y y θ yt respectively at a given time t μ t and v t are the marginal probabilities in the unit hypercube with uniform marginal distributions the corresponding time varying nonstationary joint density function f xy can be written as 7 f xy x y θ xt θ yt θ ct c 2 μ t v t θ ct μ t v t μ t x v t y c μ t v t θ ct f x x θ xt f y y θ yt where f x x θ xt and f y y θ yt are density functions of x and y respectively at a given time t the time varying

bivariate nonstationary copula models were used which were developed based on the gumbel clayton and frank copula with one structure parameter bb1 bb2 bb3 bb4 bb5 bb6 bb7 bb8 copula with two structure parameters and tawn copula with three structure parameters table 1 2 3 parameter estimation and model selection nonstationary marginal distribution and structure parameters in the nonstationary copula are estimated by implementing a bayesian inference framework and inference function for margins scheme with a two step parameter estimation sarhadi et al 2016 first the marginal distribution parameters of each flood variable are estimated second to infer the copula structure parameters prior distributions for the parameters are assumed to be independent cheng et al 2014 the prior distribution of each parameter was described using a normal distribution sarhadi et al 2016 hu et al 2017 bracken et al 2018 a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler was used to generate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution of each parameter in parallel hu et al 2017 the sample number in each parallel was set to 10 000 and the parallel number was set to five the convergence test criterion r was used to verify whether the sampling approach converged gelman and shirley 2011 11 r ϕ ω where 12 ϕ n 1 n ω m 1 nm 1 m 1 j 1 m e j e 13 ω 1 m j 1 m 1 n 1 i 1 n ϑ j i e j 2 where 14 e j

parameter ϑ when the r is 1 1 the sampling approach can satisfy the convergence requirement gelman and shirley 2011 the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic were used for selecting the marginal and copula models gräler et al 2013 hu et al 2017 2 4 design value estimation under nonstationary bivariate situation in multivariate hfa infinite combinations of variables x and y can be obtained with an identical joint return period among them the most likely combination is usually selected as the typical realization of multivariate design values jiang et al 2019 if a water related project is designed to protect against heavy flood volume and is insensitive to flood peak it would be inappropriate to use the most likely combination as the typical design flood realization before using the multivariate hfa it is vital to clarify which flood features are dominant in affecting flood management serinaldi 2015 for example numerous small reservoirs mainly focus on flood peaks as they can be easily flooded whereas for large reservoirs flood volume is often more critical as they have a larger storage capacity to reduce the peak flow the goal of this study was to apply univariate hfa to calculate the design value of the dominant flood variable to guarantee that the project meets the design standards for protection against floods next we applied the interplay between the primary flood variables to infer the design values of the secondary flood variables which were conditioned based on the design value of the dominant flood variable supposing x and y represented the dominant and secondary flood variables respectively two strategies will be used to calculate the typical realization of the design flood combination of x and y 1 conditional most likely combination approach and 2 conditional expectation combination approach 2 4 1 conditional most likely combination approach in this approach the most likely estimation y ml of the secondary variable y which was conditioned on the quantile x p of the dominant variable x with a non exceedance probability p was calculated by maximizing the conditional probability density of function f y x i e the derivative of the function f y x should be zero 16 d f y x y x p θ yt θ ct dy dc μ p ν t θ ct f y y θ yt dy c μ p ν t θ ct ν t ν t y f y y θ yt c μ p ν t θ ct d f y y θ yt dy c μ p ν t θ ct ν t f y y θ yt 2 c μ p ν t θ ct d f y y θ yt dy 0 the pair of x p and y ml t is the most likely combination of the design values of x and y notably the most likely estimation y ml t conditioned on the x p changed through time because the function f y x varied over time under non stationarity 2 4 2 conditional expectation combination approach in this approach the expectation estimation y e of the secondary variable y which was conditioned on the quantile x p of the dominant variable x with a non exceedance probability p can be calculated as follows 17 y e t e y x p θ yt θ ct y f y x y x p θ yt θ ct d y yc μ p ν t θ ct f y y θ yt d y c μ p ν t θ ct f y 1 v t θ yt d ν the pair of x p and y e t is called the expectation combination of the design values of x and y the expectation estimation y e t conditioned on x p also changed through time due to the temporal variability of function f y x under non stationarity 2 4 3 nonstationary bivariate design value estimation the nonstationary marginal functions f x x θ xt and f y y θ yt as well as the nonstationary copula f xy x y θ xt θ yt θ ct could be calibrated based on the n year nonstationary observations of the dominant and secondary variables x and y respectively furthermore the marginal and copula function in any future year covering the l year design lifespan of a water related project from n 1 to n l could be predicted fig 2 the quantile x p of x from n 1 to n l with a probability p could be calculated using its distribution f x x θ xt for example 18 x p t f x 1 p θ xt t n 1 n 2 n l next the corresponding most likely y ml t and expectation y e t t n 1 n 2 n l estimations of y conditioned on x p t in time t could be calculated using equations 16 and 17 respectively the relationship between the p quantile of x its corresponding most likely estimation of y was quantified using the pairs x p t y ml t t n 1 n 2 n l and could be expressed as 19 y ml f x p equation 19 represents the most likely combination relationship between the design values of the x and y corresponding to a probability p under non stationarity the relationship between the p quantile of x the corresponding expectation estimation of y was quantified using the pairs x p t y e t t n 1 n 2 n l which could be expressed as 20 y e f x p equation 20 represents the expectation combination relationship between the design values of x and y corresponding to a probability p under non stationarity once the design value x t of x was obtained with a return period t the most likely y t ml and expectation y t e estimations of y conditioned on x t can be calculated as 21 y t ml f x t 22 y t e f x t the pairs x t y t ml and x t y t e are the most likely and expectation combination estimations of the design flood for x and y within the t year return period of x several typical methods section 1 were used to estimate the design value x t of x under non stationarity cooley 2013 parey et al 2010 rootzén and katz 2013 read and vogel 2015 liang et al 2016 this study used the er method which considers the impact of the design lifespan length on the design value estimation liang et al 2016 yan et al 2017b hu et al 2018 according to this method the t year design value x t of x corresponding to the design lifespan from t 1 to t 2 can be calculated as follows 23 t 1 t 2 f x x t θ xt 1 1 t t 2 t 1 1 3 flood data for application to illustrate the proposed method for estimating the nonstationary bivariate design flood am1 and am15 flood volumes of the yichang hydrological station during 1946 2018 were used regarding the selection of extreme series in the multivariate frequency analysis there are two methods that can be adopted the first method requires different extreme events in a year from the same flood the second one is to follow the annual maximum principle to select the extreme events regardless of whether it comes from the same flood in the second method the different extreme events in a year may come from the different floods with respect to flood prevention and engineering safety in order to ensure that each event of the extreme series is the largest in the year the second method annual maximum principle is commonly adopted for selecting the annual maximum extreme sample of each variable respectively using the second method to select the extreme events is a conservative approach that is biased towards engineering safety considerations difference between the 15 day flood volume events selected based on the above mentioned two methods are given as a supplementary explanation in the supporting material spm1 the yichang hydrological station is located 40 km downstream of the three gorges reservoir which affects its streamflow along with other upstream water related projects the am1 flood volume series ranges from 2 367 to 6 005 billion cubic meters with an average value of 4 173 billion cubic meters the am15 flood volume series ranges from 28 927 to 78 512 billion cubic meters with an average value of 49 279 billion cubic meters the am1 and am15 flood volumes exhibit a decreasing trend fig 3 the statistics of the mann kendell test are 4 5337 and 3 3193 for the am1 and am15 flood volumes respectively the absolute values of the mann kendell statistic 4 5337 and 3 3193 are larger than the threshold value of 1 96 that corresponds to 0 05 significant level which suggests a significant decreasing trend of the two series pettitt s test shows that the points of the flood volumes of am1 and am15 changed in 1989 and 1968 respectively since several water related projects built in different years and continuous human activity impacts the upper reaches of the yichang station comprehensive changes occur in flood characteristics the downward trend slowed between 1968 and 1989 but remained within the downward trend channel fig 3 thus the decreasing trend was used as the dominant changing feature of the two series in this study 4 results 4 1 assessment of nonstationary marginal distributions and joint distribution six marginal distribution models four nonstationary and two stationary were used to fit the am1 and am15 flood volumes respectively the posterior distribution of each parameter in different marginal distributions was estimated using the bayesian method hu et al 2017 sarhadi et al 2016 the aic and bic values were calculated based on the maximum posterior estimation of the parameters the pe3 l with its location varying over time was found to be the optimal marginal distribution for the am1 flood volume table 2 for the am15 flood volume pe3 l and pe3 ls with their location and scale varying over time outperformed the other candidate distributions to further analyze the performance of the pe3 l and pe3 ls model for the am15 flood volume its pe3 l and pe3 ls based quantiles with annual exceedance probabilities of 0 01 and 0 02 were computed in each year during 1946 2118 the impact of parameter estimation uncertainty of pe3l and pe3ls on quantile calculations was also considered according to the bayesian method hu et al 2017 the quantile estimation uncertainty of pe3 ls was found to be larger than that of pe3 l fig 4 since a more complex nonstationary distribution model increases the uncertainty the simpler pe3 l model was selected as the optimal marginal distribution for the am15 flood volume the 15 continuous nonstationary copula models table 1 were used to fit the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes the posterior distribution of each parameter in these copula models was estimated using the bayesian method the aic and bic of these copula models were calculated based on the maximum posterior estimation of the parameters the aic and bic indicate that the gumbel n model outperforms the other copulas table 3 given that there is a significant change point in the am1 1989 and am15 1968 flood volumes three change point nonstationary copula models developed based on the gumbel clayton and frank copula were also used to fit the am1 am15 joint distribution in a change point nonstationary copula model the parameters before and after the change point were different based on the change point of the am1 and am15 series they were divided into two separate sub series table 4 the goodness of fit of the pe3 and gev distributions for the sub series shows that gev is an optimal distribution for each sub series table 4 the am1 am15 pairs were divided into three sub pairs series 1946 1968 1969 1989 and 1990 2018 the performance of the three change point nonstationary models was assessed by the aic and bic the frank c3 model outperforms the other two change point nonstationary models table 4 the parameters of the gev distribution and frank copula before and after the change points were given in the supporting material spm2 however the performance of the three change point nonstationary copula models was worse than that of the continuous nonstationary copula model gumbel n therefore the gumbel n model was selected to describe the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes 4 2 temporal variation analysis of bivariate joint distribution features based on the optimal nonstationary marginal distribution model pe3 l and the nonstationary copula model gumbel n temporal variation of the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes was assessed fig 5 shows the evolution characteristics of the joint distribution in the form of probability isolines during 1946 2030 with four different joint probabilities of 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 0 95 it was observed that for a specified joint probability such as 0 95 the probability isolines substantially varied from 1946 to 2030 which shifted to the bottom left since 1946 and covered a large range interval this was mainly due to the decreasing trend in the two series the shift to the bottom left suggests that the hydraulic conditions were becoming less severe the results in fig 6 show the difference in the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes in the years 1950 1980 2010 and 2030 in the form of joint probability under the same joint probability the joint distributions were different in different years taking the 0 95 joint probability as an example the most likely combination of the am1 and am15 flood volumes were 49 60 519 45 in 1950 48 92 518 55 in 1980 48 24 517 70 in 2010 and 47 80 517 11 in 2030 respectively the design values of the am1 and am15 flood volumes were different in different years and decreased over time the temporal variation of the or joint return period of the am1 and am15 flood volumes was also investigated fig 7 illustrates the change characteristics of the joint return period in the form of return period isolines during 1946 2030 with four different return periods of 20 50 100 and 200 year for a given return period the isolines varied from 1946 to 2030 this implies that for a given return period the most likely combination of the am1 and am15 flood volumes in different years is different due to the non stationarity of the two series fig 8 presents the difference in the joint return period of am1 and am15 for the years 1950 1980 2010 and 2030 the results are similar to the analysis results based on the joint probability presented in fig 5 further supporting the position that under the same joint return period their joint distributions are different in different years taking the 100 year joint return period as an example the most likely combinations of the am1 and am15 flood volumes were 55 25 591 78 in 1950 54 58 590 94 in 1980 53 90 590 14 in 2010 and 53 46 589 63 in 2030 respectively the design values of the am1 and am15 flood volumes under the same joint return period decreased over time 4 3 design value estimation for nonstationary bivariate flood characteristics in this study the am15 flood volume was considered as the dominant flood variable whereas the am1 flood volume was the secondary flood variable distributions of the am15 flood volume during 2019 2118 were predicted based on the model pe3 l the quantiles of the am15 flood volume corresponding to exceedance probabilities of 0 05 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 during 2019 2118 were calculated based on the quantiles of the am15 flood volume in different years and different exceedance probabilities the corresponding conditional most likely and conditional expectation estimations of the am1 flood volume were calculated using the conditional most likely section 2 4 1 and conditional expectation section 2 4 2 combination approaches the two estimations of the am1 flood volume varied over time because the quantiles of the am15 flood volume changed from 2019 to 2118 based on the pair of the most likely and expectation combinations of the am1 and am15 flood volumes from 2019 to 2118 the most likely and expectation combination relationships between the am1 and am15 flood volume was quantified fig 9 shows the two combination relationship curves related to the exceedance probabilities of 0 05 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 of the am15 flood volume the most likely combination curve was observed to be different from the expectation combination curve for an am15 flood volume value the corresponding conditional expectation estimation of the am1 flood volume was smaller than its corresponding conditional most likely estimation fig 10 presents the difference formed by subtracting the conditional expectation estimation from the conditional most likely estimation of the am1 flood volume during 2019 2118 related to the exceedance probabilities of 0 05 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 of the am15 flood volume the differences between them increased with a decrease in the exceedance probabilities from 0 05 to 0 005 while such differences decreased over time from 2019 to 2118 this suggests that smaller exceedance probability of the am15 flood volume quantile causes more significant difference between the corresponding conditional most likely and conditional expectation estimations of the am1 flood volume based on the er method the design values of the am15 flood volume related to 20 50 100 and 200 year return periods under the design lifespan length of 10 to 100 with an interval of 10 were estimated the conditional most likely and conditional expectation estimations of the am1 flood volume design value conditioned on the design value of the am15 flood volume were then calculated fig 11 shows the design value estimation of the am15 flood volume and the two estimations of the am1 flood volume design value the design values of am15 and the corresponding am1 flood volume both decreased with an increase in the design lifespan length from 10 to 100 years for a given return period fig 11 which is consistent with the decreasing trend of the two series additionally for an am15 flood volume design value related to a given return period and design lifespan length the conditional most likely estimation of the design value of the am1 flood volume was different from its corresponding conditional expectation estimation as the former was greater than the latter the differences between the conditional expectation estimation from the conditional most likely estimation of the design value for the am1 flood volume were calculated under a given return period of the am15 flood volume this difference decreased with an increase in the design lifespan length fig 12 furthermore for a specific design lifespan length the differences between the two estimations increased with the return period from 20 to 100 years this implies that the differences between the conditional most likely and conditional expectation estimations were comprehensively influenced by the design return period and design lifespan length 5 discussion nonstationary multivariate design flood estimation is a challenging and unsolved problem that needs detailed study the nonstationary multivariate hfa is much more complicated than the stationary multivariate hfa under stationary conditions the parameters of the joint distribution did not change over time the typical combination of multivariate design values for a joint return period can be calculated using either the most likely or the expectation combination approach salvadori et al 2011 moftakhari et al 2019 for a joint return period the aforementioned typical combination of multivariate design values was unique however under non stationarity one or more parameters of the joint distribution were modeled to change over time i e the joint distribution between different variables was different in different years fig 2 which led to the typical combination of the multivariate design values for a joint return period to be different in different years fig 7 from the perspective of design flood a unique combination of flood design values for a given design standard is expected there is still a lack of theories and methods that can be used to practically guide the hydrological design and an in depth exploration of how to derive the multivariate design flood under non stationarity is required the nonstationary copula is a popular tool for constructing a nonstationary multivariate joint distribution in which the parameters in the marginal distribution or the dependent structure are modeled as a function of time or other factors bender et al 2014 sarhadi et al 2016 bracken et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 in the model construction and optimization stage a more complex model leads to a better goodness of fit but it may introduce greater uncertainty fig 4 therefore improving the model performance by complicating the model or introducing more covariates to drive the changes in model parameters change should not be overemphasized instead we need to pay more attention to the predictive ability and robustness of the model because the distribution function used for estimating the design value in nonstationary conditions are those in the future conditions it is not certain that a more complex model will enhance its predictive capability it should be acknowledged that fitting model parameters against historical events is different from building a model that can predict an unknown future distribution there are infinite possible combinations of the multivariate design values for a joint return period determining a typical combination with respect to engineering design is extremely important for engineering practitioners we propose that design flood calculation should consider the design function of the project and clarify which flood features are the dominant variables for example if a larger reservoir is designed to protect against heavy flood volume the flood volume can be treated as the dominant variable and other flood features e g flood peak can be treated as secondary variables the conditional most likely or conditional expectation strategies can be used to estimate the typical combination for the design value of dominant and secondary variables in this study the proposed method was only used to calculate the nonstationary bivariate design flood for a multivariate case the method of estimating the design value combination needs to be further studied as a demonstrative example the parameters in the nonstationary marginal distributions were modeled as only a linear function of time without considering the impact of other covariates e g precipitation due to changes in climatic conditions and human interventions the extrapolation of past trends may not robustly represent the future conditions hu et al 2018 wu et al 2021 thus using only the time as a factor to drive the changes in the marginal distribution parameter is not ideal in future studies more reasonable covariates and different distributions need to be used to establish other nonstationary marginal distribution models that fit the flood variables out of which the optimal model can be selected based on an appropriate goodness index e g aic and bic however more attention must be paid to the predictive ability and robustness of the nonstationary model to avoid it from being too complicated and uncertain an extrapolation of the nonstationary marginal and joint distribution obtained from historical observations is risky because the deterministic causes of flood non stationarity in future years are not known moreover many parameters are introduced when applying a nonstationary copula model to construct the nonstationary joint distribution which will lead to uncertainty in the design value calculation because of the estimation uncertainty of the parameter the results show that the design flood volume of am1 and am15 for a design standard as well as the design flood combination including the conditional most likely and conditional expectation combinations change with the design lifespan length fig 11 i e even with the same design standard the aforementioned design values would be different for different lengths of the design lifespan this indicates that it is necessary to consider the impact of design lifespan length on the design flood estimation under non stationarity because the distributions used for estimating the design value in non stationarity are in the future years fig 2 therefore determining the period in which the project should be planned to be operative is vital for design flood estimation under non stationarity conditions hu et al 2018 6 conclusions we constructed nonstationary copula models to model the non stationarity of the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes including non stationarity of marginal distributions and copula dependence structure a framework for nonstationary bivariate design flood estimation is proposed the nonstationary model pe3 l in which the location parameter of the pe3 distribution varied over time was selected to model the marginal distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes the nonstationary copula model gumbel n in which the copula dependence structure varied over time was selected to simulate the joint distribution of the am1 and am15 flood volumes the temporal variation of the joint distribution was analyzed in terms of the joint probability and joint return period the results indicated that joint distribution changed over time and the am1 and am15 combinations associated with a given joint return period became less serve further into the future the typical combinations of the design values for the am1 and am15 flood volume including the conditional most likely and conditional expectation combinations were calculated for the return periods of 20 50 100 and 200 years under the design lifespan length from 10 to 100 years under non stationarity in the abovementioned combinations the design values of the am15 flood volume for a return period and design lifespan length were calculated using the er method the design values of the am1 flood volume conditioned on the am15 design value were calculated using the conditional most likely and conditional expectation combination strategies the results indicated that for a specific return period the design value of the am15 flood volume as well as the conditional most likely and conditional expectation design values of the am1 flood volume were affected by the design lifespan length the design values of the am1 and am15 flood volumes decreased with increase in the design lifespan length which conforms with the decrease of the two series the conditional most likely estimation of the design value of the am1 flood volume that was conditioned on the design value of the am15 flood volume was different from its conditional expectation estimation as the former was greater than the latter with respect to flood prevention and engineering safety the conditional most likely estimation approach was found to be more conservative and can be prioritized in future applications credit authorship contribution statement yiming hu conceptualization methodology

3731,statistical drought characterization is critical for drought studies within the multivariate temporal and frequency domains an efficient drought management can result in improved drought preparedness and risk management in this study standardized precipitation indices spis over various timeframes were derived using precipitation data the historical data for the hydrological stations and meteorological stations in sabah and sarawak malaysia were courtesy of the department of irrigation and drainage malaysia based on the spi index the meteorological drought trends periodicities and the turning points were analysed using the mann kendall mk test spearman rho sr test sequential mann kendall sqmk test k means clustering algorithm and the continuous wavelet transform cwt the mk and sr test were applied on a decade interval for a period of years from 1989 to 2018 according to the findings it was observed that there was a declining tendency shifting from the east to the west in sabah whereas in sarawak there was observed a declining trend across the state particularly in its central area the underlying trend of the droughts in sabah reveals that the dominant periodicity of the spi series that persisted throughout the study period at the sabah stations varied between 2 5 and 5 5 years however the periodicity in sarawak did not vary as much as it did in sabah the wavelet coherence analysis also reveals that significant coherence between spi and climatic indices occurred intermittently for shorter periodicities furthermore the longer dominating periodicities were shown to be associated with one or more climate phenomena keywords drought mk test k means clustering continuous wavelet transform cwt standardized precipitation index spi 1 introduction a drought is a natural occurrence caused by a shortage of precipitation in relation to the region s statistical inter intra annual rainfall hoffman and todd 2013 islam and ryan 2015 lybbert and carter 2015 albeit drought is frequently linked with low precipitation however it may also occur in areas with abundant rainfall in comparison to rapid events such as hurricanes and thunderstorms drought on the other hand have no immediate consequences and it has a long lasting effect adhikari 2018 edwards et al 2019 the complexities of drought are frequently attributable to its interaction with the global climate variability and anthropogenic according to singh et al 2021 the drought can also be closely linked to a slow onset incremental climatic change such as sea rising levels increasing temperatures and ocean acidification despite it being an extreme event droughts are classified into four types based on their duration meteorological agricultural hydrological and economic hao et al 2016 lai et al 2019 monjo et al 2020 although pinpointing when a drought begins and end is challenging drought prediction may be accomplished through constantly monitoring the rainfall streamflow and soil moisture liu et al 2016 park et al 2017 besides through the implementation of these indicators it allows for the assessment and measurement of the drought characteristics drought indicators are used to analyse the climatic factors that describe the drought event to evaluate the existence of the drought statistically rashid et al 2020 drought indicators characterize drought conditions using variables such as streamflow temperature precipitation vegetation stress level groundwater etc furthermore because of the diversity of the components of the hydrologic cycle these indicators can take a variety of forms the most common measures relating to the characteristics of the drought are frequency intensity severity and length several drought indices have been developed such as the palmer drought severity index phdi palmer 1965 surface water supply index swsi shafer and dezman 1982 and standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kogan 1995 some meteorological drought indicators for example the spi the crop moisture index cmi and the self calibrating pdsi sc pdsi are better adapted for dry weather environments to measure the impact of rainfall deficits on water supply particularly in streams reservoirs and lakes the hydrological drought indicators such as the phdi and swsi are more appropriate since point based weather data is collected at meteorological stations these indices may be ineffective when weather data is unavailable nonetheless remote sensing data can complement the absence of meteorological data recently remote sensing data have been utilized to continually monitor the drought with the assistance of some established drought indices one of the popular remote sensing based drought indices is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kogan 1995 several studies have utilized the ndvi in their drought assessment liu et al 2020 park et al 2018 shen et al 2019 there are also several review articles that have emphasized these drought indices eslamian et al 2017 song et al 2020 yihdego et al 2019 nevertheless supervising the drought mitigation work in the time and frequency domain is a complex task diaz et al 2020 furthermore drought is a complicated series since precipitation is a non stationary time series with shifting mean and variation over time unless the periodicity is consistent method such as the fourier analysis is not suited for extracting the spatiotemporal connection of time series bolzan et al 2020 chong et al 2019 ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2017 the wavelet transform wt have been the subject of a variety of studies in the water industry because of their capacity to evaluate a signal both over time and frequency simultaneously making it easy to locate localized signal information the wt is frequently utilized in the multi temporal scale hydrologic series analysis yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 when the continuous wavelet transform cwt is applied to a hydrologic series it generates a contour map of wavelet coefficients that illustrates their spatiotemporal connection a wt may also do cross correlation analysis to determine the connection between two series liu et al 2018 furthermore many studies utilized the wavelet analysis not only in trend identification but also in forecasting chong et al 2020 ni et al 2020 for example a discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose a hydrological parameter into a series of smaller components using a low and high pass filter hosseinzadeh 2020 the decrease in the complexity of the hydrological parameters facilitates the prediction this objective of this study is to define in depth the spatiotemporal evaluations of drought cycles in the states of sabah and sarawak in malaysia the initial analysis is to perform a mann kendall test mk test and the spearman rho test sr test based on the spi series of the rainfall station to determine the trend in the sabah state further research was carried out to explore the temporal and spatial variations in drought cycles at first the at site spi series were grouped into sub regions according to their similar drought characteristics using the k means clustering algorithm and then each of the sub region is analysed using the continuous wavelet transform and the sequential mk test to determine the dominant periodicity in the spi series finally a wavelet coherence is utilized to analyse the correlation between the spi series and several climatic indices such as the southern oscillation index soi the dipole mode index dmi and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo with a deepened understanding of the drought characteristics it helps to prepare for the worst scenarios 2 methodology 2 1 case study sabah and sarawak are located in east malaysia near the northernmost tip of the borneo island sabah receives between 2500 and 3500 mm of rain per year whereas sarawak has a higher average rainfall in the range of 3300 and 4600 mm although rainfall is consistent across this region of the country its distribution varies significantly according to the terrain and seasonal winds the precipitation is influenced by two monsoon seasons the northeast monsoon which delivers significant rains to parts of the country particularly in the northeast and the southwest monsoon which brings dry winds from the pacific ocean due to its proximity to the equator they are more susceptible to climatic changes compared to other states in west malaysia there are several extreme drought events that have occurred in the past decade the most extreme drought event occurred in the year 1982 1983 where there was a 15 reduction in precipitation in addition human activities primarily linked to forest fires had aggravated the situation even further the impact was tremendous with roughly 85 percent of the damage occurring in the logged over forest another incident had occurred in 1997 98 and while it was less severe than the one in 1983 the fires had caused some significant impact aside from the fire events sabah s growing water issue is also caused by the ubiquitous population and economic growth inadequate water availability and inefficient water resource management correspondingly sarawak is also often influenced by several climate variabilities such as the enso mjo and ido as a result any short term or long term drought in sabah and sarawak might result in severe water scarcity in this study data collected at 57 and 192 meteorological stations throughout 30 years were utilized to analyse the drought occurrence in sabah and sarawak respectively fig 1 shows the locations of the two case studies along with their rainfall stations 2 2 continuous wavelet transform cwt a wavelet can be expressed as a waveform that has a finite length of zero mean with a discrete point the common characteristics of a wavelet are irregular short duration and non symmetrical a continuous wavelet is built by interpolation and extrapolation from the original wavelet filter point to define a continuous wavelet in the mathematical term it can be expressed as a convolution of the time series with the wavelet function as shown below 1 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where the indicates the complex conjugate a wavelet can be stretched or scaled s and shifted n in time to match with the series the more a wavelet is stretched the lower the frequency it contains it gives information about the time and frequency of the series by knowing the amount of stretch and shifted required to fit with it another alternative way of computing the cwt is by using the fft algorithm as shown below 2 w n s n 0 n 1 x k ψ s ω k e i ω k n δ t where 3 x k 1 n n 0 n 1 x n e 2 π i k n n 4 ω k 2 π k n δ t k n 2 5 2 π k n δ t k n 2 where ψ is the normalized wavelet function the normalization is carried to ensure that the total probability in the whole search base is at maximum or 1 and the normalization process can be done by multiplying a constant value of 2 π s δ t 1 2 with unnormalized wavelet function ψ 0 6 ψ s ω k 2 π s δ t 1 2 ψ 0 s ω k there are several wavelet families and these can be analysed either continuously or discretely the sort of analysis that will be performed is determined by the wavelet s orthogonality attribute the morlet morl in short mexican hat marr and gaussian gauss wavelets are non orthogonal wavelets whereas the haar daubechies dbn coiflets coifn symlets symn biorsplines biorm n reversebior rbiom n and dmeyer wavelets are orthogonal wavelets dmey sang et al 2016 according to torrence and compo 1998 a non orthogonal wavelet may be used for both discrete and continuous analysis the wavelet function employed is also determined by the time series under consideration a morlet wavelet is an excellent option as the mother wavelet among the three non orthogonal wavelets notably in the subject of hydrology potočki et al 2017 in comparison to other wavelet functions such as the mexican hat function and the classic sine function the morlet wavelet function accurately characterizes the form of hydrological data which provides a fair balance of temporal and frequency localization liu et al 2011 sharma et al 2018 in this study a morlet wavelet function is used and it is defined as 7 ψ 0 s ω k π 1 4 h ω e s ω ω 2 2 where h ω heaviside step function h ω 1 if ω 0 h ω 0 otherwise the wavelet function is usually complex and consists of two parts a real part and an imaginary part besides the wavelet power spectrum can be obtained by squaring the wavelet transforms wn s 2 the wavelet spectrum can be normalized using the equation to make comparing different wavelet power spectra easier wn s 2 σ 2 2 3 mann kendall mk and sequential mk sqmk test the mk test is used to determine the presence of a monotonic upwards or downwards trend in the data collected over time in a time series like any other statistical test it contains two hypotheses a null hypothesis ho and an alternative hypothesis ha by rejecting the ho it means that the data collected in the series is independent and has no trend on the other hand by accepting the ha it concludes that there is a positive or negative trend in the series the mk procedure is as shown below ho no monotonic trend is present ha a monotonic trend is present 8 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n 1 s g n x j x k 9 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 where sgn x is defined as s g n x 1 f o r x 0 10 0 f o r x 0 11 1 f o r x 0 12 and the normalized test statistic zmk is as defined as z m k s 1 v f o r x 0 13 0 f o r x 0 14 s 1 v f o r x 0 15 where z m k value is used to evaluate the presence of a statistically significant trend s represents the summation of differences in the total number of positive minus the number of negative v represents the variance of the dataset n represents the number of data points mk test reveals the overall trends of the series but if the progression of the trend throughout the period is necessary then a sequential mk test can be applied this test can show how the trend changes over time in this test there are two series a progressive series t and a backward series u t the crossing between the two series indicates that there is a change in the trend sequential progressive value can be calculated as 16 u t t i e t v a r t i and parameter t i e t and v a r t i can be calculated as 17 t i j 1 i n j 18 e t n n 1 4 19 v a r t i i i 1 i 5 72 where t i represents the cumulative summation at i th data point e t and v a r t i represent the mean and variance of the series respectively as for the sequential backward series it is calculated using the same steps above but in a reverse direction starting from the end of the series 2 4 spearman rho test sr test the sr test similar to the mk test is a nonparametric test used to determine whether or not there is a significant correlation between two variables x and y the sr test may be used as a trend test by substituting one of the variables with time the mathematical term of sr test can be defined as 20 r s 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where r s represents the sr test coefficient n represents the number of ranked pairs d i represents the difference between a ranked pair when the computed r s differs considerably from zero it indicates that the time and dataset series are correlated implying a trend 2 5 standardized precipitation indices spi the spi is a metric that can be used to assess the wet and dry events in a region which was created by mckee et al 1993 drought has a start date an end date a severity level and a magnitude level due to its ease of use based on precipitation it is a widely used indicator for measuring drought occurrences besides the spi computation provides the benefit of choosing the time scale of one s preference 1 3 6 9 and 12 months etc furthermore the conversion of the gamma modelled historical data into normally distributed data with constant value over time and space allows for a more objective evaluation of dry and wet periods the spi acts as an indicator which quantifies the intensity of dry or wet events the following steps are used to compute the spi a set of averaging periods are generated and is determined by the previous j months where j is 1 3 6 and 12 months and then each of the data is fitted to the gamma function to determine the relationship of the probability to the rainfall the gamma distribution s probability density function is defined as 21 g x 1 β α t α x α 1 e x β f o r x 0 where α and β represent the shape and scale parameters respectively x is the precipitation amount t α represents the gamma function the α and β parameters are estimated using the the shape and scale parameters can be estimated using the approximation of thom 22 α 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 and 23 β x α with 24 a ln x ln x n where x represents the average precipitation n represents the number of data points in the series x represents the precipitation at the current period in the subsequent step the cumulative probability of an observed amount of precipitation is obtained using the equation 25 g x 0 x g x d x g x 1 β α t α x α 1 e x β d x when x 0 the gamma distribution will return an undefined value therefore the above equation is modified as shown below 26 h x q 1 q g x once the modified cumulative probability is estimated an approximation of spi index can be calculated abromowitz and stegun 1965 spi t c 0 c

drought index proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 which includes both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet influence spei is a simple calculation that is based on the original spi calculation technique since spei uses pet influence in defining drought the first step is to compute the difference between precipitation p i and pet i for month i 31 d p i pet i where d represents the difference between precipitation and pet pi represents the precipitation following the same approach in the spi the computed di values are aggregated at different time frames dk is then normalized as a log logistic probability distribution which is necessary to compute a three parameter distribution 32 f x β α x γ α 1 x γ α 2 where parameters α β and γ represent scale shape and origin respectively the l moment method is used to calculate the parameters of the above log logistic probability distribution 33 β 2 w 1 w 2 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 34 α w 0 2 w 1 β t 1 1 β t 1 1 β 35 α w 0 α t 1 1

analysis was performed in this study to assess whether the spi is appropriate for drought monitoring purposes by comparing it to the spei in a comparative study of the spi and spei by balbo et al 2019 the use of spi and spei is interchangeable when there is just a minor fluctuation in climatological temperature 2 c 30 years it was evident from the consistent distribution of drought frequency df and duration dd between spi and spei in sabah fig 2 according to the linear regression analysis on the temperature dataset in sabah as shown in table 1 the temperature rise is 2 c unlike sabah sarawak s df and dd components exhibited a minor difference between spi and spei fig 3 the discrepancy might be attributed to the influence of rising temperatures in specific regions as indicated in table 1 although the difference is modest it highlights the significance of temperature fluctuation in defining drought however the efficiency of the spei index depends on the availability of temperature data and the pet equation tefera et al 2019 tirivarombo et al 2018 due to the lack of temperature data some missing temperature data had to be interpolated for the spei computation therefore in this study spi was used for drought monitoring due to the ease of data computation the difference between spei and spi in terms of drought severity distribution over timescales might be due to the presence of short and long term periodicities 3 1 multi scale patterns of the drought to recap in this study to analyse the drought 57 stations in sabah and 192 stations in sarawak state were used respectively data 1989 2017 at all the stations are courtesy of the department of irrigation and drainage malaysia the assessment of the meteorological changes was carried out through the nonparametric mk test method on the spi index in the year range of 1989 1998s 1999 2008s 2009 2017 the annual intervals are designated a through c for ease of reference as shown in fig 4 the data produced here demonstrates how the precipitation pattern over the country has changed since the 1989s as the spi is a drought measure based only on precipitation terms between 1990 and 1998 31 6 percent of the stations had exhibited declining trends but only 1 8 percent of the sites having demonstrated significance p 0 05 the highest magnitude trend was an mk value of 3 02 the declining tendency was particularly noticeable in the plains of sabah s eastern section the locations that exhibited a positive trend on the other hand were primarily in sabah s western area in terms of percentages there were little or no changes compared to the preceding year from 1971 to 1980 the middle region of sabah however has begun to exhibit negative tendencies overall the drought trend in sabah has consistently decreased from 2009 to 2017 with 62 5 percent of the region s stations exhibiting negative growth given the increase in the number of spi stations with a negative mk value this implies a consistent dry spell throughout the study period the drought precipitation trend showed a shift from the eastern part towards the western part of declining tendencies a similar tendency was seen in the sarawak state where the number of stations displaying negative trends had increased from 1989 to 2017 to demonstrate the changes quantitatively the number of stations with negative trends was 19 2 percent in the first ten years of the study period gradually increasing to 30 8 percent in the next ten years and 59 1 percent in the last decade the mk test value decreased at the majority of the stations with the central sarawak region being the most impacted the sr test was then applied to the same at site spi series to compare the trend observed with the mk test the results are given in fig 5 demonstrating that the outcomes of both tests were identical the sr test s similarities in trend detection have increased the reliability of the mk test s results furthermore in the study by yue et al 2002 the authors have tested the power of both non parametric tests in the hydrological series they reported that several factors such as distribution type and sample size affected the effectiveness of these tests these two tests according to their simulation findings have comparable power in spotting a trend 3 2 drought homogeneous sub regions identification a regionalization technique is frequently used as an alternative to estimating data at ungauged sites wan and konyha 2015 furthermore it has been demonstrated in numerous studies that drought monitoring utilising at site series may underestimate the drought level owing to asynchronous fluctuations earle 1993 zhou and liu 2016 therefore in this section the drought was investigated regionally in this study on a 1 3 6 and 12 month basis a k means clustering approach was applied to the spi index to generate homogenous sub regions based on their drought characteristics the spi 1 is strongly connected to soil moisture on short time intervals whereas the spi 3 is related to groundwater and reservoir storage on longer time scales the spi 6 can be used to monitor hydrological agricultural droughts whereas the spi 12 can be used to monitor hydrological droughts there are several clustering algorithms to select from and there is no one optimum clustering method for all circumstances however the k means clustering technique is widely utilized in hydrology research for a variety of objectives including 1 hydrologic catchment categorization for information transfer or forecasting the ungauged basin sawicz et al 2011 sharghi et al 2018 2 risk assessment for floods matheswaran et al 2018 xu et al 2018 3 regionalization of drought goyal and sharma 2016 santos et al 2011 when using the k means clustering algorithm there are two ways of evaluating the results the silhouette method si and the square of sum errors sse fig 6 in the si a number near 1 is usually desirable but in the sse it s always beneficial to check for sudden shifts in the graph often known as the knee effect the figure depicts these two requirements for each of the spi series for example in the spi 1 the sse is maximum when the cluster number is 3 and then there is a rapid change in si when the cluster number is 3 it is worth noting that the number of clusters for each spi series may not be the same when the cluster number reaches three the area can be divided into three homogenous sub regions of comparable drought characteristics the drought features of spi 1 3 6 and 12 for each sub region are shown in fig 7 and listed in table 2 the sensitivity of the spi readings at different periods varies significantly the smaller the time scale the more evident the wet and dry variations are for the short term the spi 1 and spi 3 divided the region into three sub regions meanwhile for the long term the spi 12 six homogeneous sub areas were categorized drought features and their temporal evolution varied substantially among sub regions at different times scales of the spi series for example in the spi 1 according to drought characteristics in table 2 the drier sub regions of b had the highest frequency of drought f 73 the wetter sub region of a and c had the lowest frequency of drought f 62 and 66 respectively in the case of the spi 12 the western part of sabah revealed three more different sub regions according to the short and long term spi statistics the western portions of sabah had the most severe drought from 1989 to 2017 the influence of the el nino southern oscillation enso phenomenon on rainfall in the west coast of sabah contributed significantly to the declining spi trend according to research by wen and sidik 2011 another explanation for the wetter east coast of sabah is that the north east monsoon blows from november to april bringing significant precipitation with it meanwhile sarawak consists of more evenly distributed homogeneous regions the consistency in the clustering of the spi stations on various scales has indicated that the effect of water scarcity has a similar trend in the short and long term run furthermore the disparity in clustering areas is becoming increasingly visible on the longer spi scale while the western part of the state experiences more drought the eastern part of the state is affected by drought for a prolonged period 3 3 analysis of continuous wavelet transform the growing threat of drought necessitates an accurate analysis of the long term meteorological data for better water management by utilizing a wavelet transform a better representation of the drought spatiotemporal variation can be obtained the results obtained from the cwt is presented and discussed in this section figs 8 and 9 show the scalograms of the stations spi time data by looking at the high intensity area of the scalogram and visualizing its magnitude the periodicity may be recognized the dark blue zone represents a negative spi index while the dark red region represents a positive spi index according to the cwt analysis both states have a similar periodicity especially on the short term scale figs 8 9 the shorter dominating periodicity 12 months occurred in the spi 1 and spi3 for all sub regions the spi 6 and spi 12 on the other hand showed longer periodicity 12 months the higher the frequency fluctuation of the cycle the shorter the periodicity drought frequency rose in the study region as the environment became drier for all sub regions in the spi 1 and spi 3 the cwt shows significant periodicities of drought variations in a range of 12 months 3 4 sub regional drought characteristics and their temporal evolution in addition to determining the most common periodicity in the series cwt was used to assess the temporal variability of the short and long term drought cycles in this study the spi 12 was used to examine both the short and long terms table 3 summarises the results obtained from the analysis of the cwt for short and long term drought periodicity in the early and later years of the study period a short drought periodicity of 2 3 years was observed in spi12e as shown in fig 8 a shift from a long drought period to a short drought periodicity was seen at an approximately periodicity level of 5 5 years the transition zone occurred between the years 2006 to 2007 in the case of spi12d a short term periodicity was seen to shift from 3 5 to 2 years in 2004 in the middle of the decade the long term drought cycle with a 5 5 year periodicity came to an end as seen in the picture the short term drought cycle affected nearly the whole research period according to the clustering this region was the most vulnerable to drought occurrences drought periods are comparable in both the spi12c and spi12b series in sabah s central region from the beginning of the study period the year 1989 until 2017 there were two prevailing periodicity structures 5 5 and 2 5 years there was no discernible drought cycle between the early and late periods the long term periodicity at the end of the study period was around 4 5 years the northern area as indicated in table 3 was the least affected by the drought drought intensity would be affected by changes in dominating periodicities in the cwt through time the dominant periodicity of the spi series of sabah stations varied between 2 5 and 5 5 years droughts were less prevalent in all sub regions towards the middle of the study period owing to an increase in the long term drought dominant periodicity at spi12e a slight decrease in the short term drought cycle which implies that the occurrence of drought has risen considerably meanwhile a continuous short term drought cycle at spi12d would suggest that short term droughts are more prevalent than at spi12e spi12a s structure provides essential information regarding sabah s east area the lesser variance there is in the periodicity the easier it is to forecast what will happen the analysis of the sarawak trend was relatively simpler than that of sabah due to the lower number of clusters the two homogeneous sub regions were dominated by a short term drought at a periodicity level of 1 2 years and 2 3 years respectively the cwt analysis has also revealed a long term drought cycle in the western region the presence of multiple drought cycles may have led to the rise in the drought incidence as indicated in table 3 3 5 turning point analysis using sqmk to verify the above result an sqmk test was performed on the spi series by observing the crossover of the two series the turning point in the spi series may be seen the results of the sqmk test for the spi series detected the change in the trend of the spi series fig 10 depicts the progressive and retrograde series u t and u t as well as their intersection the sqmk test identified no notable turning point in the spi series of sarawak s two homogeneous sub regions since the progressive and retrograde sequential series u t and u t were moving in the same direction in the spi series of sabah s homogenous sub regions however several turning points have been identified in spi 12a there was a downward tendency at the beginning in the year 1989 with a turning point coming towards the end of the year 1993 the progressive and retrograde sequential series u t and u t were observed traveling in the same direction after the turning point a shift from a declining to a rising trend at the beginning of the period might indicate that the long term trend is robust and long lasting in comparison to the cwt the sequential mk test detected several turning points throughout the study period in spi 12b 12c and 12d there was another transition that occurred at the end of the study period around the year 2006 the recent increase in the spi series implies that the present trend is less likely to continue both u t and u t values for the spi12e stayed roughly parallel suggesting no discernible trend 3 6 wavelet coherence with climatic indices the wavelet coherence was employed in this work to assess the relationship between the spi series and the climatic indices the intensity of the colour bar determines the connection between them just as the wavelet spectrum the brightness of the colour bar defines the link between them much as a wavelet spectrum with a value of zero dark blue denotes no dependency in the series and strong dependence light yellow if the value is one the arrows in the wavelet coherence plot represent the relative phasing of two series that is they are physically related if the phase lag is consistent or slowly varying if the arrows point to the right the two series are in phase if the arrows point to the left the two series are anti phase besides an upward downward arrow shows that the spi series lags leads the climatic indices by 90 figs 11 and 12 depict time localized regions of high coherence that occur during the corresponding climate indicators for a shorter periodicity of less than one year not only do the strong coherence occur irregularly from year to year but it also does not occur in the same way for any of the sub regions furthermore wavelet coherence can reveal the relationship between the dominating periodicity derived from the cwt analysis and climatic variables among the three climatic indices the pdo showed no significant power on the dominant periodicities in spi12a in sarawak it would imply that the pdo had less of an impact on the long term spi index fluctuations in all sub regions throughout the study period in terms of the two dominant periodicities the dmi exhibited strong anti phase coherence with the spi series whereas the soi and the spi exhibited strong in phase coherence one of the commonalities between sabah and sarawak is that the phase lag of these climate indices was comparable in contrast to sarawak where the pdo has the minimum influence on dominant periodicity sabah has a significant anti phase coherence between the pdo and the spi in general the drought periodicities in sabah and sarawak have a strong association with the climatic indices table 4 summarizes the relationship between spi and climatic indices 4 conclusions this study evaluated the spatial and temporal evolutions of droughts in sabah and sarawak state using several analytical methods with data from a statistical test known as the mk test was used to determine the trend reflected at the rainfall stations the spi time series one of the most widely used indices to track drought was utilized to monitor the drought variation and regularity the mk test indicates that the negative trend was most prominent in the eastern region at the early years of the study period by the end of the study period the number of spi stations with a negative mk value had increased indicating a persistent dry spell besides the clustering algorithm has shown that the long term spi 12 can be categorized into five homogeneous sub regions with similar drought characteristics based on results tabulated in table 1 spi 12d and spi 12e experienced the highest severity of drought occurrence compared to other regions to detect the presence of a dominating periodicity a cwt analysis was used the cwt scalogram reveals that each spi series contained a distinct or a few periodicities and the transition between cycles if they exist the most common short term periodicity was 2 4 3 years whereas the most common long term periodicity was 5 5 6 years the transition zone observed in the cwt corresponds to the results of the sequential mk test the cwt analysis also revealed that three locations had a similar turning point in the drought cycle interestingly sarawak is likewise experiencing a rise in the negative trend across the state with the central area being the most affected sarawak s variance of drought cycles seemed less intricate than that of sabah evidenced by the lowest number of clusters according to the clustering data the western area has a higher incidence of drought than its eastern counterpart although for a shorter period in terms of periodicity sarawak s drought pattern was characterized by shorter term drought cycles lasting 1 2 years and 2 3 years the wavelet coherence was used to assess the relationships between the spi series and several climate indices results have reflected that the presence of the dominant periodicities is associated with not only one but several climatic indices furthermore strong coherence between the spi and climate indicators was seen intermittently from year to year for shorter periodicities of less than one year due to the varying sensitivity of drought indices to precipitation and temperature a drought evaluation method based on various indices may result in differing perspectives on future drought features as a result to produce a comprehensive drought assessment the synthesis of several drought indices may be investigated to provide a more accurate representation of the onset and progression of the drought furthermore the spi index should be utilized with caution in sabah and sarawak owing to rising temperatures a future study on drought assessment should be conducted using the spei index when the temperature rises become evident 2 c 30 years last but not least additional orthogonal wavelets such as the paul and mexican wavelets could be used more extensively to utilize the different features of the precipitation series credit authorship contribution statement k l chong conceptualization methodology formal analysis software writing original draft writing

3731,statistical drought characterization is critical for drought studies within the multivariate temporal and frequency domains an efficient drought management can result in improved drought preparedness and risk management in this study standardized precipitation indices spis over various timeframes were derived using precipitation data the historical data for the hydrological stations and meteorological stations in sabah and sarawak malaysia were courtesy of the department of irrigation and drainage malaysia based on the spi index the meteorological drought trends periodicities and the turning points were analysed using the mann kendall mk test spearman rho sr test sequential mann kendall sqmk test k means clustering algorithm and the continuous wavelet transform cwt the mk and sr test were applied on a decade interval for a period of years from 1989 to 2018 according to the findings it was observed that there was a declining tendency shifting from the east to the west in sabah whereas in sarawak there was observed a declining trend across the state particularly in its central area the underlying trend of the droughts in sabah reveals that the dominant periodicity of the spi series that persisted throughout the study period at the sabah stations varied between 2 5 and 5 5 years however the periodicity in sarawak did not vary as much as it did in sabah the wavelet coherence analysis also reveals that significant coherence between spi and climatic indices occurred intermittently for shorter periodicities furthermore the longer dominating periodicities were shown to be associated with one or more climate phenomena keywords drought mk test k means clustering continuous wavelet transform cwt standardized precipitation index spi 1 introduction a drought is a natural occurrence caused by a shortage of precipitation in relation to the region s statistical inter intra annual rainfall hoffman and todd 2013 islam and ryan 2015 lybbert and carter 2015 albeit drought is frequently linked with low precipitation however it may also occur in areas with abundant rainfall in comparison to rapid events such as hurricanes and thunderstorms drought on the other hand have no immediate consequences and it has a long lasting effect adhikari 2018 edwards et al 2019 the complexities of drought are frequently attributable to its interaction with the global climate variability and anthropogenic according to singh et al 2021 the drought can also be closely linked to a slow onset incremental climatic change such as sea rising levels increasing temperatures and ocean acidification despite it being an extreme event droughts are classified into four types based on their duration meteorological agricultural hydrological and economic hao et al 2016 lai et al 2019 monjo et al 2020 although pinpointing when a drought begins and end is challenging drought prediction may be accomplished through constantly monitoring the rainfall streamflow and soil moisture liu et al 2016 park et al 2017 besides through the implementation of these indicators it allows for the assessment and measurement of the drought characteristics drought indicators are used to analyse the climatic factors that describe the drought event to evaluate the existence of the drought statistically rashid et al 2020 drought indicators characterize drought conditions using variables such as streamflow temperature precipitation vegetation stress level groundwater etc furthermore because of the diversity of the components of the hydrologic cycle these indicators can take a variety of forms the most common measures relating to the characteristics of the drought are frequency intensity severity and length several drought indices have been developed such as the palmer drought severity index phdi palmer 1965 surface water supply index swsi shafer and dezman 1982 and standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kogan 1995 some meteorological drought indicators for example the spi the crop moisture index cmi and the self calibrating pdsi sc pdsi are better adapted for dry weather environments to measure the impact of rainfall deficits on water supply particularly in streams reservoirs and lakes the hydrological drought indicators such as the phdi and swsi are more appropriate since point based weather data is collected at meteorological stations these indices may be ineffective when weather data is unavailable nonetheless remote sensing data can complement the absence of meteorological data recently remote sensing data have been utilized to continually monitor the drought with the assistance of some established drought indices one of the popular remote sensing based drought indices is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kogan 1995 several studies have utilized the ndvi in their drought assessment liu et al 2020 park et al 2018 shen et al 2019 there are also several review articles that have emphasized these drought indices eslamian et al 2017 song et al 2020 yihdego et al 2019 nevertheless supervising the drought mitigation work in the time and frequency domain is a complex task diaz et al 2020 furthermore drought is a complicated series since precipitation is a non stationary time series with shifting mean and variation over time unless the periodicity is consistent method such as the fourier analysis is not suited for extracting the spatiotemporal connection of time series bolzan et al 2020 chong et al 2019 ghaderpour and pagiatakis 2017 the wavelet transform wt have been the subject of a variety of studies in the water industry because of their capacity to evaluate a signal both over time and frequency simultaneously making it easy to locate localized signal information the wt is frequently utilized in the multi temporal scale hydrologic series analysis yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 when the continuous wavelet transform cwt is applied to a hydrologic series it generates a contour map of wavelet coefficients that illustrates their spatiotemporal connection a wt may also do cross correlation analysis to determine the connection between two series liu et al 2018 furthermore many studies utilized the wavelet analysis not only in trend identification but also in forecasting chong et al 2020 ni et al 2020 for example a discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose a hydrological parameter into a series of smaller components using a low and high pass filter hosseinzadeh 2020 the decrease in the complexity of the hydrological parameters facilitates the prediction this objective of this study is to define in depth the spatiotemporal evaluations of drought cycles in the states of sabah and sarawak in malaysia the initial analysis is to perform a mann kendall test mk test and the spearman rho test sr test based on the spi series of the rainfall station to determine the trend in the sabah state further research was carried out to explore the temporal and spatial variations in drought cycles at first the at site spi series were grouped into sub regions according to their similar drought characteristics using the k means clustering algorithm and then each of the sub region is analysed using the continuous wavelet transform and the sequential mk test to determine the dominant periodicity in the spi series finally a wavelet coherence is utilized to analyse the correlation between the spi series and several climatic indices such as the southern oscillation index soi the dipole mode index dmi and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo with a deepened understanding of the drought characteristics it helps to prepare for the worst scenarios 2 methodology 2 1 case study sabah and sarawak are located in east malaysia near the northernmost tip of the borneo island sabah receives between 2500 and 3500 mm of rain per year whereas sarawak has a higher average rainfall in the range of 3300 and 4600 mm although rainfall is consistent across this region of the country its distribution varies significantly according to the terrain and seasonal winds the precipitation is influenced by two monsoon seasons the northeast monsoon which delivers significant rains to parts of the country particularly in the northeast and the southwest monsoon which brings dry winds from the pacific ocean due to its proximity to the equator they are more susceptible to climatic changes compared to other states in west malaysia there are several extreme drought events that have occurred in the past decade the most extreme drought event occurred in the year 1982 1983 where there was a 15 reduction in precipitation in addition human activities primarily linked to forest fires had aggravated the situation even further the impact was tremendous with roughly 85 percent of the damage occurring in the logged over forest another incident had occurred in 1997 98 and while it was less severe than the one in 1983 the fires had caused some significant impact aside from the fire events sabah s growing water issue is also caused by the ubiquitous population and economic growth inadequate water availability and inefficient water resource management correspondingly sarawak is also often influenced by several climate variabilities such as the enso mjo and ido as a result any short term or long term drought in sabah and sarawak might result in severe water scarcity in this study data collected at 57 and 192 meteorological stations throughout 30 years were utilized to analyse the drought occurrence in sabah and sarawak respectively fig 1 shows the locations of the two case studies along with their rainfall stations 2 2 continuous wavelet transform cwt a wavelet can be expressed as a waveform that has a finite length of zero mean with a discrete point the common characteristics of a wavelet are irregular short duration and non symmetrical a continuous wavelet is built by interpolation and extrapolation from the original wavelet filter point to define a continuous wavelet in the mathematical term it can be expressed as a convolution of the time series with the wavelet function as shown below 1 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where the indicates the complex conjugate a wavelet can be stretched or scaled s and shifted n in time to match with the series the more a wavelet is stretched the lower the frequency it contains it gives information about the time and frequency of the series by knowing the amount of stretch and shifted required to fit with it another alternative way of computing the cwt is by using the fft algorithm as shown below 2 w n s n 0 n 1 x k ψ s ω k e i ω k n δ t where 3 x k 1 n n 0 n 1 x n e 2 π i k n n 4 ω k 2 π k n δ t k n 2 5 2 π k n δ t k n 2 where ψ is the normalized wavelet function the normalization is carried to ensure that the total probability in the whole search base is at maximum or 1 and the normalization process can be done by multiplying a constant value of 2 π s δ t 1 2 with unnormalized wavelet function ψ 0 6 ψ s ω k 2 π s δ t 1 2 ψ 0 s ω k there are several wavelet families and these can be analysed either continuously or discretely the sort of analysis that will be performed is determined by the wavelet s orthogonality attribute the morlet morl in short mexican hat marr and gaussian gauss wavelets are non orthogonal wavelets whereas the haar daubechies dbn coiflets coifn symlets symn biorsplines biorm n reversebior rbiom n and dmeyer wavelets are orthogonal wavelets dmey sang et al 2016 according to torrence and compo 1998 a non orthogonal wavelet may be used for both discrete and continuous analysis the wavelet function employed is also determined by the time series under consideration a morlet wavelet is an excellent option as the mother wavelet among the three non orthogonal wavelets notably in the subject of hydrology potočki et al 2017 in comparison to other wavelet functions such as the mexican hat function and the classic sine function the morlet wavelet function accurately characterizes the form of hydrological data which provides a fair balance of temporal and frequency localization liu et al 2011 sharma et al 2018 in this study a morlet wavelet function is used and it is defined as 7 ψ 0 s ω k π 1 4 h ω e s ω ω 2 2 where h ω heaviside step function h ω 1 if ω 0 h ω 0 otherwise the wavelet function is usually complex and consists of two parts a real part and an imaginary part besides the wavelet power spectrum can be obtained by squaring the wavelet transforms wn s 2 the wavelet spectrum can be normalized using the equation to make comparing different wavelet power spectra easier wn s 2 σ 2 2 3 mann kendall mk and sequential mk sqmk test the mk test is used to determine the presence of a monotonic upwards or downwards trend in the data collected over time in a time series like any other statistical test it contains two hypotheses a null hypothesis ho and an alternative hypothesis ha by rejecting the ho it means that the data collected in the series is independent and has no trend on the other hand by accepting the ha it concludes that there is a positive or negative trend in the series the mk procedure is as shown below ho no monotonic trend is present ha a monotonic trend is present 8 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n 1 s g n x j x k 9 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 where sgn x is defined as s g n x 1 f o r x 0 10 0 f o r x 0 11 1 f o r x 0 12 and the normalized test statistic zmk is as defined as z m k s 1 v f o r x 0 13 0 f o r x 0 14 s 1 v f o r x 0 15 where z m k value is used to evaluate the presence of a statistically significant trend s represents the summation of differences in the total number of positive minus the number of negative v represents the variance of the dataset n represents the number of data points mk test reveals the overall trends of the series but if the progression of the trend throughout the period is necessary then a sequential mk test can be applied this test can show how the trend changes over time in this test there are two series a progressive series t and a backward series u t the crossing between the two series indicates that there is a change in the trend sequential progressive value can be calculated as 16 u t t i e t v a r t i and parameter t i e t and v a r t i can be calculated as 17 t i j 1 i n j 18 e t n n 1 4 19 v a r t i i i 1 i 5 72 where t i represents the cumulative summation at i th data point e t and v a r t i represent the mean and variance of the series respectively as for the sequential backward series it is calculated using the same steps above but in a reverse direction starting from the end of the series 2 4 spearman rho test sr test the sr test similar to the mk test is a nonparametric test used to determine whether or not there is a significant correlation between two variables x and y the sr test may be used as a trend test by substituting one of the variables with time the mathematical term of sr test can be defined as 20 r s 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where r s represents the sr test coefficient n represents the number of ranked pairs d i represents the difference between a ranked pair when the computed r s differs considerably from zero it indicates that the time and dataset series are correlated implying a trend 2 5 standardized precipitation indices spi the spi is a metric that can be used to assess the wet and dry events in a region which was created by mckee et al 1993 drought has a start date an end date a severity level and a magnitude level due to its ease of use based on precipitation it is a widely used indicator for measuring drought occurrences besides the spi computation provides the benefit of choosing the time scale of one s preference 1 3 6 9 and 12 months etc furthermore the conversion of the gamma modelled historical data into normally distributed data with constant value over time and space allows for a more objective evaluation of dry and wet periods the spi acts as an indicator which quantifies the intensity of dry or wet events the following steps are used to compute the spi a set of averaging periods are generated and is determined by the previous j months where j is 1 3 6 and 12 months and then each of the data is fitted to the gamma function to determine the relationship of the probability to the rainfall the gamma distribution s probability density function is defined as 21 g x 1 β α t α x α 1 e x β f o r x 0 where α and β represent the shape and scale parameters respectively x is the precipitation amount t α represents the gamma function the α and β parameters are estimated using the the shape and scale parameters can be estimated using the approximation of thom 22 α 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 and 23 β x α with 24 a ln x ln x n where x represents the average precipitation n represents the number of data points in the series x represents the precipitation at the current period in the subsequent step the cumulative probability of an observed amount of precipitation is obtained using the equation 25 g x 0 x g x d x g x 1 β α t α x α 1 e x β d x when x 0 the gamma distribution will return an undefined value therefore the above equation is modified as shown below 26 h x q 1 q g x once the modified cumulative probability is estimated an approximation of spi index can be calculated abromowitz and stegun 1965 spi t c 0 c

drought index proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 which includes both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet influence spei is a simple calculation that is based on the original spi calculation technique since spei uses pet influence in defining drought the first step is to compute the difference between precipitation p i and pet i for month i 31 d p i pet i where d represents the difference between precipitation and pet pi represents the precipitation following the same approach in the spi the computed di values are aggregated at different time frames dk is then normalized as a log logistic probability distribution which is necessary to compute a three parameter distribution 32 f x β α x γ α 1 x γ α 2 where parameters α β and γ represent scale shape and origin respectively the l moment method is used to calculate the parameters of the above log logistic probability distribution 33 β 2 w 1 w 2 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 34 α w 0 2 w 1 β t 1 1 β t 1 1 β 35 α w 0 α t 1 1

analysis was performed in this study to assess whether the spi is appropriate for drought monitoring purposes by comparing it to the spei in a comparative study of the spi and spei by balbo et al 2019 the use of spi and spei is interchangeable when there is just a minor fluctuation in climatological temperature 2 c 30 years it was evident from the consistent distribution of drought frequency df and duration dd between spi and spei in sabah fig 2 according to the linear regression analysis on the temperature dataset in sabah as shown in table 1 the temperature rise is 2 c unlike sabah sarawak s df and dd components exhibited a minor difference between spi and spei fig 3 the discrepancy might be attributed to the influence of rising temperatures in specific regions as indicated in table 1 although the difference is modest it highlights the significance of temperature fluctuation in defining drought however the efficiency of the spei index depends on the availability of temperature data and the pet equation tefera et al 2019 tirivarombo et al 2018 due to the lack of temperature data some missing temperature data had to be interpolated for the spei computation therefore in this study spi was used for drought monitoring due to the ease of data computation the difference between spei and spi in terms of drought severity distribution over timescales might be due to the presence of short and long term periodicities 3 1 multi scale patterns of the drought to recap in this study to analyse the drought 57 stations in sabah and 192 stations in sarawak state were used respectively data 1989 2017 at all the stations are courtesy of the department of irrigation and drainage malaysia the assessment of the meteorological changes was carried out through the nonparametric mk test method on the spi index in the year range of 1989 1998s 1999 2008s 2009 2017 the annual intervals are designated a through c for ease of reference as shown in fig 4 the data produced here demonstrates how the precipitation pattern over the country has changed since the 1989s as the spi is a drought measure based only on precipitation terms between 1990 and 1998 31 6 percent of the stations had exhibited declining trends but only 1 8 percent of the sites having demonstrated significance p 0 05 the highest magnitude trend was an mk value of 3 02 the declining tendency was particularly noticeable in the plains of sabah s eastern section the locations that exhibited a positive trend on the other hand were primarily in sabah s western area in terms of percentages there were little or no changes compared to the preceding year from 1971 to 1980 the middle region of sabah however has begun to exhibit negative tendencies overall the drought trend in sabah has consistently decreased from 2009 to 2017 with 62 5 percent of the region s stations exhibiting negative growth given the increase in the number of spi stations with a negative mk value this implies a consistent dry spell throughout the study period the drought precipitation trend showed a shift from the eastern part towards the western part of declining tendencies a similar tendency was seen in the sarawak state where the number of stations displaying negative trends had increased from 1989 to 2017 to demonstrate the changes quantitatively the number of stations with negative trends was 19 2 percent in the first ten years of the study period gradually increasing to 30 8 percent in the next ten years and 59 1 percent in the last decade the mk test value decreased at the majority of the stations with the central sarawak region being the most impacted the sr test was then applied to the same at site spi series to compare the trend observed with the mk test the results are given in fig 5 demonstrating that the outcomes of both tests were identical the sr test s similarities in trend detection have increased the reliability of the mk test s results furthermore in the study by yue et al 2002 the authors have tested the power of both non parametric tests in the hydrological series they reported that several factors such as distribution type and sample size affected the effectiveness of these tests these two tests according to their simulation findings have comparable power in spotting a trend 3 2 drought homogeneous sub regions identification a regionalization technique is frequently used as an alternative to estimating data at ungauged sites wan and konyha 2015 furthermore it has been demonstrated in numerous studies that drought monitoring utilising at site series may underestimate the drought level owing to asynchronous fluctuations earle 1993 zhou and liu 2016 therefore in this section the drought was investigated regionally in this study on a 1 3 6 and 12 month basis a k means clustering approach was applied to the spi index to generate homogenous sub regions based on their drought characteristics the spi 1 is strongly connected to soil moisture on short time intervals whereas the spi 3 is related to groundwater and reservoir storage on longer time scales the spi 6 can be used to monitor hydrological agricultural droughts whereas the spi 12 can be used to monitor hydrological droughts there are several clustering algorithms to select from and there is no one optimum clustering method for all circumstances however the k means clustering technique is widely utilized in hydrology research for a variety of objectives including 1 hydrologic catchment categorization for information transfer or forecasting the ungauged basin sawicz et al 2011 sharghi et al 2018 2 risk assessment for floods matheswaran et al 2018 xu et al 2018 3 regionalization of drought goyal and sharma 2016 santos et al 2011 when using the k means clustering algorithm there are two ways of evaluating the results the silhouette method si and the square of sum errors sse fig 6 in the si a number near 1 is usually desirable but in the sse it s always beneficial to check for sudden shifts in the graph often known as the knee effect the figure depicts these two requirements for each of the spi series for example in the spi 1 the sse is maximum when the cluster number is 3 and then there is a rapid change in si when the cluster number is 3 it is worth noting that the number of clusters for each spi series may not be the same when the cluster number reaches three the area can be divided into three homogenous sub regions of comparable drought characteristics the drought features of spi 1 3 6 and 12 for each sub region are shown in fig 7 and listed in table 2 the sensitivity of the spi readings at different periods varies significantly the smaller the time scale the more evident the wet and dry variations are for the short term the spi 1 and spi 3 divided the region into three sub regions meanwhile for the long term the spi 12 six homogeneous sub areas were categorized drought features and their temporal evolution varied substantially among sub regions at different times scales of the spi series for example in the spi 1 according to drought characteristics in table 2 the drier sub regions of b had the highest frequency of drought f 73 the wetter sub region of a and c had the lowest frequency of drought f 62 and 66 respectively in the case of the spi 12 the western part of sabah revealed three more different sub regions according to the short and long term spi statistics the western portions of sabah had the most severe drought from 1989 to 2017 the influence of the el nino southern oscillation enso phenomenon on rainfall in the west coast of sabah contributed significantly to the declining spi trend according to research by wen and sidik 2011 another explanation for the wetter east coast of sabah is that the north east monsoon blows from november to april bringing significant precipitation with it meanwhile sarawak consists of more evenly distributed homogeneous regions the consistency in the clustering of the spi stations on various scales has indicated that the effect of water scarcity has a similar trend in the short and long term run furthermore the disparity in clustering areas is becoming increasingly visible on the longer spi scale while the western part of the state experiences more drought the eastern part of the state is affected by drought for a prolonged period 3 3 analysis of continuous wavelet transform the growing threat of drought necessitates an accurate analysis of the long term meteorological data for better water management by utilizing a wavelet transform a better representation of the drought spatiotemporal variation can be obtained the results obtained from the cwt is presented and discussed in this section figs 8 and 9 show the scalograms of the stations spi time data by looking at the high intensity area of the scalogram and visualizing its magnitude the periodicity may be recognized the dark blue zone represents a negative spi index while the dark red region represents a positive spi index according to the cwt analysis both states have a similar periodicity especially on the short term scale figs 8 9 the shorter dominating periodicity 12 months occurred in the spi 1 and spi3 for all sub regions the spi 6 and spi 12 on the other hand showed longer periodicity 12 months the higher the frequency fluctuation of the cycle the shorter the periodicity drought frequency rose in the study region as the environment became drier for all sub regions in the spi 1 and spi 3 the cwt shows significant periodicities of drought variations in a range of 12 months 3 4 sub regional drought characteristics and their temporal evolution in addition to determining the most common periodicity in the series cwt was used to assess the temporal variability of the short and long term drought cycles in this study the spi 12 was used to examine both the short and long terms table 3 summarises the results obtained from the analysis of the cwt for short and long term drought periodicity in the early and later years of the study period a short drought periodicity of 2 3 years was observed in spi12e as shown in fig 8 a shift from a long drought period to a short drought periodicity was seen at an approximately periodicity level of 5 5 years the transition zone occurred between the years 2006 to 2007 in the case of spi12d a short term periodicity was seen to shift from 3 5 to 2 years in 2004 in the middle of the decade the long term drought cycle with a 5 5 year periodicity came to an end as seen in the picture the short term drought cycle affected nearly the whole research period according to the clustering this region was the most vulnerable to drought occurrences drought periods are comparable in both the spi12c and spi12b series in sabah s central region from the beginning of the study period the year 1989 until 2017 there were two prevailing periodicity structures 5 5 and 2 5 years there was no discernible drought cycle between the early and late periods the long term periodicity at the end of the study period was around 4 5 years the northern area as indicated in table 3 was the least affected by the drought drought intensity would be affected by changes in dominating periodicities in the cwt through time the dominant periodicity of the spi series of sabah stations varied between 2 5 and 5 5 years droughts were less prevalent in all sub regions towards the middle of the study period owing to an increase in the long term drought dominant periodicity at spi12e a slight decrease in the short term drought cycle which implies that the occurrence of drought has risen considerably meanwhile a continuous short term drought cycle at spi12d would suggest that short term droughts are more prevalent than at spi12e spi12a s structure provides essential information regarding sabah s east area the lesser variance there is in the periodicity the easier it is to forecast what will happen the analysis of the sarawak trend was relatively simpler than that of sabah due to the lower number of clusters the two homogeneous sub regions were dominated by a short term drought at a periodicity level of 1 2 years and 2 3 years respectively the cwt analysis has also revealed a long term drought cycle in the western region the presence of multiple drought cycles may have led to the rise in the drought incidence as indicated in table 3 3 5 turning point analysis using sqmk to verify the above result an sqmk test was performed on the spi series by observing the crossover of the two series the turning point in the spi series may be seen the results of the sqmk test for the spi series detected the change in the trend of the spi series fig 10 depicts the progressive and retrograde series u t and u t as well as their intersection the sqmk test identified no notable turning point in the spi series of sarawak s two homogeneous sub regions since the progressive and retrograde sequential series u t and u t were moving in the same direction in the spi series of sabah s homogenous sub regions however several turning points have been identified in spi 12a there was a downward tendency at the beginning in the year 1989 with a turning point coming towards the end of the year 1993 the progressive and retrograde sequential series u t and u t were observed traveling in the same direction after the turning point a shift from a declining to a rising trend at the beginning of the period might indicate that the long term trend is robust and long lasting in comparison to the cwt the sequential mk test detected several turning points throughout the study period in spi 12b 12c and 12d there was another transition that occurred at the end of the study period around the year 2006 the recent increase in the spi series implies that the present trend is less likely to continue both u t and u t values for the spi12e stayed roughly parallel suggesting no discernible trend 3 6 wavelet coherence with climatic indices the wavelet coherence was employed in this work to assess the relationship between the spi series and the climatic indices the intensity of the colour bar determines the connection between them just as the wavelet spectrum the brightness of the colour bar defines the link between them much as a wavelet spectrum with a value of zero dark blue denotes no dependency in the series and strong dependence light yellow if the value is one the arrows in the wavelet coherence plot represent the relative phasing of two series that is they are physically related if the phase lag is consistent or slowly varying if the arrows point to the right the two series are in phase if the arrows point to the left the two series are anti phase besides an upward downward arrow shows that the spi series lags leads the climatic indices by 90 figs 11 and 12 depict time localized regions of high coherence that occur during the corresponding climate indicators for a shorter periodicity of less than one year not only do the strong coherence occur irregularly from year to year but it also does not occur in the same way for any of the sub regions furthermore wavelet coherence can reveal the relationship between the dominating periodicity derived from the cwt analysis and climatic variables among the three climatic indices the pdo showed no significant power on the dominant periodicities in spi12a in sarawak it would imply that the pdo had less of an impact on the long term spi index fluctuations in all sub regions throughout the study period in terms of the two dominant periodicities the dmi exhibited strong anti phase coherence with the spi series whereas the soi and the spi exhibited strong in phase coherence one of the commonalities between sabah and sarawak is that the phase lag of these climate indices was comparable in contrast to sarawak where the pdo has the minimum influence on dominant periodicity sabah has a significant anti phase coherence between the pdo and the spi in general the drought periodicities in sabah and sarawak have a strong association with the climatic indices table 4 summarizes the relationship between spi and climatic indices 4 conclusions this study evaluated the spatial and temporal evolutions of droughts in sabah and sarawak state using several analytical methods with data from a statistical test known as the mk test was used to determine the trend reflected at the rainfall stations the spi time series one of the most widely used indices to track drought was utilized to monitor the drought variation and regularity the mk test indicates that the negative trend was most prominent in the eastern region at the early years of the study period by the end of the study period the number of spi stations with a negative mk value had increased indicating a persistent dry spell besides the clustering algorithm has shown that the long term spi 12 can be categorized into five homogeneous sub regions with similar drought characteristics based on results tabulated in table 1 spi 12d and spi 12e experienced the highest severity of drought occurrence compared to other regions to detect the presence of a dominating periodicity a cwt analysis was used the cwt scalogram reveals that each spi series contained a distinct or a few periodicities and the transition between cycles if they exist the most common short term periodicity was 2 4 3 years whereas the most common long term periodicity was 5 5 6 years the transition zone observed in the cwt corresponds to the results of the sequential mk test the cwt analysis also revealed that three locations had a similar turning point in the drought cycle interestingly sarawak is likewise experiencing a rise in the negative trend across the state with the central area being the most affected sarawak s variance of drought cycles seemed less intricate than that of sabah evidenced by the lowest number of clusters according to the clustering data the western area has a higher incidence of drought than its eastern counterpart although for a shorter period in terms of periodicity sarawak s drought pattern was characterized by shorter term drought cycles lasting 1 2 years and 2 3 years the wavelet coherence was used to assess the relationships between the spi series and several climate indices results have reflected that the presence of the dominant periodicities is associated with not only one but several climatic indices furthermore strong coherence between the spi and climate indicators was seen intermittently from year to year for shorter periodicities of less than one year due to the varying sensitivity of drought indices to precipitation and temperature a drought evaluation method based on various indices may result in differing perspectives on future drought features as a result to produce a comprehensive drought assessment the synthesis of several drought indices may be investigated to provide a more accurate representation of the onset and progression of the drought furthermore the spi index should be utilized with caution in sabah and sarawak owing to rising temperatures a future study on drought assessment should be conducted using the spei index when the temperature rises become evident 2 c 30 years last but not least additional orthogonal wavelets such as the paul and mexican wavelets could be used more extensively to utilize the different features of the precipitation series credit authorship contribution statement k l chong conceptualization methodology formal analysis software writing original draft writing

3732,an increasing number of canals are designed with liners to decrease canal seepage as the lining material and cracks or holes were previously considered equivalent porous media few studies have quantified the effects of lining parameters on canal seepage and the relationships between the reduction factor β of the lining and the crack width df and hole density hd are not explicit leading to large errors in the estimation of seepage loss a three dimensional numerical model is employed to simulate seepage loss from canals lined with concrete and geomembrane material in a total of 1159 scenarios focusing on the crack locations saturated hydraulic conductivity k s of concrete material and geomembrane material k sc and k sg respectively thickness t c concrete lining df and geomembrane lining hd for canals lined with concrete df is the main factor affecting canal seepage followed by k sc and t c cracks with widths smaller than 0 02 mm have minimal influence on β where β is reduced by a decrease in k sc or an increase in t c when df ranges from 0 02 to 0 2 mm β increases gradually to a maximum value while the impacts of k sc and t c weaken for canals lined with geomembranes β increases slightly with hd from 0 to 4 2 10 5 increases nearly linearly with log hd from 4 2 10 5 to 8 4 10 3 and then approaches 1 0 β is weakly influenced by k sg for particular hd values when k sg is smaller than 10 11 m s increases rapidly with k sg from 1 10 11 to 1 10 8 m s and then exceeds 0 938 for a canal lined with both concrete and a geomembrane the trends in β with changes in df and hd are identical to those of a canal with a single lining based on these results the damage degree is proposed to evaluate the influence of cracks and holes on the lining effectiveness and as an intermediate variable for calculating β from df and hd three empirical equations are proposed to calculate the β value of the concrete lining geomembrane lining and combined lining with different df and hd the results show that the proposed equation improves the accuracy of the estimation of β compared with the multiplication model and can be further used for calculations of seepage loss from lined canals keywords canal seepage canal lining numerical simulation damage lining seepage reduction factor of lining 1 introduction due to increasing demand for irrigation caused by competition among water use sectors population growth environmental concerns and consequences of climate change barkhordari et al 2020 it has been a major challenge for many irrigation districts worldwide to ensure sustainable use of water abd el baki et al 2018 agricultural irrigation consumes the largest proportion of water resources in some countries and water loss from canals is the main component of water loss during water conveyance in irrigation areas which accounts for more than 15 50 of the total water amount utilized for irrigation in some regions van der leeden et al 1990 wang et al 2002 therefore lining canals with materials exhibiting low permeability e g geomembrane liners bitumen stone rock brick and concrete is one of the major approaches used to reduce seepage loss from canals burt et al 2010 merkley 2007 moghazi and ismail 1997 wilkinson 2008 concrete and geomembrane are currently two popular materials used as canal linings soomro et al 2018 zhang 2013 the main factors affecting canal seepage include soil hydraulic properties length and shape of the wetted perimeter canal bottom depth to the groundwater table lining material damage characteristics lining service time and the presence of other constraints such as wells drains and impermeable soils alam and bhutta 2004 kinzli et al 2010 swamee et al 2000 yao et al 2012 for canals lined with concrete and geomembrane linings canal seepage is greatly influenced by damage to the canal lining especially by cracks in the concrete or holes in the geomembrane since only a negligible amount of water is lost through intact concrete and geomembranes giroud et al 1992 han et al 2020 holmes et al 1981 reginato and myers 1966 by comparing the seepage loss from a canal before and after installing the lining it was found that canal seepage loss was greatly reduced by newly installed canal linings akkuzu et al 2007 eshetu and alamirew 2018 jadhav et al 2014 snell 2001 zhang et al 2017 however significant seepage loss from lined canals occurs after deterioration of the lining especially with poor maintenance barkhordari et al 2020 ghazaw 2011 kilic and tuylu 2011 and the concrete liner gradually loses its efficacy as cracks expand merkley 2007 swamee and chahar 2015 holmes et al showed that the seepage losses measured by ponding tests from unlined canals and lined canals were 0 13 and 0 12 m d respectively due to the presence of many cracks and joints filled with silt holmes et al 1981 wachyan and rushton 1987 plusquellec 2019 found that canal linings with a small percentage of cracks and or open joints had a seepage rate of 70 for the same unlined canal han et al 2020 showed that the seepage loss from a canal lined with concrete and a geomembrane lining increased by 128 due to the development of cracks and holes 3 years after constructing the lining this increase accounted for 32 of the seepage loss from an earthen canal under the same conditions for geomembrane linings eshetu and alamirew 2018 showed that damage to the geomembrane lining limited the seepage loss to only 32 according to the results of the inflow outflow measurements it was also found that only 11 of canal seepage was reduced by a geomembrane lining when the hole density hd i e hole area divided by geomembrane area was 4 2 10 4 han et al 2020 these results showed that seepage losses from the lined canal increased when there were cracks in the concrete lining or holes in the geomembrane lining han et al 2020 merkley 2007 rowe et al 2003 wachyan and rushton 1987 therefore the effects of cracks and holes should be considered in estimations of seepage loss from a lined canal the seepage from lined canals is mainly estimated by numerical simulations e g mirnateghi and bruch 1983 wachyan and rushton 1987 rastogi and prasad 1992 phogat et al 2009 and empirical formulas e g akkuzu 2012 shah et al 2020 salmasi and abraham 2020 numerical simulations can accurately show the spatial and temporal seepage development under various boundary conditions yao et al 2012 however because the relationship between the equivalent k s value of the lining and the lining damage is not explicit there may be large errors in the estimation of seepage from lined canals when the lining damage and lining material are considered one layer of porous media wachyan and rushton 1987 rastogi and prasad 1992 to avoid this deficiency a fully coupled numerical model coupling continuous porous media discrete cracks and thin geomembranes that can be used to simulate the seepage process through concrete with cracks and geomembranes with holes and cracks was established by han et al 2021 however because the fully coupled numerical model requires many iterations to solve the 3d richards equation it is difficult and time consuming to capture large scale canal seepage the empirical formula method is a simple and convenient way to estimate canal seepage zhang et al 2017 and includes the davis wilson equation moritz equation ingham equation molesworth equation kostiakov model etc guo 1997 kraatz 1977 among the empirical formulas the lining effect on seepage loss is represented by the reduction factor β in the kostiakov equation guo 1997 and a similar parameter c in the davis wilson equation kraatz 1977 salmasi and abraham 2020 the parameters are used to estimate the seepage loss from lined canals by multiplication with the seepage rate of earthen canals kraatz 1977 salmasi and abraham 2020 since the influence of lining damage such as that from cracks and holes is not considered in β or c which were mainly determined by the lining material and thickness guo 1997 kraatz 1977 the empirical formulas produce relatively large errors in the estimation of seepage loss from a lined canal by disregarding the variation in lining effect akkuzu 2012 shah et al 2020 akkuzu 2012 showed a large difference between the seepage loss calculated for a concrete lined canal by the moritz and davis wilson equations and that tested by inflow outflow methods shah et al 2020 showed that the mean percent errors for the swamee punmia moritz and kostiakov formulas are 20 19 53 and 158 respectively when they are used to estimate the seepage loss from canals lined with concrete consequently it is vital to study the influence of lining parameters especially the damage parameters e g crack width df and hd on lining permeability to improve the accuracies of the empirical formulas leigh 2014 found that the davis wilson equation provided poor results after predicting seepage rates for local lining conditions and aimed to improve the accuracy by ranking linings into 5 classes with different c values this approach showed reasonable improvement however due to the lack of quantitative relationships between the lining effect and damage parameters it still requires a sufficient theoretical basis and higher accuracy therefore it is necessary to study the effects of canal damage characteristics on canal seepage and to provide a simple and accurate method to estimate the seepage from a lined canal some useful contributions to understanding the influence of cracks on the permeability of concrete and holes on the permeability of geomembranes have been provided by researchers many studies have shown that the permeability of concrete dramatically increases as cracks develop aldea et al 1999a aldea et al 1999b wang et al 1997 yi et al 2011 based on permeability tests of concrete with cracks and the use of a feedback controlled splitting test method it was shown that cracks with widths smaller than 50 μm had minimal effects on the permeability of concrete and concrete permeability increased rapidly with increasing df in the range of 50 200 μm aldea et al 1999a wang et al 1997 yi et al 2011 according to experimental results the flow through a crack is mainly influenced by the geometric characteristics of the crack including df tortuosity and roughness li et al 2019 among which df is recognized as the dominant factor aldea et al 1999a reinhardt and jooss 2003 flows through cracks in concrete follow the cubic law meaning that discharge through the crack per unit length is proportional to df cubed louis 1969 qian et al 2012 snow 1968 witherspoon et al 1980 and this relationship has been widely utilized in numerical simulation studies of concrete permeability with discrete cracks liu et al 2016 long et al 1982 qian et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 however there have been few studies relating the flows through cracked concrete porous media and geomembrane linings and analysing the relationship between the cracking degree and the effects of concrete linings seepage through a geomembrane lining is influenced by the number and size of holes permeability of the geomembrane material permeability of soil in contact with the geomembrane and transmissivity at the interface between the geomembrane and adjacent soil which is generally qualitatively described as the contact condition of the geomembrane and adjacent soil giroud et al 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989a rowe 2012 rowe et al 2017 based on experimental results and analytical derivations the rate of seepage through a hole in a geomembrane lining is a power function of the hole area and the power value ranges from 0 05 to 1 0 according to different contact conditions and k s values for the underlying soil giroud et al 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989a 1989b giroud and touze foltz 2005 rowe 1998 touze foltz and giroud 2003 the contact condition and wrinkles have a substantial influence on the seepage rate giroud and bonaparte 1989a rowe and brachman 2004 and it may take 2 20 times the error in the calculation from the numerical and experimental results cartaud et al 2005 giroud and bonaparte 1989b giroud and touze foltz 2005 for seepage through geomembranes with many holes saidi et al 2008 used numerical simulations and concluded that the total seepage rate was not obviously reduced by the interaction between two adjacent square holes in a geomembrane even without wrinkles current studies provide a valuable reference for determining the effectiveness of geomembrane linings however as geomembranes generally have many holes and the boundary conditions and underlying soil characteristics are different they are not suitable for direct estimation of canal seepage moreover the relationship between the lining effectiveness and damage characteristics is not explicit numerical simulations of the influence of lining damage on canal seepage and the effect of the canal lining based on further investigation of the effects of canal damage on canal seepage are presented in this paper concrete and geomembranes were selected as representative lining materials subsequently numerical studies of various lining factors that influence canal seepage loss such as the k s of concrete material k sc df crack location thickness of the concrete lining t c k s of the geomembrane material k sg and hd were performed to comprehensively understand their effect on canal seepage based on the results of these studies three empirical equations were established to calculate β and damage degree d from the df and hd values of the concrete lining and geomembrane lining respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description a fully coupled three dimensional model that combines continuous porous media discrete cracks and thin geomembranes was generated calibrated and validated in our previous work han et al 2021 and it was employed herein to simulate different seepage processes in concrete with cracks and geomembranes with holes the main assumption of the coupled model was that the concrete lining was divided into uncracked domains i e concrete slabs and crack domains and the geomembrane lining was divided into geomembrane material and holes fig 1 the area of the concrete lining domain was divided into porous media and areas with cracks water flow in porous media was described by the richards equation richards 1931 and flows in the areas with cracks were described by the richards equation and cubic law li et al 2018 the three dimensional richards equation was used to simulate the water movement in porous media fu et al 2019 wang and ueda 2011 1 c h t x k h h x y k h h y z k h h z 1 s where c is the soil water capacity l 1 h is the soil water potential or pressure head l t is time t x is the horizontal coordinate perpendicular to the canal l y is the coordinate along the canal l z is the vertical coordinate for which the positive direction is upward l k h is the soil hydraulic conductivity as a function of the pressure head lt 1 and s is the source sink term which means that the water moves from the soil and concrete to the cracks in this study t 1 the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 was utilized to calculate the soil water retention curve and unsaturated water conductivity function as shown in the appendix a the soil parameter values used in this study are shown in table 1 the parameters of the concrete were determined according to the results obtained in the literature li et al 2017 yao et al 2012 and were assumed to be equivalent to those of a soil layer with similar permeability the zero thickness element was selected for the discretization and modelling of water flow in cracks for simplicity the crack domain was treated as an ideal porous medium with a porosity of 1 0 in this paper therefore the richards equation was also adopted to simulate water flow in cracks which is similar to the approach employed in previous studies li et al 2018 roels et al 2003 wang et al 2016 the water flow through cracks is described by eq 2 2 d f c f h t t d f k f h t h z q u p q d o w n where df is the crack width l cf is the crack water capacity l 1 h is the matrix potential or pressure head in the crack l t l 1 denotes the gradient operator that restricts the tangential plane of the crack kf is the permeability coefficient of the crack lt 1 and qup and qdown are the upper surface flux and lower surface flux respectively from the crack to the soil or concrete lt 1 the cubic law long et al 1982 witherspoon et al 1980 which has been shown to be effective for cracks with widths in the range of 0 001 mm 10 mm lomize 1951 louis 1969 was adopted to calculate the kf for each crack in the concrete lining as follows li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 1996 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 3 k f d f 2 γ 12 μ ξ k r h where γ is the unit weight of water ml 2t 2 μ is the dynamic viscosity of water mt 1l 1 and ξ is the empirical factor that accounts for the reduction in permeability due to the toughness and tortuosity of the crack which is 1 0 since the cracks are relatively shallow flat and smooth since a geomembrane lining has a small thickness and low k s the simulation of water flow through geomembranes requires a large number of calculations and many singular elements render mesh pretreatment difficult neuman 1973 zhan et al 2009 to address this issue the zero thickness element was also applied herein to simulate the geomembrane which was simulated as two flux boundaries for the two subdomains divided by the geomembrane han et al 2021 which are calculated as follows 4 n u u u k g h d h u d g 5 n d u d k g h u h d d g where n is the external vector normal to the boundary u is the water flow velocity vector lt 1 k g is the permeability coefficient of the geomembrane lt 1 hu and hd are the water heads at the upper and lower boundary respectively of the geomembrane l and d g is the thickness of the geomembrane l in this paper holes were used to represent damage in the geomembrane lining and were treated as the contact surface of the upper and lower soil layers of the geomembrane and the water head loss at the holes was disregarded detailed implementation of the aforementioned formulas was performed with the software comsol multiphysics comsol 2015 which can be found in previous work han et al 2021 the simulation outputs included the volumetric water flux and its cumulative infiltration ci across the canal surface 2 2 scenario descriptions based on the representative lining materials selected the following scenarios were established to evaluate the effects of possible damage types on canal seepage the selected scenarios include three common lining conditions in which the lining material was concrete only set 1 a geomembrane lining only set 2 and the combination of a concrete lining and a geomembrane lining set 3 when a canal is lined with only concrete as in set 1 the influencing factors of canal seepage include the crack location df k sc and t c first to evaluate the effects of crack location and df for the concrete on canal seepage 39 scenarios that combined 3 concrete crack locations and 13 values of df were chosen as group 1 in set 1 the 3 concrete crack locations are the sides of the canal cs the bottom of the canal cb and both the sides and bottom of the canal csb as shown in fig 2 b there were 4 types of joints s1 s2 d1 and d2 defined by their locations in the canal d1 represents joints running parallel to the direction of the canal between the side and bottom of the canal d2 represents joints on the bottom of the canal s1 represents joints parallel to the direction of the canal on the sides of the canal and s2 represents joints perpendicular to the direction of the canal on the sides of the canal cs and cb indicate that joints were cracked only in s1 and s2 or only in d1 and d2 respectively csb means that all 4 types of joints s1 s2 d1 and d2 were cracked the 13 df values were 0 0001 0 001 0 002 0 005 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 5 mm fig 3 in these 39 scenarios k sc was set to 1 08 10 8 m s measured based on darcy s law li et al 2016 and t c was 6 cm second 78 scenarios that combined 6 values of k sc and 13 values of df were selected as group 2 to evaluate the effect of k sc and df on canal seepage in this group joints at all locations were assumed to be cracked based on the measured k sc the 6 values of k sc were set to 1 0 10 12 1 0 10 11 1 0 10 10 1 0 10 9 1 08 10 8 and 1 0 10 7 m s denoted as k sc1 k sc6 t c and the 13 values of df were the same as those in group 1 of set 1 third to study the effects of t c and df 78 scenarios combining 6 values of t c and 13 values of df were selected as group 3 the 6 values of t c were set to 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 cm denoted as t c1 t c6 the 13 values of df were the same as those in group 1 and group 2 of set 1 since the scenarios in which k sc was 1 08 10 8 m s and t c was 6 cm were identical in group 2 and group 3 there were a total of 169 scenarios in set 1 the main factors associated with a canal lined with only a geomembrane lining as in set 2 are hd i e total hole area divided by the geomembrane area under the canal water surface and k sg to evaluate the effect of hd and k sg on canal seepage 66 scenarios combining 11 values of hd and 6 values of k sg values were selected for set 2 as shown in fig 3 since the k sg value was in the range of 1 0 10 9 1 0 10 13 m s akbar 2005 cartaud et al 2005 giroud and bonaparte 1989b the 6 values of k sg were set to 1 0 10 13 1 0 10 12 1 0 10 11 1 0 10 10 1 0 10 9 and 1 0 10 8 m s the 11 values of hd were set to 0 0 001 0 01 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 5 10 and 20 times the measured observation of 4 2 10 4 fig 3 when a canal was lined with both concrete and a geomembrane lining as in set 3 the main factors for canal seepage were the cracks in the concrete lining k sc hd in the geomembrane and k sg therefore 2 groups of scenarios were selected in set 3 in the first group k sc was set to 1 08 10 8 m s a total of 528 scenarios combining 4 values of k sg 12 values of df and 11 values of hd were selected to investigate the influences of df hd and k sg on canal seepage through the combined lining the 4 values of k sg were set to 1 0 10 13 1 0 10 11 1 0 10 10 and 1 0 10 9 m s the 12 df values were 0 001 0 001 0 002 0 005 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 5 mm fig 3 in addition the 11 values of hd were equivalent to those in set 2 second 528 scenarios combining 4 values of k sc 12 values of df and 11 values of hd were selected to investigate the influences of df hd and k sg on canal seepage through the combined lining k sg was constant at 1 0 10 10 m s and the 4 values of k sc were set to 1 0 10 7 1 08 10 8 1 0 10 10 and 1 0 10 12 m s the 12 values of df and 11 values of hd were equivalent to those used in group 1 of set 3 since the 132 scenarios in which k sg was set to 1 0 10 10 m s and k sc was 1 08 10 8 m s were accounted for in group 1 and group 2 of set 3 there were only 7 combinations of k sc and k sg denoted as cg1 cg7 which meant there was a total of 924 scenarios in set 3 therefore 1159 scenarios were established and simulated to study the effect of canal damage characteristics on canal seepage 2 3 boundary and initial conditions in all scenarios the boundary and initial conditions were set according to the actual conditions of a canal based on the field experiment han et al 2021 han et al 2020 the initial condition was input as the pressure head according to the measured soil water content and groundwater table depth the canal surface under the water level was treated as a constant water head boundary 0 3 m and the zones above the water surface were taken as a no flux boundary b1 in fig 2 the ground surface was set as the top boundary of the domain area b2 in fig 2 which is taken as a no flux boundary the bottom boundary of the domain area b3 in fig 2 was set as a no flux boundary located 4 m below the ground surface the horizontal research area had a total length of 50 m perpendicular to the canal because the area influenced by canal seepage was limited hosseinzadeh asl et al 2020 due to the assumption that flow is symmetric along the canal only half of the domain area was simulated and the vertical boundaries parallel to the canal were taken as no flux boundaries b4 and b5 in fig 2 the length width and thickness of the precast concrete slabs of the concrete lining were 0 6 0 4 and 0 06 m the joints between the precast concrete slabs were filled with cement mortar where cracks occurred each crack was assumed to have the same width and depth therefore only a 1 2 m section along the direction of the canal was selected as the domain based on the symmetry of the concrete slab arrangement fig 2 and the front and back surfaces of the canal b6 and b7 in fig 2 in the y direction were set as no flux boundaries the boundary conditions for the simulations were the following yao et al 2012 6 h z n 0 x z b 2 b 3 b 4 b 5 b 6 b 7 0 t t m 7 h z 0 h w x z b 1 0 t t m where n is the direction normal to the boundary tm is the simulation duration t z0 is the vertical coordinate of the canal surface l and hw is the water level in the canal l 2 4 reduction factor in this paper the β of the canal lining guo 1997 kraatz 1977 was employed to represent the seepage control effect of the lining and it was calculated as in eq 8 a smaller value of β indicates that the lining has better seepage control and less seepage loss from the lined canal the lining is nearly ineffective when its β value is close to 1 0 8 β s l s s where sl is the cumulative infiltration ci per unit length of the canal with the lining m3 m and ss is the ci per unit length of the canal without lining m3 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 results for a canal lined only with concrete 3 1 1 variations in reduction factor the variations in β of the concrete lining β c with df for different crack locations k sc values and t c values are shown in fig 4 the β c data were subjected to two factor analysis of variance anova without replication with a significance level of p less than 0 05 and statistically significant differences were assessed using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd test wu et al 2018 the calculated p values for each influencing factor are shown in table 2 the p value of df was smaller than those of the other factors in each group which shows that df exerts the greatest influence on β c according to the order of p values the second most influential factor was k sc followed by crack location and t c it should be noted that the p value for t c was 0 156 which is larger than 0 05 and means that t c was not a significant factor as shown in fig 4 the trends for the variation of β c with df were similar when df was within 0 01 mm β c was very small and not influenced by df while β c rapidly increased with increases in df from 0 01 to 0 2 mm the simulated results showed agreement with the experimental results of previous studies aldea et al 1999a wang et al 1997 yi et al 2011 which demonstrated that cracks with widths smaller than 0 05 mm had minimal effect on the permeability of concrete and concrete permeability increased rapidly with increasing df in the range of 0 05 0 2 mm the high β c values for the concrete lining with df larger than 0 2 mm were near 1 0 which meant that the overall concrete lining had almost lost its ability to control seepage this finding explains why there were no differences between seepage losses from lined canals and those from unlined canals with the expansion of cracks on the canal surface merkley 2007 swamee and chahar 2015 as shown in fig 4 for different crack locations β c for csb was the highest followed by those for cb and cs this is because the seepage rates through cracks in the canal bottom were greater than those for cracks in the canal sides the value for scon and the seepage rates for cracks in s1 s2 d1 and d2 when all joints are cracked for a typical scenario are plotted in fig 5 the crack seepage rate for d1 was the highest followed by those for d2 s1 and s2 with the same widths and lengths the seepage loss from a crack on the bottom of the canal was greater than those from cracks on the sides of the canal for the same df possibly because the pressure head on the bottom of the canal was greater than those on the canal sides and the canal bank with a relatively small k s was relatively thick 1 5 m which restricted horizontal water movement yao et al 2012 generally β c increased with k sc because an increase in k sc improved the permeability of the concrete lining which accounted for the permeability of the concrete material and cracks as k sc increased the difference in β c between different values of df with the same k sc gradually decreased fig 6 a as shown in fig 6 b β c varied slightly with t c for different df values although the influence of t c on canal seepage can be divided into 2 stages according to the df value when df was less than 0 1 mm β c decreased with increases in t c and when df was larger than 0 1 mm β c increased with increasing t c the domain area can be simplified into two equivalent porous media the concrete lining and the soil layers with increasing df the permeability of the concrete lining becomes larger than the k s of the soil which causes the lined canal to exhibit a higher seepage rate than the earthen canal and the β c values at t c5 and t c6 are more than 1 0 in table 3 therefore β c increased with an increase in t c with a large df in contrast if the permeability of the concrete lining was smaller than k s of the soil β c decreased with increasing t c the results shown in fig 4 reveal that the maximum β c without cracks was 0 075 when k sc was smaller than 1 08 10 8 m s which meant that at least 92 5 of the seepage loss was reduced by a concrete lining without cracks which is similar to the experimental results in the literature jadhav et al 2014 as k sc increased from 1 0 10 12 to 1 0 10 7 m s the maximum βc increased from 0 863 to 0 943 and as t c increased from 3 to 18 cm the maximum βc increased from 0 879 to 1 083 this shows that once all the joints of the concrete lining were cracked with df values larger than 2 mm only approximately 14 of the seepage loss was reduced by the concrete lining even though it had a smaller k sc and larger t c because water penetrated directly into deeper soil along cracks protecting concrete from cracks is a useful and important measurement for effectively retaining the lining merkley 2007 swamee and chahar 2015 with each order of magnitude increase in k sc the minimum βc increased by at least 2 6 times this result shows that for uncracked concrete linings it is also important to maintain a low value of k sc by preventing the concrete lining from experiencing wet dry or freeze thaw cycles wang et al 2020 yin et al 2019 although canal seepage loss and structural damage can be reduced by increasing t c li et al 2013 only with t c values ranging from 3 to 6 cm did βc decrease from 0 078 to 0 075 and βc remained in the range of 0 066 0 075 with t c in the range of 6 18 cm fig 4 3 1 2 variation in seepage rate through cracks and concrete the total seepage rate for the concrete lining s all consisted of the total seepage rate through the cracks s cr and the total seepage rate through the concrete slabs s con fig 1 b the variations in s cr s con and s cr s all with df for different crack locations k sc values and t c values are shown in fig 7 with increasing df the logarithm of s cr generally linearly increased with the logarithm of df at first and then remained stable at the maximum fig 7 a d and g as shown in fig 7 b e and h with df values smaller than 0 02 mm scon remained at a large value and then decreased with df ranging from 0 02 to 0 1 mm then scon remained stable at a smaller value with df greater than 0 1 mm s cr s all was very small and close to zero and then increased with df and reached more than 95 when df exceeded 0 1 mm fig 7 c f and i with df in the range of 0 0 01 mm s cr was substantially smaller than s con therefore the influence of cracks on canal seepage was negligible s con varied little with changes in df and s cr s all was very small and close to zero since s con accounted for most of s all βc varied greatly with k sc fig 6 a because k sc has a significant influence on s con fig 7 e for example when the values of df were 0 0001 0 001 and 0 01 mm the values of β c when k sc was 1 0 10 12 were 0 002 0 006 and 0 336 times those of β c with a 1 08 10 8 m s k sc respectively as df ranged from 0 01 to 0 2 mm s cr increased rapidly and became greater than s con and s cr gradually reached its maximum and accounted for most of s all moreover s con decreased with df because water migrated through the cracks and then continued to flow laterally in the sand below the concrete with a hydraulic gradient which decreased the hydraulic gradient between the top and bottom surfaces of the concrete when df exceeded 0 2 mm since scr accounted for at least 99 of sall which showed that the cracks provided sufficient channels for water infiltration β c varied little with k sc and t c as shown in fig 6 hence k sc and t c were not influential factors for canal seepage through a cracked concrete lining 3 2 results for a canal lined only with a geomembrane variations in β for the geomembrane lining β g with varying hd for six values of k sg are plotted in fig 8 given that k sg was generally in the range of 1 0 10 13 1 0 10 10 m s andersen and nelson 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989a jiang et al 2010 β g without holes showed agreement with experimental results zhao 1997 which revealed that canal seepage loss could be reduced by more than 95 with hd ranging from 0 to 4 2 10 5 β g increased relatively constantly within this range of hd and with different k sg values however there was an obvious increase in the absolute value of β g for example the values of β g with hd of 4 2 10 5 were 15 9 12 52 and 4 57 times that of β g without holes when k sg was 1 10 13 1 10 12 and 1 10 11 m s respectively this result is similar to those of rowe et al 2017 which showed that as the hole diameter increased from 1 5 to 10 mm the steady seepage rate through geomembranes increased by more than 1000 times however the absolute flows were negligible 0 2 compared with the case without a geomembrane with hd ranging from 4 2 10 5 to 8 4 10 3 the corresponding β g rapidly increased from 0 129 to 1 which shows that the geomembrane lining gradually becomes ineffective as holes provided sufficient channels for water infiltration through the geomembrane lining when k sg was less than 1 0 10 11 m s β g at different hd varied little with k sg fig 8 a when k sg was larger than 1 0 10 11 m s the values of β g increased nearly linearly with increasing k sg when k sg was 1 0 10 8 m s the values of β g for all hd were greater than 0 925 which showed that the geomembrane was almost ineffective the simulated total seepage rate through the holes s hole and the seepage rate through the geomembrane s geo fig 1 b are shown in fig 9 a and fig 9 b respectively s hole generally increased linearly with the logarithm of hd while s geo decreased slightly linearly with hd ranging from 0 2 1 10 4 fig 9 a and then decreased rapidly with increasing hd for different k sg values fig 9 b because the hole area was relatively small with hd values less than 4 2 10 5 the variations in s geo were not significant and the increase in s hole led to increases in s hole s all fig 9 c and β g by comparison β g was more obviously influenced by hd for smaller values of k sg which led to a smaller s geo and water mainly passed through the holes in the geomembrane lining because s geo increased slightly with k sg ranging from 1 0 10 13 to 1 0 10 11 m s β g at different hd values varied little with k sg in this range as k sg continued to increase large infiltration was produced by high k sg despite a smaller or larger number of holes in the geomembrane which shows that the influence of hd gradually decreased 3 3 results for canals with a combined lining of concrete and geomembrane 3 3 1 variations in reduction factor with df and hd variations in β for the combined concrete and geomembrane lining βcg with df for different hd values are shown in fig 10 the trend for variations in βcg with df for different values of hd was identical to the results for the canal lined only with concrete βcg changed minimally when df was less than 0 02 mm or greater than 0 2 mm and increased greatly with df from 0 02 to 0 2 mm both the increase in βcg with df values ranging from 0 02 to 0 2 mm and the maximum βcg when df exceeded 0 2 mm increased with hd as shown in fig 11 the trend for the variation of βcg with hd for all scenarios was equivalent to the results obtained for the canal lined only with geomembrane as shown in fig 8 a when df exceeded 0 02 mm βcg increased slightly with the logarithm of hd when it was less than 1 0 10 4 and increased approximately linearly with the logarithm of hd until the geomembrane became ineffective a large increase in βcg with hd occurred with a large df when df was less than 0 02 mm hd had a minimal influence on βcg because df dominated the infiltration 3 3 2 variation in the reduction factor with k sc and k sg as shown in fig 12 βcg generally increases with k sc for different values of df and hd the same trend for the variation of βcg with k sc plotted in fig 12 a d shows that the variation of βcg with k sc was seldom influenced by hd βcg varied little as k sc increased from 1 0 10 12 to 1 0 10 10 m s since the absolute value of s con rarely changed there was an obvious increase in βcg with k sc ranging from 1 0 10 10 to 1 08 10 8 m s when k sc was larger than 1 08 10 8 m s the variation in βcg with k sc was influenced by df the seepage through the concrete lining consisted of the seepage rate through both cracks and concrete which was mainly determined by df and k sc respectively when df reached more than 0 05 mm as more water passed through cracks in the concrete lining βcg varied slightly as k sc ranged from 1 08 10 8 to 1 0 10 7 m s and there was a significant increase in βcg with k sc when df values were less than 0 05 mm as shown in fig 13 there was no obvious difference in the trend for βcg variation with k sg because seepage was dominated by the concrete lining when df was less than 0 02 mm for all values of hd βcg was weakly influenced by k sg with increasing df larger than 0 02 mm more seepage infiltrated through the concrete lining and the influence of the geomembrane began to appear fig 13 e g β cg at different hd values varied little with k sg ranging from 1 0 10 13 to 1 0 10 11 m s because s geo varied little in this range as k sg continued to increase there was an obvious increase in β cg especially with smaller hd values when hd was larger than 2 1 10 3 β cg varied little with k sg because holes provide sufficient channels for water to pass through the geomembrane lining 3 4 relationship between the reduction factor β and damage parameters df and hd most studies have considered only the influence of the lining material and its thickness on β but the damage parameters exert significant impacts on β that cannot be ignored as shown in the present study since it is difficult to obtain accurate β values for the different damage conditions of canal linings to improve the accuracy in estimating seepage loss from lined canals three simple formulas used to calculate β were developed by fitting the simulations with the following formula according to variations in β the coefficient of determination r2 relative mean absolute error rmae root mean squared error rmse and mean error me were used to quantitatively evaluate the differences between fitted and observed values the formulas for the four statistical indices are shown in appendix b a normalized index named the relative damage degree of the lining d was defined as an intermediate variable to establish the quantitative relationship of β with df and hd as follows 9 d β β min β max β min where β min and β max are the values for β without damage and the maximum value of β caused by an increase in df or hd respectively d 0 indicates that the lining incurred no damage and d 1 indicates that the value for β of the lining reached β max for a concrete or geomembrane lining d is only a function of df or hd respectively once the function was established βc and βg could be obtained from eq 10 and eq 11 respectively 10 β c β c min d c d f β c max β c min where βc min and βc max are βc without cracks and the maximum βc due to an increase in df respectively dc is the damage degree of the concrete lining influenced by df 11 β g β g min d g h d β g max β g min where β g min is β g without holes and β g max is the maximum βg due to an increase in hd dg is the damage degree of the geomembrane lining influenced by hd 3 4 1 damage degree equation for concrete linings as shown in fig 4 the variations in the β c and dc values with df resemble an s curve which is similar to the shape of the logistic sigmoid equation triana et al 2010 zanetti et al 2015 therefore a modified logistic sigmoid equation eq 12 was adopted to establish the relationship between dc and df 12 d c 1 1 exp m log 10 d f log 10 d f mi d where m represents the increase rate of dc with increasing df and dfmid is an empirical parameter mm the results for fitting β c with eqs 10 and 12 are shown in table 3 and fig 14 all r 2 values exceeded 0 996 and the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 028 8 44 and 0 01 respectively which shows that the proposed equation reliably simulated β c for different df values with different crack locations k sc and t c the fitted m was relatively stable and approximately 5 605 because the parameters of the cubic function louis 1969 qian et al 2012 snow 1968 witherspoon et al 1980 used to calculate the seepage loss through each crack were the same for each scenario and the value of m is fixed at 5 605 in the present study according to the minimum total error therefore only the dfmid in eq 12 needs to be determined according to eq 12 dfmid is the value of df at which dc is 0 5 which means β c is equal to βc min βc max 2 as shown in table 3 the dfmid values fitted for csb cs and cb were nearly identical at approximately 0 037 mm demonstrating that dfmid was not influenced by the crack location or number of cracks in the concrete lining additionally dfmid varied with k sc and t c because increases in βc were caused by an increase in scr and the trends with df were the same as shown in fig 4 a and fig 7 a the βc values of csb cs and cb reached their minimum and maximum values at the same df therefore βc also reached βc min βc max 2 at the same df for different k sc and t c values the value of dfmid can be obtained from eq 13 according to eq 12 and the detailed derivation is shown in appendix c 13 log 10 d f mi d a 1 log 10 β c max β c min a 2 where a 1 and a 2 are the empirical parameters as shown in table 3 the m values of each scenario were less than 5 47 except when k sc was 1 0 10 7 m s scenario k sc6 which led to a larger scon therefore only the log10 df mid values for k sc1 k sc5 and t c1 t c6 were fitted with eq 13 as shown in fig 15 a the r 2 value was larger than 0 828 and the rmse rmae and me values were less than 0 03 1 85 and 0 026 respectively this shows that log10 df mid for different k sc and t c can be calculated directly from βc max βc min with eq 13 when k sc is less than 1 0 10 7 m s therefore for given values of k sc and t c which determine βc max and βc min β c and d c values for different df can be directly and reliably obtained with eqs 10 12 and 13 3 4 2 damage degree equation for a geomembrane lining according to the variations of β g and dg with hd plotted in fig 8 a the following formula was developed to calculate dg and β g with eq 11 14 d g 1 exp b h d where b is an empirical parameter representing the rate increase in dg with increasing hd the fitted curves the resulting regression parameter b and the evaluation indices are shown in fig 16 all r 2 values exceeded 0 933 and the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 038 32 and 0 031 respectively the proposed equation enabled reliable calculation of βg when hd was greater than 1 10 4 and the resulting βg values were in the range of 0 2 1 0 the difference between the proposed equation and the simulated results was mainly observed with hd values in the range 0 1 10 4 moreover the difference was more obvious at a smaller k sg which led to a smaller s geo and s hole accounted for a greater portion of s all refer to fig 9 parameter b was determined from the difference between β g max and β g min for canals lined with only a geomembrane lining β g max is 1 0 and β g min is determined by k sg as shown in fig 8 as the k sg value increased the influence of hd gradually decreased which caused an increase in b fig 17 a shows that b exhibited an obviously linear relationship with βg min as expected from eq 15 the intercept of the function was restricted to 0 because when βg was equal to βg min d g should be 0 15 b b β g max β g min where b is the slope 3 4 3 damage degree equation for a combined lining the trend for the variation of β cg with df shown in fig 10 is identical to that of β c with df fig 4 therefore the β cg values for different df values with certain values of k sg k sc and hd can also be fitted with eqs 10 and 12 the comparison of β cg values obtained by numerical simulation and fitting is shown in fig 18 and figs s1 s6 the r 2 values exceeded 0 999 and the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 005 0 91 and 0 001 respectively as shown in fig 15 b i the variation in the logarithm of df mid with a difference of βcg min and βcg max was also well fitted by eq 13 all r 2 values were greater than 0 999 and the rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 005 0 91 and 0 003 respectively therefore for a canal with the combined lining β cg values for different df values can be reliably calculated by the proposed equations with certain βcg min and βcg max which are determined by hd k sc and k sg since the trend for the variation in βcg with hd shown in fig 11 is identical to that in βg with hd fig 8 β cg values for different hd values can also be reliably calculated with eqs 11 and 14 the fitted curves for βcg when k sc and k sg of the canal were 1 0 10 10 and 1 08 10 8 m s respectively are plotted in fig 19 and the results for other combinations of k sc and k sg are plotted in figs s7 s12 in fig 19 the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were all less than 0 032 6 491 and 0 026 respectively compared with the results of the canal lined only by a geomembrane βcg was also greatly influenced by the concrete lining as shown in figs 10 and 11 therefore βcg values for a liner without holes are close to βcg with hd in the range of 0 1 10 4 and the proposed equations eq 11 and eq 14 provided better fits with βcg than with βg the b value of the combined lining was also influenced by the difference between βcg min and βcg max fig 17 b h shows that the b in eq 14 which was fitted from the combined lining with different combinations of k sg and k sc also exhibited a linear relationship with the difference between βcg min and βcg max considering the influence of k sc and k sg a reasonable b value in eq 15 for the combined lining is 841 379 as shown in fig 20 and the above analysis βcg for a given combination of df and hd can be obtained from the intermediate variables of βcg at points o 1 and r 1 with eq 11 and eq 14 as with the case of a geomembrane lining therefore a new approach for calculating βcg with a given combination of df and hd is as follows 16 β cg h d d f β cg r 1 d g h d d f β cg o 1 β cg r 1 where d g hd df is the damage degree of the geomembrane in the combined lining βcg o1 and βcg r1 are βcg values with df for the concrete lining and geomembrane lining with no holes and without effectiveness respectively which were calculated according to eqs 18 19 according to eqs 14 15 d g of point t is calculated as 17 d g cg h d d f 1 exp b β cg o 1 β cg r 1 where b is 841 379 or can be obtained more precisely by using k sg and k sc values for the combined lining as shown in fig 17 βcg r 1 and βcg o 1 can be calculated from eqs 18 19 according to eqs 10 and 12 as follows 18 β cg r 1 β cg m d c1 d f β cg q β cg m 19 β cg o 1 β cg n d c2 d f β cg p β cg n where βcg m and βcg n are βcg values with no cracks in the concrete lining and the geomembrane lining without holes and are completely ineffective respectively βcg q and βcg p are βcg values for a concrete lining with the severest damage due to an increase in df and the geomembrane lining without holes and is completely ineffective respectively and d c1 and d c2 are calculated from eqs 20 21 according to eq 12 and eq 13 20 d c1 1 1 exp 5 605 log 10 d f a 1 log 10 β cg q β cg m a 2 21 d c2 1 1 exp 5 605 log 10 d f a 1 log 10 β cg p β cg n a 2 where a 1 and a 2 were determined according to the k sg and k sc values of the combined lining as shown in fig 15 by substituting eqs 17 21 into eq 16 βcg for a particular df and hd was obtained moreover the damage degree of the combined lining was obtained as follows 22 d cg h d d f β cg h d d f β cg m β cg p β cg m 3 5 application and discussion of the proposed equations 3 5 1 application of the proposed equations the data obtained from ponding tests in the literatures holmes et al 1981 wachyan and rushton 1987 were used to test the applicability of the proposed method to calculate the seepage loss for a canal with only a concrete lining the seepage rates obtained for a canal with a newly repaired concrete lining and without a lining were 0 07 m d and 0 13 m d respectively the seepage rate from the damaged canal with many cracks and joints filled with silt was 0 12 m d according to the ponding test the equations eqs 10 12 and 13 obtained for the calculation of β c in this study were used to calculate the seepage rate from the canal under the damage condition with many cracks as follows according to the proposed method in the present study the β c min and β c max of the canal were 0 538 and 1 00 respectively due to the severe damage described by the authors df was assumed to be 0 02 0 2 mm the a 1 and a 2 in fig 15 a were used to calculate log10 d fmid therefore the calculated d c and β c of the canal were 0 774 0 997 and 0 90 1 0 respectively and the seepage rate from the canal was 0 116 0 130 m d this result is very close to the 0 12 m d value obtained from the ponding test holmes et al 1981 wachyan and rushton 1987 however according to the literature ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2018 in which the influence of lining damage on β c was not considered β c was only 0 1 0 15 and the seepage rate from the canal was estimated to be 0 013 0 02 m d which is much less than 0 12 m d the applicability of the equations eqs 11 14 15 proposed for the calculation of β g was tested by considering the results in the literature morrison and starbuck 1984 the seepage rate from a canal without a lining was 152 5 l m2 d in 1966 this canal was lined with a geomembrane and no seepage loss was observed two cracks approximately 76 2 mm in length 11 cracks approximately 25 4 mm in length and 4 holes were observed in the 0 743 m2 sample of this geomembrane after 13 5 years the average width of the cracks in the geomembrane and the diameter of the pinholes were assumed to be 0 1 and 0 5 mm respectively the calculated value of hd was 5 92 10 5 the seepage from the lined canal after 5 years was calculated as follows β g min and β g max were 0 0 and 1 0 respectively because the seepage rate from the newly lined canal was very small k sg was assumed to be in the range of 1 0 10 13 1 0 10 11 m s and parameter b in eq 14 was determined to be 1200 if hd was assumed to change linearly with time after constructing the lining the hd was 2 19 10 5 at 5 years after the lining was applied therefore the calculated d g and β g of the canal were both 0 026 and the seepage rate from the canal was 3 958 l m2 d this result is very close to the value of 3 1 l m2 d measured by morrison and starbuck 1984 furthermore the β cg results calculated by the proposed equations eqs 16 to 21 were compared with those obtained from the multiplicative model which has been widely utilized for estimations of canal seepage in most previous studies e g guo 1997 liu et al 2018 xue et al 2020 fig 21 compares the β cg values calculated for 7 combined lining conditions with the β cg values obtained with the multiplicative model and the proposed model eqs 16 21 the results of the proposed model agree well with those of the numerical model which are close to the 1 1 line in each figure however there were larger differences between the 1 1 line and β cg calculated by the multiplicative model as shown in table 4 all statistical indices for the proposed model were better than those of the multiplication model all r 2 values for the proposed model exceeded 0 973 and the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 04 13 6 and 0 030 respectively the seepage rates from the newly built combined lining comprising concrete and a geomembrane and those at 3 years after constructing the lining were 55 34 and 216 l m d respectively however the rate of both of them was 3 62 l m d when calculated by the multiplication model the deviation of the multiplication model was mainly caused by inadequately considering of the effects of the damage parameters as shown in figs 10 and 11 β cg changed very minimally with h d when d f was less than 0 02 mm this result indicates that β cg depended mainly on the lining with a smaller β when either β c or β g was too small and not influenced by the other lining although β c or β g alone also decreased the seepage from the earthen canal when canal seepage was dominated by a particular parameter the influence of other parameters on canal seepage was negotiable han et al 2021 therefore the multiplicative model inevitably encounters errors in the calculation 3 5 2 discussion the seepage loss from the lined canal was greatly influenced by the lining effect reflected by β in this study disregarding the influence of the lining effect produces large errors in the estimation of the seepage loss from lined canals akkuzu 2012 leigh 2014 shah et al 2020 studies quantitatively describing the relationship between the damage degree of the lining and β are lacking in this study the main influencing factors on β and the variation in β with the main parameters were obtained by studying the effects of canal damage characteristics on canal seepage more importantly the influences of cracks in concrete and holes in the geomembrane on the lining damage degree and β were quantified and d and β can be calculated by the proposed empirical equations in addition to calculate the β for the combined lining a more accurate method than the original multiplicative model is proposed because β can be directly used in the kostiakov equation davis wilson equation and moritz equation guo 1997 kraatz 1977 shah et al 2020 to calculate the seepage rate from a lined canal this is of great importance to improve the seepage loss estimation accuracy for a lined canal by empirical formulas the established equations provide a convenient and practical method for capturing seepage loss from lined canals under different lining and damage conditions in irrigation districts due to the complexity of the three dimensional numerical model the df was assumed to have the same value at all locations on the concrete lining it is convenient to estimate the seepage from the lined canals in practical although it is not consistent with the real cracks in the lining concrete it should also be noted that βc max in the proposed equations is determined only by df tc and ksc but the impact of crack number was not considered these impact factors should be considered in future studies 4 conclusions in this study the effects of damage parameters i e df and hd and material parameters such as k sg k sc and t c on the reduction factor for the canal lining were quantitatively investigated by a three dimensional coupled numerical model three empirical equations were developed to calculate β for the concrete lining geomembrane lining and combined lining under different damage conditions the primary conclusions are as follows concrete and geomembrane linings without damage exhibit good seepage control and k sc and or k sg are the factors determining β under this condition as hd or df increases β gradually depends more on hd or df while the influences of k sc t c and k sg decrease until they are negligible β varies slightly with df with values less than 0 02 mm while it increases sharply with df ranging from 0 02 to 0 2 mm and then gradually approaches a maximum at 2 mm β varies little with k sg when it is less than 1 0 10 11 m s and it is close to 1 0 when k sg is greater than 1 0 10 8 m s β varies slightly with hd when it is less than 4 2 10 5 and then increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of hd until β reaches its maximum value the proposed equations based on the logistic sigmoid function and exponential function reliably quantify the relative damage degree of the lining calculate βc from the df for different crack locations t c and k sc and calculate βg from hd for different k sg scenarios the new method to calculate the β of the combined lining can greatly improve the accuracy compared with

represents the serial number of the results n represents the total number of the results mi and oi are the predicted and observed values respectively and m mean and o mean are the means of the predicted and observed values respectively appendix c according to eq 12 when df is dfmid d c is equal to 0 5 and β c is equal to βc min βc max 2 therefore based on the definition of β c for different k sc and t c values the value of dfmid can be obtained from eq c1 c1 s cr d f d f mi d s con d f d f mi d s s a l l β c max β c min 2 where scr df dfmid and scon df dfmid are the total seepage rates from the cracks and concrete material respectively when df is dfmid ss all is the total seepage rate from the canal without lining and βc min is equal to the ratio of the seepage loss from the concrete lining without cracks scon df 0 to ss all therefore eq c1 can be transformed as follow c2 s cr d f d f mi d 0 5 β c max β c min s s a l l s con d f 0 s con d f d f mi d since scon changed slightly with df fig 7 b e and h it accounted for a very small portion of sall fig 7 c f and g that was even smaller than ss all therefore only when the m defined in eq c3 is very small can eq c2 be

3732,an increasing number of canals are designed with liners to decrease canal seepage as the lining material and cracks or holes were previously considered equivalent porous media few studies have quantified the effects of lining parameters on canal seepage and the relationships between the reduction factor β of the lining and the crack width df and hole density hd are not explicit leading to large errors in the estimation of seepage loss a three dimensional numerical model is employed to simulate seepage loss from canals lined with concrete and geomembrane material in a total of 1159 scenarios focusing on the crack locations saturated hydraulic conductivity k s of concrete material and geomembrane material k sc and k sg respectively thickness t c concrete lining df and geomembrane lining hd for canals lined with concrete df is the main factor affecting canal seepage followed by k sc and t c cracks with widths smaller than 0 02 mm have minimal influence on β where β is reduced by a decrease in k sc or an increase in t c when df ranges from 0 02 to 0 2 mm β increases gradually to a maximum value while the impacts of k sc and t c weaken for canals lined with geomembranes β increases slightly with hd from 0 to 4 2 10 5 increases nearly linearly with log hd from 4 2 10 5 to 8 4 10 3 and then approaches 1 0 β is weakly influenced by k sg for particular hd values when k sg is smaller than 10 11 m s increases rapidly with k sg from 1 10 11 to 1 10 8 m s and then exceeds 0 938 for a canal lined with both concrete and a geomembrane the trends in β with changes in df and hd are identical to those of a canal with a single lining based on these results the damage degree is proposed to evaluate the influence of cracks and holes on the lining effectiveness and as an intermediate variable for calculating β from df and hd three empirical equations are proposed to calculate the β value of the concrete lining geomembrane lining and combined lining with different df and hd the results show that the proposed equation improves the accuracy of the estimation of β compared with the multiplication model and can be further used for calculations of seepage loss from lined canals keywords canal seepage canal lining numerical simulation damage lining seepage reduction factor of lining 1 introduction due to increasing demand for irrigation caused by competition among water use sectors population growth environmental concerns and consequences of climate change barkhordari et al 2020 it has been a major challenge for many irrigation districts worldwide to ensure sustainable use of water abd el baki et al 2018 agricultural irrigation consumes the largest proportion of water resources in some countries and water loss from canals is the main component of water loss during water conveyance in irrigation areas which accounts for more than 15 50 of the total water amount utilized for irrigation in some regions van der leeden et al 1990 wang et al 2002 therefore lining canals with materials exhibiting low permeability e g geomembrane liners bitumen stone rock brick and concrete is one of the major approaches used to reduce seepage loss from canals burt et al 2010 merkley 2007 moghazi and ismail 1997 wilkinson 2008 concrete and geomembrane are currently two popular materials used as canal linings soomro et al 2018 zhang 2013 the main factors affecting canal seepage include soil hydraulic properties length and shape of the wetted perimeter canal bottom depth to the groundwater table lining material damage characteristics lining service time and the presence of other constraints such as wells drains and impermeable soils alam and bhutta 2004 kinzli et al 2010 swamee et al 2000 yao et al 2012 for canals lined with concrete and geomembrane linings canal seepage is greatly influenced by damage to the canal lining especially by cracks in the concrete or holes in the geomembrane since only a negligible amount of water is lost through intact concrete and geomembranes giroud et al 1992 han et al 2020 holmes et al 1981 reginato and myers 1966 by comparing the seepage loss from a canal before and after installing the lining it was found that canal seepage loss was greatly reduced by newly installed canal linings akkuzu et al 2007 eshetu and alamirew 2018 jadhav et al 2014 snell 2001 zhang et al 2017 however significant seepage loss from lined canals occurs after deterioration of the lining especially with poor maintenance barkhordari et al 2020 ghazaw 2011 kilic and tuylu 2011 and the concrete liner gradually loses its efficacy as cracks expand merkley 2007 swamee and chahar 2015 holmes et al showed that the seepage losses measured by ponding tests from unlined canals and lined canals were 0 13 and 0 12 m d respectively due to the presence of many cracks and joints filled with silt holmes et al 1981 wachyan and rushton 1987 plusquellec 2019 found that canal linings with a small percentage of cracks and or open joints had a seepage rate of 70 for the same unlined canal han et al 2020 showed that the seepage loss from a canal lined with concrete and a geomembrane lining increased by 128 due to the development of cracks and holes 3 years after constructing the lining this increase accounted for 32 of the seepage loss from an earthen canal under the same conditions for geomembrane linings eshetu and alamirew 2018 showed that damage to the geomembrane lining limited the seepage loss to only 32 according to the results of the inflow outflow measurements it was also found that only 11 of canal seepage was reduced by a geomembrane lining when the hole density hd i e hole area divided by geomembrane area was 4 2 10 4 han et al 2020 these results showed that seepage losses from the lined canal increased when there were cracks in the concrete lining or holes in the geomembrane lining han et al 2020 merkley 2007 rowe et al 2003 wachyan and rushton 1987 therefore the effects of cracks and holes should be considered in estimations of seepage loss from a lined canal the seepage from lined canals is mainly estimated by numerical simulations e g mirnateghi and bruch 1983 wachyan and rushton 1987 rastogi and prasad 1992 phogat et al 2009 and empirical formulas e g akkuzu 2012 shah et al 2020 salmasi and abraham 2020 numerical simulations can accurately show the spatial and temporal seepage development under various boundary conditions yao et al 2012 however because the relationship between the equivalent k s value of the lining and the lining damage is not explicit there may be large errors in the estimation of seepage from lined canals when the lining damage and lining material are considered one layer of porous media wachyan and rushton 1987 rastogi and prasad 1992 to avoid this deficiency a fully coupled numerical model coupling continuous porous media discrete cracks and thin geomembranes that can be used to simulate the seepage process through concrete with cracks and geomembranes with holes and cracks was established by han et al 2021 however because the fully coupled numerical model requires many iterations to solve the 3d richards equation it is difficult and time consuming to capture large scale canal seepage the empirical formula method is a simple and convenient way to estimate canal seepage zhang et al 2017 and includes the davis wilson equation moritz equation ingham equation molesworth equation kostiakov model etc guo 1997 kraatz 1977 among the empirical formulas the lining effect on seepage loss is represented by the reduction factor β in the kostiakov equation guo 1997 and a similar parameter c in the davis wilson equation kraatz 1977 salmasi and abraham 2020 the parameters are used to estimate the seepage loss from lined canals by multiplication with the seepage rate of earthen canals kraatz 1977 salmasi and abraham 2020 since the influence of lining damage such as that from cracks and holes is not considered in β or c which were mainly determined by the lining material and thickness guo 1997 kraatz 1977 the empirical formulas produce relatively large errors in the estimation of seepage loss from a lined canal by disregarding the variation in lining effect akkuzu 2012 shah et al 2020 akkuzu 2012 showed a large difference between the seepage loss calculated for a concrete lined canal by the moritz and davis wilson equations and that tested by inflow outflow methods shah et al 2020 showed that the mean percent errors for the swamee punmia moritz and kostiakov formulas are 20 19 53 and 158 respectively when they are used to estimate the seepage loss from canals lined with concrete consequently it is vital to study the influence of lining parameters especially the damage parameters e g crack width df and hd on lining permeability to improve the accuracies of the empirical formulas leigh 2014 found that the davis wilson equation provided poor results after predicting seepage rates for local lining conditions and aimed to improve the accuracy by ranking linings into 5 classes with different c values this approach showed reasonable improvement however due to the lack of quantitative relationships between the lining effect and damage parameters it still requires a sufficient theoretical basis and higher accuracy therefore it is necessary to study the effects of canal damage characteristics on canal seepage and to provide a simple and accurate method to estimate the seepage from a lined canal some useful contributions to understanding the influence of cracks on the permeability of concrete and holes on the permeability of geomembranes have been provided by researchers many studies have shown that the permeability of concrete dramatically increases as cracks develop aldea et al 1999a aldea et al 1999b wang et al 1997 yi et al 2011 based on permeability tests of concrete with cracks and the use of a feedback controlled splitting test method it was shown that cracks with widths smaller than 50 μm had minimal effects on the permeability of concrete and concrete permeability increased rapidly with increasing df in the range of 50 200 μm aldea et al 1999a wang et al 1997 yi et al 2011 according to experimental results the flow through a crack is mainly influenced by the geometric characteristics of the crack including df tortuosity and roughness li et al 2019 among which df is recognized as the dominant factor aldea et al 1999a reinhardt and jooss 2003 flows through cracks in concrete follow the cubic law meaning that discharge through the crack per unit length is proportional to df cubed louis 1969 qian et al 2012 snow 1968 witherspoon et al 1980 and this relationship has been widely utilized in numerical simulation studies of concrete permeability with discrete cracks liu et al 2016 long et al 1982 qian et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 however there have been few studies relating the flows through cracked concrete porous media and geomembrane linings and analysing the relationship between the cracking degree and the effects of concrete linings seepage through a geomembrane lining is influenced by the number and size of holes permeability of the geomembrane material permeability of soil in contact with the geomembrane and transmissivity at the interface between the geomembrane and adjacent soil which is generally qualitatively described as the contact condition of the geomembrane and adjacent soil giroud et al 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989a rowe 2012 rowe et al 2017 based on experimental results and analytical derivations the rate of seepage through a hole in a geomembrane lining is a power function of the hole area and the power value ranges from 0 05 to 1 0 according to different contact conditions and k s values for the underlying soil giroud et al 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989a 1989b giroud and touze foltz 2005 rowe 1998 touze foltz and giroud 2003 the contact condition and wrinkles have a substantial influence on the seepage rate giroud and bonaparte 1989a rowe and brachman 2004 and it may take 2 20 times the error in the calculation from the numerical and experimental results cartaud et al 2005 giroud and bonaparte 1989b giroud and touze foltz 2005 for seepage through geomembranes with many holes saidi et al 2008 used numerical simulations and concluded that the total seepage rate was not obviously reduced by the interaction between two adjacent square holes in a geomembrane even without wrinkles current studies provide a valuable reference for determining the effectiveness of geomembrane linings however as geomembranes generally have many holes and the boundary conditions and underlying soil characteristics are different they are not suitable for direct estimation of canal seepage moreover the relationship between the lining effectiveness and damage characteristics is not explicit numerical simulations of the influence of lining damage on canal seepage and the effect of the canal lining based on further investigation of the effects of canal damage on canal seepage are presented in this paper concrete and geomembranes were selected as representative lining materials subsequently numerical studies of various lining factors that influence canal seepage loss such as the k s of concrete material k sc df crack location thickness of the concrete lining t c k s of the geomembrane material k sg and hd were performed to comprehensively understand their effect on canal seepage based on the results of these studies three empirical equations were established to calculate β and damage degree d from the df and hd values of the concrete lining and geomembrane lining respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description a fully coupled three dimensional model that combines continuous porous media discrete cracks and thin geomembranes was generated calibrated and validated in our previous work han et al 2021 and it was employed herein to simulate different seepage processes in concrete with cracks and geomembranes with holes the main assumption of the coupled model was that the concrete lining was divided into uncracked domains i e concrete slabs and crack domains and the geomembrane lining was divided into geomembrane material and holes fig 1 the area of the concrete lining domain was divided into porous media and areas with cracks water flow in porous media was described by the richards equation richards 1931 and flows in the areas with cracks were described by the richards equation and cubic law li et al 2018 the three dimensional richards equation was used to simulate the water movement in porous media fu et al 2019 wang and ueda 2011 1 c h t x k h h x y k h h y z k h h z 1 s where c is the soil water capacity l 1 h is the soil water potential or pressure head l t is time t x is the horizontal coordinate perpendicular to the canal l y is the coordinate along the canal l z is the vertical coordinate for which the positive direction is upward l k h is the soil hydraulic conductivity as a function of the pressure head lt 1 and s is the source sink term which means that the water moves from the soil and concrete to the cracks in this study t 1 the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 was utilized to calculate the soil water retention curve and unsaturated water conductivity function as shown in the appendix a the soil parameter values used in this study are shown in table 1 the parameters of the concrete were determined according to the results obtained in the literature li et al 2017 yao et al 2012 and were assumed to be equivalent to those of a soil layer with similar permeability the zero thickness element was selected for the discretization and modelling of water flow in cracks for simplicity the crack domain was treated as an ideal porous medium with a porosity of 1 0 in this paper therefore the richards equation was also adopted to simulate water flow in cracks which is similar to the approach employed in previous studies li et al 2018 roels et al 2003 wang et al 2016 the water flow through cracks is described by eq 2 2 d f c f h t t d f k f h t h z q

tangential plane of the crack kf is the permeability coefficient of the crack lt 1 and qup and qdown are the upper surface flux and lower surface flux respectively from the crack to the soil or concrete lt 1 the cubic law long et al 1982 witherspoon et al 1980 which has been shown to be effective for cracks with widths in the range of 0 001 mm 10 mm lomize 1951 louis 1969 was adopted to calculate the kf for each crack in the concrete lining as follows li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 1996 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 3 k f d f 2 γ 12 μ ξ k r h where γ is the unit weight of water ml 2t 2 μ is the dynamic viscosity of water mt 1l 1 and ξ is the empirical factor that accounts for the reduction in permeability due to the toughness and tortuosity of the crack which is 1 0 since the cracks are relatively shallow flat and smooth since a geomembrane lining has a small thickness and low k s the simulation of water flow through geomembranes requires a large number of calculations and many singular elements render mesh pretreatment difficult neuman 1973 zhan et al 2009 to address this issue the zero thickness element was also applied herein to simulate the geomembrane which was simulated as two flux boundaries for the two subdomains divided by the geomembrane han et al 2021 which are calculated as follows 4 n u u u k g h d h u d g 5 n d u d k g h u h d d g where n is the external vector normal to the boundary u is the water flow velocity vector lt 1 k g is the permeability coefficient of the geomembrane lt 1 hu and hd are the water heads at the upper and lower boundary respectively of the geomembrane l and d g is the thickness of the geomembrane l in this paper holes were used to represent damage in the geomembrane lining and were treated as the contact surface of the upper and lower soil layers of the geomembrane and the water head loss at the holes was disregarded detailed implementation of the aforementioned formulas was performed with the software comsol multiphysics comsol 2015 which can be found in previous work han et al 2021 the simulation outputs included the volumetric water flux and its cumulative infiltration ci across the canal surface 2 2 scenario descriptions based on the representative lining materials selected the following scenarios were established to evaluate the effects of possible damage types on canal seepage the selected scenarios include three common lining conditions in which the lining material was concrete only set 1 a geomembrane lining only set 2 and the combination of a concrete lining and a geomembrane lining set 3 when a canal is lined with only concrete as in set 1 the influencing factors of canal seepage include the crack location df k sc and t c first to evaluate the effects of crack location and df for the concrete on canal seepage 39 scenarios that combined 3 concrete crack locations and 13 values of df were chosen as group 1 in set 1 the 3 concrete crack locations are the sides of the canal cs the bottom of the canal cb and both the sides and bottom of the canal csb as shown in fig 2 b there were 4 types of joints s1 s2 d1 and d2 defined by their locations in the canal d1 represents joints running parallel to the direction of the canal between the side and bottom of the canal d2 represents joints on the bottom of the canal s1 represents joints parallel to the direction of the canal on the sides of the canal and s2 represents joints perpendicular to the direction of the canal on the sides of the canal cs and cb indicate that joints were cracked only in s1 and s2 or only in d1 and d2 respectively csb means that all 4 types of joints s1 s2 d1 and d2 were cracked the 13 df values were 0 0001 0 001 0 002 0 005 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 5 mm fig 3 in these 39 scenarios k sc was set to 1 08 10 8 m s measured based on darcy s law li et al 2016 and t c was 6 cm second 78 scenarios that combined 6 values of k sc and 13 values of df were selected as group 2 to evaluate the effect of k sc and df on canal seepage in this group joints at all locations were assumed to be cracked based on the measured k sc the 6 values of k sc were set to 1 0 10 12 1 0 10 11 1 0 10 10 1 0 10 9 1 08 10 8 and 1 0 10 7 m s denoted as k sc1 k sc6 t c and the 13 values of df were the same as those in group 1 of set 1 third to study the effects of t c and df 78 scenarios combining 6 values of t c and 13 values of df were selected as group 3 the 6 values of t c were set to 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 cm denoted as t c1 t c6 the 13 values of df were the same as those in group 1 and group 2 of set 1 since the scenarios in which k sc was 1 08 10 8 m s and t c was 6 cm were identical in group 2 and group 3 there were a total of 169 scenarios in set 1 the main factors associated with a canal lined with only a geomembrane lining as in set 2 are hd i e total hole area divided by the geomembrane area under the canal water surface and k sg to evaluate the effect of hd and k sg on canal seepage 66 scenarios combining 11 values of hd and 6 values of k sg values were selected for set 2 as shown in fig 3 since the k sg value was in the range of 1 0 10 9 1 0 10 13 m s akbar 2005 cartaud et al 2005 giroud and bonaparte 1989b the 6 values of k sg were set to 1 0 10 13 1 0 10 12 1 0 10 11 1 0 10 10 1 0 10 9 and 1 0 10 8 m s the 11 values of hd were set to 0 0 001 0 01 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 5 10 and 20 times the measured observation of 4 2 10 4 fig 3 when a canal was lined with both concrete and a geomembrane lining as in set 3 the main factors for canal seepage were the cracks in the concrete lining k sc hd in the geomembrane and k sg therefore 2 groups of scenarios were selected in set 3 in the first group k sc was set to 1 08 10 8 m s a total of 528 scenarios combining 4 values of k sg 12 values of df and 11 values of hd were selected to investigate the influences of df hd and k sg on canal seepage through the combined lining the 4 values of k sg were set to 1 0 10 13 1 0 10 11 1 0 10 10 and 1 0 10 9 m s the 12 df values were 0 001 0 001 0 002 0 005 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 5 mm fig 3 in addition the 11 values of hd were equivalent to those in set 2 second 528 scenarios combining 4 values of k sc 12 values of df and 11 values of hd were selected to investigate the influences of df hd and k sg on canal seepage through the combined lining k sg was constant at 1 0 10 10 m s and the 4 values of k sc were set to 1 0 10 7 1 08 10 8 1 0 10 10 and 1 0 10 12 m s the 12 values of df and 11 values of hd were equivalent to those used in group 1 of set 3 since the 132 scenarios in which k sg was set to 1 0 10 10 m s and k sc was 1 08 10 8 m s were accounted for in group 1 and group 2 of set 3 there were only 7 combinations of k sc and k sg denoted as cg1 cg7 which meant there was a total of 924 scenarios in set 3 therefore 1159 scenarios were established and simulated to study the effect of canal damage characteristics on canal seepage 2 3 boundary and initial conditions in all scenarios the boundary and initial conditions were set according to the actual conditions of a canal based on the field experiment han et al 2021 han et al 2020 the initial condition was input as the pressure head according to the measured soil water content and groundwater table depth the canal surface under the water level was treated as a constant water head boundary 0 3 m and the zones above the water surface were taken as a no flux boundary b1 in fig 2 the ground surface was set as the top boundary of the domain area b2 in fig 2 which is taken as a no flux boundary the bottom boundary of the domain area b3 in fig 2 was set as a no flux boundary located 4 m below the ground surface the horizontal research area had a total length of 50 m perpendicular to the canal because the area influenced by canal seepage was limited hosseinzadeh asl et al 2020 due to the assumption that flow is symmetric along the canal only half of the domain area was simulated and the vertical boundaries parallel to the canal were taken as no flux boundaries b4 and b5 in fig 2 the length width and thickness of the precast concrete slabs of the concrete lining were 0 6 0 4 and 0 06 m the joints between the precast concrete slabs were filled with cement mortar where cracks occurred each crack was assumed to have the same width and depth therefore only a 1 2 m section along the direction of the canal was selected as the domain based on the symmetry of the concrete slab arrangement fig 2 and the front and back surfaces of the canal b6 and b7 in fig 2 in the y direction were set as no flux boundaries the boundary conditions for the simulations were the following yao et al 2012 6 h z n 0 x z b 2 b 3 b 4 b 5 b 6 b 7 0 t t m 7 h z 0 h w x z b 1 0 t t m where n is the direction normal to the boundary tm is the simulation duration t z0 is the vertical coordinate of the canal surface l and hw is the water level in the canal l 2 4 reduction factor in this paper the β of the canal lining guo 1997 kraatz 1977 was employed to represent the seepage control effect of the lining and it was calculated as in eq 8 a smaller value of β indicates that the lining has better seepage control and less seepage loss from the lined canal the lining is nearly ineffective when its β value is close to 1 0 8 β s l s s where sl is the cumulative infiltration ci per unit length of the canal with the lining m3 m and ss is the ci per unit length of the canal without lining m3 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 results for a canal lined only with concrete 3 1 1 variations in reduction factor the variations in β of the concrete lining β c with df for different crack locations k sc values and t c values are shown in fig 4 the β c data were subjected to two factor analysis of variance anova without replication with a significance level of p less than 0 05 and statistically significant differences were assessed using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd test wu et al 2018 the calculated p values for each influencing factor are shown in table 2 the p value of df was smaller than those of the other factors in each group which shows that df exerts the greatest influence on β c according to the order of p values the second most influential factor was k sc followed by crack location and t c it should be noted that the p value for t c was 0 156 which is larger than 0 05 and means that t c was not a significant factor as shown in fig 4 the trends for the variation of β c with df were similar when df was within 0 01 mm β c was very small and not influenced by df while β c rapidly increased with increases in df from 0 01 to 0 2 mm the simulated results showed agreement with the experimental results of previous studies aldea et al 1999a wang et al 1997 yi et al 2011 which demonstrated that cracks with widths smaller than 0 05 mm had minimal effect on the permeability of concrete and concrete permeability increased rapidly with increasing df in the range of 0 05 0 2 mm the high β c values for the concrete lining with df larger than 0 2 mm were near 1 0 which meant that the overall concrete lining had almost lost its ability to control seepage this finding explains why there were no differences between seepage losses from lined canals and those from unlined canals with the expansion of cracks on the canal surface merkley 2007 swamee and chahar 2015 as shown in fig 4 for different crack locations β c for csb was the highest followed by those for cb and cs this is because the seepage rates through cracks in the canal bottom were greater than those for cracks in the canal sides the value for scon and the seepage rates for cracks in s1 s2 d1 and d2 when all joints are cracked for a typical scenario are plotted in fig 5 the crack seepage rate for d1 was the highest followed by those for d2 s1 and s2 with the same widths and lengths the seepage loss from a crack on the bottom of the canal was greater than those from cracks on the sides of the canal for the same df possibly because the pressure head on the bottom of the canal was greater than those on the canal sides and the canal bank with a relatively small k s was relatively thick 1 5 m which restricted horizontal water movement yao et al 2012 generally β c increased with k sc because an increase in k sc improved the permeability of the concrete lining which accounted for the permeability of the concrete material and cracks as k sc increased the difference in β c between different values of df with the same k sc gradually decreased fig 6 a as shown in fig 6 b β c varied slightly with t c for different df values although the influence of t c on canal seepage can be divided into 2 stages according to the df value when df was less than 0 1 mm β c decreased with increases in t c and when df was larger than 0 1 mm β c increased with increasing t c the domain area can be simplified into two equivalent porous media the concrete lining and the soil layers with increasing df the permeability of the concrete lining becomes larger than the k s of the soil which causes the lined canal to exhibit a higher seepage rate than the earthen canal and the β c values at t c5 and t c6 are more than 1 0 in table 3 therefore β c increased with an increase in t c with a large df in contrast if the permeability of the concrete lining was smaller than k s of the soil β c decreased with increasing t c the results shown in fig 4 reveal that the maximum β c without cracks was 0 075 when k sc was smaller than 1 08 10 8 m s which meant that at least 92 5 of the seepage loss was reduced by a concrete lining without cracks which is similar to the experimental results in the literature jadhav et al 2014 as k sc increased from 1 0 10 12 to 1 0 10 7 m s the maximum βc increased from 0 863 to 0 943 and as t c increased from 3 to 18 cm the maximum βc increased from 0 879 to 1 083 this shows that once all the joints of the concrete lining were cracked with df values larger than 2 mm only approximately 14 of the seepage loss was reduced by the concrete lining even though it had a smaller k sc and larger t c because water penetrated directly into deeper soil along cracks protecting concrete from cracks is a useful and important measurement for effectively retaining the lining merkley 2007 swamee and chahar 2015 with each order of magnitude increase in k sc the minimum βc increased by at least 2 6 times this result shows that for uncracked concrete linings it is also important to maintain a low value of k sc by preventing the concrete lining from experiencing wet dry or freeze thaw cycles wang et al 2020 yin et al 2019 although canal seepage loss and structural damage can be reduced by increasing t c li et al 2013 only with t c values ranging from 3 to 6 cm did βc decrease from 0 078 to 0 075 and βc remained in the range of 0 066 0 075 with t c in the range of 6 18 cm fig 4 3 1 2 variation in seepage rate through cracks and concrete the total seepage rate for the concrete lining s all consisted of the total seepage rate through the cracks s cr and the total seepage rate through the concrete slabs s con fig 1 b the variations in s cr s con and s cr s all with df for different crack locations k sc values and t c values are shown in fig 7 with increasing df the logarithm of s cr generally linearly increased with the logarithm of df at first and then remained stable at the maximum fig 7 a d and g as shown in fig 7 b e and h with df values smaller than 0 02 mm scon remained at a large value and then decreased with df ranging from 0 02 to 0 1 mm then scon remained stable at a smaller value with df greater than 0 1 mm s cr s all was very small and close to zero and then increased with df and reached more than 95 when df exceeded 0 1 mm fig 7 c f and i with df in the range of 0 0 01 mm s cr was substantially smaller than s con therefore the influence of cracks on canal seepage was negligible s con varied little with changes in df and s cr s all was very small and close to zero since s con accounted for most of s all βc varied greatly with k sc fig 6 a because k sc has a significant influence on s con fig 7 e for example when the values of df were 0 0001 0 001 and 0 01 mm the values of β c when k sc was 1 0 10 12 were 0 002 0 006 and 0 336 times those of β c with a 1 08 10 8 m s k sc respectively as df ranged from 0 01 to 0 2 mm s cr increased rapidly and became greater than s con and s cr gradually reached its maximum and accounted for most of s all moreover s con decreased with df because water migrated through the cracks and then continued to flow laterally in the sand below the concrete with a hydraulic gradient which decreased the hydraulic gradient between the top and bottom surfaces of the concrete when df exceeded 0 2 mm since scr accounted for at least 99 of sall which showed that the cracks provided sufficient channels for water infiltration β c varied little with k sc and t c as shown in fig 6 hence k sc and t c were not influential factors for canal seepage through a cracked concrete lining 3 2 results for a canal lined only with a geomembrane variations in β for the geomembrane lining β g with varying hd for six values of k sg are plotted in fig 8 given that k sg was generally in the range of 1 0 10 13 1 0 10 10 m s andersen and nelson 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989a jiang et al 2010 β g without holes showed agreement with experimental results zhao 1997 which revealed that canal seepage loss could be reduced by more than 95 with hd ranging from 0 to 4 2 10 5 β g increased relatively constantly within this range of hd and with different k sg values however there was an obvious increase in the absolute value of β g for example the values of β g with hd of 4 2 10 5 were 15 9 12 52 and 4 57 times that of β g without holes when k sg was 1 10 13 1 10 12 and 1 10 11 m s respectively this result is similar to those of rowe et al 2017 which showed that as the hole diameter increased from 1 5 to 10 mm the steady seepage rate through geomembranes increased by more than 1000 times however the absolute flows were negligible 0 2 compared with the case without a geomembrane with hd ranging from 4 2 10 5 to 8 4 10 3 the corresponding β g rapidly increased from 0 129 to 1 which shows that the geomembrane lining gradually becomes ineffective as holes provided sufficient channels for water infiltration through the geomembrane lining when k sg was less than 1 0 10 11 m s β g at different hd varied little with k sg fig 8 a when k sg was larger than 1 0 10 11 m s the values of β g increased nearly linearly with increasing k sg when k sg was 1 0 10 8 m s the values of β g for all hd were greater than 0 925 which showed that the geomembrane was almost ineffective the simulated total seepage rate through the holes s hole and the seepage rate through the geomembrane s geo fig 1 b are shown in fig 9 a and fig 9 b respectively s hole generally increased linearly with the logarithm of hd while s geo decreased slightly linearly with hd ranging from 0 2 1 10 4 fig 9 a and then decreased rapidly with increasing hd for different k sg values fig 9 b because the hole area was relatively small with hd values less than 4 2 10 5 the variations in s geo were not significant and the increase in s hole led to increases in s hole s all fig 9 c and β g by comparison β g was more obviously influenced by hd for smaller values of k sg which led to a smaller s geo and water mainly passed through the holes in the geomembrane lining because s geo increased slightly with k sg ranging from 1 0 10 13 to 1 0 10 11 m s β g at different hd values varied little with k sg in this range as k sg continued to increase large infiltration was produced by high k sg despite a smaller or larger number of holes in the geomembrane which shows that the influence of hd gradually decreased 3 3 results for canals with a combined lining of concrete and geomembrane 3 3 1 variations in reduction factor with df and hd variations in β for the combined concrete and geomembrane lining βcg with df for different hd values are shown in fig 10 the trend for variations in βcg with df for different values of hd was identical to the results for the canal lined only with concrete βcg changed minimally when df was less than 0 02 mm or greater than 0 2 mm and increased greatly with df from 0 02 to 0 2 mm both the increase in βcg with df values ranging from 0 02 to 0 2 mm and the maximum βcg when df exceeded 0 2 mm increased with hd as shown in fig 11 the trend for the variation of βcg with hd for all scenarios was equivalent to the results obtained for the canal lined only with geomembrane as shown in fig 8 a when df exceeded 0 02 mm βcg increased slightly with the logarithm of hd when it was less than 1 0 10 4 and increased approximately linearly with the logarithm of hd until the geomembrane became ineffective a large increase in βcg with hd occurred with a large df when df was less than 0 02 mm hd had a minimal influence on βcg because df dominated the infiltration 3 3 2 variation in the reduction factor with k sc and k sg as shown in fig 12 βcg generally increases with k sc for different values of df and hd the same trend for the variation of βcg with k sc plotted in fig 12 a d shows that the variation of βcg with k sc was seldom influenced by hd βcg varied little as k sc increased from 1 0 10 12 to 1 0 10 10 m s since the absolute value of s con rarely changed there was an obvious increase in βcg with k sc ranging from 1 0 10 10 to 1 08 10 8 m s when k sc was larger than 1 08 10 8 m s the variation in βcg with k sc was influenced by df the seepage through the concrete lining consisted of the seepage rate through both cracks and concrete which was mainly determined by df and k sc respectively when df reached more than 0 05 mm as more water passed through cracks in the concrete lining βcg varied slightly as k sc ranged from 1 08 10 8 to 1 0 10 7 m s and there was a significant increase in βcg with k sc when df values were less than 0 05 mm as shown in fig 13 there was no obvious difference in the trend for βcg variation with k sg because seepage was dominated by the concrete lining when df was less than 0 02 mm for all values of hd βcg was weakly influenced by k sg with increasing df larger than 0 02 mm more seepage infiltrated through the concrete lining and the influence of the geomembrane began to appear fig 13 e g β cg at different hd values varied little with k sg ranging from 1 0 10 13 to 1 0 10 11 m s because s geo varied little in this range as k sg continued to increase there was an obvious increase in β cg especially with smaller hd values when hd was larger than 2 1 10 3 β cg varied little with k sg because holes provide sufficient channels for water to pass through the geomembrane lining 3 4 relationship between the reduction factor β and damage parameters df and hd most studies have considered only the influence of the lining material and its thickness on β but the damage parameters exert significant impacts on β that cannot be ignored as shown in the present study since it is difficult to obtain accurate β values for the different damage conditions of canal linings to improve the accuracy in estimating seepage loss from lined canals three simple formulas used to calculate β were developed by fitting the simulations with the following formula according to variations in β the coefficient of determination r2 relative mean absolute error rmae root mean squared error rmse and mean error me were used to quantitatively evaluate the differences between fitted and observed values the formulas for the four statistical indices are shown in appendix b a normalized index named the relative damage degree of the lining d was defined as an intermediate variable to establish the quantitative relationship of β with df and hd as follows 9 d β β min β max β min where β min and β max are the values for β without damage and the maximum value of β caused by an increase in df or hd respectively d 0 indicates that the lining incurred no damage and d 1 indicates that the value for β of the lining reached β max for a concrete or geomembrane lining d is only a function of df or hd respectively once the function was established βc and βg could be obtained from eq 10 and eq 11 respectively 10 β c β c min d c d f β c max β c min where βc min and βc max are βc without cracks and the maximum βc due to an increase in df respectively dc is the damage degree of the concrete lining influenced by df 11 β g β g min d g h d β g max β g min where β g min is β g without holes and β g max is the maximum βg due to an increase in hd dg is the damage degree of the geomembrane lining influenced by hd 3 4 1 damage degree equation for concrete linings as shown in fig 4 the variations in the β c and dc values with df resemble an s curve which is similar to the shape of the logistic sigmoid equation triana et al 2010 zanetti et al 2015 therefore a modified logistic sigmoid equation eq 12 was adopted to establish the relationship between dc and df 12 d c 1 1 exp m log 10 d f log 10 d f mi d where m represents the increase rate of dc with increasing df and dfmid is an empirical parameter mm the results for fitting β c with eqs 10 and 12 are shown in table 3 and fig 14 all r 2 values exceeded 0 996 and the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 028 8 44 and 0 01 respectively which shows that the proposed equation reliably simulated β c for different df values with different crack locations k sc and t c the fitted m was relatively stable and approximately 5 605 because the parameters of the cubic function louis 1969 qian et al 2012 snow 1968 witherspoon et al 1980 used to calculate the seepage loss through each crack were the same for each scenario and the value of m is fixed at 5 605 in the present study according to the minimum total error therefore only the dfmid in eq 12 needs to be determined according to eq 12 dfmid is the value of df at which dc is 0 5 which means β c is equal to βc min βc max 2 as shown in table 3 the dfmid values fitted for csb cs and cb were nearly identical at approximately 0 037 mm demonstrating that dfmid was not influenced by the crack location or number of cracks in the concrete lining additionally dfmid varied with k sc and t c because increases in βc were caused by an increase in scr and the trends with df were the same as shown in fig 4 a and fig 7 a the βc values of csb cs and cb reached their minimum and maximum values at the same df therefore βc also reached βc min βc max 2 at the same df for different k sc and t c values the value of dfmid can be obtained from eq 13 according to eq 12 and the detailed derivation is shown in appendix c 13 log 10 d f mi d a 1 log 10 β c max β c min a 2 where a 1 and a 2 are the empirical parameters as shown in table 3 the m values of each scenario were less than 5 47 except when k sc was 1 0 10 7 m s scenario k sc6 which led to a larger scon therefore only the log10 df mid values for k sc1 k sc5 and t c1 t c6 were fitted with eq 13 as shown in fig 15 a the r 2 value was larger than 0 828 and the rmse rmae and me values were less than 0 03 1 85 and 0 026 respectively this shows that log10 df mid for different k sc and t c can be calculated directly from βc max βc min with eq 13 when k sc is less than 1 0 10 7 m s therefore for given values of k sc and t c which determine βc max and βc min β c and d c values for different df can be directly and reliably obtained with eqs 10 12 and 13 3 4 2 damage degree equation for a geomembrane lining according to the variations of β g and dg with hd plotted in fig 8 a the following formula was developed to calculate dg and β g with eq 11 14 d g 1 exp b h d where b is an empirical parameter representing the rate increase in dg with increasing hd the fitted curves the resulting regression parameter b and the evaluation indices are shown in fig 16 all r 2 values exceeded 0 933 and the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 038 32 and 0 031 respectively the proposed equation enabled reliable calculation of βg when hd was greater than 1 10 4 and the resulting βg values were in the range of 0 2 1 0 the difference between the proposed equation and the simulated results was mainly observed with hd values in the range 0 1 10 4 moreover the difference was more obvious at a smaller k sg which led to a smaller s geo and s hole accounted for a greater portion of s all refer to fig 9 parameter b was determined from the difference between β g max and β g min for canals lined with only a geomembrane lining β g max is 1 0 and β g min is determined by k sg as shown in fig 8 as the k sg value increased the influence of hd gradually decreased which caused an increase in b fig 17 a shows that b exhibited an obviously linear relationship with βg min as expected from eq 15 the intercept of the function was restricted to 0 because when βg was equal to βg min d g should be 0 15 b b β g max β g min where b is the slope 3 4 3 damage degree equation for a combined lining the trend for the variation of β cg with df shown in fig 10 is identical to that of β c with df fig 4 therefore the β cg values for different df values with certain values of k sg k sc and hd can also be fitted with eqs 10 and 12 the comparison of β cg values obtained by numerical simulation and fitting is shown in fig 18 and figs s1 s6 the r 2 values exceeded 0 999 and the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 005 0 91 and 0 001 respectively as shown in fig 15 b i the variation in the logarithm of df mid with a difference of βcg min and βcg max was also well fitted by eq 13 all r 2 values were greater than 0 999 and the rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 005 0 91 and 0 003 respectively therefore for a canal with the combined lining β cg values for different df values can be reliably calculated by the proposed equations with certain βcg min and βcg max which are determined by hd k sc and k sg since the trend for the variation in βcg with hd shown in fig 11 is identical to that in βg with hd fig 8 β cg values for different hd values can also be reliably calculated with eqs 11 and 14 the fitted curves for βcg when k sc and k sg of the canal were 1 0 10 10 and 1 08 10 8 m s respectively are plotted in fig 19 and the results for other combinations of k sc and k sg are plotted in figs s7 s12 in fig 19 the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were all less than 0 032 6 491 and 0 026 respectively compared with the results of the canal lined only by a geomembrane βcg was also greatly influenced by the concrete lining as shown in figs 10 and 11 therefore βcg values for a liner without holes are close to βcg with hd in the range of 0 1 10 4 and the proposed equations eq 11 and eq 14 provided better fits with βcg than with βg the b value of the combined lining was also influenced by the difference between βcg min and βcg max fig 17 b h shows that the b in eq 14 which was fitted from the combined lining with different combinations of k sg and k sc also exhibited a linear relationship with the difference between βcg min and βcg max considering the influence of k sc and k sg a reasonable b value in eq 15 for the combined lining is 841 379 as shown in fig 20 and the above analysis βcg for a given combination of df and hd can be obtained from the intermediate variables of βcg at points o 1 and r 1 with eq 11 and eq 14 as with the case of a geomembrane lining therefore a new approach for calculating βcg with a given combination of df and hd is as follows 16 β cg h d d f β cg r 1 d g h d d f β cg o 1 β cg r 1 where d g hd df is the damage degree of the geomembrane in the combined lining βcg o1 and βcg r1 are βcg values with df for the concrete lining and geomembrane lining with no holes and without effectiveness respectively which were calculated according to eqs 18 19 according to eqs 14 15 d g of point t is calculated as 17 d g cg h d d f 1 exp b β cg o 1 β cg r 1 where b is 841 379 or can be obtained more precisely by using k sg and k sc values for the combined lining as shown in fig 17 βcg r 1 and βcg o 1 can be calculated from eqs 18 19 according to eqs 10 and 12 as follows 18 β cg r 1 β cg m d c1 d f β cg q β cg m 19 β cg o 1 β cg n d c2 d f β cg p β cg n where βcg m and βcg n are βcg values with no cracks in the concrete lining and the geomembrane lining without holes and are completely ineffective respectively βcg q and βcg p are βcg values for a concrete lining with the severest damage due to an increase in df and the geomembrane lining without holes and is completely ineffective respectively and d c1 and d c2 are calculated from eqs 20 21 according to eq 12 and eq 13 20 d c1 1 1 exp 5 605 log 10 d f a 1 log 10 β cg q β cg m a 2 21 d c2 1 1 exp 5 605 log 10 d f a 1 log 10 β cg p β cg n a 2 where a 1 and a 2 were determined according to the k sg and k sc values of the combined lining as shown in fig 15 by substituting eqs 17 21 into eq 16 βcg for a particular df and hd was obtained moreover the damage degree of the combined lining was obtained as follows 22 d cg h d d f β cg h d d f β cg m β cg p β cg m 3 5 application and discussion of the proposed equations 3 5 1 application of the proposed equations the data obtained from ponding tests in the literatures holmes et al 1981 wachyan and rushton 1987 were used to test the applicability of the proposed method to calculate the seepage loss for a canal with only a concrete lining the seepage rates obtained for a canal with a newly repaired concrete lining and without a lining were 0 07 m d and 0 13 m d respectively the seepage rate from the damaged canal with many cracks and joints filled with silt was 0 12 m d according to the ponding test the equations eqs 10 12 and 13 obtained for the calculation of β c in this study were used to calculate the seepage rate from the canal under the damage condition with many cracks as follows according to the proposed method in the present study the β c min and β c max of the canal were 0 538 and 1 00 respectively due to the severe damage described by the authors df was assumed to be 0 02 0 2 mm the a 1 and a 2 in fig 15 a were used to calculate log10 d fmid therefore the calculated d c and β c of the canal were 0 774 0 997 and 0 90 1 0 respectively and the seepage rate from the canal was 0 116 0 130 m d this result is very close to the 0 12 m d value obtained from the ponding test holmes et al 1981 wachyan and rushton 1987 however according to the literature ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2018 in which the influence of lining damage on β c was not considered β c was only 0 1 0 15 and the seepage rate from the canal was estimated to be 0 013 0 02 m d which is much less than 0 12 m d the applicability of the equations eqs 11 14 15 proposed for the calculation of β g was tested by considering the results in the literature morrison and starbuck 1984 the seepage rate from a canal without a lining was 152 5 l m2 d in 1966 this canal was lined with a geomembrane and no seepage loss was observed two cracks approximately 76 2 mm in length 11 cracks approximately 25 4 mm in length and 4 holes were observed in the 0 743 m2 sample of this geomembrane after 13 5 years the average width of the cracks in the geomembrane and the diameter of the pinholes were assumed to be 0 1 and 0 5 mm respectively the calculated value of hd was 5 92 10 5 the seepage from the lined canal after 5 years was calculated as follows β g min and β g max were 0 0 and 1 0 respectively because the seepage rate from the newly lined canal was very small k sg was assumed to be in the range of 1 0 10 13 1 0 10 11 m s and parameter b in eq 14 was determined to be 1200 if hd was assumed to change linearly with time after constructing the lining the hd was 2 19 10 5 at 5 years after the lining was applied therefore the calculated d g and β g of the canal were both 0 026 and the seepage rate from the canal was 3 958 l m2 d this result is very close to the value of 3 1 l m2 d measured by morrison and starbuck 1984 furthermore the β cg results calculated by the proposed equations eqs 16 to 21 were compared with those obtained from the multiplicative model which has been widely utilized for estimations of canal seepage in most previous studies e g guo 1997 liu et al 2018 xue et al 2020 fig 21 compares the β cg values calculated for 7 combined lining conditions with the β cg values obtained with the multiplicative model and the proposed model eqs 16 21 the results of the proposed model agree well with those of the numerical model which are close to the 1 1 line in each figure however there were larger differences between the 1 1 line and β cg calculated by the multiplicative model as shown in table 4 all statistical indices for the proposed model were better than those of the multiplication model all r 2 values for the proposed model exceeded 0 973 and the corresponding rmses rmaes and mes were less than 0 04 13 6 and 0 030 respectively the seepage rates from the newly built combined lining comprising concrete and a geomembrane and those at 3 years after constructing the lining were 55 34 and 216 l m d respectively however the rate of both of them was 3 62 l m d when calculated by the multiplication model the deviation of the multiplication model was mainly caused by inadequately considering of the effects of the damage parameters as shown in figs 10 and 11 β cg changed very minimally with h d when d f was less than 0 02 mm this result indicates that β cg depended mainly on the lining with a smaller β when either β c or β g was too small and not influenced by the other lining although β c or β g alone also decreased the seepage from the earthen canal when canal seepage was dominated by a particular parameter the influence of other parameters on canal seepage was negotiable han et al 2021 therefore the multiplicative model inevitably encounters errors in the calculation 3 5 2 discussion the seepage loss from the lined canal was greatly influenced by the lining effect reflected by β in this study disregarding the influence of the lining effect produces large errors in the estimation of the seepage loss from lined canals akkuzu 2012 leigh 2014 shah et al 2020 studies quantitatively describing the relationship between the damage degree of the lining and β are lacking in this study the main influencing factors on β and the variation in β with the main parameters were obtained by studying the effects of canal damage characteristics on canal seepage more importantly the influences of cracks in concrete and holes in the geomembrane on the lining damage degree and β were quantified and d and β can be calculated by the proposed empirical equations in addition to calculate the β for the combined lining a more accurate method than the original multiplicative model is proposed because β can be directly used in the kostiakov equation davis wilson equation and moritz equation guo 1997 kraatz 1977 shah et al 2020 to calculate the seepage rate from a lined canal this is of great importance to improve the seepage loss estimation accuracy for a lined canal by empirical formulas the established equations provide a convenient and practical method for capturing seepage loss from lined canals under different lining and damage conditions in irrigation districts due to the complexity of the three dimensional numerical model the df was assumed to have the same value at all locations on the concrete lining it is convenient to estimate the seepage from the lined canals in practical although it is not consistent with the real cracks in the lining concrete it should also be noted that βc max in the proposed equations is determined only by df tc and ksc but the impact of crack number was not considered these impact factors should be considered in future studies 4 conclusions in this study the effects of damage parameters i e df and hd and material parameters such as k sg k sc and t c on the reduction factor for the canal lining were quantitatively investigated by a three dimensional coupled numerical model three empirical equations were developed to calculate β for the concrete lining geomembrane lining and combined lining under different damage conditions the primary conclusions are as follows concrete and geomembrane linings without damage exhibit good seepage control and k sc and or k sg are the factors determining β under this condition as hd or df increases β gradually depends more on hd or df while the influences of k sc t c and k sg decrease until they are negligible β varies slightly with df with values less than 0 02 mm while it increases sharply with df ranging from 0 02 to 0 2 mm and then gradually approaches a maximum at 2 mm β varies little with k sg when it is less than 1 0 10 11 m s and it is close to 1 0 when k sg is greater than 1 0 10 8 m s β varies slightly with hd when it is less than 4 2 10 5 and then increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of hd until β reaches its maximum value the proposed equations based on the logistic sigmoid function and exponential function reliably quantify the relative damage degree of the lining calculate βc from the df for different crack locations t c and k sc and calculate βg from hd for different k sg scenarios the new method to calculate the β of the combined lining can greatly improve the accuracy compared with

3733,although fog is an important component of the hydrological cycle of drylands its formation mechanisms are not fully understood leading to discrepancy of fog type classifications using different methodologies such discrepancies may result in under or over estimation of the potential impacts of global climate change on the ecohydrology of fog dependent ecosystems to fill this knowledge gap this study applies hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes to objectively classify fog and compares this classification to meteorological conditions defined for the formation of these fog types results suggest that this isotope based fog classification method is consistent with expected meteorological conditions for the different fog types such as radiation fog advection fog and mixed fog wind speeds decreased from advection to radiation fog while estimated fog cloud height was lowest during radiation fog and highest during advection fog in addition precipitation offset lc excess suggests that radiation and advection fog had different moisture sources with radiation fog being locally sourced and advection fog originating from the ocean this study suggests isotope based fog classification is an objective method that could be applied to other coastal fog dependent ecosystems to help assess the potential impact of climate change on these ecosystems keywords advection fog mixed fog radiation fog isotope hydrology lifted condensation level lc excess 1 introduction fog is an important but often understudied component of the ecohydrology of arid and coastal environments wang et al 2017 as well as some montane forests zhan et al 2020 in fog dominated environments fog controls the manner and magnitude of the coupling between the atmosphere vegetation and soils weathers et al 2020 however despite an abundance of fog studies formation is still not fully understood because of the complex interaction between a myriad of physical processes and fog spatiotemporal variability smith et al 2018 basic research is thus needed with respect to the numerous processes influencing fog formation such as nucleation radiative processes surface turbulent fluxes mesoscale circulations pollution complex coastlines and topography stolaki et al 2009 fog classification is complex and can be based on several characteristics such as phase composition gultepe et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 aerosol composition bourcier et al 2014 su and huh 2006 isotope composition kaseke et al 2017 and meteorological and or physiographic conditions while fog type is often discussed since it has important implications on our ability to model the effect of climate change on fog dependent ecosystems haensler et al 2011 wang et al 2017 it is rarely quantitatively determined baars et al 2003 fog formation is also complicated by its dynamism often involving multiple processes in a given situation e g advection of temperature and or moisture can play a role in the formation of radiation fog and radiative cooling may be a factor in the formation of other fog types baars et al 2003 kaseke et al 2018 schmitt et al 2018 tardif and rasmussen 2007 therefore our understanding of the physics of fog remains incomplete due to the spatiotemporal scales involved in numerous processes influencing fog formation development and dissipation stolaki et al 2009 while advection fog has been extensively documented in the central namib desert andersen et al 2019 cermak 2012 olivier 1995 radiation fog has often been relegated to footnotes as opportunistic observations eckardt et al 2013 kimura 2005 seely and henschel 1998 however based on stable isotope analysis kaseke et al 2017 suggests that local radiation fog is a regular occurrence and may play a significant role in the ecohydrology of the central namib desert this has reignited debate on the sources and controls of fog formation spurred by the observation that different methodologies remote sensing and isotope analysis seem to result in contrasting conclusions andersen et al 2018 kaseke et al 2018 spirig et al 2019 these differences highlight that fog climatology not only of the central namib desert but possibly other coastal ecosystems is more complex and not as well understood as often thought or assumed the present study aims to bridge the discrepancies between different approaches by reconciling isotope based fog classification details please refer to section 2 4 and kaseke et al 2017 kaseke et al 2018 with associated meteorological conditions for similar fog types reported elsewhere in literature at the same time the study also aims to investigate details on the formation mechanisms of radiation fog in this coastal environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 field data collection and isotope analyses field observations and data collection were conducted in the central namib desert over an area approximately 1700 km2 fig 1 the central namib desert is classified as a hyper arid environment dependent on non rainfall waters for ecosystem functioning eckardt et al 2013 henschel and seely 2008 this aridity can be attributed to the influence of the global hadley circulation in conjunction with the stable cool air temperatures generated by the atlantic ocean which generate stability that supresses convection and thus rainfall along the south western coast of africa eckardt et al 2013 pietruszka and seely 1985 while the cold upwelling of the atlantic ocean prevents local convective rainfall it sustains coastal advection fog eckardt et al 2013 a prominent feature of the west south west coast of africa olivier 1995 the namib is thus a coastal desert along the west coast of southern africa stretching from the northern parts of south africa to the southern parts of angola fig 1b at the same time large scale circulation systems that influence precipitation in the region and the namib desert generally originate from the indian ocean eckardt et al 2013 while ephemeral flow and groundwater in the central namib desert are sourced from the highlands in the interior jacobson et al 1995 these source differences result in distinct isotope compositions for advection fog atlantic ocean local precipitation predominantly from the east indian ocean and groundwater such that stable isotope hydrology is applicable to ecosystem studies in this environment kaseke et al 2018 provides a more detailed description of the sampling sites displayed in fig 1a and listed here ministry of environment and tourism coastal site coastal met kleinberg sophies hoogte marble koppie vogelfederberg station 8 aussinanis and gobabeb we opportunistically sampled fog events during field campaigns conducted between 2016 and 2018 from the sampling sites indicated in fig 1a these sites were part of the southern african science service centre for climate change and adaptive land management sasscal and fognet fn projects each site was equipped with automated meteorological instrumentation including a juvik type fog collector length 40 6 cm and 500 cm2 mounted atop a young model 522202 tipping bucket rain gauge raised 1 5 m above ground level fig 1c captured fog was measured by the rain gauge and subsequently channelled into a 1l glass bottle anchored to the ground via a connecting tube from the bottom of the rain gauge and squeezed through the cap for a tight fit to minimise evaporation effects fig 1c a metal shade barrier was placed on top of the fog collector to exclude rainfall inputs from the rain gauge and prevent contamination from dust and debris fig 1c at the same time additional meteorological data including wind speed and direction 10 m air 2 m and soil 0 1 m depth temperature relative humidity 2 m and leaf wetness campbell scientific 237 l wet dry transition electrical resistance 50 and 200 kω 0 1 m were measured at hourly intervals allowing for correlation of meteorological conditions during fog events with the fog isotope data fog samples were transferred into 15 ml qorpak clear french square bottles with black phenolic polycone lined caps labelled appropriately with the site name sample type and date of collection and stored at gobabeb namib research institute until shipment to indiana university purdue university indianapolis ecohydrology lab for isotope analysis for the duration of each field campaign the fog collector at gobabeb namib research institute base was inspected between 05 30 and 06 00 hrs for sample from the previous night and or early morning whenever sample was observed and collected we immediately embarked on a sampling trip to all sites using alternate routes i e aussinanis coastal met or coastal met aussinanis fig 1 because of the spatiotemporal variability of fog in addition to the physical inspections for fog at gobabeb namib research institute we also assessed real time individual site meteorological data leaf wetness and rh from the sasscal website to determine if fog had occurred elsewhere but not our base if data suggested the possibility of fog at any of the other sites we immediately embarked on a field trip and physically checked all sites for fog sample these precautions minimized sampling trips to periods when there was actual fog to be sampled whilst at the same time served to minimize evaporation effects and sampling bias stable isotope analysis δ18o and δ2h was conducted using the triple water vapor analyzer los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa with a reported precision of 0 2 δ18o and 0 8 tian et al 2019 wang et al 2009 however this instrument was temporarily out of commission for a period and the l2130 i isotope and gas concentration analyzer picarro was used to complete the analyses reanalyses of some samples analysed by the triple water vapor analyzer using the l2130 i isotope and gas concentration analyzer were almost identical thus no correction was applied data was reported in δ notation relative to vsmow slap scale as δ rsample rvsmow 1 where rsample and rvsmow are the molar ratios of heavy to light isotopes 2h h or 18o 16o of the sample and international standard vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 2 2 lifted condensation level lcl quantification the lifted condensation level lcl is the height at which an air parcel becomes saturated due to adiabatic cooling condensation and is thus an estimate of cloud base height at the same time fog can be defined as a cloud with its base at or near the earth s surface george 1951 gonfiantini and longinelli 1962 jouzel 1986 therefore lcl could potentially be applied to differentiate fog events dominated by radiative cooling processes low cloud base from those dominated by humidification processes high cloud base lcl was estimated using the formula below h lcl 125 t t d t d 0 066077 log ew 237 3 log ew 8 16077 berry et al 1945 log ew 0 066077 7 5 x t 237 3 t log 10 rh 2 where hlcl is the lifted condensation level in meters above ground level t and td are ambient and dew point temperature in degrees celsius and rh is relative humidity because fog duration was estimated using leaf wetness sensors at hourly intervals lcl was calculated at the same interval and averaged to give a base height characteristic of the fog event at a particular site 2 3 soil surface temperature inasmuch as lcl gives an estimate of the cloud base soil surface temperature may influence local fog formation by inducing or maintaining cooling of the cloud base therefore we modelled soil surface temperature based on the 24 hr moving averages of soil temperature at 10 cm depth using an equation that describes soil diurnal fluctuations as a sine wave holmes et al 2008 t s 0 t s 10 t a e zb v sin w t zb v φ where ts0 is the soil surface temperature ts10 is soil temperature at 10 cm depth ta is the daily amplitude of air temperature defined as the difference between air temperature at 2 m and ts10 c zb is the difference in depth m between ts0 and ts10 ω is angular frequency s 1 t is time s φ is porosity while υ is the damping depth m the damping depth υ is defined as υ 2 η ω ω 2 π τ where τ is the wave period s η is the thermal diffusivity 8 7906e 06 m2s 1 at 0 295 degree of saturation using the formula in xie et al 2018 the degree of saturation was estimated using maximum volumetric water content after rains 10 adhikari and wang 2020 and porosity of namib sand 0 339 warren and john 1994 η k p s c s where k is soil thermal conductivity 0 59749 w m 1 c 1 ps is the density of sandy soil 1600 kg m 3 and cs is the specific heat capacity of sandy soil 1367 2 w kg c 1 2 4 isotope based fog classification isotope fractionation imparts unique signatures on meteoric water that can be combined with deuterium excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 to determine source origins and evaporative conditions merlivat and jouzel 1979 because fog is a first stage condensate dominated by equilibrium fractionation processes which do not alter d fog isotope composition should reflect source isotope composition by plotting on the global meteoric water line ocean derived local meteoric water line locally derived or between the two if formed by admixture aravena et al 1989 gonfiantini and longinelli 1962 kaseke et al 2017 at the same time a secondary parameter similar to d but less sensitive to seasonal variations line conditioned excess lc excess δ2hsample lmwlslope δ18osample lmwlintercept indicates the degree of deviation of meteoric water from the lmwl or local precipitation with negative values indicating evaporation whilst positive values indicate mixing from several sources landwehr and coplen 2006 therefore in theory if lc excess is applied to fog origin studies fog derived from local water sources should plot on the local water line with lc excess as zero or below the local water line indicating evaporation if the fog plots above the local water line then fog was not derived exclusively from local sources and was either mixed or advected fog transported from the nearby atlantic ocean 2 5 cross validation of fog types with meteorological conditions since we could estimate fog duration based on leaf wetness and rh sensors we could estimate the prevailing meteorological conditions during each fog event at each site this also meant we could summarize the meteorological conditions for each of the fog types based on isotope classification radiation mixed and advection in this study and compare these conditions to meteorological conditions reported in literature for the same fog types for consistency e g wind speed

classification there was large isotope variability in the bulk fog samples δ18o 0 63 1 44 δ2h 1 49 11 78 and d 3 60 2 86 suggesting multiple fog types table 1 fig 2 advection and radiation fog plotted directly on the gmwl and lmwl respectively while mixed fog plotted between the two meteoric water lines fig 2b 2d surprisingly advection fog accounted for the least amount of fog events 9 6 followed by radiation fog 20 5 while mixed fog 69 9 was the dominant fog type during the study period table 1 while advection fog δ2h may seem abnormally enriched similar values have been observed in other studies from other regions clark et al 1987 scholl et al 2011 given the large variability observed in the bulk fog samples it was not surprising to observe significant differences in the isotope compositions δ18o δ2h d and lc excess of the different fog types fig 2 and fig 3 advection fog δ18o 0 00 δ2h 8 50 d 8 50 and lc excess 11 16 were significantly enriched compared to either mixed fog δ18o 0 50 δ2h 0 50 d 3 50 and lc excess 4 49 or radiation fog δ18o 0 80 δ2h 7 00 d 0 20 and lc excess 1 08 kruskal wallis p 0 05 post hoc mann whitney test p 0 05 fig 3 these differences in fog type isotope composition reflect the differences in source water isotope composition advection fog d 8 54 was similar to the gmwl d 10 0 but enriched compared to the lmwl d 3 65 suggesting that moisture of advection fog was not derived from local meteoric waters in addition advection fog lc excess 11 48 indicates that moisture for this fog cannot be derived from local rainfall or meteoric waters as it was larger than zero fig 3d advection fog δ18o and δ2h were positively related with air temperature temperature effect high low temperatures decrease increase kinetic effects resulting in enriched depleted fog isotope compositions fig 4 a and 4c radiation fog d 0 06 was significantly depleted compared to the lmwl d 3 65 anova post hoc tukey test p 0 05 but the samples plotted on the lmwl fig 2a and 2d at the same time radiation fog lc excess 0 66 indicates that fog moisture was locally derived with some evaporation effects which account for the low d fig 3c and 3d radiation fog δ18o and δ2h were significantly positively related with soil temperature 10 cm depth and rh while inversely related with lcl fig 5 a f mixed fog d 4 01 did not differ significantly from that of lmwl 3 65 anova post hoc tukey test p 0 05 suggesting mixed fog may have been formed by moisture from local meteoric water sources fig 3c however mixed fog lc excess 4 83 indicated an admixture of moisture fig 3d because this was smaller than the lc excess observed in advection fog and d was similar to local meteoric waters suggests this was an admixture of advected and local moisture fig 3d although relatively weak mixed fog d was positively related to rh and negatively to lcl fig 6 a and 6b similar to radiation fog these results suggest that although local moisture is incorporated into mixed fog the admixture with advecting fog alters the isotope composition such that correlation of fog isotope compositions and local meteorological conditions is muddled except for the low correlations with rh and lc fig 6 3 2 meteorological conditions of different fog formations air temperature during mixed 11 29 2 76 c and advection fogs 11 31 2 85 c were similar however air temperature during radiation

formation radiative cooling radiation and humidification advection pagowski et al 2004 because fog is a first stage condensate dominated by equilibrium fractionation process that do not alter d radiation fog isotope compositions should plot on the lmwl aravena et al 1989 gonfiantini and longinelli 1962 kaseke et al 2017 although radiation fog plotted on the lmwl suggesting local moisture origins fig 2a and 2d radiation fog d 0 06 was significantly depleted compared to the lmwl d 3 65 the low radiation d could indicate some level of evaporative enrichment affecting the samples which is supported by the lc excess 0 66 which indicates local meteoric waters as the source of moisture fig 3d in addition fog simulation models suggest that soil moisture from prior precipitation events may be critical for radiation fog formation supplying the much needed moisture for formation kim et al 2020 meanwhile adhikari and wang 2020 demonstrated that vapor fluxes from the soil to atmosphere in hyper arid environments such as the central namib desert is sufficient to support radiation and or mixed fog formation it is important to note that radiation fog samples were collected in june and july 2016 2018 and that precipitation was recorded prior to these events june 2016 april 2017 and may 2018 at the same time kaseke et al 2018 suggests that the relationship between radiation fog isotopes rh and soil temperature could be attributed to a night time soil atmosphere thermal gradient facilitating vapor movement to the atmosphere and subsequent radiative cooling kinetic fractionation during evaporation is enhanced reduced at low high temperatures thus low high soil temperatures result in isotopically depleted enriched vapor transported to the atmosphere when such vapor is condensed it will result in a more depleted enriched radiation fog isotope composition fig 5a and 5d transpiration by ephemeral vegetation could be the main avenue for groundwater transport into the atmosphere leading to groundwater derived radiation fog restricted to and around ephemeral channels kaseke et al 2017 besides the general strong control of vegetation on water cycles wang et al 2014 recent work suggests that night time transpiration en is not only common across species but contributes a significant amount to total transpiration 10 60 in desert species caird et al 2007 dawson et al 2007 snyder and williams 2003 yu et al 2016 zeppel et al 2013 while the reasons and or benefits of this behaviour are not well understood evaporation demand vpd and soil moisture are the main drivers dawson et al 2007 yu et al 2016 zeppel et al 2013 vegetation in the ephemeral kuiseb and swakop rivers is dependent on shallow aquifers burke 2006 which suggests high soil moisture conditions while the leaves will no doubt experience high vpd during none fog hours of the night conditions consistent with high en radiative cooling and condensation of this transpired vapor would thus result in groundwater derived fog with a distinct isotope composition kaseke et al 2017 however admixture with advecting fog or moisture from the atlantic ocean will result in mixed fog with a higher d 4 01 plotting above the lmwl but below the gmwl fig 2a and 2c critical to condensation is radiation cooling of the soil surface creating an inversion layer that results in fog formation from the surface base upwards soil surface temperature was the same or lower than ambient dew point temperature during 67 of the radiation fog events suggesting that soil surface temperature may have contributed to formation and or sustained the fog fig 7b and fig s1 at the same time low cloud bases lcl reflect the importance of radiation cooling for condensation radiation fog while high lcl indicate the dominance of humidification advection fog radiation fog thus had the lowest estimated cloud base lcl while advection fog had the highest lcl and mixed fog was between the two fig 7f while 80 of radiation fog events had cloud bases at ground level for at least 2 hrs during each event lcl suggested 20 did not reach the surface however lcl is only an estimation all samples were technically fogs and does not take into account other factors that could result in condensation at less than ideal conditions 100 rh such as the presence of hygroscopic condensation nuclei and could over estimate cloud base height under such conditions especially during advection fog events fig 7d the inverse relationships between fog isotopes δ18o δ2h and lcl also suggest the importance of radiative cooling in localized fog formation fig 5c and 5f these results suggest two types of radiation fog shallow stable radiation fog isotopically enriched and deep adiabatic fog isotopically depleted shallow stable radiation fogs are formed from radiative cooling in the shallow surface inversion layer and as the fog continues to evolve and thicken fog top cooling is initiated inducing vertical mixing within the fog deep adiabatic fog smith et al 2018 steeneveld and de bode 2018 it is known that some clouds are isotopically stratified showing a decrease in vapor and increased isotope δ18o δ2h depletion with height gedzelman and arnold 1994 lowenthal et al 2016 condensation of this depleted vapor via fog top cooling and its subsequent sinking to the surface coupled to the negative buoyant air would then result in the extremely depleted isotope signatures observed in radiation fog fig 2a and 2d and the associated inverse relationships with lcl fig 5c and 5f although soil moisture in arid environments maybe a limiting factor to sustaining shallow stable radiation fogs kim et al 2020 sufficient moisture i e soil moisture rainfall en and admixture with advected fog moisture shallow stable radiation fog could evolve into deep adiabatic fog characterized by the extremely depleted isotope signatures observed in both radiation and mixed fog and their associated relationships with lcl fig 2a 2c 2d 5c 5f and 6b these extremely depleted isotope signatures are not unique to this study alone but have been reported before in other studies in the area eckardt et al 2013 4 2 mixed fog kaseke et al 2017 suggests mixed fog could be formed in two ways 1 incorporation of locally derived moisture into advecting fog altering the fog isotope composition scholl et al 2011 and 2 radiation cooling of a mixture of locally derived and advecting moisture george 1951 kaseke et al 2012 mixed fog thus takes on characteristics of both sets of moisture and plots between the gmwl and lmwl accounting for the large isotope variability observed for this fog class fig 2a and 2c although the estimated cloud base height for mixed fog was higher than for radiation fog the inverse relationship of lcl with d still suggests that radiation cooling was an important factor that contributed to this fog type mixed fog formation is thus complicated by its dynamism involving multiple processes in a given situation i e advection of fog or moisture coupled with addition of local moisture and radiative cooling baars et al 2003 kaseke et al 2018 schmitt et al 2018 tardif and rasmussen 2007 resulting in isotopic evolution of the fog therefore whereas the fog may visually look like advection fog isotopically it is distinct mixed fog fig 2 4 3 advection fog coastal fog isotope compositions should plot on the gmwl and their composition should be close to sea water aravena et al 1989 majoube 1971 fig 2a and 2b this suggests that this fog may have formed over the ocean sea breeze fog and was transported advected inland advection fog similar findings have been reported elsewhere for example monsoon cloud precipitation advection fog in the southern districts of oman is isotopically similar to sea water and is thought to originate from a single stage evaporation condensation cycle from the arabian sea clark et al 1987 at the same time advection fog d is maintained relatively unchanged even when sampled distances up to 60 km inland kaseke et al 2018 2017 accounting for the high d in advection fog 8 54 0 5 which is similar to the gmwl d 10 fig 3c this enriched advection fog d compared to the lmwl d 3 7 excludes local meteoric waters as possible moisture sources for this fog type fig 2a and 2b in agreement with the lc excess which also indicates a non local water source for this fog type isotope enrichment can be attributed to condensation temperature low high ambient temperatures result in depleted enriched fog isotope compositions relative to ocean water gonfiantini and longinelli 1962 fig 4a and 4c at the same time advection fog advances as a self contained system or blanket of fog hence the correlation with air temperature suggesting this is a reflection of the formation temperature fig 4 however this blanket of fog dissipates if local meteorological conditions cause instability of the system e g higher air and or soil temperature wind speed or turbulence on the other hand low air temperatures and moderate wind could facilitate fog stability extending advection inland baars et al 2003 there was also a positive relationship between advection fog δ18o and δ2h and wind speed fig 4b and 4d this suggests high wind speed may introduce some kinetic fractionation within the fog enriching the liquid phase and causing dissipation of the fog beyond a speed threshold in coastal regions advection fog can form at rh 80 due to the abundance of hygroscopic nuclei sea salt choi et al 1998 fig s2 while radiation fog is generally formed at higher rh 100 due to strong radiative cooling effects hyo 2013 sciocatti 1984 fig s1 relative humidity during fog events was highest during radiation fog 97 3 2 3 and formed at a minimum of 91 2 rh which is more than the minimum threshold established for fog formation for the area 84 kaseke et al 2012 the minimum rh threshold for radiation fog formation 91 2 suggests that hygroscopic nuclei may have catalysed fog formation before optimum conditions were achieved which would account for the 20 radiation fog events which did not reach the earth s surface according to the lcl estimation advection fog on the other hand was detected at much lower rh attributed to the abundance of hygroscopic nuclei and could be extended further inland via radiation cooling of the soil surface 43 of the events fig s2 similarly mixed fog soil surface temperature achieved or went below ambient dew point temperature for 33 of the mixed fog events suggesting that the soil surface sustained the fog as it was transported further inland at the same time average wind speeds during radiation fog were consistent with the optimal low speeds associated with radiation fog tardif and rasmussen 2007 while advection and mixed fog wind speeds were significantly faster fig 7d it has been noted that inland fog observations in the central namib desert lag 2 4 hrs behind coastal sites suggesting an advection fog pattern andersen et al 2018 kaseke et al 2012 however none of the fog samples collected from the station closest to the ocean cmet during the opportunistic samplings were classified as advection fog mixed 88 and radiation 12 a plausible explanation for this observation is that the fog passes over cmet which has the lowest elevation 94 m a s l as a cloud only intersecting land at kb 184 m a s l and 25 km inland onwards so called high fog spirig et al 2019 for example advection fog was collected on the 10th july 2017 at kb sh and vf but not observed at cmet when the cloud is low enough to intersect land at cmet fog it most likely incorporates moisture from the kuiseb delta vegetation transpiration 2 5 km from the ocean 5 15 m a s l area 16 8 km2 and isotopically evolves to mixed fog although visually this might be classified as advection fog fig 8 5 conclusions observations based on different methodologies e g remote sensing and isotope analysis sometimes result in contrasting conclusions on fog origins and fog water sources here we aim to reconcile the isotope based fog classification with meteorological conditions of different fog types reported in literature the associated meteorological conditions rh wind speed and air temperature of advection and radiation fog as defined by isotope classification were consistent with those reported elsewhere isotope based classification showed that radiation fog was formed under high rh low wind speed conditions and could be approximated using lcl meanwhile advection fog was generally formed or detected at lower rh faster wind speeds and dominated by humidification thus lcl overestimated cloud base height at the same time meteorological conditions during mixed fog were between those of radiation and advection fog suggesting that mixed fog was a combination of local and advected moisture however because mixed fog is an admixture of different moistures the isotope composition did not correlate with any of the local meteorological conditions although humidification appeared to be the dominant driver for mixed fog formation high d and lc excess there was some evidence indicating that incorporation of local moisture and radiative cooling were also important fig 6 at the same time lcl and lc excess were useful additional tools that were able to differentiate fog types based on the dominant fog formation process radiative cooling radiation and humidification advection while also identifying the source of moisture local vs advected given the consistency between the isotope based classification and fog type based on meteorological conditions we can conclude that the isotope based fog classification is real and could be applied to other coastal fog dependent regions to understand the complex ecohydrology at the same time we can also conclude that simulations of the effect of climate change on fog dependent ecosystems would be incomplete if locally derived moisture

3733,although fog is an important component of the hydrological cycle of drylands its formation mechanisms are not fully understood leading to discrepancy of fog type classifications using different methodologies such discrepancies may result in under or over estimation of the potential impacts of global climate change on the ecohydrology of fog dependent ecosystems to fill this knowledge gap this study applies hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes to objectively classify fog and compares this classification to meteorological conditions defined for the formation of these fog types results suggest that this isotope based fog classification method is consistent with expected meteorological conditions for the different fog types such as radiation fog advection fog and mixed fog wind speeds decreased from advection to radiation fog while estimated fog cloud height was lowest during radiation fog and highest during advection fog in addition precipitation offset lc excess suggests that radiation and advection fog had different moisture sources with radiation fog being locally sourced and advection fog originating from the ocean this study suggests isotope based fog classification is an objective method that could be applied to other coastal fog dependent ecosystems to help assess the potential impact of climate change on these ecosystems keywords advection fog mixed fog radiation fog isotope hydrology lifted condensation level lc excess 1 introduction fog is an important but often understudied component of the ecohydrology of arid and coastal environments wang et al 2017 as well as some montane forests zhan et al 2020 in fog dominated environments fog controls the manner and magnitude of the coupling between the atmosphere vegetation and soils weathers et al 2020 however despite an abundance of fog studies formation is still not fully understood because of the complex interaction between a myriad of physical processes and fog spatiotemporal variability smith et al 2018 basic research is thus needed with respect to the numerous processes influencing fog formation such as nucleation radiative processes surface turbulent fluxes mesoscale circulations pollution complex coastlines and topography stolaki et al 2009 fog classification is complex and can be based on several characteristics such as phase composition gultepe et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 aerosol composition bourcier et al 2014 su and huh 2006 isotope composition kaseke et al 2017 and meteorological and or physiographic conditions while fog type is often discussed since it has important implications on our ability to model the effect of climate change on fog dependent ecosystems haensler et al 2011 wang et al 2017 it is rarely quantitatively determined baars et al 2003 fog formation is also complicated by its dynamism often involving multiple processes in a given situation e g advection of temperature and or moisture can play a role in the formation of radiation fog and radiative cooling may be a factor in the formation of other fog types baars et al 2003 kaseke et al 2018 schmitt et al 2018 tardif and rasmussen 2007 therefore our understanding of the physics of fog remains incomplete due to the spatiotemporal scales involved in numerous processes influencing fog formation development and dissipation stolaki et al 2009 while advection fog has been extensively documented in the central namib desert andersen et al 2019 cermak 2012 olivier 1995 radiation fog has often been relegated to footnotes as opportunistic observations eckardt et al 2013 kimura 2005 seely and henschel 1998 however based on stable isotope analysis kaseke et al 2017 suggests that local radiation fog is a regular occurrence and may play a significant role in the ecohydrology of the central namib desert this has reignited debate on the sources and controls of fog formation spurred by the observation that different methodologies remote sensing and isotope analysis seem to result in contrasting conclusions andersen et al 2018 kaseke et al 2018 spirig et al 2019 these differences highlight that fog climatology not only of the central namib desert but possibly other coastal ecosystems is more complex and not as well understood as often thought or assumed the present study aims to bridge the discrepancies between different approaches by reconciling isotope based fog classification details please refer to section 2 4 and kaseke et al 2017 kaseke et al 2018 with associated meteorological conditions for similar fog types reported elsewhere in literature at the same time the study also aims to investigate details on the formation mechanisms of radiation fog in this coastal environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 field data collection and isotope analyses field observations and data collection were conducted in the central namib desert over an area approximately 1700 km2 fig 1 the central namib desert is classified as a hyper arid environment dependent on non rainfall waters for ecosystem functioning eckardt et al 2013 henschel and seely 2008 this aridity can be attributed to the influence of the global hadley circulation in conjunction with the stable cool air temperatures generated by the atlantic ocean which generate stability that supresses convection and thus rainfall along the south western coast of africa eckardt et al 2013 pietruszka and seely 1985 while the cold upwelling of the atlantic ocean prevents local convective rainfall it sustains coastal advection fog eckardt et al 2013 a prominent feature of the west south west coast of africa olivier 1995 the namib is thus a coastal desert along the west coast of southern africa stretching from the northern parts of south africa to the southern parts of angola fig 1b at the same time large scale circulation systems that influence precipitation in the region and the namib desert generally originate from the indian ocean eckardt et al 2013 while ephemeral flow and groundwater in the central namib desert are sourced from the highlands in the interior jacobson et al 1995 these source differences result in distinct isotope compositions for advection fog atlantic ocean local precipitation predominantly from the east indian ocean and groundwater such that stable isotope hydrology is applicable to ecosystem studies in this environment kaseke et al 2018 provides a more detailed description of the sampling sites displayed in fig 1a and listed here ministry of environment and tourism coastal site coastal met kleinberg sophies hoogte marble koppie vogelfederberg station 8 aussinanis and gobabeb we opportunistically sampled fog events during field campaigns conducted between 2016 and 2018 from the sampling sites indicated in fig 1a these sites were part of the southern african science service centre for climate change and adaptive land management sasscal and fognet fn projects each site was equipped with automated meteorological instrumentation including a juvik type fog collector length 40 6 cm and 500 cm2 mounted atop a young model 522202 tipping bucket rain gauge raised 1 5 m above ground level fig 1c captured fog was measured by the rain gauge and subsequently channelled into a 1l glass bottle anchored to the ground via a connecting tube from the bottom of the rain gauge and squeezed through the cap for a tight fit to minimise evaporation effects fig 1c a metal shade barrier was placed on top of the fog collector to exclude rainfall inputs from the rain gauge and prevent contamination from dust and debris fig 1c at the same time additional meteorological data including wind speed and direction 10 m air 2 m and soil 0 1 m depth temperature relative humidity 2 m and leaf wetness campbell scientific 237 l wet dry transition electrical resistance 50 and 200 kω 0 1 m were measured at hourly intervals allowing for correlation of meteorological conditions during fog events with the fog isotope data fog samples were transferred into 15 ml qorpak clear french square bottles with black phenolic polycone lined caps labelled appropriately with the site name sample type and date of collection and stored at gobabeb namib research institute until shipment to indiana university purdue university indianapolis ecohydrology lab for isotope analysis for the duration of each field campaign the fog collector at gobabeb namib research institute base was inspected between 05 30 and 06 00 hrs for sample from the previous night and or early morning whenever sample was observed and collected we immediately embarked on a sampling trip to all sites using alternate routes i e aussinanis coastal met or coastal met aussinanis fig 1 because of the spatiotemporal variability of fog in addition to the physical inspections for fog at gobabeb namib research institute we also assessed real time individual site meteorological data leaf wetness and rh from the sasscal website to determine if fog had occurred elsewhere but not our base if data suggested the possibility of fog at any of the other sites we immediately embarked on a field trip and physically checked all sites for fog sample these precautions minimized sampling trips to periods when there was actual fog to be sampled whilst at the same time served to minimize evaporation effects and sampling bias stable isotope analysis δ18o and δ2h was conducted using the triple water vapor analyzer los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa with a reported precision of 0 2 δ18o and 0 8 tian et al 2019 wang et al 2009 however this instrument was temporarily out of commission for a period and the l2130 i isotope and gas concentration analyzer picarro was used to complete the analyses reanalyses of some samples analysed by the triple water vapor analyzer using the l2130 i isotope and gas concentration analyzer were almost identical thus no correction was applied data was reported in δ notation relative to vsmow slap scale as δ rsample rvsmow 1 where rsample and rvsmow are the molar ratios of heavy to light isotopes 2h h or 18o 16o of the sample and international standard vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 2 2 lifted condensation level lcl quantification the lifted condensation level lcl is the height at which an air parcel becomes saturated due to adiabatic cooling condensation and is thus an estimate of cloud base height at the same time fog can be defined as a cloud with its base at or near the earth s surface george 1951 gonfiantini and longinelli 1962 jouzel 1986 therefore lcl could potentially be applied to differentiate fog events dominated by radiative cooling processes low cloud base from those dominated by humidification processes high cloud base lcl was estimated using the formula below h lcl 125 t t d t d 0 066077 log ew 237 3 log ew 8 16077 berry et al 1945 log ew 0 066077 7 5 x t 237 3 t log 10 rh 2 where hlcl is the lifted condensation level in meters above ground level t and td are ambient and dew point temperature in degrees celsius and rh is relative humidity because fog duration was estimated using leaf wetness sensors at hourly intervals lcl was calculated at the same interval and averaged to give a base height characteristic of the fog event at a particular site 2 3 soil surface temperature inasmuch as lcl gives an estimate of the cloud base soil surface temperature may influence local fog formation by inducing or maintaining cooling of the cloud base therefore we modelled soil surface temperature based on the 24 hr moving averages of soil temperature at 10 cm depth using an equation that describes soil diurnal fluctuations as a sine wave holmes et al 2008 t s 0 t s 10 t a e zb v sin w t zb v φ where ts0 is the soil surface temperature ts10 is soil temperature at 10 cm depth ta is the daily amplitude of air temperature defined as the difference between air temperature at 2 m and ts10 c zb is the difference in depth m between ts0 and ts10 ω is angular frequency s 1 t is time s φ is porosity while υ is the damping depth m the damping depth υ is defined as υ 2 η ω ω 2 π τ where τ is the wave period s η is the thermal diffusivity 8 7906e 06 m2s 1 at 0 295 degree of saturation using the formula in xie et al 2018 the degree of saturation was estimated using maximum volumetric water content after rains 10 adhikari and wang 2020 and porosity of namib sand 0 339 warren and john 1994 η k p s c s where k is soil thermal conductivity 0 59749 w m 1 c 1 ps is the density of sandy soil 1600 kg m 3 and cs is the specific heat capacity of sandy soil 1367 2 w kg c 1 2 4 isotope based fog classification isotope fractionation imparts unique signatures on meteoric water that can be combined with deuterium excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 to determine source origins and evaporative conditions merlivat and jouzel 1979 because fog is a first stage condensate dominated by equilibrium fractionation processes which do not alter d fog isotope composition should reflect source isotope composition by plotting on the global meteoric water line ocean derived local meteoric water line locally derived or between the two if formed by admixture aravena et al 1989 gonfiantini and longinelli 1962 kaseke et al 2017 at the same time a secondary parameter similar to d but less sensitive to seasonal variations line conditioned excess lc excess δ2hsample lmwlslope δ18osample lmwlintercept indicates the degree of deviation of meteoric water from the lmwl or local precipitation with negative values indicating evaporation whilst positive values indicate mixing from several sources landwehr and coplen 2006 therefore in theory if lc excess is applied to fog origin studies fog derived from local water sources should plot on the local water line with lc excess as zero or below the local water line indicating evaporation if the fog plots above the local water line then fog was not derived exclusively from local sources and was either mixed or advected fog transported from the nearby atlantic ocean 2 5 cross validation of fog types with meteorological conditions since we could estimate fog duration based on leaf wetness and rh sensors we could estimate the prevailing meteorological conditions during each fog event at each site this also meant we could summarize the meteorological conditions for each of the fog types based on isotope classification radiation mixed and advection in this study and compare these conditions to meteorological conditions reported in literature for the same fog types for consistency e g wind speed

directly on the gmwl and lmwl respectively while mixed fog plotted between the two meteoric water lines fig 2b 2d surprisingly advection fog accounted for the least amount of fog events 9 6 followed by radiation fog 20 5 while mixed fog 69 9 was the dominant fog type during the study period table 1 while advection fog δ2h may seem abnormally enriched similar values have been observed in other studies from other regions clark et al 1987 scholl et al 2011 given the large variability observed in the bulk fog samples it was not surprising to observe significant differences in the isotope compositions δ18o δ2h d and lc excess of the different fog types fig 2 and fig 3 advection fog δ18o 0 00 δ2h 8 50 d 8 50 and lc excess 11 16 were significantly enriched compared to either mixed fog

isotope composition reflect the differences in source water isotope composition advection fog d 8 54 was similar to the gmwl d 10 0 but enriched compared to the lmwl d 3 65 suggesting that moisture of advection fog was not derived from local meteoric waters in addition advection fog lc excess 11 48 indicates that moisture for this fog cannot be derived from local rainfall or meteoric waters as it was larger than zero fig 3d advection fog δ18o and δ2h were positively related with air temperature temperature effect high low temperatures decrease increase kinetic effects resulting in enriched depleted fog isotope compositions fig 4 a and 4c radiation fog d 0 06 was significantly depleted compared to the lmwl d 3 65 anova post hoc tukey test p 0 05 but the samples plotted on the lmwl fig 2a and 2d at the same time radiation fog lc excess 0 66 indicates that fog moisture was locally derived with some evaporation effects which account for the low d fig 3c and 3d radiation fog δ18o and δ2h were significantly positively related with soil temperature 10 cm depth and rh while inversely related with lcl fig 5 a f mixed fog d 4 01 did not differ significantly from that of lmwl 3 65 anova post hoc tukey test p 0 05 suggesting mixed fog may have been formed by moisture from local meteoric water sources fig 3c however mixed fog lc excess 4 83 indicated an admixture of moisture fig 3d because this was smaller than the lc excess observed in advection fog and d was similar to local meteoric waters suggests this was an admixture of advected and local moisture fig 3d although relatively weak mixed fog d was positively related to rh and negatively to lcl fig 6 a and 6b similar to radiation fog these results suggest that although local moisture is incorporated into mixed fog the admixture with advecting fog alters the isotope composition such that correlation of fog isotope compositions and local meteorological conditions is muddled except for the low correlations with rh and lc fig 6 3 2 meteorological conditions of different fog formations air temperature during mixed 11 29 2 76 c and advection fogs 11 31 2 85 c were similar however air temperature during radiation

formation radiative cooling radiation and humidification advection pagowski et al 2004 because fog is a first stage condensate dominated by equilibrium fractionation process that do not alter d radiation fog isotope compositions should plot on the lmwl aravena et al 1989 gonfiantini and longinelli 1962 kaseke et al 2017 although radiation fog plotted on the lmwl suggesting local moisture origins fig 2a and 2d radiation fog d 0 06 was significantly depleted compared to the lmwl d 3 65 the low radiation d could indicate some level of evaporative enrichment affecting the samples which is supported by the lc excess 0 66 which indicates local meteoric waters as the source of moisture fig 3d in addition fog simulation models suggest that soil moisture from prior precipitation events may be critical for radiation fog formation supplying the much needed moisture for formation kim et al 2020 meanwhile adhikari and wang 2020 demonstrated that vapor fluxes from the soil to atmosphere in hyper arid environments such as the central namib desert is sufficient to support radiation and or mixed fog formation it is important to note that radiation fog samples were collected in june and july 2016 2018 and that precipitation was recorded prior to these events june 2016 april 2017 and may 2018 at the same time kaseke et al 2018 suggests that the relationship between radiation fog isotopes rh and soil temperature could be attributed to a night time soil atmosphere thermal gradient facilitating vapor movement to the atmosphere and subsequent radiative cooling kinetic fractionation during evaporation is enhanced reduced at low high temperatures thus low high soil temperatures result in isotopically depleted enriched vapor transported to the atmosphere when such vapor is condensed it will result in a more depleted enriched radiation fog isotope composition fig 5a and 5d transpiration by ephemeral vegetation could be the main avenue for groundwater transport into the atmosphere leading to groundwater derived radiation fog restricted to and around ephemeral channels kaseke et al 2017 besides the general strong control of vegetation on water cycles wang et al 2014 recent work suggests that night time transpiration en is not only common across species but contributes a significant amount to total transpiration 10 60 in desert species caird et al 2007 dawson et al 2007 snyder and williams 2003 yu et al 2016 zeppel et al 2013 while the reasons and or benefits of this behaviour are not well understood evaporation demand vpd and soil moisture are the main drivers dawson et al 2007 yu et al 2016 zeppel et al 2013 vegetation in the ephemeral kuiseb and swakop rivers is dependent on shallow aquifers burke 2006 which suggests high soil moisture conditions while the leaves will no doubt experience high vpd during none fog hours of the night conditions consistent with high en radiative cooling and condensation of this transpired vapor would thus result in groundwater derived fog with a distinct isotope composition kaseke et al 2017 however admixture with advecting fog or moisture from the atlantic ocean will result in mixed fog with a higher d 4 01 plotting above the lmwl but below the gmwl fig 2a and 2c critical to condensation is radiation cooling of the soil surface creating an inversion layer that results in fog formation from the surface base upwards soil surface temperature was the same or lower than ambient dew point temperature during 67 of the radiation fog events suggesting that soil surface temperature may have contributed to formation and or sustained the fog fig 7b and fig s1 at the same time low cloud bases lcl reflect the importance of radiation cooling for condensation radiation fog while high lcl indicate the dominance of humidification advection fog radiation fog thus had the lowest estimated cloud base lcl while advection fog had the highest lcl and mixed fog was between the two fig 7f while 80 of radiation fog events had cloud bases at ground level for at least 2 hrs during each event lcl suggested 20 did not reach the surface however lcl is only an estimation all samples were technically fogs and does not take into account other factors that could result in condensation at less than ideal conditions 100 rh such as the presence of hygroscopic condensation nuclei and could over estimate cloud base height under such conditions especially during advection fog events fig 7d the inverse relationships between fog isotopes δ18o δ2h and lcl also suggest the importance of radiative cooling in localized fog formation fig 5c and 5f these results suggest two types of radiation fog shallow stable radiation fog isotopically enriched and deep adiabatic fog isotopically depleted shallow stable radiation fogs are formed from radiative cooling in the shallow surface inversion layer and as the fog continues to evolve and thicken fog top cooling is initiated inducing vertical mixing within the fog deep adiabatic fog smith et al 2018 steeneveld and de bode 2018 it is known that some clouds are isotopically stratified showing a decrease in vapor and increased isotope δ18o δ2h depletion with height gedzelman and arnold 1994 lowenthal et al 2016 condensation of this depleted vapor via fog top cooling and its subsequent sinking to the surface coupled to the negative buoyant air would then result in the extremely depleted isotope signatures observed in radiation fog fig 2a and 2d and the associated inverse relationships with lcl fig 5c and 5f although soil moisture in arid environments maybe a limiting factor to sustaining shallow stable radiation fogs kim et al 2020 sufficient moisture i e soil moisture rainfall en and admixture with advected fog moisture shallow stable radiation fog could evolve into deep adiabatic fog characterized by the extremely depleted isotope signatures observed in both radiation and mixed fog and their associated relationships with lcl fig 2a 2c 2d 5c 5f and 6b these extremely depleted isotope signatures are not unique to this study alone but have been reported before in other studies in the area eckardt et al 2013 4 2 mixed fog kaseke et al 2017 suggests mixed fog could be formed in two ways 1 incorporation of locally derived moisture into advecting fog altering the fog isotope composition scholl et al 2011 and 2 radiation cooling of a mixture of locally derived and advecting moisture george 1951 kaseke et al 2012 mixed fog thus takes on characteristics of both sets of moisture and plots between the gmwl and lmwl accounting for the large isotope variability observed for this fog class fig 2a and 2c although the estimated cloud base height for mixed fog was higher than for radiation fog the inverse relationship of lcl with d still suggests that radiation cooling was an important factor that contributed to this fog type mixed fog formation is thus complicated by its dynamism involving multiple processes in a given situation i e advection of fog or moisture coupled with addition of local moisture and radiative cooling baars et al 2003 kaseke et al 2018 schmitt et al 2018 tardif and rasmussen 2007 resulting in isotopic evolution of the fog therefore whereas the fog may visually look like advection fog isotopically it is distinct mixed fog fig 2 4 3 advection fog coastal fog isotope compositions should plot on the gmwl and their composition should be close to sea water aravena et al 1989 majoube 1971 fig 2a and 2b this suggests that this fog may have formed over the ocean sea breeze fog and was transported advected inland advection fog similar findings have been reported elsewhere for example monsoon cloud precipitation advection fog in the southern districts of oman is isotopically similar to sea water and is thought to originate from a single stage evaporation condensation cycle from the arabian sea clark et al 1987 at the same time advection fog d is maintained relatively unchanged even when sampled distances up to 60 km inland kaseke et al 2018 2017 accounting for the high d in advection fog 8 54 0 5 which is similar to the gmwl d 10 fig 3c this enriched advection fog d compared to the lmwl d 3 7 excludes local meteoric waters as possible moisture sources for this fog type fig 2a and 2b in agreement with the lc excess which also indicates a non local water source for this fog type isotope enrichment can be attributed to condensation temperature low high ambient temperatures result in depleted enriched fog isotope compositions relative to ocean water gonfiantini and longinelli 1962 fig 4a and 4c at the same time advection fog advances as a self contained system or blanket of fog hence the correlation with air temperature suggesting this is a reflection of the formation temperature fig 4 however this blanket of fog dissipates if local meteorological conditions cause instability of the system e g higher air and or soil temperature wind speed or turbulence on the other hand low air temperatures and moderate wind could facilitate fog stability extending advection inland baars et al 2003 there was also a positive relationship between advection fog δ18o and δ2h and wind speed fig 4b and 4d this suggests high wind speed may introduce some kinetic fractionation within the fog enriching the liquid phase and causing dissipation of the fog beyond a speed threshold in coastal regions advection fog can form at rh 80 due to the abundance of hygroscopic nuclei sea salt choi et al 1998 fig s2 while radiation fog is generally formed at higher rh 100 due to strong radiative cooling effects hyo 2013 sciocatti 1984 fig s1 relative humidity during fog events was highest during radiation fog 97 3 2 3 and formed at a minimum of 91 2 rh which is more than the minimum threshold established for fog formation for the area 84 kaseke et al 2012 the minimum rh threshold for radiation fog formation 91 2 suggests that hygroscopic nuclei may have catalysed fog formation before optimum conditions were achieved which would account for the 20 radiation fog events which did not reach the earth s surface according to the lcl estimation advection fog on the other hand was detected at much lower rh attributed to the abundance of hygroscopic nuclei and could be extended further inland via radiation cooling of the soil surface 43 of the events fig s2 similarly mixed fog soil surface temperature achieved or went below ambient dew point temperature for 33 of the mixed fog events suggesting that the soil surface sustained the fog as it was transported further inland at the same time average wind speeds during radiation fog were consistent with the optimal low speeds associated with radiation fog tardif and rasmussen 2007 while advection and mixed fog wind speeds were significantly faster fig 7d it has been noted that inland fog observations in the central namib desert lag 2 4 hrs behind coastal sites suggesting an advection fog pattern andersen et al 2018 kaseke et al 2012 however none of the fog samples collected from the station closest to the ocean cmet during the opportunistic samplings were classified as advection fog mixed 88 and radiation 12 a plausible explanation for this observation is that the fog passes over cmet which has the lowest elevation 94 m a s l as a cloud only intersecting land at kb 184 m a s l and 25 km inland onwards so called high fog spirig et al 2019 for example advection fog was collected on the 10th july 2017 at kb sh and vf but not observed at cmet when the cloud is low enough to intersect land at cmet fog it most likely incorporates moisture from the kuiseb delta vegetation transpiration 2 5 km from the ocean 5 15 m a s l area 16 8 km2 and isotopically evolves to mixed fog although visually this might be classified as advection fog fig 8 5 conclusions observations based on different methodologies e g remote sensing and isotope analysis sometimes result in contrasting conclusions on fog origins and fog water sources here we aim to reconcile the isotope based fog classification with meteorological conditions of different fog types reported in literature the associated meteorological conditions rh wind speed and air temperature of advection and radiation fog as defined by isotope classification were consistent with those reported elsewhere isotope based classification showed that radiation fog was formed under high rh low wind speed conditions and could be approximated using lcl meanwhile advection fog was generally formed or detected at lower rh faster wind speeds and dominated by humidification thus lcl overestimated cloud base height at the same time meteorological conditions during mixed fog were between those of radiation and advection fog suggesting that mixed fog was a combination of local and advected moisture however because mixed fog is an admixture of different moistures the isotope composition did not correlate with any of the local meteorological conditions although humidification appeared to be the dominant driver for mixed fog formation high d and lc excess there was some evidence indicating that incorporation of local moisture and radiative cooling were also important fig 6 at the same time lcl and lc excess were useful additional tools that were able to differentiate fog types based on the dominant fog formation process radiative cooling radiation and humidification advection while also identifying the source of moisture local vs advected given the consistency between the isotope based classification and fog type based on meteorological conditions we can conclude that the isotope based fog classification is real and could be applied to other coastal fog dependent regions to understand the complex ecohydrology at the same time we can also conclude that simulations of the effect of climate change on fog dependent ecosystems would be incomplete if locally derived moisture or fog inputs are not taken into account credit authorship contribution statement kudzai farai kaseke conceptualization methodology data curation visualization lixin wang conceptualization methodology

3734,climate change introduces substantial uncertainty in water resources planning and management this is particularly the case for the river systems in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere that are more vulnerable to global change the situation becomes more challenging when there is a limited hydrological understanding of the basin in this study we assessed the impacts of future climate on the hydrology of the saint john river basin sjrb which is an important transboundary coastal river basin in northeastern north america we also additionally performed model benchmarking for the sjrb using four different meteorological forcing datasets using the best performing forcing data and model parameters we studied the water balance of the basin our results show that meteorological forcing data play a pivotal role in model performance and therefore can introduce a large degree of uncertainty in hydrological modelling the analysis of the water balance highlights that runoff and evapotranspiration account for about 99 of the total basin precipitation with each constituting approximately 50 the simulation of future flows projects higher winter discharges but summer flows are estimated to decrease in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods compared to the baseline period 1991 2020 however the evaluation of model errors indicates higher confidence in the result that future winter flows will increase but lower confidence in the results that future summer flows will decrease keywords climate change hydrological modelling model benchmarking water balance saint john river basin 1 introduction the global climate system is warming at an unprecedented rate in recent decades pachauri et al 2014 observations have shown that the global climate system has warmed with an increase in the global mean temperature from 0 57 c to 0 95 c from 1850 1899 to 2001 2005 and is expected to rise between 1 c and 3 5 c by the end of the 20th century solomon et al 2007 the warming climate is contributing to thermal expansion of the ocean resulting in global sea level rise of about 1 7 mm year over the last century bindoff et al 2007 the consequent rise in atmospheric water vapor has led to an increase in precipitation events over north america europe and central asia which has impacted the local hydrological and water resources systems arnell reynard 1996 the river systems in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere are more vulnerable to global change since the northern hemisphere has been warming more on average 1 2 c higher compared to the southern hemisphere feulner et al 2013 this interhemispheric temperature difference has increased in recent decades friedman et al 2013 the canadian climate change report that was released in 2019 provided evidence that canada is severely impacted by changing climate with the most rapid warming occurring in the past two decades bush lemmen 2019 the arctic region which forms more than 40 of canada is warming two to three times faster than the global mean temperature bring et al 2017 the temperature in the interior of canada is already projected to rise ranging from 1 c to more than 5 c by the end of century and the magnitude of precipitation is also expected to increase across most of the canadian provinces stadnyk déry 2021 the atlantic coast of canada or eastern canada however is more susceptible to the impacts of climate change cheng et al 2011 the coast has a long history of climate induced intense storms freezing rain and hurricane events which have caused loss of life and damages to infrastructure and economy thompson et al 2009 the implications of a changing climate for global water resources are diverse the altered temperature and precipitation patterns may modify the timing and magnitude of water availability runoff and also affects both the quantity and quality of water gleick 1989 one of the major consequences of future climate change will be the variation and uncertainties of the hydrological system at regional scales giorgi francisco 2000 climate model scenarios have therefore been adopted as the best available tool for obtaining future scenarios bates et al 2008 kundzewicz et al 2008 in recent years numerous studies have investigated the impact of climate change on hydrology and water resources in many regions around the world e g middelkoop et al 2001 steele dunne et al 2008 crossman et al 2013 lu et al 2013 al mukhtar et al 2014 however all the river basins across the world have not received similar attention the saint john river basin sjrb is an important coastal transboundary river basin in northeastern north america the river originates in northern maine united states and flows through the provinces of quebec and new brunswick in canada the river is of great socio economic and environmental importance kidd et al 2011 however hydrologically the sjrb is a poorly understood river basin in north america only a handful of studies have investigated its hydrology and even fewer have assessed the effect of future climate on the hydrology of the sjrb among the available literature dugdale et al 2018 performed a study on the impacts of climate change on the thermal regime of the lower saint john river and found that the mean water temperature in the river will increase by approximately 2 c by the end of 2099 a comparatively older study by hare et al 1997 estimated that the mean annual temperature in the basin has risen to 1 3 c since 1871 similarly increases in rainfall and snowfall amounts as well as river discharge during the winter and early spring periods were reported by beltaos 2004 to the best of the authors knowledge there are no peer reviewed journal articles on hydrological modelling of the sjrb except few studies that have used simple conceptual models to simulate discharge as a part of water quality modelling hence there are no proper model benchmarks and limited understanding of the past and future hydrology which is a major motivation for carrying out this research this study is also part of the current generation hydrological modelling cghm theme under the core modelling program of the global water futures gwf program https gwf usask ca the gwf is a pan canadian research program that is funded in part by a 77 8 million grant from the canada first research excellence fund one of the major objectives of the cghm theme of the gwf program is to generate climate change production runs hydrological reanalyses as well as scenarios of change for all major river basins in canada including the sjrb therefore the major objectives of this paper are two fold the first objective is to establish a hydrological baseline for water security assessment which includes model benchmarking and analysis of water balance the second objective is to assess the impacts of future climate on the hydrology of the sjrb for appropriate water resources planning and management 2 data and methods 2 1 study site the saint john river basin sjrb is a transboundary coastal river basin located in northeastern north america fig 1 the basin has an area of 55 100 km2 with portions of the basin 36 of basin area in the state of maine in the united states and the rest in the provinces of quebec 13 and new brunswick 51 in canada kidd et al 2011 the saint john river is approximately 708 km in length with headwaters in northern maine the river drains to the bay of fundy at saint john new brunswick the majority of the sjrb has a humid continental climate with the exception being the bay of fundy coast which has a maritime climate the mean annual precipitation is about 1100 mm of which 30 falls as snow beltaos et al 2012 the mean annual discharge is approximately 1100 m3 s with the peak flows in late spring and also a smaller pulse occurring later in the fall due to rainfall the land cover is predominantly comprised of forests 70 with some patches of cropland 6 and wetlands 6 the dominant soil types in the basin are humo ferric podzols and gray luvisols which are forest soils found throughout canada kidd et al 2011 three large run of the river reservoirs are located along the saint john river impounded by three dams grand falls beechwood and mactaquac dugdale et al 2018 due to extreme high tides in the bay of fundy and the low slope of the lower reach of the river the head of the tide reaches past fredericton approx 140 km upstream from the coast kidd et al 2011 there are currently no active hydrometric stations in the main river channel downstream of fredericton due to tidal effects so for this study and modelling purpose the outlet station of the basin was set at the mactaquac dam 18 km upstream of fredericton long lat 66 672 45 951 the reduced basin has a drainage area of approximately 41 000 km2 2 2 mesh model modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology mesh is a semi distributed physically based land model developed by environment canada now known as environment and climate change canada eccc pietroniro et al 2007 wheater et al 2021 mesh represents the hydrological processes with three important components i e i a vertical exchange of water and energy within a grid cell ii the routing of lateral fluxes and iii the generation of surface and sub surface runoff mesh uses the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 for the vertical exchanges of water and energy and generation of lateral fluxes the routing of lateral soil subsurface and surface water movement is performed using watrof soulis et al 2000 and the streamflow is routed through river channels using watroute kouwen 2016 mesh is a flexible land model therefore any of these default modules can also be replaced with another module depending upon the study objective for instance soil vegetation and snow scheme svs husain et al 2016 can be used instead of class or pdmrof mekonnen et al 2014 can be used in place of watrof for prairie basins that have variable contributing areas mesh has been widely used from small e g 8 km2 to very large basins e g 1 8 million km2 across different parts of canada e g mengistu spence 2016 rokaya et al 2019b budhathoki et al 2020 and internationally e g rodriguez prado 2020 we selected mesh for two reasons a its suitability for cold region catchments due to its ability to simulate complex snow processes including snow redistributions and snow melt and b it is one of the models vetted under the gwf program for simulation of scenarios of change 2 3 meteorological forcing data there are various meteorological data sets available for this basin but only a handful meet mesh input requirements mesh requires seven meteorological forcing inputs i e precipitation wind speed air temperature specific humidity barometric pressure and incoming longwave and shortwave radiation at a fine temporal resolution 6 h since the model runs at 30 minute time step among the available datasets four different meteorological datasets were used for the model benchmarking these datasets include global environmental multiscale canadian precipitation analysis gem capa côté et al 1998 mahfouf et al 2007 the new regional deterministic reforecast system reanalysis data rdrs gasset et al 2021 watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim data wfdei weedon et al 2014 and bias corrected wfdei using gem capa wgc asong et al 2020 the record length spatial and temporal resolution of these data and their respective references are provided in table 1 gem capa is an operational product of the canadian meteorological centre gem has a spatial resolution of 10 km and is available at 1 hour intervals capa which assimilates ground observations into gem covers north america on a 10 km grid and is available at 6 hourly and 24 hourly accumulation intervals capa is regarded as one of the best gridded meteorological products for canada boluwade et al 2018 however the data is available only for a comparatively short time period i e 2002 2021 the wfdei dataset has a longer historical record 1979 2016 and wong et al 2017 reported that it performed best for canada in comparison to other long record gridded products that were assessed even though wfdei has a coarser spatial resolution 0 5 the wfdei gem capa wgc is a blended product of wfdei and gem capa which combines their respective strengths and provides a less biased long temporal record the wgc dataset was produced by bias correcting the wfdei dataset against gem capa using a multivariate generalization of the quantile mapping technique by asong et al 2020 the rdrs dataset is a comparatively new product from eccc in which the capa data is further improved for transboundary and northern watersheds gasset et al 2021 it also has higher temporal resolution in comparison to capa relatively few datasets were available for the study area for the simulation of future flows that meet mesh requirements two datasets that were considered for this study are a canadian regional climate model version 4 canrcm4 bias corrected using wfdei canrcm4 wfdei and b canrcm4 bias corrected using wfdei gem capa canrcm4 wgc canrcm4 is a regional climate model rcm from the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis and is available for the period of 1951 2100 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 over the north american domain scinocca et al 2016 although canrcm4 has large ensemble members 50 only 15 representative ensemble members were bias corrected due to computational demand with wgc and wfdei using a multivariate quantile mapping method to produce canrcm4 wgc and canrcm4 wfdei respectively by asong et al 2020 2 4 model setup the hydrologically adjusted elevation of merit hydro yamazaki et al 2019 was used for topographic data merit hydro has a resolution of 3 arc seconds and is freely available from http hydro iis u tokyo ac jp yamadai merit hydro the landcover data were processed from the commission for environmental cooperation cec land cover database in 30 m resolution http www cec org north american environmental atlas land cover 2010 landsat 30m the vegetation parameters were retrieved from literature kidd et al 2011 and the class manual verseghy 2009 whereas the soil texture information was acquired from the unified north american soil map unasm liu et al 2014 for different soil depths the unasm combines information from the us general soil map statsgo2 and soil landscape of canada slcs databases six vertical soil profile layers of thickness 10 cm 35 cm 120 cm 260 cm 310 cm and 410 cm were defined from the surface boundary in mesh the information on soil permeable depth was determined from shangguan et al 2017 where they have provided global bedrock depth for land surface modelling the model was set up with a grid resolution of 0 125 deg approx 10 km resulting in 373 grid cells nine grouped response units grus were created based on the landcover and soil data the preprocessing of the drainage database was conducted using eccc s green kenue software canadian hydraulics centre 2010 to generate drainage networks and other topography driven watershed characteristics such as slope and channel length the discharge data for canadian portion were obtained from the water survey of canada wsc hydrometric data hydat database and for the us portion the data were retrieved from the national water information system usgs webpage several reservoirs are located in the main stem but they all are run of the river reservoirs a comparison of reservoir inflows and outflows 2000 2020 showed no discernable changes in the hydrograph r2 0 98 see fig 2 so the reservoir routine was not used the reservoir inflow and outflow data were provided by new brunswick power that operates these reservoirs 2 5 model calibration and validation for model benchmarking mesh model was separately calibrated using all four meteorological forcing data i e gem capa wfdei wfdei gem capa and rdrs described in section 2 2 the calibration period and the parameters including initial value and lower and upper value bounds were kept consistent across all models for standardized comparison the calibrated mesh parameters along with their lower and upper value ranges are provided in table 2 the list of parameters for calibration were selected based on the sensitivity analyses of the mesh model by haghnegahdar et al 2017 the degree of agreement between simulated and observed outputs were measured using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse function nash sutcliffe 1970 for the peak flows and logarithmic of nse nselog for low flows various studies e g tekleab et al 2011 peña arancibia et al 2015 chilkoti et al 2018 have combined these two objective functions to improve the overall model performance ostrich optimization software toolkit for research involving computational heuristics matott 2005 a model independent and a multi algorithm optimization program was used for calibration within ostrich parallel pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search parapadds tolson et al 2014 a multi objective optimization algorithm was implemented the parapadds algorithm is an improved parallel version of the global optimization algorithm dynamically dimensioned search dds developed by tolson and shoemaker 2007 the multi objective optimization algorithm balances the conflicting objective functions and provides a best trade off solution also know as pareto optimal or non dominated solutions kollat et al 2012 sahraei et al 2020 this algorithm in ostrich has been successfully applied to several previous hydrological and water management modelling studies e g rokaya et al 2019a behrouz et al 2020 there are several hydrometric stations in the sjrb the gauging station at grand falls 01af002 is the most downstream unregulated station drainage area 21 900 km2 whereas the outlet of the basin in this study was delineated at the mactaquac station lat 45 95 and long 66 86 drainage area 41 000 km2 see fig 1 for their locations in the basin since our focus was to perform catchment scale model benchmarking as well as assess hydrological conditions under future climate for the entire catchment we selected mactaquac station for model calibration and validation with additional calibration and validation at grand falls station a total of 15 000 model iterations were performed for each model calibration a snow free period october 2002 was used to start the simulation and the model was calibrated from 2002 to 2010 the period between october 2002 to october 2003 was considered a spin up period the validation was performed using the subsequent six years i e 2011 2016 we also performed additional spatial validation of model results in six other hydrometric stations three in canada and three in united states that were not used in initial calibration and validation 2 6 derivation of future flow two meteorological forcing datasets i e canrcm4 wfdei and canrcm4 wgc were considered for assessment of hydrological conditions under a future climate however the examination of model performance for the historical period showed that wgc significantly outperforms wfdei in the sjrb details in section 3 1 1 therefore to save computation resources and time canrcm4 data bias corrected by wgc canrcm4 wgc was used to derive the baseline 1991 2020 and future 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 hydrological conditions but the simulation results from canrcm4 wgc were also not perfect for the baseline period which is expected due to uncertainty related to forcing data model structure and parameters hence the delta change method δ also known as change factor method hay et al 2000 was used to bias correct simulated future streamflows in this approach delta is calculated using the difference between model simulated future period and model simulated baseline period see also equation i the delta is then added to the historical observed data to obtain estimated future data see equation ii the relative delta change method was preferred over the absolute delta change method since it is a simple and robust method that avoids arriving to negative streamflow values hawkins et al 2013 the delta change method is usually applied to bias correct future meteorological input data e g hawkins et al 2013 navarro racines

estimates all hydrological modelling results are inherently subject to different degrees of uncertainty which may arise from errors in meteorological forcing data model structure inadequacy or parameter equifinalty mockler et al 2016 using ensembles to characterize uncertainty is a common approach in hydrological modelling in this study we used 15 ensemble members of canrcm4 wgc and we ended up with 93 optimal parameter sets more details in section 3 1 1 however it is important to acknowledge that in some aspects of the modelling steps it may not be possible to provide statistically reliable estimates of uncertainty for instance available climate models may not represent the true uncertainties in the system e g the unknowns associated with climate system feedbacks clark et al 2016 similarly when an ensemble approach is used it is possible that some model runs show better performance than others therefore including all model runs not only increases computational time and resources but can also artificially inflate the uncertainty hence in this study we included only the best 10 performing parameter sets with 15 canrcm4 wgc ensemble members resulting in an ensemble of 150 future hydrological conditions by using ensembles of forcing data and ten optimal model parameters we were able to partly address forcing data and parameter uncertainty however uncertainty in observed data and model structure were out of scope for this study we further compared climate change signal against the known model error to determine the confidence in our result for an example the evaluation of model performance in the baseline period shows that a model has a 10 error in a x month now if the difference in flows between the baseline and future periods climate change signal for the x month is only 5 we assign low confidence to the result since modelling error is larger than climate change signal in contrast if climate change signal shows 30 change for the x month then we assign some confidence to the result since modelling error is smaller compared to climate change signal 3 results and discussion 3 1 model benchmarking despite being one of the major river basins in canada the sjrb is hydrologically poorly understood in fact a literature review yielded only a handful of studies and only one of them reported on water balance components although only for the new brunswick portion potential future impacts on hydrology in the basin is a major concern but to understand future climate changes in the basin it is important to establish some baseline conditions in this study we first performed model assessment to identify suitable forcing datasets and then studied the water balance components using the best performing model setup 3 1 1 model assessment the multi objective calibration using three objective functions i e nse and nselog at grand falls and nse at mactaquac station generated 210 98 159 and 93 pareto optimal solutions using the forcing inputs gem capa wfdei wgc and rdrs respectively out of these pareto optimal solutions best 10 performing solutions were selected based on their realtive performances on all objective functions but also based on additional validation i e their performance at other six stations few optimal solutions were selected to save large computational time and resources and narrow the ensemble bounds the mean nse and nselog of the 10 optimal parameters for calibration and validation at mactaquac station basin outlet using different forcing datasets are reported in table 3 different forcing inputs yielded different nse and nselog values despite using the same standard approach for calibration i e the same parameters initial values and range of values rdrs showed the best performance in terms of both objective functions for both calibration and validation periods gem capa and wgc which is bias corrected using gem capa showed comparable results wfdei metrics were the lowest among the compared forcing datasets the rdrs derived ensemble of 10 simulated streamflows compared against observed flows at mactaquac is shown in fig 3 b since all 10 parameter sets were the optimal performing parameter sets the spread of the ensemble is thin and difficult to discern visually mean nse and nselog values of 0 84 and 0 77 respectively were obtained for the calibration period 2003 2010 whereas a mean nse value of 0 77 and a mean nselog value of 0 75 were achieved for the validation period 2011 2016 the secondary validation at the gauging station at grand falls 01af002 which is unregulated and upstream of mactaquac revealed even better results with the rdrs forcing data see fig 3 a the calibration period resulted in a mean nse of 0 90 and mean nselog of 0 89 whereas for the validation period a mean nse of 0 85 and mean nselog of 0 88 were obtained additional spatial validations were also performed at six other stations three in us and three in canada that were not used in calibration and validation the model performance in these six sites showed reasonable predictive ability for the calibration period 2003 2010 the nse values ranged from 0 69 to 0 87 average 0 8 and nselog from 0 61 to 0 87 average 0 76 using rdrs data similarly for the validation period an average nse of 0 78 range 0 65 0 86 and an average nselog of 0 71 0 55 0 89 were achieved these results highlight the predictive capability of the mesh model an earlier evaluation of mesh by rokaya et al 2020 also showed that it can reasonably replicate most 28 out of 33 hydro ecological indicators such as monthly flows 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day maxima and minima recent advances in model development include improvements in many cold region processes such as blowing snow transport and sublimation infiltration in frozen ground and representation of glaciers and permafrost new algorithms have also been added for multi stage reservoir operation lateral land surface flow and representation of prairie pothole storage dynamics these advances over the last decade have been summarized by wheater et al 2021 however there are still some areas for improvement although the model includes lateral fluxes representation of groundwater and wetland processes can be further improved similarly representation of changing landscapes such as glacier geometry topography hydrological connectivity and vegetation is an active area of study 3 1 2 water balance of the saint john river basin since rdrs data showed superior performance during model calibration and validation we used results generated from rdrs data to perform a preliminary water balance of the sjrb note that in addition to comparing hydrological modelling results we also compared the precipitation and temperature data from all four forcing datasets used in this study to observed data from a climate station in edmundston climate id 8101303 located upstream of grand falls in the basin and found rdrs to be the closest to observed data not shown here although the spatial resolution of station data point and gridded data grid do not quite coincide it still provides some reasonable comparative estimate however the better correspondence of rdrs and capa with station data could be due to the fact that these products assimilate station data the partitioning of precipitation into runoff evapotranspiration and changes in storage is shown in fig 4 based on the 13 years of simulated data the average precipitation in the basin is about 1218 mm per year of which approximately 30 fall as solid precipitation snow and the rest 70 as liquid precipitation rain runoff and evapotranspiration account for about 99 of total precipitation with each showing almost equal proportions 605 mm runoff and 609 mm of evapotranspiration of the total runoff interflow is the largest component i e 74 33 followed by ground water 16 03 and overland flow accounts for the remaining portion 9 63 changes in subsurface storage varied across the years but was negligible compared to runoff and evapotranspiration we were not able to find any other studies that have performed a similar water balance assessment for the entire sjrb for any meaningful comparison however hulsman 2002 did an assessment of the new brunswick portion of the basin using surfer mapping software he reported that 40 of the precipitation returned to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration and 60 was runoff however he notes that his results may not be representative of the entire basin and his method of runoff mapping may be progressively less accurate as calculations are advanced downstream 3 2 simulation of future hydrological conditions 3 2 1 simulation of baseline conditions although rdrs performed the best in the model assessment it was not considered for estimation of future flows since rdrs is recently released data and rdrs bias corrected global circulation model regional climate model gcm rcm data were not available two datasets canrcm4 bias corrected using wfdei canrcm4 wfdei and canrcm4 bias corrected by wfdei gem capa canrcm4 wgc were considered for simulation of future flows however our assessment showed that wgc outperforms wfdei in the sjrb basin in terms of model performance see table 3 furthermore canrcm4 wgc was available at higher spatial resolution 0 125 compared to canrcm4 wfdei 0 44 therefore canrcm4 wgc was preferred for derivation of future flows a common practice in hydrological modelling is to assess the model performance for a baseline period before deriving future streamflows shrestha et al 2016 this is essential for two reasons first to determine if bias corrected gcm rcm data can capture the climatology of the historical period beyond calibration validation period second to establish a baseline scenario to which changes in future flows can be compared since model simulated baseline and model simulated future flows are both subject to same sources of uncertainty this offers a more standardized comparison than comparing against historical observed flows that are not prone to the same modelling uncertainties rokaya et al 2020 a total of 150 simulations 15 canrcm4 wgc ensembles 10 optimal parameter sets were generated for both grand fall and mactaquac stations and compared against the observed flows see fig 5 a total of 30 year runs was evaluated for grand falls i e 1991 2020 and a total of 20 years period i e 2000 2020 was assessed for the mactaquac station observed data before that period was not available for mactaquac the results are satisfactory but show two distinct differences first the interquartile variability is less in simulated flows compared to the observed flows second the model is unable to capture peak spring flows of april and may these baseline results warranted an explanation on the sources of modelling error particularly on the underestimation of spring flows we first evaluated the model generated hydrographs for the calibration and validation periods the results show that although the model produced reasonable performance metrics during calibration validation using wgc as forcing data i e 0 71 nse at daily scale the monthly flows for spring are largely underestimated see fig 6 a and 6b at both grand falls and mactaquac stations on the other hand the monthly peaks are captured better by rdrs data see fig 6 c and 6d which reveals that the errors are stemming mainly from the forcing data this emphasizes the fact that evaluating model performance solely based on performance metrics which is a common practice in hydrological modelling may be misleading the average nse values for the calibration and validation periods using rdrs is only 12 more than that of wgc at the grand falls station but rdrs captures peak spring flows significantly better than wgc see fig 6 c and 6d 3 2 2 projected streamflow under a future climate an ensemble of 150 streamflows were generated for two future reference periods i e 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 using canrcm4 wgc a delta change method as described in section 2 6 was used to generate the estimated future flows the results show that winter flows between december to march will increase in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods compared to the baseline 1991 2020 period for grand falls and 2000 2020 period for mactaquac see fig 7 a and 7b in contrast spring and summer flows are projected to decline between april and july in both future periods compared to the baseline period the largest increases were observed in march for both grand falls 191 in the 2041 2070 and 355 in 2071 2100 periods and mactaquac 141 in the 2041 2070 and 246 in 2071 2100 periods compared to the baseline period in contrast the largest decreases were observed in may at both locations grand falls showed a decline of 49 and 56 respectively for the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods whereas mactaquac revealed a decline of 43 and 51 for the same periods the rest of the months showed only minor discrepancies a climate change impact report by natural resources canada 2007 indicates that by 2050 there will be less summer discharge in the sjrb compared to the historical period which is in line with what was found in this study kidd et al 2011 reported that the higher evapotranspiration rate that can offset the potential increases in precipitation and reduced snowpack are the major causes for these declines in summer flows in this study we also found that the average evapotranspiration will increase by 7 9 and 14 5 over summer june august in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 period respectively compared to the 1991 2020 period for the winter period we attribute the increase in streamflow to increased precipitation and increased temperature our analysis of meteorological data shows that winter precipitation december february is on an average 13 and 27 higher in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 period respectively compared to the 1991 2020 period whereas the average temperature for winter month shows an increase of 4 c and 6 2 c in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 period respectively 3 2 3 confidence assessment on future streamflow in earlier sections we have discussed in detail about model uncertainty and in fact highlighted the errors in our own modelling results of the simulated baseline conditions as well as offered some diagnostics on the sources of those errors therefore it is important to critically reflect on uncertainty in our future flow estimates we used the method described in section 2 7 to assess how reliable the estimates of future flows are by comparing model error versus projected changes in streamflow if the climate change signal largely outweighs model error then we can be confident that climatic effects will be prevalent despite modelling errors and vice versa the results show that the percentage of changes in future streamflows between december and march significantly outweighs the model error in those months for the baseline period therefore we can be confident in our projection that the future winter flows will increase see fig 8 in contrast modelling error exceeds or is equivalent to the changes in streamflow for both future periods between april and november period therefore there is less confidence on our result that summer flows will decline additions of these confidence bands in results help us to understand the robustness of our results as well as acknowledge the uncertainty modelling errors 4 concluding summary the sjrb is an important transboundary coastal river basin in eastern north america with socio economic and environmental significance however hydrologically the basin is poorly understood in this study we evaluated four different meteorological datasets to identify the best performing forcing data for hydrological modelling of the sjrb our assessment showed that rdrs significantly outperforms gem capa wfdei and wgc however it was also revealed that the evaluation of model performance based solely on performance metrics such as nse or nselog could be misleading thus a closer look at climatology is also required the results also highlight the significance of meteorological forcing data on model performance we showed that they can be a source of large uncertainty however resolving forcing data issues is particularly challenging in transboundary basins such as the sjrb where observed data needs to be harmonized across national jurisdictions furthermore limited data availability also hinders scientific advances although we found rdrs to be the best performing forcing data rdrs bias corrected gcm rcm data were not available at the time of this study a data set which may have reduced the modelling errors and increased the confidence in our results for future studies in the sjrb we suggest an application of gcm rcm data bias corrected using rdrs we also investigated the water balance of the basin to understand the partitioning of the precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff our results show that evaporation and runoff account for about 50 each in the basin the estimation of future flows using canrcm4 wgc dataset revealed that winter flows will increase but summer flows will decrease in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods compared to the baseline period of 1991 2020 under rcp 8 5 scenario however evaluation of model errors indicated higher confidence in the result that winter flows will increase but lower or no confidence in the result that summer flows will decrease these findings provide valuable information

3734,climate change introduces substantial uncertainty in water resources planning and management this is particularly the case for the river systems in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere that are more vulnerable to global change the situation becomes more challenging when there is a limited hydrological understanding of the basin in this study we assessed the impacts of future climate on the hydrology of the saint john river basin sjrb which is an important transboundary coastal river basin in northeastern north america we also additionally performed model benchmarking for the sjrb using four different meteorological forcing datasets using the best performing forcing data and model parameters we studied the water balance of the basin our results show that meteorological forcing data play a pivotal role in model performance and therefore can introduce a large degree of uncertainty in hydrological modelling the analysis of the water balance highlights that runoff and evapotranspiration account for about 99 of the total basin precipitation with each constituting approximately 50 the simulation of future flows projects higher winter discharges but summer flows are estimated to decrease in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods compared to the baseline period 1991 2020 however the evaluation of model errors indicates higher confidence in the result that future winter flows will increase but lower confidence in the results that future summer flows will decrease keywords climate change hydrological modelling model benchmarking water balance saint john river basin 1 introduction the global climate system is warming at an unprecedented rate in recent decades pachauri et al 2014 observations have shown that the global climate system has warmed with an increase in the global mean temperature from 0 57 c to 0 95 c from 1850 1899 to 2001 2005 and is expected to rise between 1 c and 3 5 c by the end of the 20th century solomon et al 2007 the warming climate is contributing to thermal expansion of the ocean resulting in global sea level rise of about 1 7 mm year over the last century bindoff et al 2007 the consequent rise in atmospheric water vapor has led to an increase in precipitation events over north america europe and central asia which has impacted the local hydrological and water resources systems arnell reynard 1996 the river systems in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere are more vulnerable to global change since the northern hemisphere has been warming more on average 1 2 c higher compared to the southern hemisphere feulner et al 2013 this interhemispheric temperature difference has increased in recent decades friedman et al 2013 the canadian climate change report that was released in 2019 provided evidence that canada is severely impacted by changing climate with the most rapid warming occurring in the past two decades bush lemmen 2019 the arctic region which forms more than 40 of canada is warming two to three times faster than the global mean temperature bring et al 2017 the temperature in the interior of canada is already projected to rise ranging from 1 c to more than 5 c by the end of century and the magnitude of precipitation is also expected to increase across most of the canadian provinces stadnyk déry 2021 the atlantic coast of canada or eastern canada however is more susceptible to the impacts of climate change cheng et al 2011 the coast has a long history of climate induced intense storms freezing rain and hurricane events which have caused loss of life and damages to infrastructure and economy thompson et al 2009 the implications of a changing climate for global water resources are diverse the altered temperature and precipitation patterns may modify the timing and magnitude of water availability runoff and also affects both the quantity and quality of water gleick 1989 one of the major consequences of future climate change will be the variation and uncertainties of the hydrological system at regional scales giorgi francisco 2000 climate model scenarios have therefore been adopted as the best available tool for obtaining future scenarios bates et al 2008 kundzewicz et al 2008 in recent years numerous studies have investigated the impact of climate change on hydrology and water resources in many regions around the world e g middelkoop et al 2001 steele dunne et al 2008 crossman et al 2013 lu et al 2013 al mukhtar et al 2014 however all the river basins across the world have not received similar attention the saint john river basin sjrb is an important coastal transboundary river basin in northeastern north america the river originates in northern maine united states and flows through the provinces of quebec and new brunswick in canada the river is of great socio economic and environmental importance kidd et al 2011 however hydrologically the sjrb is a poorly understood river basin in north america only a handful of studies have investigated its hydrology and even fewer have assessed the effect of future climate on the hydrology of the sjrb among the available literature dugdale et al 2018 performed a study on the impacts of climate change on the thermal regime of the lower saint john river and found that the mean water temperature in the river will increase by approximately 2 c by the end of 2099 a comparatively older study by hare et al 1997 estimated that the mean annual temperature in the basin has risen to 1 3 c since 1871 similarly increases in rainfall and snowfall amounts as well as river discharge during the winter and early spring periods were reported by beltaos 2004 to the best of the authors knowledge there are no peer reviewed journal articles on hydrological modelling of the sjrb except few studies that have used simple conceptual models to simulate discharge as a part of water quality modelling hence there are no proper model benchmarks and limited understanding of the past and future hydrology which is a major motivation for carrying out this research this study is also part of the current generation hydrological modelling cghm theme under the core modelling program of the global water futures gwf program https gwf usask ca the gwf is a pan canadian research program that is funded in part by a 77 8 million grant from the canada first research excellence fund one of the major objectives of the cghm theme of the gwf program is to generate climate change production runs hydrological reanalyses as well as scenarios of change for all major river basins in canada including the sjrb therefore the major objectives of this paper are two fold the first objective is to establish a hydrological baseline for water security assessment which includes model benchmarking and analysis of water balance the second objective is to assess the impacts of future climate on the hydrology of the sjrb for appropriate water resources planning and management 2 data and methods 2 1 study site the saint john river basin sjrb is a transboundary coastal river basin located in northeastern north america fig 1 the basin has an area of 55 100 km2 with portions of the basin 36 of basin area in the state of maine in the united states and the rest in the provinces of quebec 13 and new brunswick 51 in canada kidd et al 2011 the saint john river is approximately 708 km in length with headwaters in northern maine the river drains to the bay of fundy at saint john new brunswick the majority of the sjrb has a humid continental climate with the exception being the bay of fundy coast which has a maritime climate the mean annual precipitation is about 1100 mm of which 30 falls as snow beltaos et al 2012 the mean annual discharge is approximately 1100 m3 s with the peak flows in late spring and also a smaller pulse occurring later in the fall due to rainfall the land cover is predominantly comprised of forests 70 with some patches of cropland 6 and wetlands 6 the dominant soil types in the basin are humo ferric podzols and gray luvisols which are forest soils found throughout canada kidd et al 2011 three large run of the river reservoirs are located along the saint john river impounded by three dams grand falls beechwood and mactaquac dugdale et al 2018 due to extreme high tides in the bay of fundy and the low slope of the lower reach of the river the head of the tide reaches past fredericton approx 140 km upstream from the coast kidd et al 2011 there are currently no active hydrometric stations in the main river channel downstream of fredericton due to tidal effects so for this study and modelling purpose the outlet station of the basin was set at the mactaquac dam 18 km upstream of fredericton long lat 66 672 45 951 the reduced basin has a drainage area of approximately 41 000 km2 2 2 mesh model modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology mesh is a semi distributed physically based land model developed by environment canada now known as environment and climate change canada eccc pietroniro et al 2007 wheater et al 2021 mesh represents the hydrological processes with three important components i e i a vertical exchange of water and energy within a grid cell ii the routing of lateral fluxes and iii the generation of surface and sub surface runoff mesh uses the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 for the vertical exchanges of water and energy and generation of lateral fluxes the routing of lateral soil subsurface and surface water movement is performed using watrof soulis et al 2000 and the streamflow is routed through river channels using watroute kouwen 2016 mesh is a flexible land model therefore any of these default modules can also be replaced with another module depending upon the study objective for instance soil vegetation and snow scheme svs husain et al 2016 can be used instead of class or pdmrof mekonnen et al 2014 can be used in place of watrof for prairie basins that have variable contributing areas mesh has been widely used from small e g 8 km2 to very large basins e g 1 8 million km2 across different parts of canada e g mengistu spence 2016 rokaya et al 2019b budhathoki et al 2020 and internationally e g rodriguez prado 2020 we selected mesh for two reasons a its suitability for cold region catchments due to its ability to simulate complex snow processes including snow redistributions and snow melt and b it is one of the models vetted under the gwf program for simulation of scenarios of change 2 3 meteorological forcing data there are various meteorological data sets available for this basin but only a handful meet mesh input requirements mesh requires seven meteorological forcing inputs i e precipitation wind speed air temperature specific humidity barometric pressure and incoming longwave and shortwave radiation at a fine temporal resolution 6 h since the model runs at 30 minute time step among the available datasets four different meteorological datasets were used for the model benchmarking these datasets include global environmental multiscale canadian precipitation analysis gem capa côté et al 1998 mahfouf et al 2007 the new regional deterministic reforecast system reanalysis data rdrs gasset et al 2021 watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim data wfdei weedon et al 2014 and bias corrected wfdei using gem capa wgc asong et al 2020 the record length spatial and temporal resolution of these data and their respective references are provided in table 1 gem capa is an operational product of the canadian meteorological centre gem has a spatial resolution of 10 km and is available at 1 hour intervals capa which assimilates ground observations into gem covers north america on a 10 km grid and is available at 6 hourly and 24 hourly accumulation intervals capa is regarded as one of the best gridded meteorological products for canada boluwade et al 2018 however the data is available only for a comparatively short time period i e 2002 2021 the wfdei dataset has a longer historical record 1979 2016 and wong et al 2017 reported that it performed best for canada in comparison to other long record gridded products that were assessed even though wfdei has a coarser spatial resolution 0 5 the wfdei gem capa wgc is a blended product of wfdei and gem capa which combines their respective strengths and provides a less biased long temporal record the wgc dataset was produced by bias correcting the wfdei dataset against gem capa using a multivariate generalization of the quantile mapping technique by asong et al 2020 the rdrs dataset is a comparatively new product from eccc in which the capa data is further improved for transboundary and northern watersheds gasset et al 2021 it also has higher temporal resolution in comparison to capa relatively few datasets were available for the study area for the simulation of future flows that meet mesh requirements two datasets that were considered for this study are a canadian regional climate model version 4 canrcm4 bias corrected using wfdei canrcm4 wfdei and b canrcm4 bias corrected using wfdei gem capa canrcm4 wgc canrcm4 is a regional climate model rcm from the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis and is available for the period of 1951 2100 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 over the north american domain scinocca et al 2016 although canrcm4 has large ensemble members 50 only 15 representative ensemble members were bias corrected due to computational demand with wgc and wfdei using a multivariate quantile mapping method to produce canrcm4 wgc and canrcm4 wfdei respectively by asong et al 2020 2 4 model setup the hydrologically adjusted elevation of merit hydro yamazaki et al 2019 was used for topographic data merit hydro has a resolution of 3 arc seconds and is freely available from http hydro iis u tokyo ac jp yamadai merit hydro the landcover data were processed from the commission for environmental cooperation cec land cover database in 30 m resolution http www cec org north american environmental atlas land cover 2010 landsat 30m the vegetation parameters were retrieved from literature kidd et al 2011 and the class manual verseghy 2009 whereas the soil texture information was acquired from the unified north american soil map unasm liu et al 2014 for different soil depths the unasm combines information from the us general soil map statsgo2 and soil landscape of canada slcs databases six vertical soil profile layers of thickness 10 cm 35 cm 120 cm 260 cm 310 cm and 410 cm were defined from the surface boundary in mesh the information on soil permeable depth was determined from shangguan et al 2017 where they have provided global bedrock depth for land surface modelling the model was set up with a grid resolution of 0 125 deg approx 10 km resulting in 373 grid cells nine grouped response units grus were created based on the landcover and soil data the preprocessing of the drainage database was conducted using eccc s green kenue software canadian hydraulics centre 2010 to generate drainage networks and other topography driven watershed characteristics such as slope and channel length the discharge data for canadian portion were obtained from the water survey of canada wsc hydrometric data hydat database and for the us portion the data were retrieved from the national water information system usgs webpage several reservoirs are located in the main stem but they all are run of the river reservoirs a comparison of reservoir inflows and outflows 2000 2020 showed no discernable changes in the hydrograph r2 0 98 see fig 2 so the reservoir routine was not used the reservoir inflow and outflow data were provided by new brunswick power that operates these reservoirs 2 5 model calibration and validation for model benchmarking mesh model was separately calibrated using all four meteorological forcing data i e gem capa wfdei wfdei gem capa and rdrs described in section 2 2 the calibration period and the parameters including initial value and lower and upper value bounds were kept consistent across all models for standardized comparison the calibrated mesh parameters along with their lower and upper value ranges are provided in table 2 the list of parameters for calibration were selected based on the sensitivity analyses of the mesh model by haghnegahdar et al 2017 the degree of agreement between simulated and observed outputs were measured using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse function nash sutcliffe 1970 for the peak flows and logarithmic of nse nselog for low flows various studies e g tekleab et al 2011 peña arancibia et al 2015 chilkoti et al 2018 have combined these two

stations in the sjrb the gauging station at grand falls 01af002 is the most downstream unregulated station drainage area 21 900 km2 whereas the outlet of the basin in this study was delineated at the mactaquac station lat 45 95 and long 66 86 drainage area 41 000 km2 see fig 1 for their locations in the basin since our focus was to perform catchment scale model benchmarking as well as assess hydrological conditions under future climate for the entire catchment we selected mactaquac station for model calibration and validation with additional calibration and validation at grand falls station a total of 15 000 model iterations were performed for each model calibration a snow free period october 2002 was used to start the simulation and the model was calibrated from 2002 to 2010 the period between october 2002 to october 2003 was considered a spin up period the validation was performed using the subsequent six years i e 2011 2016 we also performed additional spatial validation of model results in six other hydrometric stations three in canada and three in united states that were not used in initial calibration and validation 2 6 derivation of future flow two meteorological forcing datasets i e canrcm4 wfdei and canrcm4 wgc were considered for assessment of hydrological conditions under a future climate however the examination of model performance for the historical period showed that wgc significantly outperforms wfdei in the sjrb details in section 3 1 1 therefore to save computation resources and time canrcm4 data bias corrected by wgc canrcm4 wgc was used to derive the baseline 1991 2020 and future 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 hydrological conditions but the simulation results from canrcm4 wgc were also not perfect for the baseline period which is expected due to uncertainty related to forcing data model structure and parameters hence the delta change method δ also known as change factor method hay et al 2000 was used to bias correct simulated future streamflows in this approach delta is calculated using the difference between model simulated future period and model simulated baseline period see also equation i the delta is then added to the historical observed data to obtain estimated future data see equation ii the relative delta change method was preferred over the absolute delta change method since it is a simple and robust method that avoids arriving to negative streamflow values hawkins et al 2013 the delta change method is usually applied to bias correct future meteorological input data e g hawkins et al 2013 navarro racines et al 2020 but since our meteorological forcing data were already bias corrected using the multivariable quantile mapping method we applied it for post processing of simulated flows in this study the delta is defined as the difference between the models s simulated 30 year monthly mean of streamflow in the future and the historical period i δ s i m u l a t e d f u t u r e f l o w s s i m u l a t e

estimates all hydrological modelling results are inherently subject to different degrees of uncertainty which may arise from errors in meteorological forcing data model structure inadequacy or parameter equifinalty mockler et al 2016 using ensembles to characterize uncertainty is a common approach in hydrological modelling in this study we used 15 ensemble members of canrcm4 wgc and we ended up with 93 optimal parameter sets more details in section 3 1 1 however it is important to acknowledge that in some aspects of the modelling steps it may not be possible to provide statistically reliable estimates of uncertainty for instance available climate models may not represent the true uncertainties in the system e g the unknowns associated with climate system feedbacks clark et al 2016 similarly when an ensemble approach is used it is possible that some model runs show better performance than others therefore including all model runs not only increases computational time and resources but can also artificially inflate the uncertainty hence in this study we included only the best 10 performing parameter sets with 15 canrcm4 wgc ensemble members resulting in an ensemble of 150 future hydrological conditions by using ensembles of forcing data and ten optimal model parameters we were able to partly address forcing data and parameter uncertainty however uncertainty in observed data and model structure were out of scope for this study we further compared climate change signal against the known model error to determine the confidence in our result for an example the evaluation of model performance in the baseline period shows that a model has a 10 error in a x month now if the difference in flows between the baseline and future periods climate change signal for the x month is only 5 we assign low confidence to the result since modelling error is larger than climate change signal in contrast if climate change signal shows 30 change for the x month then we assign some confidence to the result since modelling error is smaller compared to climate change signal 3 results and discussion 3 1 model benchmarking despite being one of the major river basins in canada the sjrb is hydrologically poorly understood in fact a literature review yielded only a handful of studies and only one of them reported on water balance components although only for the new brunswick portion potential future impacts on hydrology in the basin is a major concern but to understand future climate changes in the basin it is important to establish some baseline conditions in this study we first performed model assessment to identify suitable forcing datasets and then studied the water balance components using the best performing model setup 3 1 1 model assessment the multi objective calibration using three objective functions i e nse and nselog at grand falls and nse at mactaquac station generated 210 98 159 and 93 pareto optimal solutions using the forcing inputs gem capa wfdei wgc and rdrs respectively out of these pareto optimal solutions best 10 performing solutions were selected based on their realtive performances on all objective functions but also based on additional validation i e their performance at other six stations few optimal solutions were selected to save large computational time and resources and narrow the ensemble bounds the mean nse and nselog of the 10 optimal parameters for calibration and validation at mactaquac station basin outlet using different forcing datasets are reported in table 3 different forcing inputs yielded different nse and nselog values despite using the same standard approach for calibration i e the same parameters initial values and range of values rdrs showed the best performance in terms of both objective functions for both calibration and validation periods gem capa and wgc which is bias corrected using gem capa showed comparable results wfdei metrics were the lowest among the compared forcing datasets the rdrs derived ensemble of 10 simulated streamflows compared against observed flows at mactaquac is shown in fig 3 b since all 10 parameter sets were the optimal performing parameter sets the spread of the ensemble is thin and difficult to discern visually mean nse and nselog values of 0 84 and 0 77 respectively were obtained for the calibration period 2003 2010 whereas a mean nse value of 0 77 and a mean nselog value of 0 75 were achieved for the validation period 2011 2016 the secondary validation at the gauging station at grand falls 01af002 which is unregulated and upstream of mactaquac revealed even better results with the rdrs forcing data see fig 3 a the calibration period resulted in a mean nse of 0 90 and mean nselog of 0 89 whereas for the validation period a mean nse of 0 85 and mean nselog of 0 88 were obtained additional spatial validations were also performed at six other stations three in us and three in canada that were not used in calibration and validation the model performance in these six sites showed reasonable predictive ability for the calibration period 2003 2010 the nse values ranged from 0 69 to 0 87 average 0 8 and nselog from 0 61 to 0 87 average 0 76 using rdrs data similarly for the validation period an average nse of 0 78 range 0 65 0 86 and an average nselog of 0 71 0 55 0 89 were achieved these results highlight the predictive capability of the mesh model an earlier evaluation of mesh by rokaya et al 2020 also showed that it can reasonably replicate most 28 out of 33 hydro ecological indicators such as monthly flows 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day maxima and minima recent advances in model development include improvements in many cold region processes such as blowing snow transport and sublimation infiltration in frozen ground and representation of glaciers and permafrost new algorithms have also been added for multi stage reservoir operation lateral land surface flow and representation of prairie pothole storage dynamics these advances over the last decade have been summarized by wheater et al 2021 however there are still some areas for improvement although the model includes lateral fluxes representation of groundwater and wetland processes can be further improved similarly representation of changing landscapes such as glacier geometry topography hydrological connectivity and vegetation is an active area of study 3 1 2 water balance of the saint john river basin since rdrs data showed superior performance during model calibration and validation we used results generated from rdrs data to perform a preliminary water balance of the sjrb note that in addition to comparing hydrological modelling results we also compared the precipitation and temperature data from all four forcing datasets used in this study to observed data from a climate station in edmundston climate id 8101303 located upstream of grand falls in the basin and found rdrs to be the closest to observed data not shown here although the spatial resolution of station data point and gridded data grid do not quite coincide it still provides some reasonable comparative estimate however the better correspondence of rdrs and capa with station data could be due to the fact that these products assimilate station data the partitioning of precipitation into runoff evapotranspiration and changes in storage is shown in fig 4 based on the 13 years of simulated data the average precipitation in the basin is about 1218 mm per year of which approximately 30 fall as solid precipitation snow and the rest 70 as liquid precipitation rain runoff and evapotranspiration account for about 99 of total precipitation with each showing almost equal proportions 605 mm runoff and 609 mm of evapotranspiration of the total runoff interflow is the largest component i e 74 33 followed by ground water 16 03 and overland flow accounts for the remaining portion 9 63 changes in subsurface storage varied across the years but was negligible compared to runoff and evapotranspiration we were not able to find any other studies that have performed a similar water balance assessment for the entire sjrb for any meaningful comparison however hulsman 2002 did an assessment of the new brunswick portion of the basin using surfer mapping software he reported that 40 of the precipitation returned to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration and 60 was runoff however he notes that his results may not be representative of the entire basin and his method of runoff mapping may be progressively less accurate as calculations are advanced downstream 3 2 simulation of future hydrological conditions 3 2 1 simulation of baseline conditions although rdrs performed the best in the model assessment it was not considered for estimation of future flows since rdrs is recently released data and rdrs bias corrected global circulation model regional climate model gcm rcm data were not available two datasets canrcm4 bias corrected using wfdei canrcm4 wfdei and canrcm4 bias corrected by wfdei gem capa canrcm4 wgc were considered for simulation of future flows however our assessment showed that wgc outperforms wfdei in the sjrb basin in terms of model performance see table 3 furthermore canrcm4 wgc was available at higher spatial resolution 0 125 compared to canrcm4 wfdei 0 44 therefore canrcm4 wgc was preferred for derivation of future flows a common practice in hydrological modelling is to assess the model performance for a baseline period before deriving future streamflows shrestha et al 2016 this is essential for two reasons first to determine if bias corrected gcm rcm data can capture the climatology of the historical period beyond calibration validation period second to establish a baseline scenario to which changes in future flows can be compared since model simulated baseline and model simulated future flows are both subject to same sources of uncertainty this offers a more standardized comparison than comparing against historical observed flows that are not prone to the same modelling uncertainties rokaya et al 2020 a total of 150 simulations 15 canrcm4 wgc ensembles 10 optimal parameter sets were generated for both grand fall and mactaquac stations and compared against the observed flows see fig 5 a total of 30 year runs was evaluated for grand falls i e 1991 2020 and a total of 20 years period i e 2000 2020 was assessed for the mactaquac station observed data before that period was not available for mactaquac the results are satisfactory but show two distinct differences first the interquartile variability is less in simulated flows compared to the observed flows second the model is unable to capture peak spring flows of april and may these baseline results warranted an explanation on the sources of modelling error particularly on the underestimation of spring flows we first evaluated the model generated hydrographs for the calibration and validation periods the results show that although the model produced reasonable performance metrics during calibration validation using wgc as forcing data i e 0 71 nse at daily scale the monthly flows for spring are largely underestimated see fig 6 a and 6b at both grand falls and mactaquac stations on the other hand the monthly peaks are captured better by rdrs data see fig 6 c and 6d which reveals that the errors are stemming mainly from the forcing data this emphasizes the fact that evaluating model performance solely based on performance metrics which is a common practice in hydrological modelling may be misleading the average nse values for the calibration and validation periods using rdrs is only 12 more than that of wgc at the grand falls station but rdrs captures peak spring flows significantly better than wgc see fig 6 c and 6d 3 2 2 projected streamflow under a future climate an ensemble of 150 streamflows were generated for two future reference periods i e 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 using canrcm4 wgc a delta change method as described in section 2 6 was used to generate the estimated future flows the results show that winter flows between december to march will increase in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods compared to the baseline 1991 2020 period for grand falls and 2000 2020 period for mactaquac see fig 7 a and 7b in contrast spring and summer flows are projected to decline between april and july in both future periods compared to the baseline period the largest increases were observed in march for both grand falls 191 in the 2041 2070 and 355 in 2071 2100 periods and mactaquac 141 in the 2041 2070 and 246 in 2071 2100 periods compared to the baseline period in contrast the largest decreases were observed in may at both locations grand falls showed a decline of 49 and 56 respectively for the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods whereas mactaquac revealed a decline of 43 and 51 for the same periods the rest of the months showed only minor discrepancies a climate change impact report by natural resources canada 2007 indicates that by 2050 there will be less summer discharge in the sjrb compared to the historical period which is in line with what was found in this study kidd et al 2011 reported that the higher evapotranspiration rate that can offset the potential increases in precipitation and reduced snowpack are the major causes for these declines in summer flows in this study we also found that the average evapotranspiration will increase by 7 9 and 14 5 over summer june august in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 period respectively compared to the 1991 2020 period for the winter period we attribute the increase in streamflow to increased precipitation and increased temperature our analysis of meteorological data shows that winter precipitation december february is on an average 13 and 27 higher in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 period respectively compared to the 1991 2020 period whereas the average temperature for winter month shows an increase of 4 c and 6 2 c in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 period respectively 3 2 3 confidence assessment on future streamflow in earlier sections we have discussed in detail about model uncertainty and in fact highlighted the errors in our own modelling results of the simulated baseline conditions as well as offered some diagnostics on the sources of those errors therefore it is important to critically reflect on uncertainty in our future flow estimates we used the method described in section 2 7 to assess how reliable the estimates of future flows are by comparing model error versus projected changes in streamflow if the climate change signal largely outweighs model error then we can be confident that climatic effects will be prevalent despite modelling errors and vice versa the results show that the percentage of changes in future streamflows between december and march significantly outweighs the model error in those months for the baseline period therefore we can be confident in our projection that the future winter flows will increase see fig 8 in contrast modelling error exceeds or is equivalent to the changes in streamflow for both future periods between april and november period therefore there is less confidence on our result that summer flows will decline additions of these confidence bands in results help us to understand the robustness of our results as well as acknowledge the uncertainty modelling errors 4 concluding summary the sjrb is an important transboundary coastal river basin in eastern north america with socio economic and environmental significance however hydrologically the basin is poorly understood in this study we evaluated four different meteorological datasets to identify the best performing forcing data for hydrological modelling of the sjrb our assessment showed that rdrs significantly outperforms gem capa wfdei and wgc however it was also revealed that the evaluation of model performance based solely on performance metrics such as nse or nselog could be misleading thus a closer look at climatology is also required the results also highlight the significance of meteorological forcing data on model performance we showed that they can be a source of large uncertainty however resolving forcing data issues is particularly challenging in transboundary basins such as the sjrb where observed data needs to be harmonized across national jurisdictions furthermore limited data availability also hinders scientific advances although we found rdrs to be the best performing forcing data rdrs bias corrected gcm rcm data were not available at the time of this study a data set which may have reduced the modelling errors and increased the confidence in our results for future studies in the sjrb we suggest an application of gcm rcm data bias corrected using rdrs we also investigated the water balance of the basin to understand the partitioning of the precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff our results show that evaporation and runoff account for about 50 each in the basin the estimation of future flows using canrcm4 wgc dataset revealed that winter flows will increase but summer flows will decrease in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods compared to the baseline period of 1991 2020 under rcp 8 5 scenario however evaluation of model errors indicated higher confidence in the result that winter flows will increase but lower or no confidence in the result that summer flows will decrease these findings provide valuable information
