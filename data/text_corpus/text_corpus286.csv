1430,surficial co2 efflux surveys have been used to delineate hydrocarbon source zones in contaminated aquifers and provide estimates of hydrocarbon biodegradation rates this approach requires distinguishing between co2 derived from petroleum degradation and co2 produced from natural soil respiration to this end radiocarbon has been used to differentiate between 14c depleted co2 from hydrocarbon degradation and 14c enriched co2 from natural soil respiration to effectively quantify the contribution of each source to total co2 efflux and by deduction natural source zone depletion nszd rates in this study a systematic method comparison has been conducted to evaluate available approaches for collecting co2 gas samples for radiocarbon analysis used to correct total co2 efflux measurements for quantifying natural source zone depletion rates gas samples for radiocarbon analysis were sampled from i dynamic closed chambers located at ground surface ii static chambers also at ground surface iii shallow soil gas probes 0 3 m bgs and iv soil gas monitoring wells 0 6 m below ground surface during a co2 efflux survey conducted at the site of a historical pipeline rupture near bemidji mn the mean fraction of radiocarbon f14c obtained from samples overlying the source zone were i 0 93 0 01 ii 0 73 0 03 iii 0 71 0 04 and iv 0 41 0 06 for the four methods respectively these f14c values were used to apportion total co2 efflux measurements into contributions of contaminant derived co2 efflux and natural soil respiration to evaluate natural source zone depletion processes results suggest that the method of radiocarbon sampling has a significant effect on the calculated fraction of the co2 efflux originating from contaminant related soil respiration with contributions ranging between 27 and 59 of total soil respiration results indicate that radiocarbon sampled from static chambers and shallow soil gas probes methods offer the best compromise between co2 sample yield and sample representativeness providing the most reliable estimates of co2 effluxes originating from contaminant degradation however the results also show that for this study all methods agree within a factor of 2 3 regarding the inferred nszd rates keywords co2 efflux petroleum hydrocarbons natural source zone depletion radiocarbon 1 introduction implementing natural source zone depletion nszd as a long term management strategy has become an increasingly accepted practice at petroleum hydrocarbon phc contaminated sites garg et al 2017 sookhak et al 2019 the occurrence of phc biodegradation in the subsurface has been documented through monitoring long term biogeochemical changes of terminal electron acceptors in the saturated and vadose zones and characterizing the contributions of aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes to hydrocarbon mass depletion revesz et al 1995 cozzarelli et al 2001 amos et al 2005 bekins et al 2005 quantitative monitoring methods of nszd processes in unconfined aquifers have become an integral component of long term site management providing information on rates of contaminant degradation and source zone longevity garg et al 2017 kulkarni et al 2020 methods to quantify rates of nszd in hydrocarbon source zones are based on o2 demand for contaminant degradation quantified by the gradient method johnson et al 2006 or co2 production and release across the ground surface sihota et al 2011 mccoy et al 2015 methods relying on quantification of co2 release assume that co2 produced from contaminant degradation in the vadose zone and smear zone is predominately exported to the atmosphere via gas diffusion through the vadose zone reactive transport modelling of a shallow petroleum contaminated aquifer conducted by ng et al 2014 estimated that 82 93 of co2 produced from contaminant biodegradation was outgassed to the ground surface providing support for this assumption carbon dioxide production and release to the atmosphere can be quantified via co2 efflux measurements derived from co2 gradients in the vadose zone sihota et al 2011 or measured directly using dynamic closed chambers dcc sihota et al 2011 eichert et al 2017 or co2 sorbent traps mccoy et al 2015 these methods rely on measuring co2 emissions using non invasive co2 efflux surveys allowing for the assessment of depth integrated hydrocarbon degradation rates via naturally occurring biodegradation processes sihota et al 2011 sihota and mayer 2012 identifying co2 efflux attributed to contaminant related soil respiration can be correlated to depth integrated rates of contaminant mineralization sihota and mayer 2012 warren et al 2014 more recently alternative methods have been developed to estimate rates of nszd based on thermal gradients from exothermic microbial reactions occurring during contaminant degradation sweeney and ririe 2014 warren et al 2014 askarani and sale 2020 all these methods provide rate estimates of hydrocarbon loss via naturally occurring processes comparable to those obtained by late stage active remedial activities garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2020 a critical evaluation of nszd monitoring methods is important to ensure representative rate estimates are used to guide site management decisions kulkarni et al 2020 dynamic closed chamber techniques sihota et al 2011 and co2 sorbent traps mccoy et al 2015 measure total soil respired co2 efflux j tsr overlying phc contaminated source zones to provide an adequate estimate of nszd rates it is necessary to effectively distinguish between co2 emissions originating from contaminant degradation and co2 generated by naturally occurring soil respiration in previous studies it was found that j tsr measured overlying contaminant source zones is typically elevated in comparison to background locations e g sihota et al 2011 to identify the contribution of petroleum derived contaminant related soil respiration j csr to j tsr some previous studies have used a background correction bgc method sihota et al 2011 warren et al 2014 using this method average co2 effluxes associated with background natural soil respiration j nsr are estimated by calculating the mean efflux from measurements at pristine background locations unaffected by contaminants co2 effluxes associated with contaminant related soil respiration at locations overlying the contaminant source zone are then estimated by subtracting j nsr from j tsr based on the following equation eq 1 sihota et al 2011 1 j csr j tsr j nsr although this method is attractive for its simplicity several assumptions are made that affect the accuracy and representativeness of the results sihota and mayer 2012 the method assumes that the average background value for j nsr is also representative across the contaminated region which might not be the case due to differences in vegetation rochette et al 1991 soil and subsurface heterogeneity as well as other parameters affecting spatial variability fang et al 1998 and the impact of the contamination on root respiration and the decomposition of naturally occurring organic matter in the soil alternatively isotope analysis of co2 has been used to identify the contributions of phc degradation towards total co2 efflux sihota and mayer 2012 specifically radiocarbon 14c can be used to differentiate phc derived co2 from natural background co2 given that it is absent in hydrocarbons of geological age yet present at modern levels in soils and vegetation reimer et al 2013 the modern carbon standard mc has an established 14c 12c ratio of 1 18 10 12 and radiocarbon measurements are expressed as a fraction of modern carbon f14c today atmospheric co2 and natural co2 in the biosphere has an f14c that is close to 1 0 e g reimer et al 2013 clark 2015 several studies focusing on quantifying nszd at petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sites have already used radiocarbon correction to derive j csr from j tsr for example sihota and mayer 2012 used 14c isotopes to trace co2 derived from biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons at a historical pipeline rupture site near bemidji mn during their investigation warren et al 2014 samples for radiocarbon analyses were obtained from shallow monitoring ports of existing soil gas monitoring wells located in close proximity to dynamic closed flux chambers however collecting soil gas from existing monitoring wells does not guarantee that the measured f14c value of soil gas co2 is representative of the f14c value of co2 emitted at the surface similarly in subsequent dcc studies at decommissioned refinery sites sihota 2014 jourabchi et al 2016 eichert et al 2017 gas samples for radiocarbon analysis in co2 were collected directly from the dynamic closed chambers direct gas sample collection from the dynamic closed chambers ensures representativeness of the sample however co2 is already present in ambient air at the time of chamber closure making the determination of the contribution of j csr to j tsr based on measured f14c more complicated in addition to the methods introduced above alternative methods for collection of samples for radiocarbon analysis are available such as sampling from dedicated shallow hand augered soil gas probes aelion et al 2009 sihota 2014 or static chambers although radiocarbon analysis has been used to determine the fraction of contaminant related soil respiration in the context of dcc flux measurements a systematic comparison to evaluate the effect of the gas sampling methods on the accuracy of the radiocarbon correction as well as practicality and ease of application has not been completed to date the quantification of nszd rates and assessment of source zone longevity at contaminated sites via co2 efflux surveys benefits from evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and from identifying the most suitable and practical methods for radiocarbon sampling and correction representative sampling ultimately influences estimates of nszd rates that can be used in long term site management decisions particularly when comparing active lnapl management methods to passive management strategies relying on nszd garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2020 kulkarni et al 2020 in this study we present a comparison of radiocarbon sampling methods that was conducted at the well characterized usgs national crude oil spill research site in bemidji mn in august 2015 with the objective of identifying the most suitable methods for determining nszd rates from co2 efflux surveys this site was selected for our study because it is very well characterized providing ideal conditions for the method comparison with general applicability to sites of similar geology our work specifically focuses on complementing co2 efflux surveys performed with the dynamic closed chamber technique 2 study site this study was conducted at the usgs national crude oil spill research site near bemidji mn latitude 47 34 23 longitude 95 05 33 in 1979 a pipeline rupture released 1 7 106 l of crude oil into the environment hult and grabbe 1988 initial clean up efforts removed 75 of the released oil however an estimated 400 000 l infiltrated into the underlying aquifer where it accumulated in the unsaturated zone and at the water table which lies 6 8 m below ground surface mbgs hult and grabbe 1988 delin et al 1998 residual light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl remains predominantly in two pools the north pool which has been extensively characterized and is the focus of this study and the smaller south pool which accumulated to the southwest of the pipeline rupture delin et al 1998 the 20 m thick aquifer consists predominantly of glacial outwash composed of a mixture of sands gravel and lacustrine silts franzi 1988 previous site investigations have indicated the occurrence of biodegradation in the contaminant source zone e g bekins et al 2001 methane ch4 produced from microbial degradation diffuses upwards through the vadose zone but reacts with oxygen o2 2 4 mbgs creating an active methanotrophic zone transforming ch4 into co2 amos et al 2005 carbon dioxide is also directly produced by aerobic degradation of residual phcs in the vadose zone amos et al 2005 molins et al 2010 the investigation by sihota et al 2011 found average surficial co2 effluxes over the source zone at the bemidji site are almost double the effluxes at background locations confirming the occurrence of contaminant biodegradation the spatial distribution of co2 effluxes was found to adequately delineate the subsurface source zone by identifying a strong correlation between increased vadose zone co2 concentrations abundance of residual oil and elevated co2 effluxes sihota et al 2011 based on these measurements sihota et al 2011 were also able to provide estimates for nszd rates using the background correction method which were refined by sihota and mayer 2012 using radiocarbon corrected co2 effluxes subsequently warren et al 2014 correlated surface co2 efflux to the abundance of microbes and hydrocarbon loss from the subsurface while the study by sihota et al 2016 determined seasonal variabilities in nszd rates together these studies provide clear evidence that surficial co2 effluxes can be used to determine nszd rates if contaminant related soil respiration can be effectively separated from natural soil respiration 3 methods survey co2 efflux measurements were conducted from august 14 to august 19 2015 overlying the north pool lnapl source zone at bemidji mn radiocarbon 14c in co2 was analysed from gas samples collected using four different sampling methods fig 1 specifically gas samples were collected from 1 dynamic closed chambers dcc 2 static chambers sc 3 shallow soil gas probes sp 4 existing soil gas monitoring wells mw soil collars for dcc measurements scs and sps were placed within 1 0 m of existing mws along the north pool transect fig 2 to minimize differences in measurements due to spatial variability of soil gas concentrations and effluxes the source zone indicated in grey on fig 2 was considered as the region between well 1302 23 9 m up gradient and 1402 26 7 m down gradient of the center of the delineated free product along the north pool transect during the study groundwater levels measured by the usgs were approximately 9 3 m bgs at background well 310 and 6 6 6 8 m bgs 604 9015 in the center of north pool transect 3 1 co2 efflux measurements for the method intercomparison co2 efflux measurements were taken at 20 select locations situated approximately 5 15 m apart along the north pool transect following the method developed by sihota et al 2011 co2 efflux at each sampling location was measured using an li 8100a dynamic closed co2 flux survey chamber system equipped with an infrared gas analyser licor biosciences lincoln nebraska co2 effluxes were calculated for a 60 s measurement interval after a 30 s dead band to allow stabilization of co2 concentration trends in the chamber headspace prior to flux measurements sihota et al 2011 sihota and mayer 2012 the chamber tubing was purged prior to and after each measurement for 30 s as per the manufacturer s recommendations licor biosciences lincoln nebraska a polyvinyl chloride pvc collar 20 cm o d by 10 cm was inserted into the soil 3 5 cm at each measurement location at least 24 h prior to the first co2 efflux measurement to allow equilibration of gas effluxes after disturbance of the soil the chamber offset was averaged from three collar height measurements recorded and inputted in the li 8100a 4 0 software program at the time of the efflux measurement a complete description of the method can be found in sihota et al 2011 efflux measurements were performed three times a day over a period of three days the measurements were taken from 9 00 12 00 12 00 15 00 and 15 00 18 00 respectively the average of the co2 efflux measurements at each location were calculated and are referred to as the mean j tsr for each location on the transect each co2 efflux measurement location was positioned within a 1 0 m radius from existing soil gas monitoring wells along the north pool transect figs 2 and 3 3 2 gas sample collection gas samples for radiocarbon analysis were collected at the 20 co2 efflux measurement locations along the north pool transect using the four different methods figs 2 and 3 for the sc sp and mw methods 300 ml gas samples were extracted using a 100 ml luer lok gas tight syringe hamilton 1000 series and injected into 200 ml wheaton bottles fitted with butyl stoppers this sampling method minimizes the risk for atmospheric contamination during sample processing and provides sufficient sample for radiocarbon analysis larger volumes were collected from the dynamic closed chambers 400 ml samples collected in 250 ml wheaton bottles equipped with butyl stoppers to amend co2 mass in the sample for lower expected co2 concentrations relative to the other methods additional details on method specific sampling procedures are provided below gas samples for determination of co2 concentrations were also collected at the time of radiocarbon sample collection from static chambers shallow soil gas probes and soil gas monitoring wells these samples were inserted into pre evacuated 20 ml glass serum vials gas samples were not collected for the dcc method since the method continuously measures co2 concentrations via infra red gas analysis 3 2 1 direct sampling from dynamic closed chambers dcc in case of the dcc method two gas samples for radiocarbon analysis were taken at each measurement location on august 17 2015 the radiocarbon samples were taken from a t fitting equipped with a septa li 8100 664 trace gas adapter that was inserted into the air in line of the gas analyser fig 1a the initial sample was taken prior to survey co2 efflux measurements to assess whether the ambient radiocarbon content over the collar area is in fact close to atmospheric levels while the second sample was taken directly from the headspace of the closed chamber after completion of the co2 efflux measurement to assess change in f14c over the measurement interval the initial 400 ml gas sample was collected through the trace gas adapter using the gas tight syringe immediately prior to survey efflux measurements i e before the chamber closed subsequently the co2 efflux measurement was completed t 90 s and a second 400 ml sample was extracted from the trace gas adapter starting immediately after the flux measurement interval sample extraction was completed over a time period of 210 s the chamber remained closed during this time period the total time of chamber closure was 300 s 3 2 2 sampling from static chambers sc cylindrical closed top static chambers were constructed from 20 cm long sections of 20 cm id pvc piping with a serrated edge lower rim for penetration into soils fig 1b on august 16 2015 static chambers were inserted directly adjacent to dcc collar locations 0 1 m and left for 24 h to allow accumulation of soil gas in the chamber headspace vegetation was removed from the area covered by the chamber and a mallet was used to drive the chambers 5 6 cm into the ground after 24 h gas samples were collected using a gas tight syringe through a septa fitted to the center of the lid fig 1b and then injected into the pre evacuated wheaton bottles 3 2 3 sampling from shallow soil gas probes sp soil gas probes ams inc american falls id were driven into the ground 0 3 m bgs and allowed to equilibrate with the soil for 30 min at each measurement location the shallow soil gas probe was placed within 1 m of the existing monitoring well and samples were collected from august 15 17 2015 during the co2 efflux survey dates a gas tight syringe connected to the probe with tygon tubing was used to purge three line volumes and then extract gas for insertion into the pre evacuated wheaton bottles fig 1c 3 2 4 sampling from soil gas monitoring wells mw gas samples were collected from existing multi level monitoring wells constructed from 3 2 mm tubing and equipped with 10 cm long 6 4 mm outer diameter o d stainless steel screens hult and grabbe 1988 fig 1d as discussed sampling locations for the dcc sc and sp methods were located within 1 m of the mws samples were collected from august 14 16 2015 from the top port of each monitoring well which averaged 0 6 m bgs a peristaltic pump geopump geotech environmental equipment inc denver co was used to bring the samples to the surface at a flow rate of 1 5 l min 1 samples were collected into the pre evacuated wheaton bottles after at least three line volumes had been purged sihota and mayer 2012 purge time was set to 3 min taking into consideration the sand pack surrounding the port 3 3 radiocarbon analysis the fractions of radiocarbon f14c in co2 from the gas samples were analysed at the a e lalonde accelerator mass spectrometer laboratory in ottawa on canada the f14c was calculated following reimer et al 2013 where the ratio of 14c 12c of the sample is compared to a national bureau of standards nbs oxalic acid ii and normalized to the δ13c pdb eq 2 as described in crann et al 2016 2 f 14 c 14 c 12 c s a m p l e 14 c 12 c o x i i s t a n d a r d co2 for radiocarbon analysis was cryogenically extracted from gas samples using a vacuum extraction line 10 5 kpa at the g g hatch lab at the university of ottawa co2 was transferred into a 6 mm o d pyrex tube and torch sealed all break seals contained 6 8 grains silver cobaltous and were baked overnight at 200 c to scrub out any remaining sulphur impurities palstra and meijer 2014 purified co2 from the gas samples was converted into elemental carbon in the presence of 5 0 mg of a pre conditioned iron catalyst and hydrogen by high temperature reduction as described by crann et al 2016 the graphite coated iron was pressed into targets and run on the a e lalonde 3 0 mv accelerator mass spectrometer at 2 5 mv with ar stripping kieser et al 2015 crann et al 2016 results were fractionation corrected using the oxalic acid ii standard f14c 1 34 and normalized to the δ13c pdb crann et al 2016 additional information on sample preparation is provided in the supporting information 3 4 radiocarbon correction the contribution of contaminant soil respiration co2 efflux j csr to total co2 efflux j tsr measured was calculated by determining the fraction of contaminant soil respiration f csr and fraction of natural soil respiration f nsr sihota and mayer 2012 where no other significant sources of radiocarbon depletion exist j tsr is the sum of the natural soil respiration and contaminant soil respiration so that 3 f c s r 1 f n s r the f nsr of co2 efflux measurements can be quantified using f14c of the collected gas sample in the case of sample collection from shallow soil gas probes sp or soil gas monitoring wells mw f nsr can be related directly to the measured f14c 4 f nsr f 14 c for both chamber methods sc and dcc co2 is already present within the chamber at the time of closure generally concentrations of co2 and its isotopic composition are expected to be close to atmospheric co2 i e co2 air 400 ppm and f14cair 1 when calculating f14c associated with co2 emitted from the subsurface it is therefore necessary to correct for the contribution of the gas that was initially present in the chamber for the chamber based methods dcc and sc f nsr can be calculated using the following mass balance equation based on the work of sihota 2014 and as modified by jourabchi et al 2016 5 f nsr f 14 c c f co 2 c f f 14 c air co 2 air co 2 c f co 2 air where f14cc f is the fraction of modern carbon in gas samples collected from the chamber after completion of the co2 efflux measurement co2 c f is the corresponding concentration of co2 after completion of the co2 efflux measurement for the dcc method co2 c f corresponds to the average co2 concentration during sample collection for radiocarbon analysis which is considered the average concentration measured by the infrared gas analyser connected to the chamber over the gas sampling interval t 90 to 300 s after chamber closure for the sc method co2 c f is the concentration at the time of sample collection for radiocarbon analysis the concentration is obtained from a gas sample collected 24 h after placement of the static chamber considering that the chambers entrap air directly above the ground surface subjected to limited mixing with the air column it is necessary to verify whether concentrations and isotopic signature prior to chamber closure indeed correspond to those of ambient air the method most affected is the dcc method considering the chamber closure time is limited to 300 s and the increase of co2 concentrations within the chamber headspace in comparison to atmospheric co2 concentrations is modest to address this uncertainty we utilized gas samples collected directly before chamber closure using these additional samples f nsr of the emitted gas can be calculated as 6 f nsr f 14 c c f co 2 c f f 14 c c i co 2 c i co 2 c f co 2 c i where f14cc i is the initial fraction of modern carbon measured for the gas sample collected from the chamber headspace prior to the co2 efflux measurement and co2 c i is the initial concentration of co2 in the chamber at t 0 comparison of f nsr values obtained using eqs 5 and 6 allows to determine the effect of assuming atmospheric conditions at the time of chamber closure and to determine whether the collection and costly analysis of the initial sample for radiocarbon in co2 is necessary if f nsr is known f csr can be calculated based on eq 3 and the petroleum derived contaminant soil respiration co2 efflux j csr can be quantified by multiplying j tsr with f csr 7 j csr f csr j tsr during the co2 efflux field investigation at bemidji mn usgs national crude oil spill research site from august 14 to 19 2015 j tsr was taken as the average total co2 efflux measured by the li 8100a flux chamber over the 3 day measurement period 4 results 4 1 total co2 efflux measurements the co2 efflux at background site 310 200 8 m up gradient from the center of the north pool transect was 2 7 0 4 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 the mean j tsr in the source zone ranged from 4 1 0 4 1212 to 7 4 0 3 μmol m 2 s 1 9015 fig 4 and average mean j tsr overlying the source area was 5 2 0 1 μmol m 2 s 1 the average j tsr at down gradient locations 9103 533 9101 532 518 531 and 530 ranged from 2 8 0 2 μmol m 2 s 1 to 5 1 0 5 μmol m 2 s 1 mean 3 9 0 3 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 upgradient location 603 in the spray zone 118 4 m up gradient which is characterized by hydrophobic soils as well as increased vegetation in comparison to other collar locations in the spray zone delin et al 1998 had an average j tsr of 5 7 0 9 μmol m 2 s 1 while location 604 showed effluxes similar to background location 310 fig 4 4 2 co2 concentrations gas samples collected from the shallow ports of the soil gas monitoring wells mw had the highest co2 concentrations on average 0 83 0 2 v v across the north pool transect with a maximum value of 2 6 0 038 v v 1302 the volumetric concentration of co2 from samples collected from the shallow soil gas probes sp along the north pool transect reached up to 0 49 0 007 v v 9015 with an average value of 0 21 0003 v v while samples collected from the static chambers sc reached up to 0 21 0 004 v v 534 with an average value of 0 13 0 003 v v the co2 concentrations measured directly by the dynamic closed chamber system dcc ranged from 0 038 0 001 to 0 041 0 001 v v atmosphere prior to chamber closure with an average value of 0 039 0 001 v v consistently reflecting ambient atmospheric co2 concentrations average co2 concentrations measured at the end of the sampling cycle t 300 s from the dynamic closed chambers at t 300 s was 0 049 0 001 v v with a maximum value of 0 059 0 001 v v 9014 time averaged concentrations during radiocarbon sample collection between t 90 s and t 300 s reached a maximum value of 0 052 0 001 v v 9014 and 9015 with a mean concentration of 0 046 0 001 v v table s1 supporting information provides a summary of the measured co2 concentrations for the four methods 4 3 radiocarbon 14c measurements the f14c samples collected along the north pool transect showed a trend of increased depletion of f14c with increasing proximity to the source zone for all four methods fig 5 table s2 gas samples at each sampling location showed increased radiocarbon depletion with increasing depth of sample collection as a function of the method samples collected directly from the dcc 0 m bgs were closest to modern fig 5a and mw samples 0 6mbgs showed the lowest f14c fig 5d for example at location 9017 23 2 m up gradient radiocarbon f14c ranged from 0 90 0 013 0 mbgs to 0 57 0 003 0 m bgs 0 48 0 002 0 3 m bgs and 0 35 0 003 0 6 m bgs for dcc after co2 efflux measurement sc sp and mw samples respectively at background location 310 200 8 m up gradient radiocarbon measured f14c values were 0 95 0 002 dcc prior to chamber closure 1 00 0 006 sc 0 95 0 012 sp and 0 96 0 007 mw ambient air samples collected directly from the dcc prior to the efflux measurement were consistently showing modern 14c signature f14c 1 022 0 0013 9016 f14c 0 930 0 0177 1402 with no apparent correlation between distance from the center of the source zone and depletion of the 14c isotope samples taken prior to chamber measurements were more enriched with 14c isotopes than the sample taken after co2 flux measurement with the exception of one source zone location 1402 and most down gradient locations see table s2 in supporting information at these sites 14c prior to and after chamber closure were both close to atmospheric conditions the f14c of gas samples collected along the north pool transect deviates from a modern 14c signature for sites overlying known residual oil delin et al 1998 sihota and mayer 2012 amos et al 2005 using all four sampling methods the results obtained with all sampling methods show that emitted co2 in the source zone and spray zone is characterized by significantly lower mean f14c than emitted co2 at the background location 310 and down gradient locations table s2 the mean f14c collected from dcc sc sp and mw sample after efflux measurement in the source zone were 0 93 0 01 0 73 0 03 0 71 0 04 and 0 41 0 06 respectively these observations mirror findings of sihota and mayer 2012 who determined significant differences in the radiocarbon of co2 in soil gas between contaminated background and downgradient locations 4 4 determination of co2 efflux related to contaminant soil respiration j csr radiocarbon results and co2 concentrations for dcc and sc methods were used to calculate the fraction of the co2 efflux derived from microbial degradation f csr of phcs using eq 3 with f nsr obtained from eq 4 sp and mw and 5 dcc and sc samples collected from surface efflux methods dcc and sc were processed considering the radiocarbon signature of ambient air f14c 1 0 co2 400 ppm assumed to be initially present in the chambers while samples collected using the sp and mw methods do not require this correction for the dcc method f nsr was alternatively determined using eq 6 which makes use of initial measured radiocarbon and co2 concentration values fluxes for j csr were then calculated from j tsr measurements using the f csr correction factor based on eq 7 and are summarized in fig 6 prior to comparison of j csr for the different methods it is useful to compare f csr which is the parameter defining the contribution of contaminant soil respiration towards total soil respiration see table s3 this approach provides a metric for intercomparison of the different sampling approaches without the added complexity introduced by the variation of the magnitude of co2 effluxes as a function of location focusing on the source zone the mean f csr values calculated using eq 5 for dcc and sc samples were 0 45 0 14 and 0 32 0 01 respectively alternatively using eq 6 for the dcc samples yield a calculated average f csr of 0 27 0 22 the sp and mw radiocarbon data analysed using eq 4 resulted in calculated f csr 0 29 0 006 sp and 0 59 0 002 mw respectively together these results suggest that the method of radiocarbon sampling has a significant effect on the calculated fraction of the co2 efflux originating from contaminant related soil respiration with contributions ranging between 27 and 59 of total soil respiration at the background location 310 f csr values calculated using the sc sp and mw methods ranged between 0 00 and 0 05 indicating that contaminated related soil respiration is negligible at this location and showing that the methods are in good agreement f csr values obtained for the spray zone were similar to those of the source zone while all methods show lower f csr values in the downgradient regions table s3 all four methods demonstrated a decrease in radiocarbon corrected j csr with increased distance up and down gradient of the center of the source zone with the exception of select locations in the spray zone which are also significantly impacted by degradation of residual phc fig 6 in the source zone the average j csr is calculated as 2 3 0 72 1 7 0 12 1 5 0 08 and 3 2 0 1 μmol m 2 s 1 for dcc sc sp and mw methods respectively fig 6 table s4 if eq 6 is used to determine j csr for the dcc method the average j csr in the source zone is 1 4 1 1 μmol m 2 s 1 table s4 fig s1 while all methods are able to quantify an increase in j csr in the source zone the magnitude of the effluxes attributed to contaminant degradation varies substantially 5 discussion although the dcc method has the advantage that radiocarbon samples are directly extracted from the chamber i e directly obtained from the gas that is emitted from the ground the method also poses challenges as can be seen in fig 6a and fig s1 see also table s4 absolute errors associated with this sampling technique are relatively large in comparison to the other three methods examination of eqs 5 and 6 as well as co2 concentrations and radiocarbon values tables s1 and s2 reveal that the relatively large errors are due to small differences between final co2 concentrations and the corresponding radiocarbon signature relative to initial values prior to chamber closure the determination of f nsr and therefore f csr is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the measured co2 concentrations and f14c both after the flux measurement and prior to chamber closure in case of eq 6 comparison of average initial co2 concentration values in the source zone 392 ppm to the assumed value in air 400 ppm and the corresponding f14c value 0 98 vs 1 0 suggests that the assumptions behind eq 5 are adequate in principle however despite these very small differences in assumed and measured initial co2 concentrations and f14c 2 results show that using eqs 5 and 6 lead to substantially different mean values for f csr and j csr in the source zone f csr 0 45 vs 0 27 respectively and j csr 2 3 vs 1 4 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively this observation highlights the sensitivity of both methods towards the accuracy of concentration and radiocarbon measurements although eq 6 provides in principle a better estimation of f csr and j csr than eq 5 the cumulative errors associated with this method are large fig s1 table s3 and s4 at several locations in particular in regions with limited contaminant related soil respiration downgradient zone the determined values for f csr and j csr were negative providing non physical results tables s3 and s4 generally the large errors of the dcc method using eqs 5 and 6 were also affected by lower than recommended co2 concentrations for radiocarbon analysis 0 2 mg carbon this is due to low co2 concentrations and the limited sample size that can be extracted from the chamber system increasing the sample volume for laboratory analysis would increase the accuracy of the dcc method for future studies this could be achieved by either increasing the gas volume from 400 ml to 1000 ml or conversely extending the length of the efflux measurement to allow for higher concentration to build up in the chamber headspace mimicking static chamber conditions increasing the sample size to 1000 ml is problematic since such a large volume constitutes a large fraction of the chamber headspace volume in a subsequent study at a former refinery site in british columbia jourabchi et al 2018 reduced the error of the dcc method by increasing the length of the chamber measurement until concentrations in the chamber headspace were 1000 ppm this improvement to the dcc method increases the accuracy of the j csr correction however it also increases sampling time and restricts the number of efflux measurements that can be conducted in a given time frame using a dcc system in summary although the dcc method provides the most representative samples for co2 and f14c the accuracy of the method is limited in addition costs for f14c analysis are high if eq 6 is used to determine f csr and j csr since f14c must be determined prior to and after the efflux measurement fig 6 and tables s3 and s4 show that the highest f csr and j csr were obtained using the mw method these results are due to the high degree of radiocarbon depletion fig 5 table s2 in the samples collected from the wells significantly lower f14c values obtained from mw samples can be attributed to closer proximity to the lnapl source in comparison shallower sampling methods dcc sc sp account for mixing with ambient air and co2 generated in the shallow soil which more accurately reflect the composition of co2 efflux measured at the ground surface previous subsurface soil gas characterization conducted at bemidji mn by amos et al 2005 and sihota and mayer 2012 found sharp transition for soil gases for elevated co2 with increasing depth corresponding to depleted f14c with depth therefore radiocarbon signatures of samples obtained from 0 6 m bgs are not considered representative of co2 emitted at surface which are diluted by modern atmospheric co2 although this method is attractive for its simplicity in particular in the presence of an existing monitoring network and relatively low error it will tend to overestimate f csr and j csr the remaining methods sc and sp provide attractive alternatives for radiocarbon sample collection the sc method has the advantage that gas samples are collected directly at the ground surface however similar to the dcc method mixing with ambient air prior to static chamber placement must be taken into account errors associated with this method are much lower than with the dcc method fig 6 tables s3 and s4 since the chamber is left in place for 24 h and co2 concentrations at the time of sample collection are higher using sampling devices dedicated to sampling locations is possible with the sc method due to the low cost of static chambers the inferred values for f csr and j csr are considered more representative than for the mw method and more accurate than the dcc method as presented here conversely the 24 h deployment period of the sc method implies that the measured f14c co2 value is representative for a longer time period than covered by the short efflux measurement of the dynamic closed chambers 2 min sihota et al 2016 documented seasonal variability of f14c co2 measurements however shorter term diurnal variability in f14c co2 in nszd studies has not be examined in the literature it is well known that soil respiration processes show diurnal variations subke et al 2003 riveros iregui et al 2007 it can therefore be expected that f14c co2 in the emitted gas will vary over a 24 h time period possibly compromising the representativeness of the 14c sample for the period of the co2 efflux measurement with the adjacent dynamic closed chambers the sp method yields similar results in magnitude to the sc method since samples are collected closer to the ground surface than using the mw method f14c values are considered more representative although not as representative as f14c obtained via the sc method on the upside the sp method is not affected by mixing its precision is higher than that of the sc method and the sample collection is instantaneous and can be coordinated with the efflux measurement all four methods in this study are comparable to previous nszd estimates at bemidji mn using the dynamic closed chamber method table 1 data obtained from the top port of soil gas monitoring wells obtained from sihota and mayer 2012 is similar to the magnitude measured during the 2015 co2 efflux survey a quantitative comparison of results from this study for the different methods reveals that the variability between the various methods is limited to a factor of less than 2 3 comparing results obtained for dcc 14c eq 6 and mw 14c table 1 it should be noted that this level of variability is similar to the variability observed between different measurement methods to determine nszd rates for example askarani et al 2018 showed that nszd rates determined via the co2 sorbent trap method and a temperature based method differed by a factor of 2 while kulkarni et al 2020 observed differences between nszd rates derived from co2 sorbent trap measurements and bgc corrected dynamic closed chamber measurements exceeding a factor of 2 the accuracy of nszd estimates might also be affected by spatial and temporal variability eichert et al 2017 askarani and sale 2020 nevertheless our study results indicate that radiocarbon correction with the sc and sp methods are most reliable in terms of representativeness and accuracy when quantifying nszd rates using dynamic closed chambers 6 conclusions analysis of radiocarbon samples obtained from the top port of nested soil gas monitoring wells 0 6 mbgs shallow soil gas probes 0 3 m bgs static chambers at surface and directly from dynamic closed chambers before and after efflux measurement allowed for an intercomparison of these four methods for deriving phc degradation rates from measured co2 effluxes overall results support findings by sihota and mayer 2012 who showed that radiocarbon correction provides an effective means for quantifying nszd rates from surface co2 efflux measurements however the results show that the sampling method for radiocarbon in co2 affects the magnitude of inferred nszd rates radiocarbon samples obtained from existing soil gas monitoring wells lead to an underestimation of the contribution from natural soil respiration and therefore an overestimation of nszd rates use of the dcc method for collecting radiocarbon samples is troubled by relatively low co2 concentrations in ambient air and in the sampling loop such that samples have marginal or even insufficient co2 for radiocarbon analysis and are therefore susceptible to increased analytical error increased sampling cost and complexity as well as limited accuracy of direct sampling from a dcc system makes this method less attractive for practical implementation at contaminated sites our results suggest that gas samples collected from static chambers provide representative f14c values of sufficient accuracy for quantifying nszd rates from co2 efflux measurements similarly radiocarbon correction using f14c obtained from shallow soil gas probes installed at a depth of 0 3 m was found to provide comparative estimates of nszd rates therefore both the sc and sp methods provide attractive alternatives for radiocarbon sample collection and analysis in the context of quantifying nszd rates at contaminated sites despite the differences all radiocarbon correction methods were in agreement within a factor of less than 2 3 when deriving nszd rates from measured co2 effluxes this finding implies that in a broader context all four methods yield acceptable results considering that quantifying nszd rates within a factor of 2 5 is often sufficient this is particularly true for mw sp and sc methods considering that radiocarbon samples are not collected directly from the dynamic closed chamber in this context spatial and temporal variations in effluxes and soil gas concentrations will also affect the accuracy of the inferred nszd rates notably the results of this study are generally applicable for phc contaminated sites and are not restricted to the bemidji crude oil spill research site in particular if the contamination is present in shallow and

1430,surficial co2 efflux surveys have been used to delineate hydrocarbon source zones in contaminated aquifers and provide estimates of hydrocarbon biodegradation rates this approach requires distinguishing between co2 derived from petroleum degradation and co2 produced from natural soil respiration to this end radiocarbon has been used to differentiate between 14c depleted co2 from hydrocarbon degradation and 14c enriched co2 from natural soil respiration to effectively quantify the contribution of each source to total co2 efflux and by deduction natural source zone depletion nszd rates in this study a systematic method comparison has been conducted to evaluate available approaches for collecting co2 gas samples for radiocarbon analysis used to correct total co2 efflux measurements for quantifying natural source zone depletion rates gas samples for radiocarbon analysis were sampled from i dynamic closed chambers located at ground surface ii static chambers also at ground surface iii shallow soil gas probes 0 3 m bgs and iv soil gas monitoring wells 0 6 m below ground surface during a co2 efflux survey conducted at the site of a historical pipeline rupture near bemidji mn the mean fraction of radiocarbon f14c obtained from samples overlying the source zone were i 0 93 0 01 ii 0 73 0 03 iii 0 71 0 04 and iv 0 41 0 06 for the four methods respectively these f14c values were used to apportion total co2 efflux measurements into contributions of contaminant derived co2 efflux and natural soil respiration to evaluate natural source zone depletion processes results suggest that the method of radiocarbon sampling has a significant effect on the calculated fraction of the co2 efflux originating from contaminant related soil respiration with contributions ranging between 27 and 59 of total soil respiration results indicate that radiocarbon sampled from static chambers and shallow soil gas probes methods offer the best compromise between co2 sample yield and sample representativeness providing the most reliable estimates of co2 effluxes originating from contaminant degradation however the results also show that for this study all methods agree within a factor of 2 3 regarding the inferred nszd rates keywords co2 efflux petroleum hydrocarbons natural source zone depletion radiocarbon 1 introduction implementing natural source zone depletion nszd as a long term management strategy has become an increasingly accepted practice at petroleum hydrocarbon phc contaminated sites garg et al 2017 sookhak et al 2019 the occurrence of phc biodegradation in the subsurface has been documented through monitoring long term biogeochemical changes of terminal electron acceptors in the saturated and vadose zones and characterizing the contributions of aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes to hydrocarbon mass depletion revesz et al 1995 cozzarelli et al 2001 amos et al 2005 bekins et al 2005 quantitative monitoring methods of nszd processes in unconfined aquifers have become an integral component of long term site management providing information on rates of contaminant degradation and source zone longevity garg et al 2017 kulkarni et al 2020 methods to quantify rates of nszd in hydrocarbon source zones are based on o2 demand for contaminant degradation quantified by the gradient method johnson et al 2006 or co2 production and release across the ground surface sihota et al 2011 mccoy et al 2015 methods relying on quantification of co2 release assume that co2 produced from contaminant degradation in the vadose zone and smear zone is predominately exported to the atmosphere via gas diffusion through the vadose zone reactive transport modelling of a shallow petroleum contaminated aquifer conducted by ng et al 2014 estimated that 82 93 of co2 produced from contaminant biodegradation was outgassed to the ground surface providing support for this assumption carbon dioxide production and release to the atmosphere can be quantified via co2 efflux measurements derived from co2 gradients in the vadose zone sihota et al 2011 or measured directly using dynamic closed chambers dcc sihota et al 2011 eichert et al 2017 or co2 sorbent traps mccoy et al 2015 these methods rely on measuring co2 emissions using non invasive co2 efflux surveys allowing for the assessment of depth integrated hydrocarbon degradation rates via naturally occurring biodegradation processes sihota et al 2011 sihota and mayer 2012 identifying co2 efflux attributed to contaminant related soil respiration can be correlated to depth integrated rates of contaminant mineralization sihota and mayer 2012 warren et al 2014 more recently alternative methods have been developed to estimate rates of nszd based on thermal gradients from exothermic microbial reactions occurring during contaminant degradation sweeney and ririe 2014 warren et al 2014 askarani and sale 2020 all these methods provide rate estimates of hydrocarbon loss via naturally occurring processes comparable to those obtained by late stage active remedial activities garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2020 a critical evaluation of nszd monitoring methods is important to ensure representative rate estimates are used to guide site management decisions kulkarni et al 2020 dynamic closed chamber techniques sihota et al 2011 and co2 sorbent traps mccoy et al 2015 measure total soil respired co2 efflux j tsr overlying phc contaminated source zones to provide an adequate estimate of nszd rates it is necessary to effectively distinguish between co2 emissions originating from contaminant degradation and co2 generated by naturally occurring soil respiration in previous studies it was found that j tsr measured overlying contaminant source zones is typically elevated in comparison to background locations e g sihota et al 2011 to identify the contribution of petroleum derived contaminant related soil respiration j csr to j tsr some previous studies have used a background correction bgc method sihota et al 2011 warren et al 2014 using this method average co2 effluxes associated with background natural soil respiration j nsr are estimated by calculating the mean efflux from measurements at pristine background locations unaffected by contaminants co2 effluxes associated with contaminant related soil respiration at locations overlying the contaminant source zone are then estimated by subtracting j nsr from j tsr based on the following equation eq 1 sihota et al 2011 1 j csr j tsr j nsr although this method is attractive for its simplicity several assumptions are made that affect the accuracy and representativeness of the results sihota and mayer 2012 the method assumes that the average background value for j nsr is also representative across the contaminated region which might not be the case due to differences in vegetation rochette et al 1991 soil and subsurface heterogeneity as well as other parameters affecting spatial variability fang et al 1998 and the impact of the contamination on root respiration and the decomposition of naturally occurring organic matter in the soil alternatively isotope analysis of co2 has been used to identify the contributions of phc degradation towards total co2 efflux sihota and mayer 2012 specifically radiocarbon 14c can be used to differentiate phc derived co2 from natural background co2 given that it is absent in hydrocarbons of geological age yet present at modern levels in soils and vegetation reimer et al 2013 the modern carbon standard mc has an established 14c 12c ratio of 1 18 10 12 and radiocarbon measurements are expressed as a fraction of modern carbon f14c today atmospheric co2 and natural co2 in the biosphere has an f14c that is close to 1 0 e g reimer et al 2013 clark 2015 several studies focusing on quantifying nszd at petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sites have already used radiocarbon correction to derive j csr from j tsr for example sihota and mayer 2012 used 14c isotopes to trace co2 derived from biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons at a historical pipeline rupture site near bemidji mn during their investigation warren et al 2014 samples for radiocarbon analyses were obtained from shallow monitoring ports of existing soil gas monitoring wells located in close proximity to dynamic closed flux chambers however collecting soil gas from existing monitoring wells does not guarantee that the measured f14c value of soil gas co2 is representative of the f14c value of co2 emitted at the surface similarly in subsequent dcc studies at decommissioned refinery sites sihota 2014 jourabchi et al 2016 eichert et al 2017 gas samples for radiocarbon analysis in co2 were collected directly from the dynamic closed chambers direct gas sample collection from the dynamic closed chambers ensures representativeness of the sample however co2 is already present in ambient air at the time of chamber closure making the determination of the contribution of j csr to j tsr based on measured f14c more complicated in addition to the methods introduced above alternative methods for collection of samples for radiocarbon analysis are available such as sampling from dedicated shallow hand augered soil gas probes aelion et al 2009 sihota 2014 or static chambers although radiocarbon analysis has been used to determine the fraction of contaminant related soil respiration in the context of dcc flux measurements a systematic comparison to evaluate the effect of the gas sampling methods on the accuracy of the radiocarbon correction as well as practicality and ease of application has not been completed to date the quantification of nszd rates and assessment of source zone longevity at contaminated sites via co2 efflux surveys benefits from evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and from identifying the most suitable and practical methods for radiocarbon sampling and correction representative sampling ultimately influences estimates of nszd rates that can be used in long term site management decisions particularly when comparing active lnapl management methods to passive management strategies relying on nszd garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2020 kulkarni et al 2020 in this study we present a comparison of radiocarbon sampling methods that was conducted at the well characterized usgs national crude oil spill research site in bemidji mn in august 2015 with the objective of identifying the most suitable methods for determining nszd rates from co2 efflux surveys this site was selected for our study because it is very well characterized providing ideal conditions for the method comparison with general applicability to sites of similar geology our work specifically focuses on complementing co2 efflux surveys performed with the dynamic closed chamber technique 2 study site this study was conducted at the usgs national crude oil spill research site near bemidji mn latitude 47 34 23 longitude 95 05 33 in 1979 a pipeline rupture released 1 7 106 l of crude oil into the environment hult and grabbe 1988 initial clean up efforts removed 75 of the released oil however an estimated 400 000 l infiltrated into the underlying aquifer where it accumulated in the unsaturated zone and at the water table which lies 6 8 m below ground surface mbgs hult and grabbe 1988 delin et al 1998 residual light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl remains predominantly in two pools the north pool which has been extensively characterized and is the focus of this study and the smaller south pool which accumulated to the southwest of the pipeline rupture delin et al 1998 the 20 m thick aquifer consists predominantly of glacial outwash composed of a mixture of sands gravel and lacustrine silts franzi 1988 previous site investigations have indicated the occurrence of biodegradation in the contaminant source zone e g bekins et al 2001 methane ch4 produced from microbial degradation diffuses upwards through the vadose zone but reacts with oxygen o2 2 4 mbgs creating an active methanotrophic zone transforming ch4 into co2 amos et al 2005 carbon dioxide is also directly produced by aerobic degradation of residual phcs in the vadose zone amos et al 2005 molins et al 2010 the investigation by sihota et al 2011 found average surficial co2 effluxes over the source zone at the bemidji site are almost double the effluxes at background locations confirming the occurrence of contaminant biodegradation the spatial distribution of co2 effluxes was found to adequately delineate the subsurface source zone by identifying a strong correlation between increased vadose zone co2 concentrations abundance of residual oil and elevated co2 effluxes sihota et al 2011 based on these measurements sihota et al 2011 were also able to provide estimates for nszd rates using the background correction method which were refined by sihota and mayer 2012 using radiocarbon corrected co2 effluxes subsequently warren et al 2014 correlated surface co2 efflux to the abundance of microbes and hydrocarbon loss from the subsurface while the study by sihota et al 2016 determined seasonal variabilities in nszd rates together these studies provide clear evidence that surficial co2 effluxes can be used to determine nszd rates if contaminant related soil respiration can be effectively separated from natural soil respiration 3 methods survey co2 efflux measurements were conducted from august 14 to august 19 2015 overlying the north pool lnapl source zone at bemidji mn radiocarbon 14c in co2 was analysed from gas samples collected using four different sampling methods fig 1 specifically gas samples were collected from 1 dynamic closed chambers dcc 2 static chambers sc 3 shallow soil gas probes sp 4 existing soil gas monitoring wells mw soil collars for dcc measurements scs and sps were placed within 1 0 m of existing mws along the north pool transect fig 2 to minimize differences in measurements due to spatial variability of soil gas concentrations and effluxes the source zone indicated in grey on fig 2 was considered as the region between well 1302 23 9 m up gradient and 1402 26 7 m down gradient of the center of the delineated free product along the north pool transect during the study groundwater levels measured by the usgs were approximately 9 3 m bgs at background well 310 and 6 6 6 8 m bgs 604 9015 in the center of north pool transect 3 1 co2 efflux measurements for the method intercomparison co2 efflux measurements were taken at 20 select locations situated approximately 5 15 m apart along the north pool transect following the method developed by sihota et al 2011 co2 efflux at each sampling location was measured using an li 8100a dynamic closed co2 flux survey chamber system equipped with an infrared gas analyser licor biosciences lincoln nebraska co2 effluxes were calculated for a 60 s measurement interval after a 30 s dead band to allow stabilization of co2 concentration trends in the chamber headspace prior to flux measurements sihota et al 2011 sihota and mayer 2012 the chamber tubing was purged prior to and after each measurement for 30 s as per the manufacturer s recommendations licor biosciences lincoln nebraska a polyvinyl chloride pvc collar 20 cm o d by 10 cm was inserted into the soil 3 5 cm at each measurement location at least 24 h prior to the first co2 efflux measurement to allow equilibration of gas effluxes after disturbance of the soil the chamber offset was averaged from three collar height measurements recorded and inputted in the li 8100a 4 0 software program at the time of the efflux measurement a complete description of the method can be found in sihota et al 2011 efflux measurements were performed three times a day over a period of three days the measurements were taken from 9 00 12 00 12 00 15 00 and 15 00 18 00 respectively the average of the co2 efflux measurements at each location were calculated and are referred to as the mean j tsr for each location on the transect each co2 efflux measurement location was positioned within a 1 0 m radius from existing soil gas monitoring wells along the north pool transect figs 2 and 3 3 2 gas sample collection gas samples for radiocarbon analysis were collected at the 20 co2 efflux measurement locations along the north pool transect using the four different methods figs 2 and 3 for the sc sp and mw methods 300 ml gas samples were extracted using a 100 ml luer lok gas tight syringe hamilton 1000 series and injected into 200 ml wheaton bottles fitted with butyl stoppers this sampling method minimizes the risk for atmospheric contamination during sample processing and provides sufficient sample for radiocarbon analysis larger volumes were collected from the dynamic closed chambers 400 ml samples collected in 250 ml wheaton bottles equipped with butyl stoppers to amend co2 mass in the sample for lower expected co2 concentrations relative to the other methods additional details on method specific sampling procedures are provided below gas samples for determination of co2 concentrations were also collected at the time of radiocarbon sample collection from static chambers shallow soil gas probes and soil gas monitoring wells these samples were inserted into pre evacuated 20 ml glass serum vials gas samples were not collected for the dcc method since the method continuously measures co2 concentrations via infra red gas analysis 3 2 1 direct sampling from dynamic closed chambers dcc in case of the dcc method two gas samples for radiocarbon analysis were taken at each measurement location on august 17 2015 the radiocarbon samples were taken from a t fitting equipped with a septa li 8100 664 trace gas adapter that was inserted into the air in line of the gas analyser fig 1a the initial sample was taken prior to survey co2 efflux measurements to assess whether the ambient radiocarbon content over the collar area is in fact close to atmospheric levels while the second sample was taken directly from the headspace of the closed chamber after completion of the co2 efflux measurement to assess change in f14c over the measurement interval the initial 400 ml gas sample was collected through the trace gas adapter using the gas tight syringe immediately prior to survey efflux measurements i e before the chamber closed subsequently the co2 efflux measurement was completed t 90 s and a second 400 ml sample was extracted from the trace gas adapter starting immediately after the flux measurement interval sample extraction was completed over a time period of 210 s the chamber remained closed during this time period the total time of chamber closure was 300 s 3 2 2 sampling from static chambers sc cylindrical closed top static chambers were constructed from 20 cm long sections of 20 cm id pvc piping with a serrated edge lower rim for penetration into soils fig 1b on august 16 2015 static chambers were inserted directly adjacent to dcc collar locations 0 1 m and left for 24 h to allow accumulation of soil gas in the chamber headspace vegetation was removed from the area covered by the chamber and a mallet was used to drive the chambers 5 6 cm into the ground after 24 h gas samples were collected using a gas tight syringe through a septa fitted to the center of the lid fig 1b and then injected into the pre evacuated wheaton bottles 3 2 3 sampling from shallow soil gas probes sp soil gas probes ams inc american falls id were driven into the ground 0 3 m bgs and allowed to equilibrate with the soil for 30 min at each measurement location the shallow soil gas probe was placed within 1 m of the existing

gas samples were analysed at the a e lalonde accelerator mass spectrometer laboratory in ottawa on canada the f14c was calculated following reimer et al 2013 where the ratio of 14c 12c of the sample is compared to a national bureau of standards nbs oxalic acid ii and normalized to the δ13c pdb eq 2 as described in crann et al 2016 2 f 14 c 14 c 12 c s a m p l e 14 c 12 c o x i i s t a n d a r d

radiocarbon correction the contribution of contaminant soil respiration co2 efflux j csr to total co2 efflux j tsr measured was calculated by determining the fraction of contaminant soil respiration f

contaminant soil respiration so that 3 f c s r 1 f n s r the f nsr of co2 efflux measurements can be quantified using f14c of the collected gas sample in the case of sample collection from shallow

the time of closure generally concentrations of co2 and its isotopic composition are expected to be close to atmospheric co2 i e co2 air 400 ppm and f14cair 1 when calculating f14c associated with co2 emitted from the subsurface it is therefore necessary to correct for the contribution of the gas that was initially present in the chamber for the chamber based methods dcc and sc f nsr can be calculated using the following mass balance equation based on the work of sihota 2014 and as modified by jourabchi et al 2016 5 f nsr f 14 c c f co 2 c f f 14 c air co 2 air co 2 c f co 2 air where

the co2 efflux measurement for the dcc method co2 c f corresponds to the average co2 concentration during sample collection for radiocarbon analysis which is considered the average concentration measured by the infrared gas analyser connected to the chamber over the gas sampling interval t 90 to 300 s after chamber closure for the sc method co2 c f is the concentration at the time of sample collection for radiocarbon analysis the concentration is obtained from a gas sample collected 24 h after placement of the static chamber considering that the chambers entrap air directly above the ground surface subjected to limited mixing with the air column it is necessary to verify whether concentrations and isotopic signature prior to chamber closure indeed correspond to those of ambient air the method most affected is the dcc method considering the chamber closure time is limited to 300 s and the increase of co2 concentrations within the chamber headspace in comparison to atmospheric co2 concentrations is modest to address this uncertainty we utilized gas samples collected directly before chamber closure using these additional samples f nsr of the emitted gas can be calculated as 6 f nsr f 14 c c f co 2 c f f 14 c c i co 2 c i co 2 c f co 2 c i where f14cc i is the initial fraction of modern carbon measured for the gas sample collected from the chamber headspace prior to the co2 efflux measurement and co2 c i is the initial concentration of co2 in the chamber at t 0 comparison of f nsr values obtained using eqs 5 and 6 allows to determine the effect of assuming atmospheric conditions at the time of chamber closure and to determine whether the collection and costly analysis of the initial sample for radiocarbon in co2 is necessary if f nsr is known f csr can be calculated based on eq 3 and the petroleum derived contaminant soil respiration co2 efflux j csr can be quantified by multiplying j tsr with f csr 7 j csr f csr j tsr during the co2 efflux field investigation at bemidji mn usgs national crude oil spill research site from august 14 to 19 2015 j tsr was taken as the average total co2 efflux measured by the li 8100a flux chamber over the 3 day

locations 9103 533 9101 532 518 531 and 530 ranged from 2 8 0 2 μmol m 2 s 1 to 5 1 0 5 μmol m 2 s 1 mean 3 9 0 3 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 upgradient location 603 in the spray zone 118 4 m up gradient which is characterized by hydrophobic soils as well as increased vegetation in comparison to other collar locations in the spray zone delin et al 1998 had an average j tsr of 5 7 0 9 μmol m 2 s 1 while location 604 showed effluxes similar to background location 310 fig 4 4 2 co2 concentrations gas samples collected from the shallow ports of the soil gas monitoring wells mw had the highest co2 concentrations on average 0 83 0 2 v v across the north pool transect with a maximum value of 2 6 0 038 v v 1302 the volumetric concentration of co2 from samples collected from the shallow soil gas probes sp along the north pool transect reached up to 0 49 0 007 v v 9015 with an average value of 0 21 0003 v v while samples collected from the static chambers sc reached up to 0 21 0 004 v v 534 with an average value of 0 13 0 003 v v the co2 concentrations measured directly by the dynamic closed chamber system dcc ranged from 0 038 0 001 to 0 041 0 001 v v atmosphere prior to chamber closure with an average value of 0 039 0 001 v v consistently reflecting ambient atmospheric co2 concentrations average co2 concentrations measured at the end of the sampling cycle t 300 s from the dynamic closed chambers at t 300 s was 0 049 0 001 v v with a maximum value of 0 059 0 001 v v 9014 time averaged concentrations during radiocarbon sample collection between t 90 s and t 300 s reached a maximum value of 0 052 0 001 v v 9014 and 9015 with a mean concentration of 0 046 0 001 v v table s1 supporting information provides a summary of the measured co2 concentrations for the four methods 4 3 radiocarbon 14c measurements the f14c samples collected along the north pool transect showed a trend of increased depletion of f14c with increasing proximity to the source zone for all four methods fig 5 table s2 gas samples at each sampling location showed increased radiocarbon depletion with increasing depth of sample collection as a function of the method samples collected directly from the dcc 0 m bgs were closest to modern fig 5a and mw samples 0 6mbgs showed the lowest f14c fig 5d for example at location 9017 23 2 m up gradient radiocarbon f14c ranged from 0 90 0 013 0 mbgs to 0 57 0 003 0 m bgs 0 48 0 002 0 3 m bgs and 0 35 0 003 0 6 m bgs for dcc after co2 efflux measurement sc sp and mw samples respectively at background location 310 200 8 m up gradient radiocarbon measured f14c values were 0 95 0 002 dcc prior to chamber closure 1 00 0 006 sc 0 95 0 012 sp and 0 96 0 007 mw ambient air samples collected directly from the dcc prior to the efflux measurement were consistently showing modern 14c signature f14c 1 022 0 0013 9016 f14c 0 930 0 0177 1402 with no apparent correlation between distance from the center of the source zone and depletion of the 14c isotope samples taken prior to chamber measurements were more enriched with 14c isotopes than the sample taken after co2 flux measurement with the exception of one source zone location 1402 and most down gradient locations see table s2 in supporting information at these sites 14c prior to and after chamber closure were both close to atmospheric conditions the f14c of gas samples collected along the north pool transect deviates from a modern 14c signature for sites overlying known residual oil delin et al 1998 sihota and mayer 2012 amos et al 2005 using all four sampling methods the results obtained with all sampling methods show that emitted co2 in the source zone and spray zone is characterized by significantly lower mean f14c than emitted co2 at the background location 310 and down gradient locations table s2 the mean f14c collected from dcc sc sp and mw sample after efflux measurement in the source zone were 0 93 0 01 0 73 0 03 0 71 0 04 and 0 41 0 06 respectively these observations mirror findings of sihota and mayer 2012 who determined significant differences in the radiocarbon of co2 in soil gas between contaminated background and downgradient locations 4 4 determination of co2 efflux related to contaminant soil respiration j csr radiocarbon results and co2 concentrations for dcc and sc methods were used to calculate the fraction of the co2 efflux derived from microbial degradation f csr of phcs using eq 3 with f nsr obtained from eq 4 sp and mw and 5 dcc and sc samples collected from surface efflux methods dcc and sc were processed considering the radiocarbon signature of ambient air f14c 1 0 co2 400 ppm assumed to be initially present in the chambers while samples collected using the sp and mw methods do not require this correction for the dcc method f nsr was alternatively determined using eq 6 which makes use of initial measured radiocarbon and co2 concentration values fluxes for j csr were then calculated from j tsr measurements using the f csr correction factor based on eq 7 and are summarized in fig 6 prior to comparison of j csr for the different methods it is useful to compare f csr which is the parameter defining the contribution of contaminant soil respiration towards total soil respiration see table s3 this approach provides a metric for intercomparison of the different sampling approaches without the added complexity introduced by the variation of the magnitude of co2 effluxes as a function of location focusing on the source zone the mean f csr values calculated using eq 5 for dcc and sc samples were 0 45 0 14 and 0 32 0 01 respectively alternatively using eq 6 for the dcc samples yield a calculated average f csr of 0 27 0 22 the sp and mw radiocarbon data analysed using eq 4 resulted in calculated f csr 0 29 0 006 sp and 0 59 0 002 mw respectively together these results suggest that the method of radiocarbon sampling has a significant effect on the calculated fraction of the co2 efflux originating from contaminant related soil respiration with contributions ranging between 27 and 59 of total soil respiration at the background location 310 f csr values calculated using the sc sp and mw methods ranged between 0 00 and 0 05 indicating that contaminated related soil respiration is negligible at this location and showing that the methods are in good agreement f csr values obtained for the spray zone were similar to those of the source zone while all methods show lower f csr values in the downgradient regions table s3 all four methods demonstrated a decrease in radiocarbon corrected j csr with increased distance up and down gradient of the center of the source zone with the exception of select locations in the spray zone which are also significantly impacted by degradation of residual phc fig 6 in the source zone the average j csr is calculated as 2 3 0 72 1 7 0 12 1 5 0 08 and 3 2 0 1 μmol m 2 s 1 for dcc sc sp and mw methods respectively fig 6 table s4 if eq 6 is used to determine j csr for the dcc method the average j csr in the source zone is 1 4 1 1 μmol m 2 s 1 table s4 fig s1 while all methods are able to quantify an increase in j csr in the source zone the magnitude of the effluxes attributed to contaminant degradation varies substantially 5 discussion although the dcc method has the advantage that radiocarbon samples are directly extracted from the chamber i e directly obtained from the gas that is emitted from the ground the method also poses challenges as can be seen in fig 6a and fig s1 see also table s4 absolute errors associated with this sampling technique are relatively large in comparison to the other three methods examination of eqs 5 and 6 as well as co2 concentrations and radiocarbon values tables s1 and s2 reveal that the relatively large errors are due to small differences between final co2 concentrations and the corresponding radiocarbon signature relative to initial values prior to chamber closure the determination of f nsr and therefore f csr is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the measured co2 concentrations and f14c both after the flux measurement and prior to chamber closure in case of eq 6 comparison of average initial co2 concentration values in the source zone 392 ppm to the assumed value in air 400 ppm and the corresponding f14c value 0 98 vs 1 0 suggests that the assumptions behind eq 5 are adequate in principle however despite these very small differences in assumed and measured initial co2 concentrations and f14c 2 results show that using eqs 5 and 6 lead to substantially different mean values for f csr and j csr in the source zone f csr 0 45 vs 0 27 respectively and j csr 2 3 vs 1 4 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively this observation highlights the sensitivity of both methods towards the accuracy of concentration and radiocarbon measurements although eq 6 provides in principle a better estimation of f csr and j csr than eq 5 the cumulative errors associated with this method are large fig s1 table s3 and s4 at several locations in particular in regions with limited contaminant related soil respiration downgradient zone the determined values for f csr and j csr were negative providing non physical results tables s3 and s4 generally the large errors of the dcc method using eqs 5 and 6 were also affected by lower than recommended co2 concentrations for radiocarbon analysis 0 2 mg carbon this is due to low co2 concentrations and the limited sample size that can be extracted from the chamber system increasing the sample volume for laboratory analysis would increase the accuracy of the dcc method for future studies this could be achieved by either increasing the gas volume from 400 ml to 1000 ml or conversely extending the length of the efflux measurement to allow for higher concentration to build up in the chamber headspace mimicking static chamber conditions increasing the sample size to 1000 ml is problematic since such a large volume constitutes a large fraction of the chamber headspace volume in a subsequent study at a former refinery site in british columbia jourabchi et al 2018 reduced the error of the dcc method by increasing the length of the chamber measurement until concentrations in the chamber headspace were 1000 ppm this improvement to the dcc method increases the accuracy of the j csr correction however it also increases sampling time and restricts the number of efflux measurements that can be conducted in a given time frame using a dcc system in summary although the dcc method provides the most representative samples for co2 and f14c the accuracy of the method is limited in addition costs for f14c analysis are high if eq 6 is used to determine f csr and j csr since f14c must be determined prior to and after the efflux measurement fig 6 and tables s3 and s4 show that the highest f csr and j csr were obtained using the mw method these results are due to the high degree of radiocarbon depletion fig 5 table s2 in the samples collected from the wells significantly lower f14c values obtained from mw samples can be attributed to closer proximity to the lnapl source in comparison shallower sampling methods dcc sc sp account for mixing with ambient air and co2 generated in the shallow soil which more accurately reflect the composition of co2 efflux measured at the ground surface previous subsurface soil gas characterization conducted at bemidji mn by amos et al 2005 and sihota and mayer 2012 found sharp transition for soil gases for elevated co2 with increasing depth corresponding to depleted f14c with depth therefore radiocarbon signatures of samples obtained from 0 6 m bgs are not considered representative of co2 emitted at surface which are diluted by modern atmospheric co2 although this method is attractive for its simplicity in particular in the presence of an existing monitoring network and relatively low error it will tend to overestimate f csr and j csr the remaining methods sc and sp provide attractive alternatives for radiocarbon sample collection the sc method has the advantage that gas samples are collected directly at the ground surface however similar to the dcc method mixing with ambient air prior to static chamber placement must be taken into account errors associated with this method are much lower than with the dcc method fig 6 tables s3 and s4 since the chamber is left in place for 24 h and co2 concentrations at the time of sample collection are higher using sampling devices dedicated to sampling locations is possible with the sc method due to the low cost of static chambers the inferred values for f csr and j csr are considered more representative than for the mw method and more accurate than the dcc method as presented here conversely the 24 h deployment period of the sc method implies that the measured f14c co2 value is representative for a longer time period than covered by the short efflux measurement of the dynamic closed chambers 2 min sihota et al 2016 documented seasonal variability of f14c co2 measurements however shorter term diurnal variability in f14c co2 in nszd studies has not be examined in the literature it is well known that soil respiration processes show diurnal variations subke et al 2003 riveros iregui et al 2007 it can therefore be expected that f14c co2 in the emitted gas will vary over a 24 h time period possibly compromising the representativeness of the 14c sample for the period of the co2 efflux measurement with the adjacent dynamic closed chambers the sp method yields similar results in magnitude to the sc method since samples are collected closer to the ground surface than using the mw method f14c values are considered more representative although not as representative as f14c obtained via the sc method on the upside the sp method is not affected by mixing its precision is higher than that of the sc method and the sample collection is instantaneous and can be coordinated with the efflux measurement all four methods in this study are comparable to previous nszd estimates at bemidji mn using the dynamic closed chamber method table 1 data obtained from the top port of soil gas monitoring wells obtained from sihota and mayer 2012 is similar to the magnitude measured during the 2015 co2 efflux survey a quantitative comparison of results from this study for the different methods reveals that the variability between the various methods is limited to a factor of less than 2 3 comparing results obtained for dcc 14c eq 6 and mw 14c table 1 it should be noted that this level of variability is similar to the variability observed between different measurement methods to determine nszd rates for example askarani et al 2018 showed that nszd rates determined via the co2 sorbent trap method and a temperature based method differed by a factor of 2 while kulkarni et al 2020 observed differences between nszd rates derived from co2 sorbent trap measurements and bgc corrected dynamic closed chamber measurements exceeding a factor of 2 the accuracy of nszd estimates might also be affected by spatial and temporal variability eichert et al 2017 askarani and sale 2020 nevertheless our study results indicate that radiocarbon correction with the sc and sp methods are most reliable in terms of representativeness and accuracy when quantifying nszd rates using dynamic closed chambers 6 conclusions analysis of radiocarbon samples obtained from the top port of nested soil gas monitoring wells 0 6 mbgs shallow soil gas probes 0 3 m bgs static chambers at surface and directly from dynamic closed chambers before and after efflux measurement allowed for an intercomparison of these four methods for deriving phc degradation rates from measured co2 effluxes overall results support findings by sihota and mayer 2012 who showed that radiocarbon correction provides an effective means for quantifying nszd rates from surface co2 efflux measurements however the results show that the sampling method for radiocarbon in co2 affects the magnitude of inferred nszd rates radiocarbon samples obtained from existing soil gas monitoring wells lead to an underestimation of the contribution from natural soil respiration and therefore an overestimation of nszd rates use of the dcc method for collecting radiocarbon samples is troubled by relatively low co2 concentrations in ambient air and in the sampling loop such that samples have marginal or even insufficient co2 for radiocarbon analysis and are therefore susceptible to increased analytical error increased sampling cost and complexity as well as limited accuracy of direct sampling from a dcc system makes this method less attractive for practical implementation at contaminated sites our results suggest that gas samples collected from static chambers provide representative f14c values of sufficient accuracy for quantifying nszd rates from co2 efflux measurements similarly radiocarbon correction using f14c obtained from shallow soil gas probes installed at a depth of 0 3 m was found to provide comparative estimates of nszd rates therefore both the sc and sp methods provide attractive alternatives for radiocarbon sample collection and analysis in the context of quantifying nszd rates at contaminated sites despite the differences all radiocarbon correction methods were in agreement within a factor of less than 2 3 when deriving nszd rates from measured co2 effluxes this finding implies that in a broader context all four methods yield acceptable results considering that quantifying nszd rates within a factor of 2 5 is often sufficient this is particularly true for mw sp and sc methods considering that radiocarbon samples are not collected directly from the dynamic closed chamber in this context spatial and temporal variations in effluxes and soil gas concentrations will also affect the accuracy of the inferred nszd rates notably the results of this study are generally applicable for phc contaminated sites and are not restricted to the bemidji crude oil spill research site in particular if the contamination is present in shallow and

1431,given the interest in accurately predicting the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d x within the fields of hydraulic and water quality modeling a wide range of methods have been used to estimate this parameter in order to improve the accuracy of d x predictions this paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional network dcn a sub field of machine learning the proposed deep neural network architecture consists of two parts first a one dimensional convolutional neural network cnn to build informative feature maps and second a stack of deep fully connected layers to estimate pollution dispersion as d x in streams to accurately predict d x the developed model draws upon a large and diverse array of datasets in the form of three dimensionless parameters width depth w h velocity shear velocity u u and longitudinal dispersion coefficient depth shear velocity d x hu the model s accuracy is compared to that of several empirical models using a number of statistical measures in addition the dcn model results are compared with artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm models implemented in this research and also similar studies applying various machine learning models ml towards d x prediction the statistical evaluation indicates that the dcn model outperforms the tested empirical ann svm and ml models with a significant difference additionally five fold cross validation is performed to analyze the sensitivity and dependency of the dcn model s results on dataset selection which shows that the dataset selection process does not significantly affect the model s accuracy since both ml and empirical models are in general poor predictors of the upper and lower ranges of d x values the dcn model s predictions of d x in six different extreme value ranges are assessed the dcn model shows excellent accuracy in estimating d x over the full possible range of data in comparison with the empirical and ml models mentioned above the dcn model more accurately predicts d x values from river geometry and hydraulic datasets with low errors across all ranges of d x the most significant advantage of dcn is that it tries to learn high level features from data in an incremental manner keywords longitudinal dispersion coefficient machine learning deep convolutional network water quality modeling uncertainty analysis five fold cross validation 1 introduction the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d x is a critical parameter in simulating the fate and transport of soluble pollution in water quality modeling a key issue in the understanding and management of the pollution of water bodies e g rivers estuaries lakes seas and oceans d x represents the spreading of a pollutant within a water body and is an essential consideration for river managers environmental engineers institutional researchers and others involved in water quality management deng et al 2001 the dispersion coefficient which considers the longitudinal lateral and vertical dispersion d x d y d z respectively of a pollutant is a measure of a surface water body s ability to disperse a pollutant through the medium water along three dimensions deng et al 2002 taylor 1953 1954 introduced a one dimensional version of the advection dispersion equation based on fick s law eq 1 1 c t u c x d x 2 c x 2 where t is time s x is the longitudinal coordinate oriented in the direction of the mean streamflow m c is the cross sectional mean pollutant concentration kg m 3 d x is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 u is the mean longitudinal velocity m s to predict d x in a river the effect of a range of variables has been assessed and according to dimensional analysis the width w depth h velocity u and shear velocity u are the most important parameters noori et al 2017 seo and cheong 1998 seo and baek 2004 fischer 1967 elder 1959 koussis and rodríguez mirasol 1998 for natural rivers three main methods are used to determine d x the first is the flow structure method that directly quantifies the physical processes governing dispersion the second is an experimental approach that traces a conservative pollutant s concentration along the river from a release point the third uses an empirical equation that is derived by considering d x and the river s geometric flow characteristics balf et al 2018 carrying out the measurements required by the flow structure method is rarely feasible and significant errors are common when tracing conservative pollutants due to the difficulty in evaluating distribution variances caused by elongated and poorly defined pollutant trails due to these challenges the empirical equation approach has been acceptable among engineers wallis and manson 2004 alternative approaches and measurements have been used to predict d x including artificial neural networks anns tayfur and singh 2005 noori et al 2011a 2011b support vector machines svm azamathulla and wu 2011 noori et al 2011a 2011b the m5 model etemad shahidi and taghipour 2012 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis riahi madvar et al 2009 and granular computing gc noori et al 2017 ghiasi et al 2019 according to the above mentioned d x prediction studies there is significant variability among model parameters for a single river intra river variance in the riverine physical attributes allows for a wide range of d x values e g 0 005 to 1800 m2 s 1 therefore model accuracy in estimating d x which may be poor for upper and lower range values must be evaluated over the full range of output values investigations of the empirical formulas performances showed that empirical models are often poor estimators of high or low d x values additionally even if the empirical model estimates high and low values precisely unacceptably poor predictions may be made in some cases the empirical model may generate nil or negative values of d x many previously proposed artificial intelligence ai models often presented as black boxes have also been poor predictors of extremely low and high d x values noori et al 2015 given the even wider variance of riverine physical attributes between rivers the range of d x values will vary widely between rivers accordingly a model proposed for the prediction of d x for all rivers should perform acceptably across the full range of river specific d x values and a universal model must consider most possible ranges of riverine physical properties in order to accurately estimate d x over its full range for a wide variety of rivers deep neural networks have shown promising results in various fields the deep neural network models have a good performance in a wide range and high variance datasets liu et al 2017 jodeiri et al 2019 therefore considering the conditions of different rivers in larger river datasets and the weakness of ml models in estimating datasets with high variance the new deep neural network models are suitable for estimating the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the current study presents an application of deep learning to the implementation of a backpropagation algorithm lecunlecun et al 2015 designed to extract the inherent structure of large datasets containing the hydraulic characteristics of different rivers thereby facilitating improved estimation of d x generally considered a sub field of machine learning schmidhuber 2015 deep learning models have the advantage of being able to automatically learn high level layered hierarchical abstractions from data and map the extracted features to desired labels through end to end training shen 2018 summarizes the most impactful areas for deep learning application in water sciences and suggests that deep learning is vital for harnessing the power of big data in water resource management amidst the emergence of new data sources such as remote sensing images convolutional neural networks cnns as one of the major categories of deep learning methods are widely used in the field of computer vision to achieve automatic feature extraction though they are primarily employed towards two or three dimensional image and video projects jodeiri et al 2019 jodeiri et al 2018 cnns have also shown the ability to extract deep features from unidimensional data such as speech signals or vectors of raw input data sainath et al 2015 various studies have explored the use of cnns in water resource management including in identifying and classifying diatoms libreros et al 2018 classifying wetlands rezaee et al 2018 estimating water levels xu et al 2018 forecasting rainfall runoff li et al 2018 miao et al 2019 measuring river wetted width ling et al 2019 and quantifying dynamic multiphase flow in heterogeneous media mo et al 2018 in contrast to other empirical and ai based methods that have been applied for d x prediction a deep learning approach opens up new possibilities that were previously infeasible by providing an integrated accurate and fully automatic system for future water pollution research therefore the main objective of the currents study is using deep learning approach based model for d x estimation with high precision and low error in all ranges low and high values of d x with low uncertainty so that the input and output data selection has little effect on the performance and accuracy of the model the current study proposes a cnn based algorithm that can extract specific abstract patterns from each riverine dataset to determine the distinctiveness of each case and to map the input samples directly to their corresponding labels accordingly the goal of the present study is to develop an ml model based on a deep convolutional network model dcn that improves on the performance of previous models for all d x ranges for this purpose the accuracy and uncertainty of the dcn model especially in the extremities of the possible ranges of d x and riverine attributes were analyzed using a five fold cross validation method 2 methodology 2 1 data description a total of 503 riverine datasets were collected from past research for use in the current study deng et al 2001 kashefipour and falconer 2002 carr and rehmann 2007 riahi madvar et al 2009 ahmad 2013 each dataset includes width m depth m stream velocity m s and shear velocity m s as well as the observed d x m2 s 1 table 1 summarizes the dataset properties 80 of the 503 datasets were used in the training process while the remaining datasets were used for model testing according to the dimensional analysis of all parameters affecting the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of the river in previous studies their physical impact can be summarized in the form of two width w depth h and velocity u shear velocity u dimensionless parameters noori et al 2017 seo and cheong 1998 also the relationship between the dimensionless parameters w h and u u with d x h u is much greater than the relationship between the dimensions parameters w h u and u with dx noori et al 2017 therefore datasets were entered into the model as three dimensionless sets w h and u u as model input data and d x h u as the model output 2 2 network architecture of the proposed dcn model the dcn model consists of two main blocks the feature extraction and classification blocks that are connected by a flattened layer fig 1 for the automatic extraction of feature maps from 2 1 raw input samples a one dimensional cnn with a 3 1 kernel size ten feature maps and the non linear relu activation function was used the classification block contains three fully connected layers with a relu activation function following each layer except for the last layer where the linear function was employed for regression the number of activation neurons of the fully connected layers was 256 16 and 1 respectively in order to prevent over fitting due to the relatively large number of trainable parameters an 80 drop out layer was added after the flattened layer the convolutional and fully connected layers play different roles in our proposed model the convolutional layers extract 10 different patterns that are related to the target value when used as inputs these extracted patterns improve the model s ability to distinguish among input samples in comparison with a case that raw data is given directly to the classifier the fully connected layers provide a powerful environment for mapping the input features to the corresponding labels through backward error propagation 2 3 implementation details the dcn model was implemented using the tensorflow library and optimized using the adam algorithm with a 0 0002 learning rate this project was treated as a regression problem therefore the root mean square error rmse was selected as the loss function rmse is a quadratic scoring rule that calculates the average of the squared differences between prediction and actual value effectively measuring the average magnitude of the error rmse is often applied in regression problems as its smooth differentiability facilitates mathematical operations chai and draxler 2014 the adam optimization algorithm is used for minimization of the loss function through a given number of epochs kingma and ba 2014 at each epoch a mini batch size of 50 samples was randomly selected from the training images and fed into the network for parameterization the network converged at 300 epochs no data augmentation nor pre training weights were used during the network s training the model was implemented on a workstation with a core i7 and 3 4 ghz cpu with 8gb ram and an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 gpu it is notable that 70 microsecond takes for each epoch and consequently 21 milliseconds for model training 300 epochs 2 4 evaluation statistics various statistical measures exist to assess how close the predicted data are to the observed data for this study coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse normalized mean bias error nmbe median absolute percentage error mdape average absolute relative error aare nashe sutcliffe coefficient nse and index of agreement ia were used to assess the model accuracy in predicting k x dawson et al 2007 these statistics were used to compare the results obtained in the current study with those of empirical models by fischer 1967 seo and cheong 1998 deng et al 2001 kashefipour and falconer 2002 sahay and dutta 2009 zeng and huai 2014 disley et al 2015 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 and noori et al 2017 to compare the accuracy of the developed dcn model with

the results obtained in the current study with those of other studies the d x for all datasets was also predicted using the empirical equations presented by fischer 1967 seo and cheong 1998 deng et al

dcn model achieved the highest r2 value r2 0 9965 while the equations from fischer 1967 achieved the poorest r2 0 0287 the other empirical models had an average r2 of 0 154 the second most accurate model was that of noori et al 2017 with an r2 of 0 209 these results highlight the improved accuracy of the dcn model over the tested empirical methods in terms of rmse the dcn model rmse 12 7751 was

disley et al 2015 showing an aare of 46 304 299 over 9000 times greater than that of the dcn model 5 079 results of the ia and nse also support the improved accuracy of the dcn model over the empirical methods fig 3 note that the nse value for fischer 1967 at 1073 is considered to diverge excessively from that of the other models and has therefore been removed from fig 3 to improve readability fig 4 depicts the accuracy of the different models based on their aare nmbe nrmse and mdape 3 3 comparison of the dcn model with other ml methods in order to better understand the benefits of the dcn model for d x prediction the results of the dcn model have been contrasted with the results of other ml models applied to the same purpose table 4 presents a summary of the proposed methods including the type of model the number of data used in each method along with the corresponding rmse and r2 values the results of the current study and those of the granular computing gc and granular computing neural network grc ann algorithm presented by noori et al 2017 and ghiasi et al 2019 predicted d x most precisely in contrast to the other methods the r2 for the dcn model is slightly higher than that of the gc model however the rmse of the gc model is smaller it should be noted that the gc model uses three input parameters including river curvature noori et al 2017 which increases the accuracy of the model in addition the gc model uses only 70 datasets for the training and testing steps noori et al 2017 while the current study uses 503 datasets since increasing the number of big data the d x 500 values in 503 datasets was four times more than 70 data increases rmse the statistical analysis results may be skewed in favor of the gc model the effect of not using the river curvature parameter and increasing the number of data that leads to a decrease in model accuracy decrease in r2 and increase in rmse is tangible in the grc ann model the developed gc model in ghiasi et al 2019 comparing the results of the recent studied models using 503 data shows that the estimation of d x with 503 data and high accuracy is very difficult so that the rmse of these studies are approximately 40 to 56 times the dcn model also the rmse of ann and svm models is about eight times the rmse of dcn model therefore the dcn model performs much better than other ml and gc models these results support the argument that the dcn model is among the most accurate ml models for d x prediction 3 4 accuracy in the extreme range in general both ml and empirical models perform more poorly when applied to the prediction of extreme upper and lower output values noori et al 2015 to further support the accuracy of the dcn model the r2 values of the model s d x predictions in six different extreme value ranges were compared table 5 the lower extreme value ranges were defined as values of d x less than 1 0 1 and 0 03 m2 s 1 while the upper extreme value ranges were values of d x exceeding 10 100 and 300 m2 s 1 the dcn model obtained the most inadequate performance in the d x 0 03 range though with an r2 0 9263 in this range the dcn model still significantly outperformed other empirical models over the entire range of data overall the dcn model was found to be more accurate in the upper ranges of the data than in the lower ranges though the model was the most accurate in predicting the middle range of d x values the results indicated that the model performance declines significantly when d x 0 03 since in the extreme ranges the number of samples for model training is rare the model performance decrease in fact there is a strong relationship between the number of samples in each arbitrary range and the performance of the system in that range the distribution of both the predicted and observed d x values when above 300 m2 s 1 fig 5 and below 0 03 m2 s 1 fig 6 depicts the accuracy of the dcn model when predicting extreme values of d x the dcn model showed an acceptable performance in both the upper and lower ranges with a high level of agreement between predicted and observed values in both cases 3 5 uncertainty analysis five fold cross validation of the dcn model was used to assess the dependency of the results on the chosen test datasets when averaged across all five experiments an r2 0 9961 0 0011 mean standard deviation was achieved for the training phase and an r2 0 9969 0 0045 was achieved for the testing phase these result indicate that the combination of datasets selected for the training and testing phases does not significantly influence the model s r2 which implies that the accuracy of the model is not dependent on the datasets selected fig 7 indicates that the range of variation in all three phases of the dcn model the training testing and full data assessment phases was minimal although the error for the training and all data modeling phases are almost identical the testing phase shows the lowest nrmse in the four different model runs and highest nrmse in one model run because of the considerable variance difference between the train and test dataset in five fold cross validation runs fig 8 depicts the nrmse results for the main run of the dcn model and the five fold cross validation fig 8 shows that only in the fourth run due to the placement of high variance data in the test dataset the nrmse value of this step is slightly higher and therefore to achieve the best model performance and accuracy the train and test data should be selected well however according to the deficient error of all runs in the calibration and testing steps the data selection method has minimal impact on the model performance and the dcn model can provide results with high accuracy in a wide range of d x data 4 conclusions d x is a vital parameter in simulating the dissemination of a pollutant within water streams many different methods and have been used to estimate d x each with benefits and weaknesses using 503 subsets of data from a wide range of streams 0 0048 d x 1798 6029 m 2 s 1 the current study explores the development and employment of a cnn based deep learning algorithm able to extract specific abstract patterns from distinct riverine datasets and to map these directly to corresponding labels in order to more accurately predict the d x parameter in the proposed deep convolutional network dcn method feature maps were automatically extracted using a convolutional neural network cnn after which a stack of fully connected layers analyzed the feature maps to estimate the pollution dispersion as d x in streams the main limitation of the dcn model is the black box architecture which makes it hard to find the reason for the poor results in some cases or interpret the output of the feature extractor block various statistical measures were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the dcn model in predicting d x in streams in comparison to a range of empirical and ml models the results indicated that the dcn model r2 0 9965 is far more accurate than the empirical models average r2 0 154 similarly the average rmse for the empirical models used to predict d x was 1146 5984 versus only 12 7751 for the dcn model this is a considerable difference considering that the rmse of the next most accurate model was 382 1659 other statistics nse ia nrmse nmbe mdape and aare were used to assess the models accuracy in predicting d x and each confirmed that the dcn model outperformed the studied empirical models in addition the results of the current study were compared with ann and svm models implemented in this study and other studies that applied ml models to predict d x in streams according to these analysis results the current dcn model represents an improvement over existing ai based methods with a high difference a five fold cross validation process showed that the combination of datasets selected for the training and testing phases of the dcn model had the lowest significant influence on either the r2 or the nrmse implying that the model s accuracy in predicting d x was not dependent on the chosen combinations of datasets thus the dcn model was found to outperform the considered empirical and ml methods in d x prediction using river geometry datasets and hydraulic parameters offering improved accuracy and lower error across all ranges of d x declaration of

1431,given the interest in accurately predicting the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d x within the fields of hydraulic and water quality modeling a wide range of methods have been used to estimate this parameter in order to improve the accuracy of d x predictions this paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional network dcn a sub field of machine learning the proposed deep neural network architecture consists of two parts first a one dimensional convolutional neural network cnn to build informative feature maps and second a stack of deep fully connected layers to estimate pollution dispersion as d x in streams to accurately predict d x the developed model draws upon a large and diverse array of datasets in the form of three dimensionless parameters width depth w h velocity shear velocity u u and longitudinal dispersion coefficient depth shear velocity d x hu the model s accuracy is compared to that of several empirical models using a number of statistical measures in addition the dcn model results are compared with artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm models implemented in this research and also similar studies applying various machine learning models ml towards d x prediction the statistical evaluation indicates that the dcn model outperforms the tested empirical ann svm and ml models with a significant difference additionally five fold cross validation is performed to analyze the sensitivity and dependency of the dcn model s results on dataset selection which shows that the dataset selection process does not significantly affect the model s accuracy since both ml and empirical models are in general poor predictors of the upper and lower ranges of d x values the dcn model s predictions of d x in six different extreme value ranges are assessed the dcn model shows excellent accuracy in estimating d x over the full possible range of data in comparison with the empirical and ml models mentioned above the dcn model more accurately predicts d x values from river geometry and hydraulic datasets with low errors across all ranges of d x the most significant advantage of dcn is that it tries to learn high level features from data in an incremental manner keywords longitudinal dispersion coefficient machine learning deep convolutional network water quality modeling uncertainty analysis five fold cross validation 1 introduction the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d x is a critical parameter in simulating the fate and transport of soluble pollution in water quality modeling a key issue in the understanding and management of the pollution of water bodies e g rivers estuaries lakes seas and oceans d x represents the spreading of a pollutant within a water body and is an essential consideration for river managers environmental engineers institutional researchers and others involved in water quality management deng et al 2001 the dispersion coefficient which considers the longitudinal lateral and vertical dispersion d x d y d z respectively of a pollutant is a measure of a surface water body s ability to disperse a pollutant through the medium water along three dimensions deng et al 2002 taylor 1953 1954 introduced a one dimensional version of the advection dispersion equation based on fick s law eq 1 1 c t u c x d x 2 c x 2 where t is time s x is the longitudinal coordinate oriented in the direction of the mean streamflow m c is the cross sectional mean pollutant concentration kg m 3 d x is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 u is the mean longitudinal velocity m s to predict d x in a river the effect of a range of variables has been assessed and according to dimensional analysis the width w depth h velocity u and shear velocity u are the most important parameters noori et al 2017 seo and cheong 1998 seo and baek 2004 fischer 1967 elder 1959 koussis and rodríguez mirasol 1998 for natural rivers three main methods are used to determine d x the first is the flow structure method that directly quantifies the physical processes governing dispersion the second is an experimental approach that traces a conservative pollutant s concentration along the river from a release point the third uses an empirical equation that is derived by considering d x and the river s geometric flow characteristics balf et al 2018 carrying out the measurements required by the flow structure method is rarely feasible and significant errors are common when tracing conservative pollutants due to the difficulty in evaluating distribution variances caused by elongated and poorly defined pollutant trails due to these challenges the empirical equation approach has been acceptable among engineers wallis and manson 2004 alternative approaches and measurements have been used to predict d x including artificial neural networks anns tayfur and singh 2005 noori et al 2011a 2011b support vector machines svm azamathulla and wu 2011 noori et al 2011a 2011b the m5 model etemad shahidi and taghipour 2012 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis riahi madvar et al 2009 and granular computing gc noori et al 2017 ghiasi et al 2019 according to the above mentioned d x prediction studies there is significant variability among model parameters for a single river intra river variance in the riverine physical attributes allows for a wide range of d x values e g 0 005 to 1800 m2 s 1 therefore model accuracy in estimating d x which may be poor for upper and lower range values must be evaluated over the full range of output values investigations of the empirical formulas performances showed that empirical models are often poor estimators of high or low d x values additionally even if the empirical model estimates high and low values precisely unacceptably poor predictions may be made in some cases the empirical model may generate nil or negative values of d x many previously proposed artificial intelligence ai models often presented as black boxes have also been poor predictors of extremely low and high d x values noori et al 2015 given the even wider variance of riverine physical attributes between rivers the range of d x values will vary widely between rivers accordingly a model proposed for the prediction of d x for all rivers should perform acceptably across the full range of river specific d x values and a universal model must consider most possible ranges of riverine physical properties in order to accurately estimate d x over its full range for a wide variety of rivers deep neural networks have shown promising results in various fields the deep neural network models have a good performance in a wide range and high variance datasets liu et al 2017 jodeiri et al 2019 therefore considering the conditions of different rivers in larger river datasets and the weakness of ml models in estimating datasets with high variance the new deep neural network models are suitable for estimating the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the current study presents an application of deep learning to the implementation of a backpropagation algorithm lecunlecun et al 2015 designed to extract the inherent structure of large datasets containing the hydraulic characteristics of different rivers thereby facilitating improved estimation of d x generally considered a sub field of machine learning schmidhuber 2015 deep learning models have the advantage of being able to automatically learn high level layered hierarchical abstractions from data and map the extracted features to desired labels through end to end training shen 2018 summarizes the most impactful areas for deep learning application in water sciences and suggests that deep learning is vital for harnessing the power of big data in water resource management amidst the emergence of new data sources such as remote sensing images convolutional neural networks cnns as one of the major categories of deep learning methods are widely used in the field of computer vision to achieve automatic feature extraction though they are primarily employed towards two or three dimensional image and video projects jodeiri et al 2019 jodeiri et al 2018 cnns have also shown the ability to extract deep features from unidimensional data such as speech signals or vectors of raw input data sainath et al 2015 various studies have explored the use of cnns in water resource management including in identifying and classifying diatoms libreros et al 2018 classifying wetlands rezaee et al 2018 estimating water levels xu et al 2018 forecasting rainfall runoff li et al 2018 miao et al 2019 measuring river wetted width ling et al 2019 and quantifying dynamic multiphase flow in heterogeneous media mo et al 2018 in contrast to other empirical and ai based methods that have been applied for d x prediction a deep learning approach opens up new possibilities that were previously infeasible by providing an integrated accurate and fully automatic system for future water pollution research therefore the main objective of the currents study is using deep learning approach based model for d x estimation with high precision and low error in all ranges low and high values of d x with low uncertainty so that the input and output data selection has little effect on the performance and accuracy of the model the current study proposes a cnn based algorithm that can extract specific abstract patterns from each riverine dataset to determine the distinctiveness of each case and to map the input samples directly to their corresponding labels accordingly the goal of the present study is to develop an ml model based on a deep convolutional network model dcn that improves on the performance of previous models for all d x ranges for this purpose the accuracy and uncertainty of the dcn model especially in the extremities of the possible ranges of d x and riverine attributes were analyzed using a five fold cross validation method 2 methodology 2 1 data description a total of 503 riverine datasets were collected from past research for use in the current study deng et al 2001 kashefipour and falconer 2002 carr and rehmann 2007 riahi madvar et al 2009 ahmad 2013 each dataset includes width m depth m stream velocity m s and shear velocity m s as well as the observed d x m2 s 1 table 1 summarizes the dataset properties 80 of the 503 datasets were used in the training process while the remaining datasets were used for model testing according to the dimensional analysis of all parameters affecting the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of the river in previous studies their physical impact can be summarized in the form of two width w depth h and velocity u shear velocity u dimensionless parameters noori et al 2017 seo and cheong 1998 also the relationship between the dimensionless parameters w h and u u with d x h u is much greater than the relationship between the dimensions parameters w h u and u with dx noori et al 2017 therefore datasets were entered into the model as three dimensionless sets w h and u u as model input data and d x h u as the model output 2 2 network architecture of the proposed dcn model the dcn model consists of two main blocks the feature extraction and classification blocks that are connected by a flattened layer fig 1 for the automatic extraction of feature maps from 2 1 raw input samples a one dimensional cnn with a 3 1 kernel size ten feature maps and the non linear relu activation function was used the classification block contains three fully connected layers with a relu activation function following each layer except for the last layer where the linear function was employed for regression the number of activation neurons of the fully connected layers was 256 16 and 1 respectively in order to prevent over fitting due to the relatively large number of trainable parameters an 80 drop out layer was added after the flattened layer the convolutional and fully connected layers play different roles in our proposed model the convolutional layers extract 10 different patterns that are related to the target value when used as inputs these extracted patterns improve the model s ability to distinguish among input samples in comparison with a case that raw data is given directly to the classifier the fully connected layers provide a powerful environment for mapping the input features to the corresponding labels through backward error propagation 2 3 implementation details the dcn model was implemented using the tensorflow library and optimized using the adam algorithm with a 0 0002 learning rate this project was treated as a regression problem therefore the root mean square error rmse was selected as the loss function rmse is a quadratic scoring rule that calculates the average of the squared differences between prediction and actual value effectively measuring the average magnitude of the error rmse is often applied in regression problems as its smooth differentiability facilitates mathematical operations chai and draxler 2014 the adam optimization algorithm is used for minimization of the loss function through a given number of epochs kingma and ba 2014 at each epoch a mini batch size of 50 samples was randomly selected from the training images and fed into the network for parameterization the network converged at 300 epochs no data augmentation nor pre training weights were used during the network s training the model was implemented on a workstation with a core i7 and 3 4 ghz cpu with 8gb ram and an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 gpu it is notable that 70 microsecond takes for each epoch and consequently 21 milliseconds for model training 300 epochs 2 4 evaluation statistics various statistical

dcn model was used to assess the dependency of the results on the chosen test datasets when averaged across all five experiments an r2 0 9961 0 0011 mean standard deviation was achieved for the training phase and an r2 0 9969 0 0045 was achieved for the testing phase these result indicate that the combination of datasets selected for the training and testing phases does not significantly influence the model s r2 which implies that the accuracy of the model is not dependent on the datasets selected fig 7 indicates that the range of variation in all three phases of the dcn model the training testing and full data assessment phases was minimal although the error for the training and all data modeling phases are almost identical the testing phase shows the lowest nrmse in the four different model runs and highest nrmse in one model run because of the considerable variance difference between the train and test dataset in five fold cross validation runs fig 8 depicts the nrmse results for the main run of the dcn model and the five fold cross validation fig 8 shows that only in the fourth run due to the placement of high variance data in the test dataset the nrmse value of this step is slightly higher and therefore to achieve the best model performance and accuracy the train and test data should be selected well however according to the deficient error of all runs in the calibration and testing steps the data selection method has minimal impact on the model performance and the dcn model can provide results with high accuracy in a wide range of d x data 4 conclusions d x is a vital parameter in simulating the dissemination of a pollutant within water streams many different methods and have been used to estimate d x each with benefits and weaknesses using 503 subsets of data from a wide range of streams 0 0048 d x 1798 6029 m 2 s 1 the current study explores the development and employment of a cnn based deep learning algorithm able to extract specific abstract patterns from distinct riverine datasets and to map these directly to corresponding labels in order to more accurately predict the d x parameter in the proposed deep convolutional network dcn method feature maps were automatically extracted using a convolutional neural network cnn after which a stack of fully connected layers analyzed the feature maps to estimate the pollution dispersion as d x in streams the main limitation of the dcn model is the black box architecture which makes it hard to find the reason for the poor results in some cases or interpret the output of the feature extractor block various statistical measures were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the dcn model in predicting d x in streams in comparison to a range of empirical and ml models the results indicated that the dcn model r2 0 9965 is far more accurate than the empirical models average r2 0 154 similarly the average rmse for the empirical models used to predict d x was 1146 5984 versus only 12 7751 for the dcn model this is a considerable difference considering that the rmse of the next most accurate model was 382 1659 other statistics nse ia nrmse nmbe mdape and aare were used to assess the models accuracy in predicting d x and each confirmed that the dcn model outperformed the studied empirical models in addition the results of the current study were compared with ann and svm models implemented in this study and other studies that applied ml models to predict d x in streams according to these analysis results the current dcn model represents an improvement over existing ai based methods with a high difference a five fold cross validation process showed that the combination of datasets selected for the training and testing phases of the dcn model had the lowest significant influence on either the r2 or the nrmse implying that the model s accuracy in predicting d x was not dependent on the chosen combinations of datasets thus the dcn model was found to outperform the considered empirical and ml methods in d x prediction using river geometry datasets and hydraulic parameters offering improved accuracy and lower error across all ranges of d x declaration of

biology north carolina state university raleigh north carolina 27695 usa corresponding author long term cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 trichlorethane 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 dioxane 1 4 d was achieved using slow release compounds srcs as growth substrates for pure cultures of rhodococcus rhodochrous atcc 21198 atcc strain 21198 resting cell transformation tests showed 1 4 d transformation occurred without a lag phase for cells grown on 2 butanol while an induction period of several hours was required for 1 butanol grown cells these observations were consistent with activity based labeling patterns for monooxygenase hydroxylase components and specific rates of tetrahydrofuran thf degradation 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d degradation rates for alcohol grown cells were slower than those for cells grown on gaseous alkanes such as isobutane batch metabolism and degradation tests were performed in the presence of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d with the growth of atcc strain 21198 on alcohols produced by the hydrolysis of orthosilicates three orthosilicates were tested tetrabutylorthosilicate tbos tetra s butylorthosilicate t2bos and tetraisopropoxysilane t2pos the measured rates of alcohol release in poisoned controls depended on the orthosilicate structure with tbos which produced a 1 alcohol 1 butanol hydrolyzing more rapidly than t2pos and t2bos that produced the 2 alcohols 2 butanol and 2 propanol respectively the orthosilicates were added as light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls with atcc strain 21198 and formed dispersed droplets when continuously mixed continuous rates of oxygen o2 consumption and carbon dioxide co2 production confirmed alcohol metabolism by atcc strain 21198 was occurring the rates of metabolism tbos t2pos t2bos were consistent with the rates of alcohol release via abiotic hydrolysis 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca were continuously transformed in successive additions by atcc strain 21198 over 125 days with the rates highly correlated with the rates of metabolism the metabolism of the alcohols was not inhibited by acetylene while transformation of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca was inhibited by this gas as acetylene is a potent inactivator of diverse bacterial monooxygenases these results suggest that monooxygenase activity was required for the observed cometabolic transformations but not for alcohol utilization alcohol concentrations in the biologically active reactors were maintained below the levels of detection indicating they were metabolized rapidly after being produced much lower rates of o2 consumption were observed in the reactors containing t2bos which has benefits for in situ bioremediation the results illustrate the importance of the structure of the src when developing passive aerobic cometabolic treatment systems keywords cometabolism orthosilicates activity based labeling hydrolysis 1 4 dioxane 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 introduction current sources of 1 4 dioxane 1 4 d include paint strippers antifreeze degreasing and deicing fluids deodorants shampoos contraceptives and is a byproduct during the manufacture of polyethylene terephthalate pet us epa 2017 historically 1 4 d was most frequently used as a chemical stabilizer for chlorinated solvents such as 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca to prevent decomposition due to reactions from light heat oxygen or acid base chemistry mohr 2001 us epa 2017 1 1 1 tca formulas contain up to 5 1 4 d mohr 2001 and due to poor solvent disposal practices 1 4 d is now a commonly detected groundwater contaminant in areas with chlorinated solvent contamination adamson et al 2011 for example in an evaluation of over 2000 sites in california 1 4 d was detected at 194 sites and 95 of these sites contain one or more chlorinated solvent adamson et al 2014 and 76 had both 14 d and 1 1 1 tca present 1 4 d has several characteristics that create challenges for remediation of contaminated aquifers 1 4 d is fully miscible in water infinitely soluble and has a low octanol water partition coefficient kow mohr 2001 us epa 2017 1 4 d is generally resistant to anaerobic transformation mcelroy et al 2019 these characteristics result in 1 4 d having a high mobility in groundwater with the potential to form extended dissolved contaminant plumes mohr 2001 1 4 d is categorized as a b2 probable human carcinogen derosa et al 1996 mohr 2001 there is currently no federal maximum contaminant level mcl for 1 4 d but us epa has determined an aqueous concentration of 0 35 μg l represents a 1 1 000 000 cancer risk and has established a screening level of 1 4 d in drinking water at 0 46 μg l us epa 2012 us epa 2017 state agencies have varying regulatory levels in drinking water and for groundwater cleanup ranging from 0 25 μg l in new hampshire to 77 μg l in alaska us epa 2017 1 1 1 tca was used for degreasing and in various adhesives and is currently classified as group d carcinogen us epa 1999 the maximum contaminant level mcl for 1 1 1 tca in drinking water is 200 μg l us epa 1995 both ex situ and in situ methods for treating 1 4 d have been reviewed by mcelroy et al 2019 and zhang et al 2017 in situ bioremediation can potentially provide a large cost savings for the treatment of 1 4 d direct metabolism of 1 4 d as a sole carbon and energy source has been demonstrated for a number of pure cultures of bacteria and fungi zhang et al 2017 mcelroy et al 2019 growth is fairly inefficient with high whole cell half saturation constants ranging from 17 5 to 160 mg l slow growth rates low biomass yields and low enzymatic activity barajas rodriguez and freeman 2018 mcelroy et al 2019 thus treating low concentrations 100 ppb of 1 4 d is expected to be ineffective using microorganisms that directly metabolize and grow on 1 4 d aerobic cometabolism is a particularly attractive option as specific microorganisms can be stimulated in situ using selective primary substrates to drive the transformation semprini 1997 frascari et al 2015 microbial growth on the primary substrates leads to expression of oxygenase enzymes that can then fortuitously oxidize and remediate contaminants to low concentration levels needed for the in situ treatment of 1 4 d cometabolic transformation of 1 4 d has been reported on a range of substrates for growth and or induction of cometabolic enzymes as reviewed by zhang et al 2017 and mcelroy et al 2019 common gaseous substrates include propane barajas rodriguez and freeman 2018 lippincott et al 2015 vainberg et al 2006 ethane hatzinger et al 2017 and isobutane rolston et al 2019 recent in situ studies for 1 4 d remediation have focused on aerobic cometabolism using microorganisms simulated on propane as a primary substrate using either sparging lippincott et al 2015 or recirculation well technology chu et al 2018 matrix diffusion or the diffusion of contaminants between high and low permeability zones can complicate remediation practices parker et al 2008 decades of matrix diffusion can cause the low permeability zones to act as a storage for high concentrations of groundwater contaminants matrix diffusion causes the contaminants of concern cocs to be released back into high permeability zones liu and ball 2005 an analytical modeling study by adamson et al 2016 investigated the behavior of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca under various loading conditions in a dual media aquifer containing a high permeability sand and a low permeability layer silt the study indicated that remediation methods such as pump and treat are significantly hindered due to the release of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca from the low permeability media after initial treatment of the high permeability zone due to the existence of long plumes of low concentration and matrix diffusion over extended periods there is an interest in developing passive in situ treatment systems passive treatment systems such as permeable reactive barriers prbs have the potential to reduce costs and eliminate the need to extract groundwater or continuously add substrates acceptors and nutrients for biological treatment or chemical treatment scherer et al 2008 provide a review of permeable reactive barriers for groundwater treatment using chemical and biological methods cometabolic treatment systems require the continuous addition of a primary substrate and this can lead to competitive inhibition of the contaminant transforming monooxygenase and a decrease in process efficiency semprini 1997 frascari et al 2015 this has led to strategies for in situ treatment such as the pulsed addition of the primary substrate semprini et al 1990 mccarty et al 1998 a goal of the research presented here is to develop more passive systems for the cometabolic treatment of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca and other cocs the objective was to evaluate slow release compounds srcs that slowly hydrolyze to produce primary growth substrates that do not inhibit the monooxygenase enzyme but promote continuous and effective cometabolic treatment an effective src would slowly supply the growth substrate needed for the cometabolically active microorganisms while also promoting the production of the monooxygenase enzyme required for the contaminant transformation the src would undergo abiotic hydrolysis with water to produce the substrate used by the microorganism and would be resistant to biotic hydrolysis to increase its long term potential as a substrate the src should have a low solubility in water permitting its addition as a non aqueous phase liquid napl for in situ bioremediation this property would also permit its co encapsulation at high concentrations with the selected microorganism in hydrogel beads that could be used to create a prb an src that upon hydrolysis produces food grade substrate is also of interest to facilitate its in situ use the microorganism evaluated in this study was rhodococcus rhodochrous 21198 atcc strain 21198 when grown on isobutane atcc strain 21198 cometabolically transforms 1 4 d rapidly via first order rates to low concentrations of 1 ppb rolston et al 2019 isobutane grown cells of this organism can also transform a broad range of chlorinated ethanes including 1 1 1 tca 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca and chlorinated ethenes including 1 2 cis dichloroethene cis dce 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce and vinyl chloride vc thankitkul 2016 krippaehne 2018 mixtures of 1 4 d 1 1 1 tca 1 1 dce and 1 2 dca are also effectively transformed by atcc strain 21198 krippaehne 2018 previous studies with mycobacterium vaccae job5 and rhodoccoccus jostii rha demonstrated these bacteria can cometabolize 1 4 d and tce when grown on 1 butanol hand et al 2015 atcc strain 21198 has also been reported to cometabolically degrade vc after growth on 2 propanol kuntz et al 2003 thus there is the potential of supporting the cometabolic transformation by srcs that produce alcohols in earlier but unrelated studies it was observed that aerobic cometabolism of tce and cis dce could be achieved by a mixed culture maintained on orthosilicates that hydrolyze to form alcohols vancheeswaran et al 1999 semprini and vancheeswaran 2002 the orthosilicates have four organic groups linked to the central silicon atom via oxygen bonds and upon hydrolysis produce four alcohols fig 1 shows an example of an orthosilicate used in this study tetra s butyl orthosilicate t2bos that hydrolyzes to produce 2 butanol ihlenfeldt et al 2009 vancheeswaran et al 1999 evaluated two orthosilicates tetrabutyl orthosilicate tbos and tetrakis 2 ethylbutoxy silane tkebs that hydrolyzed to form 1 butanol and ethylbutanol respectively abiotic hydrolysis rates of tkebs were an order of magnitude slower than tbos indicating the branched nature of the alcohol groups slowed the rates of hydrolysis for the microbial community enriched on tbos the hydrolysis rates were higher than the abiotic rates suggesting biotic hydrolysis of the orthosilicate ester linkages rasmussen et al 2020 presented results where atcc strain 21198 was co encapsulated in a gellan gum hydrogel along with tbos or t2bos as srcs long term cometabolic transformation of a mixture of 1 1 1 tca cis dce and 1 4 d was maintained for over 300 days as the contaminants diffused into the beads and were cometabolically transformed these results illustrated the promise of co encapsulation atcc strain 21198 with orthosilicates to produce cometabolic gellan gum beads that can be potentially used to create prbs the work presented here was conducted in parallel with that of rasmussen et al 2020 and provides a different system of testing and potential direct use of the orthosilicates as srcs in this study orthosilicates were added as a neat lnapl phase along with atcc strain 21198 in batch reactors the objective was to determine what alcohols promoted the cometabolic transformation of 1 4 d by atcc strain 21198 once the potential alcohols were determined the orthosilicates that produced the alcohol through hydrolysis were selected for study in batch systems atcc strain 21198 was grown on the selected orthosilicates and the simultaneous transformation of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca was evaluated the abiotic hydrolysis rates of the orthosilicate were also determined under the same conditions of the batch incubations using poisoned controls the rates of metabolism via oxygen o2 consumption and carbon dioxide co2 production were compared with the rates of cometabolism and the abiotic rates of alcohol production three different orthosilicates were evaluated tetra butyl orthosilicate tbos tetra s butyl orthosilicate t2bos and tetra isopropoxysilane t2pos that produce 1 butanol 2 butanol and 2 propanol respectively the tests were performed in batch reactors and monitored for up to 125 days to evaluate their long term performance these comparisons provided insight into how the structure of the orthosilicates are an important variable when selecting src for a passive cometabolic treatment system the method provides a simpler system for evaluation of the src since encapsulation is not required the study is also a first step in evaluating the potential for the direct addition of the src as a lnapl along with the desired microorganism to promote long term cometabolic treatment further investigations are needed under groundwater microcosm conditions where competition can occur with native microorganisms that may not promote cometabolism when grown on the alcohols studied 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were analytical grade isobutane 99 99 gas

of rhodococcus rhodochrous atcc 21198 for resting cell and cometabolism tests r rhodochrous atcc 21198 obtained from the american type culture collection manassas va was grown on isobutane 1 butanol 2 butanol and 2 propanol in 720 ml glass bottles containing 270 ml of phosphate buffered mineral salts medium msm kottegoda et al 2015 and 450 ml of air headspace as described by rolston et al 2019 the cells were incubated at 30 c at 200 rpm and harvested at the late exponential growth phase by centrifugation at 15 000 g for 10 min the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer 25 ml and centrifugation and decanting of the supernatant was repeated the biomass concentration was determined using a total suspended solids tss test as described in awwa standards rice et al 2017 protein analysis was used to quantify the tss protein ratio under the growth conditions described the ratio of protein to tss was 0 45 mg protein mg tss rolston et al 2019 for activity based labeling studies atcc strain 21198 was grown in batch culture in glass serum vials 160 ml sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals wheaton scientific millville n j the vials contained mineral salts medium msm 23 ml wiegant and de bont 1980 and were inoculated to an initial optical density od600 of 0 02 using cells previously grown on agar plates containing casein yeast extract dextrose cyd media isobutane 10 v v gas phase or alcohols 0 1 v v liquid phase were added as sole sources of carbon and energy and the cultures were grown in the dark in an environmental shaker operated at 30 c and 150 rpm after growth for 3 days the culture vials were opened in a sterile laminar flow hood to replenish air in the vials after equilibration for 10 min the vials were resealed and the original growth substrate was added again to the original initial concentration once the final culture od600 reached 0 7 a sample 20 μl of the culture was plated on cyd plates to subsequently confirm the purity of the culture the remaining cells were harvested by centrifugation 10 000 g 5 min at 4 c the supernatant was decanted and the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in buffer 10 ml 50 mm sodium phosphate ph 7 0 and centrifuged again 10 000 g 5 min at 4 c the cell pellet was finally resuspended in buffer to a protein concentration of 10 mg ml and the washed cells were stored on ice and used for experiments within 4 h 2 3 activity based labeling the activity based labeling method was based on procedures described by bennett et al 2016 to covalently fluorescently label components of ammonia monooxygenase amo the first step of this two step method involves the in vivo mechanism based inactivation of active monooxygenases in cells by a diyne probe such as 1 7 octadiyne 17od this activation targets one of the terminal alkyne groups of the probe and generates a reactive intermediate that reacts with one or more amino acids in the active site of the enzyme this results in an irreversible loss of enzyme activity through formation of a covalent enzyme probe adduct that retains the probe s second but unreacted terminal alkyne group the second in vitro step involves a copper catalyzed alkyne azide cycloaddition cuaac reaction between this unreacted alkyne group and an azide containing fluor the resulting fluorescently labeled polypeptides can then be separated and visualized by sds page and subsequent nir scanning of the unstained gel while the second step of this abl process and the sds page analysis are entirely independent of the target enzyme the first step requires that the target monooxygenases are sensitive to mechanism based inactivation by alkynes the monooxygenase catalyzed 1 4 d degrading activity of atcc strain 21198 is fully inhibited by acetylene rolston et al 2019 and is therefore expected to be detectable using our abl approach the abl approach can be used to determine both the presence and relative amount of active monooxygenase in cells at any time by sampling cells and exposing them to 17od as the binding of the activated probe to the monooxygenases active site containing polypeptide requires the catalytic activity of the enzyme itself the abl method only generates fluorescently labeled polypeptides of appropriate mass if monooxygenase are present and active as the stoichiometry of probe binding events to monooxygenase inactivation events is expected to be near constant the level of fluorescence detected after sds page and nir scanning is also expected to be proportional to the amount of active enzyme present in the cells at their time of exposure to 17od in the present study the first step of the procedure was conducted in glass serum vials 10 ml sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum tear off seals the reactions contained 17od 100 μm added from a stock solution 0 1 m in dmso and were initiated by the addition of harvested cells 1 ml to the reaction vial which were then incubated for 30 min in a shaking water bath operated at 30 c and 150 rpm after this incubation the incubated cells were pelleted by centrifugation 10 000 g 5 min washed twice with buffer 1 ml 50 mm sodium phosphate ph 7 0 and finally resuspended with buffer 0 3 ml the resulting cell suspension was then disrupted by two cycles of bead beating 5 0 m s 55 s in tubes 2 ml containing lysing matrix b mp biomedicals irvine ca the resulting cell extract was briefly centrifuged to remove unbroken cells and the resulting cell free extract was stored on ice at 4 c and used within 1 h in the second step of the procedure a sample of the broken cell extract from 17od treated cells 30 μg total protein was mixed with deionized water in a microfuge tube 500 μl and sds was added from an aqueous stock solution 10 w v to final

added sequentially to give a final reaction volume of 75 μl the vials were incubated at room temperature in a dark room for 1 h and were then quenched by adding 3 butyn 1 ol 13 mm 1 μl of a 1 m aqueous solution the resulting labeled cell extracts were stored in the dark at 20 c prior to analysis by sds page 2 4 sds page and ir scanning sds page analyses were conducted using 9 discontinuous polyacrylamide gels using the bio rad mini protean electrophoresis system bio rad hercules ca protein samples 100 μg total protein were prepared by adding 6 sample buffer 375 mm tris hcl 9 sds 50 glycerol 0 05 bromophenol blue and 9 β mercaptoethanol at room temperature samples 5 μg total protein were then loaded onto the gels and electrophoresed at room temperature for 90 min at a fixed current of 25 35 ma to visualize fluorescently labeled polypeptides immediately after electrophoresis the unfixed gel was scanned with an li cor odyssey 9120 ir scanner li cor biotechnology lincoln ne and migration of fluorescently labeled nir marker proteins was used to estimate the mass of fluorescently labeled bacterial polypeptides bennett et al 2016 the gel images were recorded and analyzed by odyssey imaging system application software version 3 0 the protein concentration of all cell extracts was determined by biuret protein assay gornall et al 1949 in summary samples were solubilized by incubation with 1 5 m naoh final concentration at 65 c for 30 min the solubilized protein sample was briefly centrifuged 10 000 g 5 min to remove insoluble material was then assayed using bovine serum albumin as a standard 2 5 resting cell 1 4 d transformation tests resting cell 1 4 d transformation tests were performed in sterile 27 ml batch vials sealed with butyl rubber septa and crimp tops as described by rolston et al 2019 phosphate buffered nutrient medium 10 ml was added along with cells 5 mg tss experimental controls included an abiotic control no cells and an acetylene control 10 v v gas phase to inactivate the monooxygenase enzyme hyman and wood 1985 acetylene was found to be an effective inhibitor of 1 4 d cometabolism and isobutane utilization by atcc strain 21198 rolston et al 2019 acetylene was generated from the reaction of water with calcium carbide cac2 and then added to the reactor headspace acetylene was allowed to equilibrate with the cells for 1 h on a shaker table 200 rpm before 1 4 d or isobutane was added which ensured the monooxygenase enzyme were fully inactivated the batch reactors were incubated at 30 c while shaking at 200 rpm to ensure equilibrium was maintained between the gas and liquid phases throughout the experiment cometabolism tests were performed at an aqueous concentration of 1 4 d of 17 6 mg l the degradation of thf was determined in small scale reactions conducted in glass serum vials 10 ml the vials contained 50 mm phosphate buffer 900 μl and were sealed with teflon lined mininert valves thf was added to the vials to an initial concentration of 1 mm using a freshly prepared aqueous solution 0 1 m the vials were then placed in a heated shaking water bath 3 c 150 rpm for 10 min to allow equilibration of the thf between the gas and liquid phase the reactions were initiated by adding aliquots 100 μl of concentrated cell suspension the reaction vials were then returned to the shaking water bath and samples were removed as required for analysis of residual thf by gas chromatography 2 6 cometabolism tests methods presented by vancheeswaran et al 1999 were used to evaluate the growth of atcc strain 21198 on tbos t2bos and t2pos as srcs and cometabolism of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d in summary batch tests were performed in autoclaved glass serum bottles 178 ml sealed with screw on caps with butyl rubber septa and each experimental condition was conducted in duplicate the batch reactors were constructed aseptically in a laminar flow hood and contained phosphate buffer msm 68 ml with the remaining volume 110 ml as air headspace the reactor medium was inoculated with a small amount of isobutane grown cells of atcc strain 21198 0 1 mg tss to ensure that cell growth would be observed during the test tests were first performed to examine growth directly on alcohols by adding individual alcohols 45 μmol to the batch reactors for tests with orthosilicates as long term sources of alcohols the neat compounds were added directly to the medium to achieve a nominal non dissolved concentration of 1500 mg l these nominal concentrations are above the aqueous solubility limit the orthosilicates were present as dispersed lnapls when the batch reactors were incubated on the rotary shaker table at 150 rpm as described by vancheeswaran et al 1999 the solubility of tbos in water at 20 c is less than 1 mg l vancheeswaran 1998 thus strain atcc 21198 was exposed to both the dissolved and non aqueous phase orthosilicate 1 4 d 59 μl was added from a 1000 ppm aqueous stock solution while 1 1 1 tca 23 μl was added from a saturated aqueous stock solution to achieve the desired mass additions several additions of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca were made over the time course of the experiment in order to study the abiotic hydrolysis of the orthosilicates batch reactors were constructed as described above with sodium azide 0 2 w v added from a 1 m aqueous stock solution to investigate the role of monooxygenases in the transformation of orthosilicates 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca control reactions were prepared as described above with acetylene 10 v v added to the reaction headspace to evaluate the ability of resting cells to transform the mixtures of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca controls tests were also constructed with the initial cell inoculum 0 1 mg tss added but with no orthosilicate present 2 7 analytical methods details of the analytical methods for the headspace measurement of 1 1 1 tca and the aqueous concentration of 1 4 d are described by rolston et al 2019 briefly 1 1 1 tca was measured in a 0 1 ml gas headspace sample on a hewlett packard series 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector ecd chromatographic separation was achieved using an agilent technologies inc db 62941 column with helium as a carrier gas at 8 ml min and the ecd received a flow of 95 argon and 5 methane at ultra high purity airgas corvallis albany or the temperatures of the oven injector and detector were 100 c 250 c and 250 c respectively the residence time of 1 1 1 tca was 1 3 min the method was quantified using external standards the quantification limits for 1 1 1 tca was around 1 μg l at an equilibrated aqueous concentration in the reactor the headspace oxygen o2 and carbon dioxide co2 concentrations were used as indicators of metabolic activity headspace o2 was quantified with a hewlett packard 5890 gc equipped with a supelco 60 80 carboxen 1000 column and a thermal conductivity detector tcd the temperatures of the oven injector and detector were 40 c 275 c and 275 c respectively ultra high purity helium airgas corvallis albany or was the carrier gas flowing at 30 ml min the o2 residence time was 4 5 min co2 was also quantified with a hewlett packard 5890 gc equipped with a supelco 60 80 carboxen 1000 column equipped with a tcd detector the temperature of the oven injector and detector were 220 c 275 c and 275 c respectively ultra high purity argon was used airgas corvallis albany or as the carrier gas flowing at 15 ml min the residence time for co2 was 3 min both the o2 and co2 headspace concentrations were quantified using external standards with argon used as the carrier gas the atmospheric concentration of co2 could be measured and represented the initial headspace concentration in the reactors the concentration of the alcohols 1 butanol 2 butanol and 2 propanol in active and poisoned reactors was determined by gc analysis of aqueous samples to avoid sampling the non aqueous phase orthosilicate the aqueous samples were obtained by inverting the batch reactors so that the orthosilicate lnapl floated to the top of the medium and aqueous sample was obtained from the middle of the reactor the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf filter and 5 μl was injected to a hewlett packard 5890 gc with a 0 2 cw 1500 80 100 carbopack c column and fid detector the temperatures of the oven injector and detector were 105 c 150 c and 175 c respectively residence times for 1 butanol 2 butanol and 2 propanol were 3 5 3 5 and 1 2 min respectively the alcohol detection limit for this analysis was 1 mg l 1 4 d was analyzed from liquid samples on a hewlett packard series 6890 gas chromatograph model 5973 mass spectrometer gc ms preceded by a tekmar dohrmann model 3100 heated purge and trap concentrator rolston et al 2019 describe details of the method the gc ms was run in single ion mode for m z 88 1 4 d and m z 96 deuterated 1 4 d run as an internal standard draper et al 2000 the 1 4 d quantification limit was 0 1 μg l with a 25 ml aqueous sample samples from the batch reactors 0 3 ml l were diluted 125 to 250 times in di water when loaded onto the purge and trap concentrator for the analysis of thf degradation aqueous samples 2 μl from the sealed reaction vials were immediately injected into a shimadzu gc 8a gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization detector and a stainless steel column 0 3 by 183 cm filled with porapak q 60 to 80 mesh waters associates framingham mass the analysis was conducted with a column temperature of 160 c an injection port temperature of 200 c and a detector temperature of 220 c nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15 ml min 1 the gas chromatograph was interfaced with a hewlett packard hp3395 hewlett packard palo alto calif integrator for data collection rates of thf degradation were determined from plots of residual thf versus time for samples taken every 10 min after the addition of cells the rates were determined by linear regression analyses quantification of thf was determined by the calibration plots developed using authentic standards of thf 2 8 mass balances for the duration of each experiment the batch reactors were stored at 20 c and shaken at 150 rpm on a rotary shaker table to maintain equilibrium partitioning between the headspace and liquid phases the total mass mt of each compound was calculated from eq 1 where the concentration in the aqueous phase cl concentration in the headspace cg volume of the liquid vl and the headspace volume vg are the concentrations and volumes in the liquid and gas compartments respectively and hcc is the dimensionless henry s constant equal to the ratio of a compound in the gas and liquid phases hcc values were 49 2 0 0002 0 548 31 5 and 1 20 for isobutane 1 4 d 1 1 1 tca o2 and co2 respectively sander 1999 1 mass t c g v l h cc v g zero order rates of o2 consumption co2 and alcohol production and first order rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were determined via linear regression of the mass histories using microsoft excel 3 experimental results 3 1 activity based labeling the abl approach used in this study targets the hydroxylase components of catalytically active monooxgenases and generates a covalent fluor probe enzyme adduct that can be visualized by nir scanning of sds page analyses of protein extracts from cells in this study we used whole cells assays to determine monooxygenase activity and these rates were then compared to the fluorescent abl patterns and intensity for cells grown on the same substrates the activity of cells was initially determined by determining the specific rate of consumption of thf a structural analog of 1 4 d cells grown on gaseous alkanes c2 c4 all exhibited high rates of degradation of thf 40 110 nmoles min mg total protein fig 2a with the lowest rate observed with propane grown cells and the highest rates observed with cells grown on n butane or isobutane only very low rates of thf consumption 5 nmoles min mg total protein were determined for cells grown on the 1 alcohols tested ethanol 1 propanol 1 butanol isobutanol while low but readily detectable rates of thf consumption 10 15 nmoles min mg total protein were detected for cells grown on 2 alcohols 2 propanol and 2 butanol in the abl assays isobutane grown cells were used to illustrate the labeling pattern and intensity for cells with high level of monooxygenase activity fig 2b the labeling pattern included at least one intensely labeled polypeptide with a mass of 60 kda and several substantially less intensely labeled smaller polypeptides in the case of alcohol grown cells no labeling was observed for cells grown on any of the primary 1 alcohols tested ethanol 1 propanol 1 butanol and isobutanol while low levels of labeling were observed for cells grown on either 2 butanol or 2 propanol cells grown on 2 butanol exhibited labeling of a 60 kda polypeptide while the lower level of labeling was associated with a larger 70 kda polypeptide 3 2 resting cell transformation of 1 4 dioxane by strain 21198 resting cell transformation tests were performed with strain atcc 21198 grown on either 1 butanol 2 butanol 2 propanol or isobutane to investigate whether the trends observed in the abl experiments also occurred with 1 4 d both isobutane fig 3a and 2 butanol grown cells fig 3c immediately transformed 1 4 d 17 6 mg l without a lag phase although the rates of 1 4 d degradation by 2 butanol grown cells were 5 fold lower than isobutane grown cells 2 propanol grown cells also immediately transformed 1 4 d but at rate 9 slower than isobutane grown cells data not shown in contrast 1 butanol grown cells only transformed 1 4 d after a lag period of 3 to 4 h one possibility is that an induction period was required before transformation occurred fig 3b the mechanism responsible for this delay in transformation with 1 butanol grown cells need further investigation after the lag period 1 4 d was transformed at rate 14 times lower than isobutane grown cells 3 3 cometabolic transformation of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca during growth on 2 butanol as cells grown on 2 butanol appeared to have readily detectable rates of monooxygenase catalyzed reactions we subsequently examined the longer term degradation of contaminants 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca by atcc strain 21198 when growing on 2 butanol in batch reactors our results fig 4 are presented for the second addition of 2 butanol to the reactors the production of co2 and utilization of 2 butanol fig 4a the increase in optical density fig 4b all demonstrate that in this experimental system atcc strain 21198 grew on 2 butanol within approximately 1 day following a second addition of 2 butanol degradation of 1 4 d fig 4c accelerated as microbial growth occurred with most of the degradation occurring 0 5 to 1 5 days after the alcohol addition 1 4 d transformation lagged the consumption of 2 butanol modeling of substrate utilization coupled with microbial growth and the cometabolic transformation would help to determine if the observed responses are consistent with the increase in biomass that was observed 1 1 1 tca fig 4c transformation was consistent with 1 4 d however 1 1 1 tca was transformed at a slower rate the slowing in rates after 1 5 days may result from 1 1 1 tca concentrations being reduced below the half substrate concentration ks value based on the results presented in fig 4 both zero order and first order rate estimates were made of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d cometabolism while zero order rate estimates were made for co2 production and o2 and 2 butanol consumption table s3 similar rates estimates were obtained for the duplicate reactors and consistent increases in rates were observed with the second addition of 2 butanol the first order rates for 1 1 1 tca increased by a factor of 2 1 while for 1 4 d by a factor of 2 3 between the first and second additions the increase transformation rates are consistent with the increased rates of metabolism as indicated by co2 production and 2 butanol consumption the zero order rates of co2 production increased by a factor of 2 0 while that of 2 butanol was 3 4 the results are consistent with the increase in o d resulting from the increase biomass the first order rates of 1 4 d transformation were a factor of 2 3 and 2 5 greater than 1 1 1 tca in in the first and second addition respectively a more detailed modeling analysis is needed that relates microbial growth substrate utilization and the cometabolic transformation to show that the increase in rates were associated with an increase in biomass concentration 3 4 abiotic hydrolysis of orthosilicates in order to provide for a long term source of alcohols 1500 mg l of three orthosilicates tbos t2bos and t2pos were added to reactors as an lnapl equating to 310 μmoles of tbos and t2bos and 380 μmoles of t2pos in each reactor mixing on the rotary shaker table dispersed the lnapl fine droplets and provided a high surface area for interaction with water the time course of alcohol production via abiotic hydrolysis of each orthosilicate in poisoned controls showed a near linear increase in each case indicating the abiotic hydrolysis rate followed pseudo zero order kinetics fig 5 the zero order rates of alcohol production determined via linear regression were 11 1 5 1 and 0 76 μmol day for tbos t2pos and t2bos respectively when normalized for the aqueous volume present the rates were 62 4 28 7 and 4 3 μmol l day respectively of the initial tbos t2bos t2pos added 62 99 5 and 87 respectively would remain at the end of the incubations based on the abiotic hydrolysis rates 3 5 metabolism and cometabolism on t2bos tbos and t2pos 3 5 1 metabolism with t2bos metabolism in the batch reactors was determined through the monitoring of co2 production and o2 consumption in the reactor headspace while cometabolism was monitored by the concentration histories of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d the long term observations from the t2bos reactor are shown in fig 6 the early rapid increase in co2 likely results from the 2 butanol present as an impurity in the neat t2bos that was added the initial 2 butanol concentration decreased rapidly in both the live and the acetylene treated reactors fig 5b a constant and gradual increase in co2 was then observed over 125 days between day 5 and day 125 approximately 30 μmol of co2 were produced in the reactor headspace co2 production was also observed in the batch reactor containing acetylene fig 6a which is consistent with 2 butanol utilization not requiring monooxygenase activity no co2 production was observed in the poisoned control the gradual increases in co2 are consistent with the slow rates of hydrolysis observed in the poisoned control fig 5b it should be noted that a large fraction of the co2 produced is present as bicarbonate ion at the buffered ph of 7 2 the mass shown represents only the co2 in the headspace after the initial 2 butanol added as an impurity of the neat t2bos was consumed 2 butanol was not detected in the aqueous phase the live reactors with and without acetylene indicating that it was rapidly utilized as it was produced via hydrolysis fig 5b a slow but gradual rate of o2 consumption was observed compared to the poisoned and abiotic controls fig 6b o2 consumption occurred in all the reactors where co2 accumulated including the acetylene treated control reactors the rate of o2 consumption fig 5b is in the range expected from the utilization of the 2 butanol produced via hydrolysis fig 5b and the development of microbial biomass approximately 200 μmol of o2 were consumed over 125 days while 65 μmol of 2 butanol were produced via abiotic hydrolysis representing a 3 to 1 stoichiometric ratio a stoichiometric ratio of 6 to 1 is required for complete oxidation of 2 butanol to co2 and h2o the lower observed ratio is consistent with the incorporation of a fraction of the 2 butanol into biomass co2 production and o2 consumption and 2 butanol concentrations being below detection all support continuous metabolic activity over the 125 days of incubation the acetylene live treatment tracked the live treatments without acetylene demonstrating the monooxygenase activity was not required to metabolize 2 butanol 3 5 2 cometabolism with t2bos the concentration histories of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d for the batch tests with t2bos are shown in fig 6 c and d three additions of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were made to the biologically active reactors at 0 21 and 60 days the acetylene treated the poisoned and cell only reactors received only one addition of 1 1 1 tca and two additions of 1 4 d consistent with co2 production as an indicator of metabolic activity fig 6a 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were both cometabolically transformed during the first 20 days of incubation minimal decreases in 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were observed in the abiotic and acetylene treated live control 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation not being observed in the live acetylene treated control indicates monooxygenase activity was responsible for their transformation the rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation decreased slightly in the second addition for the initial transformation test day 0 to 20 the cells had access to the free aqueous 2 butanol from the impurity present in the neat t2bos which likely facilitated the more rapid cometabolic transformation a third addition of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was made to the active bottles around day 60 the same mass of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were added except for active bottle 1 ab1 for ab1 a 10 fold greater mass of 1 4 d was added to investigate the transformation rate at higher 1 4 d concentrations fig 6d the increased 1 4 d concentration was effectively cometabolized and its higher concentration did not affect the first order rate of 1 1 1 tca transformation fig 6c the results show the cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was maintained over a period of 125 days with a single addition of t2bos as discussed above the sustained metabolism was achieved over this period the observations support sustained cometabolism of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d driven by the continuous metabolism of 2 butanol produced from t2bos hydrolysis 3 5 3 metabolism with tbos fig 7 shows the results from the incubation of atcc strain 21198 with tbos since the abiotic hydrolysis of tbos was a factor of 15 higher than t2bos fig 5 much higher rates of metabolism were expected a continuous increase in co2 headspace concentration was observed over the 45 days of the test in both the live reactors and the acetylene treated control one of the duplicates had a slower rate of co2 accumulation while the acetylene treated control matched the other duplicate the zero order rate of co2 production in the tbos reactors were factors of 7 to 14 times higher than the t2bos reactors table s5 consistent with the higher rate of tbos hydrolysis after the repair of the gas chromatograph measurements of headspace o2 concentrations were initiated on day 21 it should be noted that the build up in 1 butanol observed between 17 and 20 days fig 5a was likely associated with o2 becoming limiting in the reactor headspace upon adding o2 1 butanol was rapidly consumed fig 5a over the period of 20 to 25 days the duplicate with the slower rate of co2 production had a slower rate of o2 consumption the slower rates might be associated with a lower initial biomass of strain atcc 21198 in the reactor due to the high rate of consumption o2 was added to the reactors on days 20 28 and 34 after the third addition the rates of o2 consumption were similar in all reactors likely indicating the development of a similar biomass the much higher utilization of o2 in the tbos reactors compared to the t2bos reactors is evident a buildup of 1 butanol was only observed in the poisoned control fig 5a concentrations remained near detection in the live and acetylene treated reactor indicating 1 butanol was rapidly consumed upon release from tbos hydrolysis the acetylene treated control also showed similar rates of co2 production and o2 consumption as the active bottles that lacked acetylene consistent with the t2bos results like 2 butanol 1 butanol consumption was not inhibited by acetylene as monooxygenase activity is not required for alcohol utilization 3 5 4 cometabolism with tbos 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d concentration histories for the tbos reactors are shown fig 7c and d the duplicate reactor that more slowly produced co2 and consumed o2 initially lags in 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation which likely a results of lower biomass being present the rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation increase in the second and third additions indicating an increasing biomass in that reactor the duplicate reactor showed increasing cometabolic rates consistent with increase in the rate of oxygen uptake the results support an increase in biomass concentration resulting from microbial growth continuous transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was observed over the 45 day study no transformation was observed in the acetylene treated control consistent with the t2bos reactor observations 3 5 5 metabolism with t2pos fig 8 presents the results from the incubation of atcc strain 21198 with t2pos t2pos has a rate of hydrolysis between that of t2bos and tbos fig 5c thus the rate of metabolism and cometabolism is expected to be in between those of tbos and t2bos duplicate active bottles showed very reproducible rates of co2 production and o2 consumption the acetylene treated control showed a more rapid increase co2 production and o2 consumption possibly due to more t2pos being accidentally added to this reactor resulting in a higher rate of alcohol release consistent with the rate of hydrolysis the rates of co2 production and o2 consumption were between those of the t2bos and tbos reactors table s6 3 5 6 cometabolism with t2pos the continuous transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was observed in the duplicate live reactors some resting cell transformation was observed inoculum control however after 7 days transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d slowed whereas the active bottles transformation continued another addition of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was added on day 19 and the active bottles continued to transform 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d consistent with the tbos and the t2bos tests transformation was not observed in the reactor containing acetylene 3 5 7 comparison of rates of metabolism and cometabolism observed with t2bos tbos and t2pos data used to calculate rates for single reactors are presented in tables s4 to s6 and figs s4 s8 both zero order and first order rate estimates were made of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d cometabolism while zero order rate estimates were made for co2 production and o2 consumption the first order rate estimates were made over the full range of concentrations while zero order made over the periods of the highest rates of contaminant decrease in the t2bos reactors the first order and zero order rates of cometabolism were similar for the duplicates table s4 the first order rates decreased with each addition of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d the initial rate was a factor of 5 greater for 1 1 1 tca and approximately 10 higher for 1 4 d compared to the rate estimated for the third addition a much higher concentration of 1 4 d was added in the third addition which resulted in a higher zero order rate similar rates of co2 production and o2 consumption were observed in the duplicates consistent with the similar rates of cometabolism these rates could not normalized by biomass present since it was not measured thus metabolic comparison were made it is interesting to compare the rates observed with t2bos to those obtained with the growth directly on 2 butanol fig 4 table s3 the first order rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d achieved with their first addition in the t2bos reactors was 0 4 and 0 5 respectively of those obtained during the growth of 2 butanol the rate of 1 4 d was also a factor of 2 5 times higher than 1 1 1 tca during this period consistent observations during growth on 2 butanol these high rates support early growth on 2 butanol that was present in the t2bos by the third addition of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d to the t2bos reactors the rates were reduced by over an order magnitude compared to those obtained during direct growth on 2 butanol in the tbos reactors table s5 the first order rates more than doubled for both 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d with the three additions while zero order rates increased by a factor three while the first order rate of the duplicates initially differed by a factor of three they were very similar by the third addition the first order rates were higher than observed in the tests with t2bos consistent with the higher rates of metabolism and alcohol production for example both the rates of co2 production and o2 consumption were approximately a factor of 20 higher in the tbos reactors than the t2bos reactor the higher rates of metabolism are consistent with the rate of 1 butanol release which was about a factor of 15 greater than 2 butanol the first order rates of cometabolism of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d ranged from 10 to 20 times higher in the tbos reactors supporting a greater biomass developing in these reactors in in the t2pos reactors table s6 the first order rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation were very similar in the duplicate reactors and remained fairly constant between the first and second additions the rates of co2 production and o2 consumption was also very similar between the duplicates the estimated first order rates in between those observed in the t2bos and tbos fig 9 provides a summary of the estimated rates provided in the si figs s4 s8 zero order rates were provided for for co2 and alcohol production while first order fits were provided for 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d since they provide better fits to these data a pearson s correlation analysis of the rates was performed in microsoft excel and the results are provide in table s7 the results show a strong correlation between rates of metabolism as indicated by co2 production and o2 consumption not shown and the rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation with pearson s correlation r values of 0 9915 and 0 9786 respectively the rates of co2 production are also correlated with the rates of alcohol production with pearson s correlation value r 0 9303 it is interesting to note that the first order rates of 1 4 d transformation are a factor of 1 6 times those of 1 1 1 tca for all three orthosilicates tested despite the rates differing by a factor of 18 between tbos and t2bos reactors the pearson correlation r value for the 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d rates achieved with the three different orthosilicates was 0 997 the similar factor difference in rates and the very high pearson s correlation indicate the same oxygenase enzyme is transforming the contaminant despite the growth on the different alcohol substrates within a treatment comparison of duplicate reactors indicate rates of cometabolism are also correlated with the rates of metabolism and likely biomass present when the rates of metabolism were higher for a duplicate when the rates of cometabolism for both 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were also higher both the rates of metabolism and cometabolism being correlated indicate that higher biomass concentrations were maintained in the tbos reactor compared to the t2pos and t2bos reactors a photo of the tbos reactor at the start day 0 and end day 43 of the incubation is presented in fig s9 the dispersion of the tbos into colloidal liquid droplets is indicated on day 0 at a later time the orange color indicates the growth of atcc stain 21198 which when plated appears orange in color the cells clump and tend to grow around particles of tbos making measurements of biomass on a protein basis difficult fig s10 shows photographs of the reactors with growth on the different substrates for the t2bos and t2pos batch reactors a visual increase of atcc strain 21198 was difficult to see consistent with their lower metabolic activity a greater extent of growth was observed in the reactor containing tbos compared to the reactors containing t2pos and t2bos consistent with the higher rates of metabolism and cometabolism observed the zero order rates of oxygen utilization divided by the zero order rates of alcohol production can be used to estimate the molar ratios of o2 utilized to substrate consumed the ratios are 3 5 2 5 0 7 μmol o2 μmol alcohol for tbos t2bos and t2pos incubations respectively these ratios compared with 6 5 6 5 and 3 5 μmol o2 μmol alcohol for the complete oxidation of the respective alcohols to co2 and h2o the lower measured ratios based on o2 consumption and alcohol production compared to ratios required for complete oxidation to co2 and h2o are consistent with substrate utilization for the generation of cell biomass rittman and mccarty 2001 the results also indicate that biotic hydrolysis does not seem to be important since a more rapid rate of alcohol production would have increased the oxygen demand 4 discussion of results in this study activity based labeling abl was shown to be a useful and simple method for determining the level of monooxygenase activity in cells and one that potentially provides more information than whole cell activity measurements alone for example the labeling intensity for isobutane grown cells was much greater than cells grown on 2 butanol and this difference was clearly reflected in the substantial differences in specific rates of thf fig 2 and 1 4 d fig 3 degradation exhibited by these cell types the abl approach also allowed us to discriminate between cells that express 1 4 d degrading monooxygenases during growth e g 2 butanol grown cells as opposed to cells that express these enzymes after growth e g 1 butanol grown cells this difference was confirmed by demonstrating that cells grown on 2 butanol degrade 1 4 d without a lag phase fig 3c while cells grown on 1 butanol exhibit a lag phase for this activity fig 3b although further research is needed to determine why cells grown on 1 butanol exhibited this lag a delay of several hours is sufficient time for suitably stimulated cells to synthesize the monooxygenase enzymes required for subsequent observable 1 4 d degrading activity hyman and arp 1992 although several different factors could potentially promote this de novo protein synthesis an alcohol independent effect of 1 4 d itself is a particularly interesting possibility a growth substrate independent inducing effect on monooxygenase expression by methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe another ether pollutant has previously been observed with the well characterized gaseous alkane oxidizing bacterium mycobacterium vaccae job5 johnson et al 2004 a further potential application of our abl approach could be to characterize changes in monooxygenase expression when 1 butanol grown cells of r rhodochrous atcc 21198 are exposed to 1 4 d in the presence and absence of protein synthesis inhibitors as the abl method targets the active site containing component of monooxygenases bennett et al 2016 the labeling pattern observed in sds page analyses can also potentially identify which enzyme is expressed under different growth and incubation conditions for instance a labeled polypeptide of the same mass 60 kda was detected for cells grown on isobutane and 2 butanol the genome of r rhodochrous atcc 21198 encodes 2 soluble di iron monooxygenases shields menard et al 2014 and both of these gaseous alkane oxidizing enzymes have alpha hydroxylase components with masses of 60 kda heterologously expressed forms of one of these enzymes a group 6 sdimo referred to as a short chain alkane monooxygenase scam rolston et al 2019 can oxidize 1 4 d deng et al 2018 while this activity has not been confirmed for the other sdimo a group 5 propane monooxygenase prmo although the labeled polypeptides we observed in this study were not identified at the molecular level unequivocal identification of these proteins typically requires extensive and expensive mass spectral approaches the current abl procedure can therefore provide a simple and effective screening procedure where unequivocal enzyme identification is not an immediate priority the cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was observed during growth on 2 butanol with increases in rate correlated correlated with higher rates of metabolism and increases in optical density associated with increases in biomass this type of growth experiment provides a simple method of evaluating the potential of different alcohols produced by orthosilicates to promote cometabolism cometabolism was continuously observed in the batch tests with all the three of the orthosilicates tested indicating continuous monooxygenase expression all of the orthosilicates were of high purity 95 to 99 indicating it was the alcohol produced that was beneficial in supporting the cometabolic process the high purity was confirmed by gc ms analysis inhibition by the growth substrate on cometabolism was likely not occurring since monooxygenase activity is not needed for alcohol utilization as indicated by the continuous metabolic activity with all three orthosilicates that occurred in the presence of acetylene the differences in the rates of hydrolysis are consistent with previous observations of vancheeswaran et al 1999 who evaluated tbos that produces 1 butanol and tkebs that produces 2 ethylbutanol a branched alcohol abiotic hydrolysis rates for tkebs were an order of magnitude slower than for tbos indicating that branching has an impact on the orthosilicate hydrolysis rates results presented here therefore suggest the rate of hydrolysis for t2bos being a factor of 15 slower than tbos was due to the branching effect previously observed with tbos and tkebs which is qualitatively consistent with observations from arkles et al 1992 the substituent chain length is also important as t2bos that has an additional carbon atom hydrolyzed at a 7 fold slower rate than t2pos the structure of the orthosilicate and the leaving group therefore are important factors that can be used in design of in situ remediation systems for example if higher biomass and higher rate systems are needed tbos would be chosen while for lower biomass and slower rate systems branched with longer chain lengths like t2bos would be used another consideration is delivery of the o2 that is needed for this aerobic process o2 consumption is correlated with the rates of hydrolysis and alcohol release much higher rates of oxygen consumption were observed in tbos fed reactors compared to t2pos and t2bos thus there is a benefit of using a more slowly hydrolyzing orthosilicate the results presented here did not provide strong evidence for the biotic hydrolysis of the orthosilicates rates of alcohol production in the poisoned controls seemed to match the rates of metabolism estimated from o2 consumption and co2 production the zero order rates of co2 production also remained constant with time consistent with the constant zero order rates of alcohol production an acceleration in rate did not occur as might be expected if biotic hydrolysis was occurring and the biomass increased vancheeswaran et al 1999 suggested that biotic hydrolysis was likely in their studies with tbos since they observed the rates increasing as the biomass grew the hydrolysis rates were a factor of 4 to 5 higher in their live versus poisoned controls they however were using a mixed culture in their studies which may have contained microorganisms that possessed enzymes capable of hydrolyzing orthosilicates more research is needed to determine whether atcc strain 21198 has orthosilicate hydrolyzing capabilities and enzymes one benefit of using a pure culture system that does not promote biotic hydrolysis is having more control of the rate of hydrolysis via abiotic processes the results presented here agree with those presented by rasmussen et al 2020 where tbos and t2bos were co encapsulated in gellan gum along with atcc strain 21198 higher rates of hydrolysis metabolism and cometabolism were observed in the reactors containing gellan gum bead containing tbos compared to t2bos both studies were conducted with the same mass loading of orthosilicates to the batch reactors to permit comparison of the direct contact of the orthosilicate and atcc strain 21198 and their co encapsulation in the gellan gum hydrogel the abiotic rates of hydrolysis reported here were 8 to 15 times higher than observed with the encapsulated beads the higher rates of hydrolysis likely resulted from mass transfer issues into the gellan gum beads and the high surface areas created by the colloidal droplets in solution observed in this study the rates of oxygen consumption reported here were factors of 4 and 1 25 times higher for t2bos and tbos respectively compared to the estimates with the co encapsulated beads it is not known why greater differences were not observed one possibility is that there was also an o2 demand associated biodegradation of the gellan gum beads both studies showed consistent results related to the cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d more rapid cometabolic transformation was observed with tbos compared to t2bos and 1 4 d was more rapidly transformed than 1 1 1 tca comparing first order rates between the two studies shows much higher rates observed here compared to the co encapsulated systems consistent with the more rapid rates of hydrolysis in the study of rasmussen et al 2020 cis dce was also present as a co contaminant which may have affected the transformation rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d the present study was conducted in buffer growth media thus representing more optimal conditions compared to those that might be encountered in situ rasmussen et al 2020 presented results where the co encapsulated gellan gum beans containing tbos and atcc strain 21198 were incubated in microcosms containing groundwater and aquifer solids continuous cometabolic transformation of cis dce 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was observed in the microcosms for over 220 days with rates slower but in the range of those in media similar studies are needed for the process reported here where the orthosilicates are directly added along with atcc strain 21198 to groundwater microcosms in these tests atcc strain 21198 would be in competition with indigenous microorganisms for the alcohols that are released but may not promote the cometabolic transformation when gaseous substrates are used isobutane in the case of atcc strain 21198 rolston et al 2019 a monooxygenase is required for substrate utilization and thus indigenous microorganisms that are stimulated will likely cometabolize the contaminants studied here with the gellan gum co encapsulation system the alcohols that are produced are consumed within the hydrogel by the microbial culture that is effective towards cometabolism of contaminants of interest rasmussen et al 2020 thus there is protection offered by the co encapsulation of the microorganism and the orthosilicate within the gel the methods presented here provide a means of investigating other microorganisms that have potential to cometabolize cocs when grown on orthosilicates that slowly release alcohols the method used of direct contact of the orthosilicates with planktonic cells provides a means for growing microorganisms slowly at low substrate concentrations which may be key to obtaining the long term continuous cometabolic transformation the methods provide for a simpler means of testing of slow release compounds that might be incorporated into co encapsulated hydrogel systems 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn for the results that were presented 1 secondary alcohols such as 2 butanol induce monooxygenase activity in atcc strain 21198 during growth whereas primary alcohols such as 1 butanol did not however cometabolism of 1 4 d was observed by 1 butanol grown cells after exposure to 1 4 d 2 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation was achieved during direct growth of atcc strain 21198 on 2 butanol with the first order rates of 1 4 d being a factor of 2 5 times greater than 1 1 1 tca 3 alcohol releasing orthosilicates continually promoted the cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d by atcc strain 21198 for up to 125 days 4 the order of the rates of abiotic hydrolysis of alcohols from orthosilicates were as follows tbos t2pos t2bos the straight chained orthosilicate tbos was hydrolyzed more quickly than the branched chained t2bos the shorter branched chained t2pos were hydrolyzed more quickly than the longer chained t2bos 5 there are strong correlations between the rates of metabolism and cometabolism and the rates of alcohol production by the orthosilicates with pearson r values ranging from 0 9307 to 0 9971 the correlations likely result from the higher biomass of atcc strain 21198 being maintained by the more rapidly hydrolyzing orthosilicates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

using slow release compounds srcs as growth substrates for pure cultures of rhodococcus rhodochrous atcc 21198 atcc strain 21198 resting cell transformation tests showed 1 4 d transformation occurred without a lag phase for cells grown on 2 butanol while an induction period of several hours was required for 1 butanol grown cells these observations were consistent with activity based labeling patterns for monooxygenase hydroxylase components and specific rates of tetrahydrofuran thf degradation 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d degradation rates for alcohol grown cells were slower than those for cells grown on gaseous alkanes such as isobutane batch metabolism and degradation tests were performed in the presence of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d with the growth of atcc strain 21198 on alcohols produced by the hydrolysis of orthosilicates three orthosilicates were tested tetrabutylorthosilicate tbos tetra s butylorthosilicate t2bos and tetraisopropoxysilane t2pos the measured rates of alcohol release in poisoned controls depended on the orthosilicate structure with tbos which produced a 1 alcohol 1 butanol hydrolyzing more rapidly than t2pos and t2bos that produced the 2 alcohols 2 butanol and 2 propanol respectively the orthosilicates were added as light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls with atcc strain 21198 and formed dispersed droplets when continuously mixed continuous rates of oxygen o2 consumption and carbon dioxide co2 production confirmed alcohol metabolism by atcc strain 21198 was occurring the rates of metabolism tbos t2pos t2bos were consistent with the rates of alcohol release via abiotic hydrolysis 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca were continuously transformed in successive additions by atcc strain 21198 over 125 days with the rates highly correlated with the rates of metabolism the metabolism of the alcohols was not inhibited by acetylene while transformation of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca was inhibited by this gas as acetylene is a potent inactivator of diverse bacterial monooxygenases these results suggest that monooxygenase activity was required for the observed cometabolic transformations but not for alcohol utilization alcohol concentrations in the biologically active reactors were maintained below the levels of detection indicating they were metabolized rapidly after being produced much lower rates of o2 consumption were observed in the reactors containing t2bos which has benefits for in situ bioremediation the results illustrate the importance of the structure of the src when developing passive aerobic cometabolic treatment systems keywords cometabolism orthosilicates

shampoos contraceptives and is a byproduct during the manufacture of polyethylene terephthalate pet us epa 2017 historically 1 4 d was most frequently used as a chemical stabilizer for chlorinated solvents such as 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca to prevent decomposition due to reactions from light heat oxygen or acid base chemistry mohr 2001 us epa 2017 1 1 1 tca formulas contain up to 5 1 4 d mohr 2001 and due to poor solvent disposal practices 1 4 d is now a commonly detected groundwater contaminant in areas with chlorinated solvent contamination adamson et al 2011 for example in an evaluation of over 2000 sites in california 1 4 d was detected at 194 sites and 95 of these sites contain one or more chlorinated solvent adamson et al 2014 and 76 had both 14 d and 1 1 1 tca present 1 4 d has several characteristics that create challenges for remediation of contaminated aquifers 1 4 d is fully miscible in water infinitely soluble and has a low octanol water partition coefficient kow mohr 2001 us epa 2017 1 4 d is generally resistant to anaerobic transformation mcelroy et al 2019 these characteristics result in 1 4 d having a high mobility in groundwater with the potential to

and in situ methods for treating 1 4 d have been reviewed by mcelroy et al 2019 and zhang et al 2017 in situ bioremediation can potentially provide a large cost savings for the treatment of 1 4 d direct metabolism of 1 4 d as a sole carbon and energy source has been demonstrated for a number of pure cultures of bacteria and fungi zhang et al 2017 mcelroy et al 2019 growth is fairly inefficient with high whole cell half saturation constants ranging from 17 5 to 160 mg l slow growth rates low biomass yields and low enzymatic activity barajas rodriguez and freeman 2018 mcelroy et al 2019 thus treating low concentrations 100 ppb of 1 4 d is expected to be ineffective using microorganisms that directly metabolize and grow on 1 4 d aerobic cometabolism is a particularly attractive option as specific microorganisms can be stimulated in situ using selective primary substrates to drive the transformation semprini 1997 frascari et al 2015 microbial growth on the primary substrates leads to expression of oxygenase enzymes that can then fortuitously oxidize and remediate contaminants to low concentration levels needed for the in situ treatment of 1 4 d cometabolic transformation of 1 4 d has been reported on a range of substrates for growth and or induction of cometabolic enzymes as reviewed by zhang et al 2017 and mcelroy et al 2019 common gaseous substrates include propane barajas rodriguez and freeman 2018 lippincott et al 2015 vainberg et al 2006 ethane hatzinger et al 2017 and isobutane rolston et al 2019 recent in situ studies for 1 4 d remediation have focused on aerobic cometabolism using microorganisms simulated on propane as a primary substrate using either sparging lippincott et al 2015 or recirculation well technology chu et al 2018 matrix diffusion or the diffusion of contaminants between high and low permeability zones can complicate remediation practices parker et al 2008 decades of matrix diffusion can cause the low permeability zones to act as a storage for high concentrations of groundwater contaminants matrix diffusion causes the contaminants of concern cocs to be released back into high permeability zones liu and ball 2005 an analytical modeling study by adamson et al 2016 investigated the behavior of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca under various loading conditions in a dual media aquifer containing a high permeability sand and a low permeability layer silt the study indicated that remediation methods such as pump and treat are significantly hindered due to the release of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca from the low permeability media after initial treatment of the high permeability zone due to the existence of long plumes of low concentration and matrix diffusion over extended periods there is an interest in developing passive in situ treatment systems passive treatment systems such as permeable reactive barriers prbs have the potential to reduce costs and eliminate the need to extract groundwater or continuously add substrates acceptors and nutrients for biological treatment or chemical treatment scherer et al 2008 provide a review of permeable reactive barriers for groundwater treatment using chemical and biological methods cometabolic treatment systems require the continuous addition of a primary substrate and this can lead to competitive inhibition of the contaminant transforming monooxygenase and a decrease in process efficiency semprini 1997 frascari et al 2015 this has led to strategies for in situ treatment such as the pulsed addition of the primary substrate semprini et al 1990 mccarty et al 1998 a goal of the research presented here is to develop more passive systems for the cometabolic treatment of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca and other cocs the objective was to evaluate slow release compounds srcs that slowly hydrolyze to produce primary growth substrates that do not inhibit the monooxygenase enzyme but promote continuous and effective cometabolic treatment an effective src would slowly supply the growth substrate needed for the cometabolically active microorganisms while also promoting the production of the monooxygenase enzyme required for the contaminant transformation the src would undergo abiotic hydrolysis with water to produce the substrate used by the microorganism and would be resistant to biotic hydrolysis to increase its long term potential as a substrate the src should have a low solubility in water permitting its addition as a non aqueous phase liquid napl for in situ bioremediation this property would also permit its co encapsulation at high concentrations with the selected microorganism in hydrogel beads that could be used to create a prb an src that upon hydrolysis produces food grade substrate is also of interest to facilitate its in situ use the microorganism evaluated in this study was rhodococcus rhodochrous 21198 atcc strain 21198 when grown on isobutane atcc strain 21198 cometabolically transforms 1 4 d rapidly via first order rates to low concentrations of 1 ppb rolston et al 2019 isobutane grown cells of this organism can also transform a broad range of chlorinated ethanes including 1 1 1 tca 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca and chlorinated ethenes including 1 2 cis dichloroethene cis dce 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce and vinyl chloride vc thankitkul 2016 krippaehne 2018 mixtures of 1 4 d 1 1 1 tca 1 1 dce and 1 2 dca are also effectively transformed by atcc strain 21198 krippaehne 2018 previous studies with mycobacterium vaccae job5 and rhodoccoccus jostii rha demonstrated these bacteria can cometabolize 1 4 d and tce when grown on 1 butanol hand et al 2015 atcc strain 21198 has also been reported to cometabolically degrade vc after growth on 2 propanol kuntz et al 2003 thus there is the potential of supporting the cometabolic transformation by srcs that produce alcohols in earlier but unrelated studies it was observed that aerobic cometabolism of tce and cis dce could be achieved by a mixed culture maintained on orthosilicates that hydrolyze to form alcohols vancheeswaran et al 1999 semprini and vancheeswaran 2002 the orthosilicates have four organic groups linked to the central silicon atom via oxygen bonds and upon hydrolysis produce four alcohols fig 1 shows an example of an orthosilicate used in this study tetra s butyl orthosilicate t2bos that hydrolyzes to produce 2 butanol ihlenfeldt et al 2009 vancheeswaran et al 1999 evaluated two orthosilicates tetrabutyl orthosilicate tbos and tetrakis 2 ethylbutoxy silane tkebs that hydrolyzed to form 1 butanol and ethylbutanol respectively abiotic hydrolysis rates of tkebs were an order of magnitude slower than tbos indicating the branched nature of the alcohol groups slowed the rates of hydrolysis for the microbial community enriched on tbos the hydrolysis rates were higher than the abiotic rates suggesting biotic hydrolysis of the orthosilicate ester linkages rasmussen et al 2020 presented results where atcc strain 21198 was co encapsulated in a gellan gum hydrogel along with tbos or t2bos as srcs long term cometabolic transformation of a mixture of 1 1 1 tca cis dce and 1 4 d was maintained for over 300 days as the contaminants diffused into the beads and were cometabolically transformed these results illustrated the promise of co encapsulation atcc strain 21198 with orthosilicates to produce cometabolic gellan gum beads that can be potentially used to create prbs the work presented here was conducted in parallel with that of rasmussen et al 2020 and provides a different system of testing and potential direct use of the orthosilicates as srcs in this study orthosilicates were added as a neat lnapl phase along with atcc strain 21198 in batch reactors the objective was to determine what alcohols promoted the cometabolic transformation of 1 4 d by atcc strain 21198 once the potential alcohols were determined the orthosilicates that produced the alcohol through hydrolysis were selected for study in batch systems atcc strain 21198 was grown on the selected orthosilicates and the simultaneous transformation of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca was evaluated the abiotic hydrolysis rates of the orthosilicate were also determined under the same conditions of the batch incubations using poisoned controls the rates of metabolism via oxygen o2 consumption and carbon dioxide co2 production were compared with the rates of cometabolism and the abiotic rates of alcohol production three different orthosilicates were evaluated tetra butyl orthosilicate tbos tetra s butyl orthosilicate t2bos and tetra isopropoxysilane t2pos that produce 1 butanol 2 butanol and 2 propanol respectively the tests were performed in batch reactors and monitored for up to 125 days to evaluate their long term performance these comparisons provided insight into how the structure of the orthosilicates are an important variable when selecting src for a passive cometabolic treatment system the method provides a simpler system for evaluation of the src since encapsulation is not required the study is also a first step in evaluating the potential for the direct addition of the src as a lnapl along with the desired microorganism to promote long term cometabolic treatment further investigations are needed under groundwater microcosm conditions where competition can occur with native microorganisms that may not promote cometabolism when grown on the alcohols studied 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were analytical grade isobutane 99 99 gas

of rhodococcus rhodochrous atcc 21198 for resting cell and cometabolism tests r rhodochrous atcc 21198 obtained from the american type culture collection manassas va was grown on isobutane 1 butanol 2 butanol and 2 propanol in 720 ml glass bottles containing 270 ml of phosphate buffered mineral salts medium msm kottegoda et al 2015 and 450 ml of air headspace as described by rolston et al 2019 the cells were incubated at 30 c at 200 rpm and harvested at the late exponential growth phase by centrifugation at 15 000 g for 10 min the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer 25 ml and centrifugation and decanting of the supernatant was repeated the biomass concentration was determined using a total suspended solids tss test as described in awwa standards rice et al 2017 protein analysis was used to quantify the tss protein ratio under the growth conditions described the ratio of protein to tss was 0 45 mg protein mg tss rolston et al 2019 for activity based labeling studies atcc strain 21198 was grown in batch culture in glass serum vials 160 ml sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals wheaton scientific millville n j the vials contained mineral salts medium msm 23 ml wiegant and de bont 1980 and were inoculated to an initial optical density od600 of 0 02 using cells previously grown on agar plates containing casein yeast extract dextrose cyd media isobutane 10 v v gas phase or alcohols 0 1 v v liquid phase were added as sole sources of carbon and energy and the cultures were grown in the dark in an environmental shaker operated at 30 c and 150 rpm after growth for 3 days the culture vials were opened in a sterile laminar flow hood to replenish air in the vials after equilibration for 10 min the vials were resealed and the original growth substrate was added again to the original initial concentration once the final culture od600 reached 0 7 a sample 20 μl of the culture was plated on cyd plates to subsequently confirm the purity of the culture the remaining cells were harvested by centrifugation 10 000 g 5 min at 4 c the supernatant was decanted and the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in buffer 10 ml 50 mm sodium phosphate ph 7 0 and centrifuged again 10 000 g 5 min at 4 c the cell pellet was finally resuspended in buffer to a protein concentration of 10 mg ml and the washed cells were stored on ice and used for experiments within 4 h 2 3 activity based labeling the activity based labeling method was based on procedures described by bennett et al 2016 to covalently fluorescently label components of ammonia monooxygenase amo the first step of this two step method involves the in vivo mechanism based inactivation of active monooxygenases in cells by a diyne probe such as 1 7 octadiyne 17od this activation targets one of the terminal alkyne groups of the probe and generates a reactive intermediate that reacts with one or more amino acids in the active site of the enzyme this results in an irreversible loss of enzyme activity through formation of a covalent enzyme probe adduct that retains the probe s second but unreacted terminal alkyne group the second in vitro step involves a copper catalyzed alkyne azide cycloaddition cuaac reaction between this unreacted alkyne group and an azide containing fluor the resulting fluorescently labeled polypeptides can then be separated and visualized by sds page and subsequent nir scanning of the unstained gel while the second step of this abl process and the sds page analysis are entirely independent of the target enzyme the first step requires that the target monooxygenases are sensitive to mechanism based inactivation by alkynes the monooxygenase catalyzed 1 4 d degrading activity of atcc strain 21198 is fully inhibited by acetylene rolston et al 2019 and is therefore expected to be detectable using our abl approach the abl approach can be used to determine both the presence and relative amount of active monooxygenase in cells at any time by sampling cells and exposing them to 17od as the binding of the activated probe to the monooxygenases active site containing polypeptide requires the catalytic activity of the enzyme itself the abl method only generates fluorescently labeled polypeptides of appropriate mass if monooxygenase are present and active as the stoichiometry of probe binding events to monooxygenase inactivation events is expected to be near constant the level of fluorescence detected after sds page and nir scanning is also expected to be proportional to the amount of active enzyme present in the cells at their time of exposure to 17od in the present study the first step of the procedure was conducted in glass serum vials 10 ml sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum tear off seals the reactions contained 17od 100 μm added from a stock solution 0 1 m in dmso and were initiated by the addition of harvested cells 1 ml to the reaction vial which were then incubated for 30 min in a shaking water bath operated at 30 c and 150 rpm after this incubation the incubated cells were pelleted by centrifugation 10 000 g 5 min washed twice with buffer 1 ml 50 mm sodium phosphate ph 7 0 and finally

current of 25 35 ma to visualize fluorescently labeled polypeptides immediately after electrophoresis the unfixed gel was scanned with an li cor odyssey 9120 ir scanner li cor biotechnology lincoln ne and migration of fluorescently labeled nir marker proteins was used to estimate the mass of fluorescently labeled bacterial polypeptides bennett et al 2016 the gel images were recorded and analyzed by odyssey imaging system application software version 3 0 the protein concentration of all cell extracts was determined by biuret protein assay gornall et al 1949 in summary samples were solubilized by incubation with 1 5 m naoh final concentration at 65 c for 30 min the solubilized protein sample was briefly centrifuged 10 000 g 5 min to remove insoluble material was then assayed using bovine serum albumin as a standard 2 5 resting cell 1 4 d transformation tests resting cell 1 4 d transformation tests were performed in sterile 27 ml batch vials sealed with butyl rubber septa and crimp tops as described by rolston et al 2019 phosphate buffered nutrient medium 10 ml was added along with cells 5 mg tss experimental controls included an abiotic control no cells and an acetylene control 10 v v gas phase to inactivate the monooxygenase enzyme hyman and wood 1985 acetylene was found to be an effective inhibitor of 1 4 d cometabolism and isobutane utilization by atcc strain 21198 rolston et al 2019 acetylene was generated from the reaction of water with calcium carbide cac2 and then added to the reactor headspace acetylene was allowed to equilibrate with the cells for 1 h on a shaker table 200 rpm before 1 4 d or isobutane was added which ensured the monooxygenase enzyme were fully inactivated the batch reactors were incubated at 30 c while shaking at 200 rpm to ensure equilibrium was maintained between the gas and liquid phases throughout the experiment cometabolism tests were performed at an aqueous concentration of 1 4 d of 17 6 mg l the degradation of thf was determined in small scale reactions conducted in glass serum vials 10 ml the vials contained 50 mm phosphate buffer 900 μl and were sealed with teflon lined mininert valves thf was added to the vials to an initial concentration of 1 mm using a freshly prepared aqueous solution 0 1 m the vials were then placed in a heated shaking water bath 3 c 150 rpm for 10 min to allow equilibration of the thf between the gas and liquid phase the reactions were initiated by adding aliquots 100 μl of concentrated cell suspension the reaction vials were then returned to the shaking water bath and samples were removed as required for analysis of residual thf by gas chromatography 2 6 cometabolism tests methods presented by vancheeswaran et al 1999 were used to evaluate the growth of atcc strain 21198 on tbos t2bos and t2pos as srcs and cometabolism of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d in summary batch tests were performed in autoclaved glass serum bottles 178 ml sealed with screw on caps with butyl rubber septa and each experimental condition was conducted in duplicate the batch reactors were constructed aseptically in a laminar flow hood and contained phosphate buffer msm 68 ml with the remaining volume 110 ml as air headspace the reactor medium was inoculated with a small amount of isobutane grown cells of atcc strain 21198 0 1 mg tss to ensure that cell growth would be observed during the test tests were first performed to examine growth directly on alcohols by adding individual alcohols 45 μmol to the batch reactors for tests with orthosilicates as long term sources of alcohols the neat compounds were added directly to the medium to achieve a nominal non dissolved concentration of 1500 mg l these nominal concentrations are above the aqueous solubility limit the orthosilicates were present as dispersed lnapls when the batch reactors were incubated on the rotary shaker table at 150 rpm as described by vancheeswaran et al 1999 the solubility of tbos in water at 20 c is less than 1 mg l vancheeswaran 1998 thus strain atcc 21198 was exposed to both the dissolved and non aqueous phase orthosilicate 1 4 d 59 μl was added from a 1000 ppm aqueous stock solution while 1 1 1 tca 23 μl was added from a saturated aqueous stock solution to achieve the desired mass additions several additions of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca were made over the time course of the experiment in order to study the abiotic hydrolysis of the orthosilicates batch reactors were constructed as described above with sodium azide 0 2 w v added from a 1 m aqueous stock solution to investigate the role of monooxygenases in the transformation of orthosilicates 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca control reactions were prepared as described above with acetylene 10 v v added to the reaction headspace to evaluate the ability of resting cells to transform the mixtures of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca controls tests were also constructed with the initial cell inoculum 0 1 mg tss added but with no orthosilicate present 2 7 analytical methods details of the analytical methods for the headspace measurement of 1 1 1 tca and the aqueous concentration of 1 4 d are described by rolston et al 2019 briefly 1 1 1 tca was measured in a 0 1 ml gas headspace sample on a hewlett packard series 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector ecd chromatographic separation was achieved using an agilent technologies inc db 62941 column with helium as a carrier gas at 8 ml min and the ecd received a flow of 95 argon and 5 methane at ultra high purity airgas corvallis albany or the temperatures of the oven injector and detector were 100 c 250 c and 250 c respectively the residence time of 1 1 1 tca was 1 3 min the method was quantified using external standards the quantification limits for 1 1 1 tca was around 1 μg l at an equilibrated aqueous concentration in the reactor the headspace oxygen o2 and carbon dioxide co2 concentrations were used as indicators of metabolic activity headspace o2 was quantified with a hewlett packard 5890 gc equipped with a supelco 60 80 carboxen 1000 column and a thermal conductivity detector tcd the temperatures of the oven injector and detector were 40 c 275 c and 275 c respectively ultra high purity helium airgas corvallis albany or was the carrier gas flowing at 30 ml min the o2 residence time was 4 5 min co2 was also quantified with a hewlett packard 5890 gc equipped with a supelco 60 80 carboxen 1000 column equipped with a tcd detector the temperature of the oven injector and detector were 220 c 275 c and 275 c respectively ultra high purity argon was used airgas corvallis albany or as the carrier gas flowing at 15 ml min the residence time for co2 was 3 min both the o2 and co2 headspace concentrations were quantified using external standards with argon used as the carrier gas the atmospheric concentration of co2 could be measured and represented the initial headspace concentration in the reactors the concentration of the alcohols 1 butanol 2 butanol and 2 propanol in active and poisoned reactors was determined by gc analysis of aqueous samples to avoid sampling the non aqueous phase orthosilicate the aqueous samples were obtained by inverting the batch reactors so that the orthosilicate lnapl floated to the top of the medium and aqueous sample was obtained from the middle of the reactor the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf filter and 5 μl was injected to a hewlett packard 5890 gc with a 0 2 cw 1500 80 100 carbopack c column and fid detector the temperatures of the oven injector and detector were 105 c 150 c and 175 c respectively residence times for 1 butanol 2 butanol and 2 propanol were 3 5 3 5 and 1 2 min respectively the alcohol detection limit for this analysis was 1 mg l 1 4 d was analyzed from liquid samples on a hewlett packard series 6890 gas chromatograph model 5973 mass spectrometer gc ms preceded by a tekmar dohrmann model 3100 heated purge and trap concentrator rolston et al 2019 describe details of the method the gc ms was run in single ion mode for m z 88 1 4 d and m z 96 deuterated 1 4 d run as an internal standard draper et al 2000 the 1 4 d quantification limit was 0 1 μg l with a 25 ml aqueous sample samples from the batch reactors 0 3 ml l were diluted 125 to 250 times in di water when loaded onto the purge and trap concentrator for the analysis of thf degradation aqueous samples 2 μl from the sealed reaction vials were immediately injected into a shimadzu gc 8a gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization detector and a stainless steel column 0 3 by 183 cm filled with porapak q 60 to 80 mesh waters associates framingham mass the analysis was conducted with a column temperature of 160 c an injection port temperature of 200 c and a detector temperature of 220 c nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15 ml min 1 the gas chromatograph was interfaced with a hewlett packard hp3395 hewlett packard palo alto calif integrator for data collection rates of thf degradation were determined from plots of residual thf versus time for samples taken every 10 min after the addition of cells the rates were determined by linear regression analyses quantification of thf was determined by the calibration plots developed using authentic standards of thf 2 8 mass balances for the duration of each experiment the batch reactors were stored at 20 c and shaken at 150 rpm on a rotary shaker table to maintain equilibrium partitioning between the headspace and liquid phases the total mass mt of each compound was calculated from eq 1 where the concentration in the aqueous phase cl concentration in the headspace cg volume of the liquid vl and the headspace volume vg are the concentrations and volumes in the liquid and gas compartments respectively and hcc is the dimensionless henry s constant equal to the ratio of a compound in the gas and liquid phases hcc values were 49 2 0 0002 0 548 31 5 and 1 20 for isobutane 1 4 d 1 1 1 tca o2 and co2 respectively sander 1999 1 mass t c g v l h cc v g zero order rates of o2 consumption co2 and alcohol production and first order rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were determined via linear regression of the mass histories using microsoft excel 3 experimental results 3 1 activity based labeling the abl approach used in this study targets the hydroxylase components of catalytically active monooxgenases and generates a covalent fluor probe enzyme adduct that can be visualized by nir scanning of sds page analyses of protein extracts from cells in this study we used whole cells assays to determine monooxygenase activity and these rates were then compared to the fluorescent abl patterns and intensity for cells grown on the same substrates the activity of cells was initially determined by determining the specific rate of consumption of thf a structural analog of 1 4 d cells grown on gaseous alkanes c2 c4 all exhibited high rates of degradation of thf 40 110 nmoles min mg total protein fig 2a with the lowest rate observed with propane grown cells and the highest rates observed with cells grown on n butane or isobutane only very low rates of thf consumption 5 nmoles min mg total protein were determined for cells grown on the 1 alcohols tested ethanol 1 propanol 1 butanol isobutanol while low but readily detectable rates of thf consumption 10 15 nmoles min mg total protein were detected for cells grown on 2 alcohols 2 propanol and 2 butanol in the abl assays isobutane grown cells were used to illustrate the labeling pattern and intensity for cells with high level of monooxygenase activity fig 2b the labeling pattern included at least one intensely labeled polypeptide with a mass of 60 kda and several substantially less intensely labeled smaller polypeptides in the case of alcohol grown cells no labeling was observed for cells grown on any of the primary 1 alcohols tested ethanol 1 propanol 1 butanol and isobutanol while low levels of labeling were observed for cells grown on either 2 butanol or 2 propanol cells grown on 2 butanol exhibited labeling of a 60 kda polypeptide while the lower level of labeling was associated with a larger 70 kda polypeptide 3 2 resting cell transformation of 1 4 dioxane by strain 21198 resting cell transformation tests were performed with strain atcc 21198 grown on either 1 butanol 2 butanol 2 propanol or isobutane to investigate whether the trends observed in the abl experiments also occurred with 1 4 d both isobutane fig 3a and 2 butanol grown cells fig 3c immediately transformed 1 4 d 17 6 mg l without a lag phase although the rates of 1 4 d degradation by 2 butanol grown cells were 5 fold lower than isobutane grown cells 2 propanol grown cells also immediately transformed 1 4 d but at rate 9 slower than isobutane grown cells data not shown in contrast 1 butanol grown cells only transformed 1 4 d after a lag period of 3 to 4 h one possibility is that an induction period was required before transformation occurred fig 3b the mechanism responsible for this delay in transformation with 1 butanol grown cells need further investigation after the lag period 1 4 d was transformed at rate 14 times lower than isobutane grown cells 3 3 cometabolic transformation of 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca during growth on 2 butanol as cells grown on 2 butanol appeared to have readily detectable rates of monooxygenase catalyzed reactions we subsequently examined the longer term degradation of contaminants 1 4 d and 1 1 1 tca by atcc strain 21198 when growing on 2 butanol in batch reactors our results fig 4 are presented for the second addition of 2 butanol to the reactors the production of co2 and utilization of 2 butanol fig 4a the increase in optical density fig 4b all demonstrate that in this experimental system atcc strain 21198 grew on 2 butanol within approximately 1 day following a second addition of 2 butanol degradation of 1 4 d fig 4c accelerated as microbial growth occurred with most of the degradation occurring 0 5 to 1 5 days after the alcohol addition 1 4 d transformation lagged the consumption of 2 butanol modeling of substrate utilization coupled with microbial growth and the cometabolic transformation would help to determine if the observed responses are consistent with the increase in biomass that was observed 1 1 1 tca fig 4c transformation was consistent with 1 4 d however 1 1 1 tca was transformed at a slower rate the slowing in rates after 1 5 days may result from 1 1 1 tca concentrations being reduced below the half substrate concentration ks value based on the results presented in fig 4 both zero order and first order rate estimates were made of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d cometabolism while zero order rate estimates were made for co2 production and o2 and 2 butanol consumption table s3 similar rates estimates were obtained for the duplicate reactors and consistent increases in rates were observed with the second addition of 2 butanol the first order rates for 1 1 1 tca increased by a factor of 2 1 while for 1 4 d by a factor of 2 3 between the first and second additions the increase transformation rates are consistent with the increased rates of metabolism as indicated by co2 production and 2 butanol consumption the zero order rates of co2 production increased by a factor of 2 0 while that of 2 butanol was 3 4 the results are consistent with the increase in o d resulting from the increase biomass the first order rates of 1 4 d transformation were a factor of 2 3 and 2 5 greater than 1 1 1 tca in in the first and second addition respectively a more detailed modeling analysis is needed that relates microbial growth substrate utilization and the cometabolic transformation to show that the increase in rates were associated with an increase in biomass concentration 3 4 abiotic hydrolysis of orthosilicates in order to provide for a long term source of alcohols 1500 mg l of three orthosilicates tbos t2bos and t2pos were added to reactors as an lnapl equating to 310 μmoles of tbos and t2bos and 380 μmoles of t2pos in each reactor mixing on the rotary shaker table dispersed the lnapl fine droplets and provided a high surface area for interaction with water the time course of alcohol production via abiotic hydrolysis of each orthosilicate in poisoned controls showed a near linear increase in each case indicating the abiotic hydrolysis rate followed pseudo zero order kinetics fig 5 the zero order rates of alcohol production determined via linear regression were 11 1 5 1 and 0 76 μmol day for tbos t2pos and t2bos respectively when normalized for the aqueous volume present the rates were 62 4 28 7 and 4 3 μmol l day respectively of the initial tbos t2bos t2pos added 62 99 5 and 87 respectively would remain at the end of the incubations based on the abiotic hydrolysis rates 3 5 metabolism and cometabolism on t2bos tbos and t2pos 3 5 1 metabolism with t2bos metabolism in the batch reactors was determined through the monitoring of co2 production and o2 consumption in the reactor headspace while cometabolism was monitored by the concentration histories of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d the long term observations from the t2bos reactor are shown in fig 6 the early rapid increase in co2 likely results from the 2 butanol present as an impurity in the neat t2bos that was added the initial 2 butanol concentration decreased rapidly in both the live and the acetylene treated reactors fig 5b a constant and gradual increase in co2 was then observed over 125 days between day 5 and day 125 approximately 30 μmol of co2 were produced in the reactor headspace co2 production was also observed in the batch reactor containing acetylene fig 6a which is consistent with 2 butanol utilization not requiring monooxygenase activity no co2 production was observed in the poisoned control the gradual increases in co2 are consistent with the slow rates of hydrolysis observed in the poisoned control fig 5b it should be noted that a large fraction of the co2 produced is present as bicarbonate ion at the buffered ph of 7 2 the mass shown represents only the co2 in the headspace after the initial 2 butanol added as an impurity of the neat t2bos was consumed 2 butanol was not detected in the aqueous phase the live reactors with and without acetylene indicating that it was rapidly utilized as it was produced via hydrolysis fig 5b a slow but gradual rate of o2 consumption was observed compared to the poisoned and abiotic controls fig 6b o2 consumption occurred in all the reactors where co2 accumulated including the acetylene treated control reactors the rate of o2 consumption fig 5b is in the range expected from the utilization of the 2 butanol produced via hydrolysis fig 5b and the development of microbial biomass approximately 200 μmol of o2 were consumed over 125 days while 65 μmol of 2 butanol were produced via abiotic hydrolysis representing a 3 to 1 stoichiometric ratio a stoichiometric ratio of 6 to 1 is required for complete oxidation of 2 butanol to co2 and h2o the lower observed ratio is consistent with the incorporation of a fraction of the 2 butanol into biomass co2 production and o2 consumption and 2 butanol concentrations being below detection all support continuous metabolic activity over the 125 days of incubation the acetylene live treatment tracked the live treatments without acetylene demonstrating the monooxygenase activity was not required to metabolize 2 butanol 3 5 2 cometabolism with t2bos the concentration histories of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d for the batch tests with t2bos are shown in fig 6 c and d three additions of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were made to the biologically active reactors at 0 21 and 60 days the acetylene treated the poisoned and cell only reactors received only one addition of 1 1 1 tca and two additions of 1 4 d consistent with co2 production as an indicator of metabolic activity fig 6a 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were both cometabolically transformed during the first 20 days of incubation minimal decreases in 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were observed in the abiotic and acetylene treated live control 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation not being observed in the live acetylene treated control indicates monooxygenase activity was responsible for their transformation the rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation decreased slightly in the second addition for the initial transformation test day 0 to 20 the cells had access to the free aqueous 2 butanol from the impurity present in the neat t2bos which likely facilitated the more rapid cometabolic transformation a third addition of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was made to the active bottles around day 60 the same mass of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were added except for active bottle 1 ab1 for ab1 a 10 fold greater mass of 1 4 d was added to investigate the transformation rate at higher 1 4 d concentrations fig 6d the increased 1 4 d concentration was effectively cometabolized and its higher concentration did not affect the first order rate of 1 1 1 tca transformation fig 6c the results show the cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was maintained over a period of 125 days with a single addition of t2bos as discussed above the sustained metabolism was achieved over this period the observations support sustained cometabolism of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d driven by the continuous metabolism of 2 butanol produced from t2bos hydrolysis 3 5 3 metabolism with tbos fig 7 shows the results from the incubation of atcc strain 21198 with tbos since the abiotic hydrolysis of tbos was a factor of 15 higher than t2bos fig 5 much higher rates of metabolism were expected a continuous increase in co2 headspace concentration was observed over the 45 days of the test in both the live reactors and the acetylene treated control one of the duplicates had a slower rate of co2 accumulation while the acetylene treated control matched the other duplicate the zero order rate of co2 production in the tbos reactors were factors of 7 to 14 times higher than the t2bos reactors table s5 consistent with the higher rate of tbos hydrolysis after the repair of the gas chromatograph measurements of headspace o2 concentrations were initiated on day 21 it should be noted that the build up in 1 butanol observed between 17 and 20 days fig 5a was likely associated with o2 becoming limiting in the reactor headspace upon adding o2 1 butanol was rapidly consumed fig 5a over the period of 20 to 25 days the duplicate with the slower rate of co2 production had a slower rate of o2 consumption the slower rates might be associated with a lower initial biomass of strain atcc 21198 in the reactor due to the high rate of consumption o2 was added to the reactors on days 20 28 and 34 after the third addition the rates of o2 consumption were similar in all reactors likely indicating the development of a similar biomass the much higher utilization of o2 in the tbos reactors compared to the t2bos reactors is evident a buildup of 1 butanol was only observed in the poisoned control fig 5a concentrations remained near detection in the live and acetylene treated reactor indicating 1 butanol was rapidly consumed upon release from tbos hydrolysis the acetylene treated control also showed similar rates of co2 production and o2 consumption as the active bottles that lacked acetylene consistent with the t2bos results like 2 butanol 1 butanol consumption was not inhibited by acetylene as monooxygenase activity is not required for alcohol utilization 3 5 4 cometabolism with tbos 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d concentration histories for the tbos reactors are shown fig 7c and d the duplicate reactor that more slowly produced co2 and consumed o2 initially lags in 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation which likely a results of lower biomass being present the rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation increase in the second and third additions indicating an increasing biomass in that reactor the duplicate reactor showed increasing cometabolic rates consistent with increase in the rate of oxygen uptake the results support an increase in biomass concentration resulting from microbial growth continuous transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was observed over the 45 day study no transformation was observed in the acetylene treated control consistent with the t2bos reactor observations 3 5 5 metabolism with t2pos fig 8 presents the results from the incubation of atcc strain 21198 with t2pos t2pos has a rate of hydrolysis between that of t2bos and tbos fig 5c thus the rate of metabolism and cometabolism is expected to be in between those of tbos and t2bos duplicate active bottles showed very reproducible rates of co2 production and o2 consumption the acetylene treated control showed a more rapid increase co2 production and o2 consumption possibly due to more t2pos being accidentally added to this reactor resulting in a higher rate of alcohol release consistent with the rate of hydrolysis the rates of co2 production and o2 consumption were between those of the t2bos and tbos reactors table s6 3 5 6 cometabolism with t2pos the continuous transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was observed in the duplicate live reactors some resting cell transformation was observed inoculum control however after 7 days transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d slowed whereas the active bottles transformation continued another addition of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was added on day 19 and the active bottles continued to transform 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d consistent with the tbos and the t2bos tests transformation was not observed in the reactor containing acetylene 3 5 7 comparison of rates of metabolism and cometabolism observed with t2bos tbos and t2pos data used to calculate rates for single reactors are presented in tables s4 to s6 and figs s4 s8 both zero order and first order rate estimates were made of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d cometabolism while zero order rate estimates were made for co2 production and o2 consumption the first order rate estimates were made over the full range of concentrations while zero order made over the periods of the highest rates of contaminant decrease in the t2bos reactors the first order and zero order rates of cometabolism were similar for the duplicates table s4 the first order rates decreased with each addition of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d the initial rate was a factor of 5 greater for 1 1 1 tca and approximately 10 higher for 1 4 d compared to the rate estimated for the third addition a much higher concentration of 1 4 d was added in the third addition which resulted in a higher zero order rate similar rates of co2 production and o2 consumption were observed in the duplicates consistent with the similar rates of cometabolism these rates could not normalized by biomass present since it was not measured thus metabolic comparison were made it is interesting to compare the rates observed with t2bos to those obtained with the growth directly on 2 butanol fig 4 table s3 the first order rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d achieved with their first addition in the t2bos reactors was 0 4 and 0 5 respectively of those obtained during the growth of 2 butanol the rate of 1 4 d was also a factor of 2 5 times higher than 1 1 1 tca during this period consistent observations during growth on 2 butanol these high rates support early growth on 2 butanol that was present in the t2bos by the third addition of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d to the t2bos reactors the rates were reduced by over an order magnitude compared to those obtained during direct growth on 2 butanol in the tbos reactors table s5 the first order rates more than doubled for both 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d with the three additions while zero order rates increased by a factor three while the first order rate of the duplicates initially differed by a factor of three they were very similar by the third addition the first order rates were higher than observed in the tests with t2bos consistent with the higher rates of metabolism and alcohol production for example both the rates of co2 production and o2 consumption were approximately a factor of 20 higher in the tbos reactors than the t2bos reactor the higher rates of metabolism are consistent with the rate of 1 butanol release which was about a factor of 15 greater than 2 butanol the first order rates of cometabolism of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d ranged from 10 to 20 times higher in the tbos reactors supporting a greater biomass developing in these reactors in in the t2pos reactors table s6 the first order rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation were very similar in the duplicate reactors and remained fairly constant between the first and second additions the rates of co2 production and o2 consumption was also very similar between the duplicates the estimated first order rates in between those observed in the t2bos and tbos fig 9 provides a summary of the estimated rates provided in the si figs s4 s8 zero order rates were provided for for co2 and alcohol production while first order fits were provided for 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d since they provide better fits to these data a pearson s correlation analysis of the rates was performed in microsoft excel and the results are provide in table s7 the results show a strong correlation between rates of metabolism as indicated by co2 production and o2 consumption not shown and the rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation with pearson s correlation r values of 0 9915 and 0 9786 respectively the rates of co2 production are also correlated with the rates of alcohol production with pearson s correlation value r 0 9303 it is interesting to note that the first order rates of 1 4 d transformation are a factor of 1 6 times those of 1 1 1 tca for all three orthosilicates tested despite the rates differing by a factor of 18 between tbos and t2bos reactors the pearson correlation r value for the 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d rates achieved with the three different orthosilicates was 0 997 the similar factor difference in rates and the very high pearson s correlation indicate the same oxygenase enzyme is transforming the contaminant despite the growth on the different alcohol substrates within a treatment comparison of duplicate reactors indicate rates of cometabolism are also correlated with the rates of metabolism and likely biomass present when the rates of metabolism were higher for a duplicate when the rates of cometabolism for both 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d were also higher both the rates of metabolism and cometabolism being correlated indicate that higher biomass concentrations were maintained in the tbos reactor compared to the t2pos and t2bos reactors a photo of the tbos reactor at the start day 0 and end day 43 of the incubation is presented in fig s9 the dispersion of the tbos into colloidal liquid droplets is indicated on day 0 at a later time the orange color indicates the growth of atcc stain 21198 which when plated appears orange in color the cells clump and tend to grow around particles of tbos making measurements of biomass on a protein basis difficult fig s10 shows photographs of the reactors with growth on the different substrates for the t2bos and t2pos batch reactors a visual increase of atcc strain 21198 was difficult to see consistent with their lower metabolic activity a greater extent of growth was observed in the reactor containing tbos compared to the reactors containing t2pos and t2bos consistent with the higher rates of metabolism and cometabolism observed the zero order rates of oxygen utilization divided by the zero order rates of alcohol production can be used to estimate the molar ratios of o2 utilized to substrate consumed the ratios are 3 5 2 5 0 7 μmol o2 μmol alcohol for tbos t2bos and t2pos incubations respectively these ratios compared with 6 5 6 5 and 3 5 μmol o2 μmol alcohol for the complete oxidation of the respective alcohols to co2 and h2o the lower measured ratios based on o2 consumption and alcohol production compared to ratios required for complete oxidation to co2 and h2o are consistent with substrate utilization for the generation of cell biomass rittman and mccarty 2001 the results also indicate that biotic hydrolysis does not seem to be important since a more rapid rate of alcohol production would have increased the oxygen demand 4 discussion of results in this study activity based labeling abl was shown to be a useful and simple method for determining the level of monooxygenase activity in cells and one that potentially provides more information than whole cell activity measurements alone for example the labeling intensity for isobutane grown cells was much greater than cells grown on 2 butanol and this difference was clearly reflected in the substantial differences in specific rates of thf fig 2 and 1 4 d fig 3 degradation exhibited by these cell types the abl approach also allowed us to discriminate between cells that express 1 4 d degrading monooxygenases during growth e g 2 butanol grown cells as opposed to cells that express these enzymes after growth e g 1 butanol grown cells this difference was confirmed by demonstrating that cells grown on 2 butanol degrade 1 4 d without a lag phase fig 3c while cells grown on 1 butanol exhibit a lag phase for this activity fig 3b although further research is needed to determine why cells grown on 1 butanol exhibited this lag a delay of several hours is sufficient time for suitably stimulated cells to synthesize the monooxygenase enzymes required for subsequent observable 1 4 d degrading activity hyman and arp 1992 although several different factors could potentially promote this de novo protein synthesis an alcohol independent effect of 1 4 d itself is a particularly interesting possibility a growth substrate independent inducing effect on monooxygenase expression by methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe another ether pollutant has previously been observed with the well characterized gaseous alkane oxidizing bacterium mycobacterium vaccae job5 johnson et al 2004 a further potential application of our abl approach could be to characterize changes in monooxygenase expression when 1 butanol grown cells of r rhodochrous atcc 21198 are exposed to 1 4 d in the presence and absence of protein synthesis inhibitors as the abl method targets the active site containing component of monooxygenases bennett et al 2016 the labeling pattern observed in sds page analyses can also potentially identify which enzyme is expressed under different growth and incubation conditions for instance a labeled polypeptide of the same mass 60 kda was detected for cells grown on isobutane and 2 butanol the genome of r rhodochrous atcc 21198 encodes 2 soluble di iron monooxygenases shields menard et al 2014 and both of these gaseous alkane oxidizing enzymes have alpha hydroxylase components with masses of 60 kda heterologously expressed forms of one of these enzymes a group 6 sdimo referred to as a short chain alkane monooxygenase scam rolston et al 2019 can oxidize 1 4 d deng et al 2018 while this activity has not been confirmed for the other sdimo a group 5 propane monooxygenase prmo although the labeled polypeptides we observed in this study were not identified at the molecular level unequivocal identification of these proteins typically requires extensive and expensive mass spectral approaches the current abl procedure can therefore provide a simple and effective screening procedure where unequivocal enzyme identification is not an immediate priority the cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was observed during growth on 2 butanol with increases in rate correlated correlated with higher rates of metabolism and increases in optical density associated with increases in biomass this type of growth experiment provides a simple method of evaluating the potential of different alcohols produced by orthosilicates to promote cometabolism cometabolism was continuously observed in the batch tests with all the three of the orthosilicates tested indicating continuous monooxygenase expression all of the orthosilicates were of high purity 95 to 99 indicating it was the alcohol produced that was beneficial in supporting the cometabolic process the high purity was confirmed by gc ms analysis inhibition by the growth substrate on cometabolism was likely not occurring since monooxygenase activity is not needed for alcohol utilization as indicated by the continuous metabolic activity with all three orthosilicates that occurred in the presence of acetylene the differences in the rates of hydrolysis are consistent with previous observations of vancheeswaran et al 1999 who evaluated tbos that produces 1 butanol and tkebs that produces 2 ethylbutanol a branched alcohol abiotic hydrolysis rates for tkebs were an order of magnitude slower than for tbos indicating that branching has an impact on the orthosilicate hydrolysis rates results presented here therefore suggest the rate of hydrolysis for t2bos being a factor of 15 slower than tbos was due to the branching effect previously observed with tbos and tkebs which is qualitatively consistent with observations from arkles et al 1992 the substituent chain length is also important as t2bos that has an additional carbon atom hydrolyzed at a 7 fold slower rate than t2pos the structure of the orthosilicate and the leaving group therefore are important factors that can be used in design of in situ remediation systems for example if higher biomass and higher rate systems are needed tbos would be chosen while for lower biomass and slower rate systems branched with longer chain lengths like t2bos would be used another consideration is delivery of the o2 that is needed for this aerobic process o2 consumption is correlated with the rates of hydrolysis and alcohol release much higher rates of oxygen consumption were observed in tbos fed reactors compared to t2pos and t2bos thus there is a benefit of using a more slowly hydrolyzing orthosilicate the results presented here did not provide strong evidence for the biotic hydrolysis of the orthosilicates rates of alcohol production in the poisoned controls seemed to match the rates of metabolism estimated from o2 consumption and co2 production the zero order rates of co2 production also remained constant with time consistent with the constant zero order rates of alcohol production an acceleration in rate did not occur as might be expected if biotic hydrolysis was occurring and the biomass increased vancheeswaran et al 1999 suggested that biotic hydrolysis was likely in their studies with tbos since they observed the rates increasing as the biomass grew the hydrolysis rates were a factor of 4 to 5 higher in their live versus poisoned controls they however were using a mixed culture in their studies which may have contained microorganisms that possessed enzymes capable of hydrolyzing orthosilicates more research is needed to determine whether atcc strain 21198 has orthosilicate hydrolyzing capabilities and enzymes one benefit of using a pure culture system that does not promote biotic hydrolysis is having more control of the rate of hydrolysis via abiotic processes the results presented here agree with those presented by rasmussen et al 2020 where tbos and t2bos were co encapsulated in gellan gum along with atcc strain 21198 higher rates of hydrolysis metabolism and cometabolism were observed in the reactors containing gellan gum bead containing tbos compared to t2bos both studies were conducted with the same mass loading of orthosilicates to the batch reactors to permit comparison of the direct contact of the orthosilicate and atcc strain 21198 and their co encapsulation in the gellan gum hydrogel the abiotic rates of hydrolysis reported here were 8 to 15 times higher than observed with the encapsulated beads the higher rates of hydrolysis likely resulted from mass transfer issues into the gellan gum beads and the high surface areas created by the colloidal droplets in solution observed in this study the rates of oxygen consumption reported here were factors of 4 and 1 25 times higher for t2bos and tbos respectively compared to the estimates with the co encapsulated beads it is not known why greater differences were not observed one possibility is that there was also an o2 demand associated biodegradation of the gellan gum beads both studies showed consistent results related to the cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d more rapid cometabolic transformation was observed with tbos compared to t2bos and 1 4 d was more rapidly transformed than 1 1 1 tca comparing first order rates between the two studies shows much higher rates observed here compared to the co encapsulated systems consistent with the more rapid rates of hydrolysis in the study of rasmussen et al 2020 cis dce was also present as a co contaminant which may have affected the transformation rates of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d the present study was conducted in buffer growth media thus representing more optimal conditions compared to those that might be encountered in situ rasmussen et al 2020 presented results where the co encapsulated gellan gum beans containing tbos and atcc strain 21198 were incubated in microcosms containing groundwater and aquifer solids continuous cometabolic transformation of cis dce 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d was observed in the microcosms for over 220 days with rates slower but in the range of those in media similar studies are needed for the process reported here where the orthosilicates are directly added along with atcc strain 21198 to groundwater microcosms in these tests atcc strain 21198 would be in competition with indigenous microorganisms for the alcohols that are released but may not promote the cometabolic transformation when gaseous substrates are used isobutane in the case of atcc strain 21198 rolston et al 2019 a monooxygenase is required for substrate utilization and thus indigenous microorganisms that are stimulated will likely cometabolize the contaminants studied here with the gellan gum co encapsulation system the alcohols that are produced are consumed within the hydrogel by the microbial culture that is effective towards cometabolism of contaminants of interest rasmussen et al 2020 thus there is protection offered by the co encapsulation of the microorganism and the orthosilicate within the gel the methods presented here provide a means of investigating other microorganisms that have potential to cometabolize cocs when grown on orthosilicates that slowly release alcohols the method used of direct contact of the orthosilicates with planktonic cells provides a means for growing microorganisms slowly at low substrate concentrations which may be key to obtaining the long term continuous cometabolic transformation the methods provide for a simpler means of testing of slow release compounds that might be incorporated into co encapsulated hydrogel systems 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn for the results that were presented 1 secondary alcohols such as 2 butanol induce monooxygenase activity in atcc strain 21198 during growth whereas primary alcohols such as 1 butanol did not however cometabolism of 1 4 d was observed by 1 butanol grown cells after exposure to 1 4 d 2 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d transformation was achieved during direct growth of atcc strain 21198 on 2 butanol with the first order rates of 1 4 d being a factor of 2 5 times greater than 1 1 1 tca 3 alcohol releasing orthosilicates continually promoted the cometabolic transformation of 1 1 1 tca and 1 4 d by atcc strain 21198 for up to 125 days 4 the order of the rates of abiotic hydrolysis of alcohols from orthosilicates were as follows tbos t2pos t2bos the straight chained orthosilicate tbos was hydrolyzed more quickly than the branched chained t2bos the shorter branched chained t2pos were hydrolyzed more quickly than the longer chained t2bos 5 there are strong correlations between the rates of metabolism and cometabolism and the rates of alcohol production by the orthosilicates with pearson r values ranging from 0 9307 to 0 9971 the correlations likely result from the higher biomass of atcc strain 21198 being maintained by the more rapidly hydrolyzing orthosilicates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

1433,groundwater samples from 61 randomly selected tube wells in densely residential dr and sparse residential sr parts of aba nigeria were analysed to elucidate the influence of urban land use on the quality and characterize the hydrochemistry of the groundwater twelve water quality indicators temperature ph ec and tds physicochemical as well as hco3 cl so4 no3 na k ca and mg major ions were analysed for each well the results of the analyses were grouped based on the influence of land use on the wells the descriptive statistics piper chadha s and bivariate scattered plots as well as index of base ion exchange and friedman nonparametric statistical test were used to delineate and ascertain the significance of the urban impact on the quality of the groundwater wells the results showed that the groundwater ph is acidic 3 7 5 6 and the mineralization low with tds ranging between 6 5 mg l 365 mg l the statistical mean and standard deviation x s d of the remaining quality indicators were found within the limits set by who in all the wells the piper and chadha s plots revealed four dominant water types with spatial differentiation in the area though there are several mixed water types in the sr area the na hco3 water type is dominant and represents the background hydrochemistry of the groundwater in the area whereas mg ca cl water types predominates in the dr wells other dominant water types found between the sr and dr areas are na cl and ca hco3 types the rapid compositional change and local alteration in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater were impacted by some identified urban land use practices which introduce additional major ions in the groundwater solution the mixed water types found in the sr wells were influenced by factors such as the direction of flow and mixing of the groundwater reservoirs impacted by the hydrochemistry of the dr groundwater which were upstream to the sr wells the results of indicators such as ec tds cl and no3 when compared showed observable local deterioration moving from wells in the sr to wells in the dr area this was supported by the friedman statistical test which revealed statistical significance of some urban practices on the quality of the groundwater these results highlight the current quality status and harmonize the reports of previous studies which have characterized the hydrochemistry of the groundwater in the study area keywords hydrochemistry groundwater nonparametric statistics urban hydrology nigeria 1 introduction in many developing urban centres the groundwater represents an important and reliable source of fresh water for domestic use barrett et al 2002 ocheri et al 2014 the rising trends in urban population and economic activities in these areas are putting pressure on different aspects of the environment and negatively affect the sustainable use and management of the resources vaux 2011 such environmental resources under stress e g groundwater should be properly managed apart from natural factors such as complexities in the lithology the direction of flow of the groundwater the quality of the recharging water etc anthropogenic activities through urban land practices pose a major threat to the groundwater these activities principally affect the quality and quantity of urban hydrology the recharge system in these developing urban areas is complicated because in some instance new recharge sources are introduced wakode 2016 while in other situation the permeability of the land cover is reduced leading to increased urban storm runoff in the area howard 2002 mallin 2009 the increased storm runoff situation in these developing urban areas is a diffused source of contamination this is because the runoff gathers surface contaminations from poor environmental land use management practices and deposit them in recharging ponds this is one of the ways by which the quality of the groundwater is degraded and the hydrochemistry impacted in the context of nigeria and many developing countries poor urban land use implementation is posing serious challenge to different aspects of the environment especially sources of water supply such urban land use practices include inappropriate disposal of municipal solid and industrial wastes by burying them underground the use of leaky septic tanks and on site sanitary facilities direct effluent discharge into the groundwater and other urban land stressors have been identified egboka et al 1989 ocheri et al 2014 ukpong et al 2015 ijioma 2020 some of these practices are alternative recharge system and have the potential to contaminate the groundwater in many developing urban areas therefore when assessing the quality of urban groundwater it is important to delineate the influence of anthropogenic pressure on the groundwater and as such unmask the effect of urban land use for the sustainable management of groundwater the use of stable isotope tracers has been explored in some studies and reviews to investigate the sources of anthropogenic contaminants in both developed and developing parts of the world lu et al 2015 harker et al 2015 nisi et al 2016 other studies which have characterized the groundwater facies in developing urban areas reported that the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is sometimes complex or dynamic for instance the characterization of the groundwater in tema metropolitan upper accra district of ghana revealed that the predominant groundwater facies are the na cl and ca mg so4 types fianko et al 2010 again seven water types ca hco3 ca cl mg hco3 na so4 mg cl na hco3 and na cl were reported in lagos the most populated urban area in nigeria despite the simple alluvium and coastal plain sands geological formations in lagos the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater were variable the outcome of the study highlights the impact of urban land use on the quality and complexity of the hydrochemistry of the groundwater akoteyon 2013 akoteyon et al 2018 this study addressed the quality and hydrochemical characterization of the groundwater the major source of water in aba nigeria some results of previous studies which have evaluated the hydrochemistry of the groundwater were inconclusive because the dominant types reported did not corroborate but revealed mixed water types in area amadi et al 2009 and agharanya and dim 2018 found in their characterization of the groundwater that the calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 type was predominant with other mixed water types in the area alichi et al 2010 in their review of the groundwater hydrochemistry in some parts of the area reported the sodium chloride na cl type as the dominant groundwater facies in the area however none of these studies has comprehensibly covered the entire study area hence the discrepancies observed in the outcome of the hydrochemical evaluations the geology soil type and terrain analyses are uniform throughout the area and will have minimum effect introducing sudden changes in the quality and hydrochemistry of the groundwater therefore it was hypothesized that urban land use practices might be responsible for the changes in the quality and hydrochemistry of the groundwater just like in the context of many developing urban areas where poor land management has been reported the study aimed to set a baseline for the status of the groundwater quality and characterize its hydrochemistry while unmasking the effect of urban land practices the specific objectives will a elucidate general trends in the physicochemical and major ion chemistry of the groundwater and b harmonize the hydrochemical results of some previous studies that have characterized the groundwater facies in the area the understanding of the evolutionary trends in the chemistry of the groundwater is important to ensure the sustainable use and management of the resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in aba and its environs the main economic nerve centre of abia state nigeria fig 1 it serves the commercial needs of important cities in the south eastern and south southern geo political regions of nigeria over one million people are estimated to be living in the 236 square km area according to the 2006 national population census in nigeria npc 2016 the vegetation and climate conditions are humid equatorial rainforest with annual mean rainfall ranging from 2150 to 2460 mm and mean daily temperatures ranging between 22 c and 33 c for the average minimum and maximum daily temperatures meteorological data were obtained from the national root crop research institute nrcri umudike and analysed over a 30 year 1986 2016 the geology is constituted by the sedimentary coastal plain sand of the benin formation with some localized clay lenses in some parts of the basin smedley 2003 the soil texture classification in the area is sandy loam adamu et al 2019 which consist of mostly ferralsol according to the fao soil map of nigeria classification esdac 1990 the petrographic characterization of the soil revealed that the sandy dominated soil type contains 95 96 quartz and 1 2 na k mica onyeagocha 1980 the lithology comprised of the medium grained sandy clay up to first 10 m and thereafter medium to coarse and very fine pebble that make up the vadose and the saturated zone up to first the 100 m ijioma 2020 the aquifer type is mostly unconfined and the water table elevation range 26 m 33 m below ground level with an average elevation depth of 28 6 m agharanya and dim 2018 ijioma 2020 the water table elevation implies that the wells are deep and the groundwater is usually abstracted from tube wells with submersible motor pumps the slope and terrain analyses of the dem revealed that the area is predominantly flat with poor drainage networks however some parts of the catchment area are drained by the aba river which forms part of the imo river tributary amadi et al 2012 and other recharging ponds as shown in the land use map fig 1c the land use characterization map for 2017 revealed four land use classes in the area the analysis of the land use classes between 1986 and 2017 showed that the built up area was made up of 36 7 of the area and it is rapidly expanding at an average annual rate of 1 3 km2 annum ijioma 2020 the growing population is putting pressure on the poorly implemented urban land use in the area refuse dumpsites are sporadically sited and are used as municipal waste disposal facility these sites can be spotted in fig 1d public water supply system is dysfunctional and the central sewage system is non existent to manage residential and industrial effluents the dysfunctional state of the public water supply system has led to the proliferation of private pumps which provide groundwater for domestic commercial and industrial purposes in the absence of the central sewerage use of cesspools septic systems direct discharge of effluents into the aquifer system have been observed in the area ijioma 2020 these current practices have the potential to harm the quality of the groundwater in the area 2 2 groundwater sampling procedures the groundwater sampling periods took place between the two main climate seasons in southern nigeria the rainy season campaign between july august 2018 and dry season campaign between february march 2019 the samples were collected from 61 randomly selected tube wells found in both the densely dr and sparse sr residential parts to cover the entire area the criteria for the tube wells selection were subject to the wells accessibility and the ability to take sample directly from the submersible motor pumps in the tube wells these wells supply groundwater to residential commercial and industrial facilities the wells were purged only for 2 3 min since the wells were always in use and to allow water in the column to be removed before samples were taken the spatial distribution of the tube wells overlaid on 2017 land use map of the area fig 1c which highlights the urban influence on the wells the groundwater samples were directly taken as it is pumped from the submersible motor pump physicochemical indicators including temperature ph and electrical conductivity were measured in situ using the wtw multi 1970i portable ph oxygen and conductivity measuring instrument manufacturer wtw weilheim germany samples for the cation s analyses were prepared by filtering them through a 0 45 μm filter disc into a 100 ml pet bottle and preserved with 10 nho3 to ph 2 for the analyses of the anions the samples were filtered and transferred to a 250 ml pe bottle without acidification all the samples obtained from the wells were stored in a cooling box under 6 c and transported to the laboratory for analysis immediately 2 3 groundwater quality evaluation twelve water quality indicators i e physicochemical and major ions in the groundwater were selected and analysed based on the standard operating procedures as summarized in table 1 the results of the samples were grouped into two classes based on the prevailing land use around the tube wells as illustrated in fig 1 c the spatial trends in the results of the analysis were graphically evaluated using some statistical tools such as descriptive statistics trend charts and friedman nonparametric ranking test and hydrochemical as well as geochemical methods piper plot chadha s plot bivariate cross plotting and index of ion exchange to visualize characterize and delineate the impact of urban land practices on the quality of the groundwater 2 4 hydrochemical methods the hydrochemical methods are used to describe the chemical behaviours of the groundwater system the methods mostly use major ions present in the water solution to describe visually the evolutionary trends and the mechanisms that influence the chemistry of the groundwater the following hydrochemical and geochemical methods were employed in this study piper diagram piper 1944 chadha plot chadha 1999 bivariate cross scattered plots ion exchange process according to the chloro alkaline indices of schoeller 1965 the piper diagram is one of the most frequently used hydrochemical models for evaluating the hydrochemical behaviour of the groundwater using a trilinear triangular as described in piper 1944 the method offers flexibility such that several samples can be investigated on a plot again the water types classification and the mixing propensity of waters in the plot is easy to visualize through this method leis 2018 however the demerits of the diagram are that it requires a special program to plot the chart and that the actual concentrations of the predetermined reacting ions are normalized before being implemented in the chart this makes it difficult to account for other ions in cases where other ions are significant chadha 1999 proposed a less complicated hydrochemical scattered chart which is comparable to the piper diagram this chart is effective in interpreting the association of the major ions in the groundwater it identified 8 quadrants positions and suggested four main geochemical fields in the chart the quadrants are likened to the triangular segments in the piper s diamond shape which represent the different hydrochemical facies in the groundwater the use of bivariate cross scattered plots demonstrates the relationship between the major ionic species in the groundwater the use of stoichiometry of the dissolved ions is used to determine the type of dissolved minerals and the sources from where they originate in the groundwater the combination of cross plots was proposed to establish which minerals furnished the major ions and the geochemical processes that define the groundwater chemistry the ion exchange process controls the background concentration of the major ions in the groundwater the chloro alkaline index cai also known as the index of base ion was first introduced by schoeller 1965 to explain the ion exchange process taking place in the groundwater the index describes the direction of movement of base cations between the groundwater and its host environment and it is controlled through the ion exchange process this involves the movement of the alkali metal ion group na k or the alkaline earth metal group ca mg between the rock and the groundwater hwang et al 2017 schoeller 1965 proposed the chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 respectively to demonstrate the direction of movement of the base ions as expressed in eqs 1 and 2 1 cai 1 cl na k cl 2 cai 2 cl na k hco 3 so 4 no 3 each of the chemical symbols in eqs 1 and 2 represents the reacting concentration of the ions in meq l when the sign in the score of the index is positive it means that the na k ions in the groundwater displace ca mg ions in the aquifer materials the reverse process occurs when na k in the aquifer medium displaces ca mg in the groundwater solution the direction of movement of the alkali ions changes the signs before the index 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of groundwater quality in the sr and dr area the results of the twelve physicochemical and major ion quality indicators for the 33 tube wells in sr and 28 tube wells obtained from the dr area were grouped and analysed table 2 the quality checks on the results of the major ion chemistry were determined by the charge balance error cbe test for all the wells the range of the cbe lies within 10 x 15 however these values are higher than the 5 10 recommended the reason for the high cbe is because the analyses of some major ions were performed in a commercial laboratory some of these laboratories do not perform customized calibrations specific for some of the selected ions and this might be responsible for the high cbe recorded in this study a cbe range of 15 can be accepted as recommended by andersen 2015 the important descriptive statistics table 2 summarized some of the results of the quality indicators and compared them against the maximum acceptable concentrations mac for drinking water quality set by the who 2011 the results can be visualized with the bar graph fig 2 comparing wells between the sr and dr areas respectively the analysis of the z factors in the sr and dr wells shows that the distribution in some indicators failed the normality test obtained from the skewness factor of the indicators for each well for sample size n 50 normality lies between 1 96 x 1 96 while x z factor apart from the results of the groundwater ph and temperature the mean values of the remaining indicators were by far below the mac values set by the who in the sr and dr wells but when compared the mean results of wells in the dr area were much higher than the ones in the sr wells fig 2 detailed analyses of each indicator are discussed for the grouped wells to elucidate the urban influence on the quality indicators 3 1 1 temperature some studies have reported that warmer temperatures in groundwater as a pollutant massmann et al 2008 saito et al 2016 groundwater temperature is an essential driver for quality assessment because its change influences some indicators that control the chemistry of the water menberg et al 2014 this parameter depends on the prevalent ambient air temperature and the temperature gradient of the area the average temperature in the sr and dr wells is the wells in the sr areas this result agrees with other studies which have found that groundwater temperatures are higher in densely built up areas relative to green areas gross 1991 berlin de 2011 the result shows that there is faster physical deterioration in the quality of the groundwater as the temperature slightly increases based on the mean values moving from the sr to the dr wells 3 1 2 ph the ph values of all the wells were acidic and did not conform to the recommended who maximum acceptable limits for drinking water 6 5 8 5 in both the sr and dr wells who 2011 the ph range lies 4 5 and 5 6 in the sr while in the dr wells it ranges between 3 7 and 4 9 however the modal ph of the groundwater is 4 8 in both areas based on this study the acidity of the groundwater reported in this study supports the findings of previous studies conducted in the area as well as the regional ph of the groundwater within the basin amadi et al 2009 alichi et al 2010 agharanya and dim 2018 the acidic ph values are typical of a humid environment where the base cations have been washed away from the host rock of the groundwater knutsson 1994 de ridder 1994 a scattered plot illustration correlating the impact of the ph and total cations present in the groundwater samples on the sr and dr wells is shown in fig 3 the illustration revealed that there is an inverse relationship between the groundwater ph and total concentrations of the major cations tc in the water solution the results revealed higher concentrations of tc in the dr wells at lower ph compared to the wells in the sr area this means that wells with higher dissolved cations concentrations have values the r2 values in the trend lines suggest that the more acidic groundwater i e low ph in the dr wells is responsible for the more dissolved cations compared to most wells in the sr area this trend in the wells of the dr area corroborates with the findings of o driscoll et al 2010 the more acidic groundwater reservoir in the dr wells suggests the presence of organic contaminations from anthropogenic sources in the groundwater which degrade to acidic carboxylic or phenolic anions hem 1985 the use of septic tanks and soak away pits bio waste treatment in the dr area and most parts of the congested commercial areas contribute to the high amounts of dissolved organic and inorganic substances in the groundwater in contrast the sr wells have slightly higher acidic groundwater ph with an average greater than 4 5 the sr wells are relatively less mineralized compared to the wells in the dr areas in general drinking water with acidic ph has no direct health implications however groundwater with acidic ph can dissolve more substances including trace metals in the surrounding thereby increasing the concentration of such ions in the water solution the presence of these metal ions can affect the taste appearance toxicity and general acceptability of the groundwater for drinking purpose 3 1 3 electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds the electrical conductivity ec simply describes how easily electric current is transferred through the ionic species in the groundwater the ec values for all the tube well samples were corrected to the corresponding specific electrical conductivity at 25 c these ec can be directly correlated to the dissolved inorganic ions in the groundwater and it is used as a proxy indicator for monitoring the quality of groundwater wells this is common in areas where the groundwater has a high possibility of saline intrusion the ec and total dissolved solids tds are interconvertible and can be related by the expression in eq 3 van der aa 2003 rusydi 2018 3 tds mg l ec 25 μs cm a where ec25 the specific electrical conductivity of the sample at 25 c a the ratio of tds to ec25 a range between 0 55 and 0 75 for freshwater but this study a 0 65 was adapted from rusydi 2018 where he found this value for freshwater based on eq 3 tds was calculated from measured ec25 the tds is used as a measure of the freshness of different natural water sources todd 1980 this indicator has been associated with the taste and acceptability of drinking water in different sources again the presence of dissolved inorganic and or organic substances in the groundwater impact taste on it who 2003a 2003b table 3 summarizes the rating of tds concentrations based on the taste it gives to drinking water according to the who guidelines for drinking water quality in table 2 the ratio of the mean results of ec and tds between the dr and sr wells is about nine times apart when compared this observation suggests the contribution of some urban land use practice on the quality of groundwater between these two parts in the area the lowest tds mineralization in the groundwater tds 6 5 mg l was found in a well very close to the stream head around aba river and represents the lowest background tds in the area with the least impact of human activities taking place the highest tds 364 mg l was recorded in a well at one of the densest residential parts around an informal settlement area the tube well was very closely sited to a cesspool in a highly congested dr part of the area based on the who s tds ratings for drinking water quality the results of most groundwater wells in the area fall within the excellent category though many of the dr wells have higher tds concentrations relative to the well in the sr area the tds values still lie between excellent to good ratings in general the low mineralization in the groundwater stem from the parent geological makeup in the area which is predominantly quartz with a very small portion of clay minerals onyeagocha 1980 lekwa and whiteside 1986 this sedimentary mineral yield trace ions in the groundwater via chemical weathering 3 2 major ion chemistry and characterization of groundwater the hydrochemical assessment specifically deals with the evaluation of the major ions na k ca mg so4 cl and hco3 present in the groundwater these ions determine the chemistry of the groundwater and the evaluation most often employ hydrochemical methods for the classification of the water types and main geochemical processes taking place in the groundwater the results of the major ions presented in table 2 were used to characterize the groundwater facies in the wells of the dr and sr areas using some selected hydrochemical and geochemical methods to draw the influence of land use on the chemistry of the groundwater 3 2 1 dominance array of the major ions in the sr and dr wells the concentrations of the major ions in milliequivalent weights are represented in the boxplots for wells in the sr and dr areas respectively figs 9a and b these illustrations present a quick overview of the dominance array based on the median values of the major cations and anions in the sr and dr areas in fig 4 a the dominance array of the cations can be ordered as na ca k mg and for the anions as hco3 cl so4 in the sr wells while in the dr wells the dominance array of the cations follows ca na mg k and the anions as cl hco3 so4 fig 4b it is worthy of mention that the sulphate concentrations in the groundwater are infinitesimal compared to the rest of the major anions in both the sr and dr wells this statistical approach gives a quick hierarchical overview of the dominant ionic species in the groundwater solution the dominance ions array in this case consider the position of the median equivalent weight concentration of the ions in the boxplot distribution the normalized milliequivalent weights of the grouped major ions in the sr and dr wells are distributed in a box plot fig 5 the implication of the results suggests that the grouped major cations and anions with the highest median value may represent the dominant hydrochemical facies in the groundwater solution such normalization approach forms the basis of the popular hydrochemical methods such as the chadha s plot and the piper s trilinear plot the results of the boxplot array revealed that the dominant water type in sr wells were biased towards na k hco3 type while the dominant water type in the dr wells is towards the ca mg cl type and ignoring the influence of so4 the pearson coefficient of variation cv test for the relationship between the normalized grouped major cations and anions in the dr wells revealed that the r2 0 26 and p 0 05 between the alkaline earth metal ions ca mg and the strong acid anions cl so4 this result means that there is no statistical significance between these grouped ions in other words this suggests that it is less probable that the source of these grouped major ions is geochemically related however the pearson correlation coefficient between the grouped alkali metal na k and the weak acidic bicarbonate ions hco3 is cv 0 5 and p 0 05 for wells in the sr areas this result shows a moderate linear relationship between the grouped cations and anions the association of the grouped in the groundwater is statistically significant and gives a pointer that these grouped ions might have originated from a common source 3 2 2 piper diagram the piper trilinear diagram was constructed from the per cent normalized concentrations of the major ions cations and anions in milliequivalent l per cent meq l figs 6 a and b represent the piper plots of all sr and dr wells respectively in the area each point in the trilinear triangle of the piper represents the constituent cations and anions in the individual tube wells and when projected onto the diamond shape of the piper diagrams defines the groundwater facies of the tube well the results of the groundwater facies in the area suggest that a reasonable number of the sr wells are found in the mixing zone represented by the green dots triangle 3 the mixing propensity implies a dynamic environment because of the groundwater flow and other interaction arising from urban land use activities in most parts of the sr area however the dominant water types in the sr wells are mostly na hco3 type represented by the green dots in triangle 6 ca hco3 represented by the green dots in triangle 1 and a few na cl type wells found in 2 found in fig 6c some of the mixed water types in the sr wells are detailed in appendix table a 3 fig 6 b illustrates the hydrochemical facies of the groundwater wells in the dr area the predominant water types in the dr area are the ca mg cl water type represented by the red dots in the triangle 5 ca hco3 type represented by the red dots in the triangle 1 and the na cl type represented by the red the wells in the 2 in the projected diamond shape of fig 4c all the water types in the dr wells are shown in appendix table a 4 3 2 3 chadha s plots the results of the more simplified chadha s plot also supported the hydrochemical outcomes of the piper s illustration for the groundwater wells in the sr and dr area fig 7 besides the hydrochemical facies in the piper diagram the chadha s plot predicts the main geochemical processes that control the chemistry of the groundwater the dominant facies are represented by the eight hydrochemical quadrants of the chart the result of the hydrochemical facies of the sr wells were found in quadrants 8 5 7 respectively this array showed that the dominant groundwater facies in the sr wells is the na hco3 type with 79 of the wells occurring in quadrant 8 making it the background water type in the area the na hco3 water type is usually found in deep wells where there is a stable equilibrium between the groundwater and the rock chae et al 2005 in such groundwater the ion exchange process regulates the displacement of ions between the groundwater and the host mineral other dominant water types found in the sr area include the ca hco3 and nacl just like in the piper the presence of the mixed water types is not usually clear in the chadha s plot the order of preponderance in the dr wells occur in 6 7 5 respectively in the dr area 67 of the wells are constituted of mg ca cl groundwater facies and this type is the most dominant water type in the dr area this category of water type is controlled by the reverse ion exchange process as the main geochemical process according to chadha 1999 this water type is generally associated with permanent hardness in the groundwater the remaining wells in the dr areas were found quadrants 5 and 7 which represent the ca hco3 and na cl water types respectively the compositional change in the dominant water types found between the dr and sr wells can be traced to the influence of anthropic activities on the groundwater especially in the dr area this is because the geology in the area is assumed uniform and geogenic processes are slow and take a long period to equilibrate thereby effecting any significant changes in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater therefore the rapid population growth industrial and economic activities in the area might be responsible for the additional major introduction in the groundwater reservoir of the dr areas the population pressure construction activities the use of the septic system for draining of household effluents within the dr areas contributing to the increase in some of the major ions found in the groundwater 3 2 4 bivariate cross plotting different bivariate cross plots have been presented to demonstrate important geochemical processes using the expected reacting ions taking place in the groundwater to describe the chemistry in the sr and dr wells to predict some of the major hydrogeochemical processes in the groundwater the concentrations of the reacting ions were expressed either in milliequivalent weights or molar concentrations see the scattered plots figs 8a d the lines in the cross plots describe the stoichiometry of the reacting units while the green and red dots represent the wells in the sr and dr areas respectively the weathering of the parent materials contributes to the major ions builds up in the groundwater berkowitz et al 2014 to determine the dominance between competing geochemical process of silicate vs carbonate weathering in the groundwater wells the usual cross plot of ca mg vs hco3 so4 was performed adopted from kumar et al 2009 fig 8a the results showed that the interaction between the reacting ions for all the wells in the sr area was below the equiline 1 1 the equiline represents the 1 1 line in the scatter plot whereas most of the wells in the dr wells were found lying above the 1 1 line the implication of this result confirms that silicate weathering is the natural source of the reacting ions when the wells lie under the 1 1 line this is true for all the wells in the sr and silicate weathering is suggested to be the background geochemical process in the groundwater of the study area this result makes sense because of the low mineralization recorded in the tds of the groundwater the quartz mineral is the predominant mineral in the soil type found in the area with trace amounts of kaolinite clay characterized in the area the quartz mineral is less reactive and constituted mainly 95 sio4 in the tectosilicate arrangement with trace impurities such as na k ca mg fe and h oh the traces are the more reactive part of the mineral and influence the chemistry of groundwater berkowitz et al 2014 the observed high concentrations of the reacting ca mg ions scattered in most of dr wells plot suggest that the ions do not come from the same geogenic sources with the hco3 so4 the illustrations in fig 8 b and c explained the correlation between the alkaline earth ions ca mg and the alkali ions na k against the total cations tc in the groundwater for the sr and dr wells respectively for the sr wells in fig 8 b the relationship between the ca mg ions and the tc revealed a weak association based on the 1 1 and 1 2 lines respectively however the relationship between ca mg and tc for wells in dr areas revealed that most of the wells aligned along the 1 2 line this stoichiometric arrangement in the dr wells suggests a possible reverse base ion exchange taking place between the na k in the groundwater and ca mg from the surrounding or increase in the concentration of ca mg ions washed into the groundwater from the surface a strong correlation was found in the sr wells fig 8c between the na k ions and tc as most of the wells aligned on the 1 1 equiline this strong correlation suggests that the na k ions come from a geogenic source and originate from the weathering of the parent materials most of the dr wells lie along the 1 2 line in the na k vs tc plots suggesting reverse ion exchange the illustration in fig 8 d was used to test the direction of movement of the base cations using the ca mg vs na k plots between the groundwater and the host environment for wells in the sr and dr areas while most of the dr wells are found around and above the 1 1 and 2 1 line this is not the same for the wells in the sr areas most of the wells in the sr area were found below the 1 1 and 1 2 lines suggesting the presence of more reacting ca mg ions from the surrounding than the na k ions in the groundwater 3 2 5 ion exchange process to further understand the origin concentration and mixing of the reacting major base ions in the groundwater reservoirs the concept of the chloro alkali index was further explored with some of the results of the major ions in the sr and dr wells the signs in the index score suggest the direction of movement of the base i e alkali metals or alkaline earth metal ions between the groundwater and the aquifer materials the results of the implemented chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 are summarized in the scattered plot fig 9 a and b for the wells sr and dr areas respectively these plots revealed that the scores of the indices for cai 1 and cai 2 have different magnitudes but the direction of the signs tells whether the process favours ion exchange or reverse ion exchange in the sr and dr wells in both cases the signs of the index suggest whether the process leads to ion exchange for an index with a negative sign or reversed ion exchange process for an index with a positive sign in the groundwater in fig 9 a the dr wells represented in the red dots have positive cai 1 indices the green dots referred to the sr wells showing a combination of positive and negative indices in the scattered chart 83 of all the wells both from the dr and sr areas have positive indices the results of the cai 2 fig 9b follow a similar trend like the results of cai 1 for the corresponding wells in fig 9 a however from the indices in the cai 2 it was found that only a few wells in the sr area have negative indices and favour ion exchange process in the groundwater when the index is negative then there are more na k ions in the groundwater solution than the chloride ion these wells were deeper and found in areas with a minimum urban influence the results of the bivariate cross plotting revealed that the chloride ions in the groundwater might not be from geogenic sources since the silicate weathering process is the dominant geochemical process in the sr wells in general most of the wells in the area have a positive chloro alkali index which means that the chloride cl concentration is higher than the concentration of alkali metal na k ions in the groundwater solution this situation was found common for all the dr wells in which a lot of major ions were furnished from surface contamination leached into the groundwater the reverse ion exchange process was also found in the sr wells more so the ions exchange is a reversible one therefore wells with the positive cai 1 index can undergo the reverse ion exchange and vice versa zaidi et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that the movement of the base ion in both directions can serve as a temporary ph buffering mechanism in the groundwater system toumi et al 2015 hence the concept of the base ion exchange process has been reported as the predominant geochemical process responsible for the mixing of the groundwater facies hamutoko et al 2017 the mechanism of the reaction of the base ion exchange is demonstrated in eq 4 4 ½ ca 2 a s na aq alkalinisation ½ ca 2 aq ½ na 2 a s earth metal alkalinisation where a adsorbing exchange medium which could be a clay mineral eq 4 is a reversible chemical process leading to either alkalinisation process i e mobilizing na or k ions in the groundwater for the backward reaction or the earth metal alkalinisation process i e mobilizing the ca or mg ions in the groundwater for the forward reaction this equation was modified from hölting and coldewey 2019 to illustrate the base ion exchange taking place between the groundwater and the host surrounding another factor influencing changes in the index of base ion exchange and the hydrochemistry of groundwater is the direction of flow of the groundwater in the reservoirs hwang et al 2017 this factor explains the mixing propensity of the groundwater reservoirs wallick and toth 1976 especially in most of the sr wells the positive and negative cai indices observed in the sr wells support the impact of the mixing of groundwater reservoirs this is influenced by the direction of flow of the groundwater from the more mineralized dr area downstream to some less mineralized sr wells causing the groundwater reservoirs to mix 3 3 anthropogenic sources of major ions in the groundwater the compositional changes observed in the hydrochemistry groundwater between the sr and dr wells has been traced to the direct consequence of rapid urban practices in the area these activities are beginning to influence both the quality and hydrochemistry of the groundwater in most of the densely residential dr area several poor land management practices have been observed the growing population means that the municipal authorities have a daunting task in managing wastes solid and effluents generated in the area most parts of the residential and industrial effluents are managed with cesspools on site sanitary and septic systems and these facilities form part of the groundwater recharge sources in the area some of the effluents drained through this system contain household cleaning products beverages black water etc and these forms some of the anthropogenic sources of chlorides in the groundwater mullaney et al 2009 refuse dumpsites are also found in different parts of the dr area and they contain food waste rubber and paper products mullaney et al 2009 these waste materials have high chlorides content and have been reported in dumpsite leachate who 2003b some of these sources also introduce anthropogenic na and k cations in the groundwater again intensive construction works to provide roads and real estate infrastructures for the growing population have been reported this was revealed in the urban sprawl development analysis between 1987 and 2017 in the area ijioma 2020 the construction activities use materials e g clay minerals which are rich sources of ca and mg ions commonly used in construction materials such as laterite cement gypsum etc kuriata potasznik and szymczyk 2015reported that the increased concentrations of ca and mg ions in natural water bodies come from storm runoff 3 4 influence of urban land use on the quality of groundwater the impact of urban land use on the groundwater quality was qualitatively and visually evaluated following the different in the trend line of some urban signature indicators such as ph tds chloride and nitrates in the groundwater between the well groups i e sr and dr wells fig 10 shows a semi log plot for the indicators drawn from the average results of the selected indicators and compared against the recommended mac for drinking water quality set by the who the results reveal that the selected signatures have higher concentrations in the dr wells compared to the wells in the sr area this explains the implications of some urban land use practices which adverse quality consequences on the groundwater wells in the dr area the extent of deterioration is represented by the shaded portion between the plots of the sr and dr wells in the illustration for instance the presence of nitrate in groundwater is a common anthropogenic signature mostly associated with agricultural land use however many developing urban areas without a central sewer system the build up of nitrate concentration in groundwater the nitrate sources come mainly from of use on site sanitary facilities and septic drains lapworth et al 2017 in the sr area the mean nitrate concentrations in the wells were basically under 1 mg l however an outlying concentration as much as 14 mg l was recorded in one of the wells in the dr area in both cases the mean concentration levels were well below 50 mg l for nitrate in drinking water the wide margin of nitrate concentrations between the sr and dr wells is an indication of the influence of urban land use in the groundwater from surface derived sources these results corroborate the report in misstear et al 2006 that rapid changes in the nitrate concentrations of natural water come from surface contamination 3 5 statistical significance of the impact of urban land use on the quality and hydrochemistry of the groundwater the line plots comparing the tube wells between the sr and dr areas used the means results of some selected urban stressors fig 10 following the implication of the illustration it is necessary to test the statistical significance of the null hypothesis that urban land use practices do not influence the quality of groundwater since the result of distribution for some quality indicators did not pass the normality test the friedman nonparametric ranking test was used to test the hypothesis by comparing the results of the twelve quality indicators for the tube wells between the sr and dr areas the friedman statistical test was performed and the results summarized in table 4 to reject the null hypothesis ho then f r ꭓ a k 1 2or the p value p χ2 fr based on this premise there is a chance that some urban land use has a significant influence on the quality of the groundwater since p 0 05 i e reject ho if p 0 05 then the alternative hypothesis is accepted as the test evaluates the spatial changes in the quality indicators between the sr and dr area but the results did not reveal which of the indicators have the most influence on the quality of the groundwater the statistical significance of this test corroborates with the impact of the reported poor land use activities already described as the use of on site such in many developing countries which form alternative recharge system for the urban groundwater and affect the quality wakode 2016 4 conclusion this study evaluated some physicochemical and major ion chemistry from samples of groundwater tube wells obtained within aba and its environs southeast nigeria the results of the analyses showed that the groundwater ph is generally acidic and the mineralization in the groundwater is low based on the tds results of the wells however when the mean results of the quality indicators were compared between the wells in sr and dr areas they showed that the quality of the groundwater is deteriorating the hydrochemical and geochemical evaluation revealed the extent of the spatial variation in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater between the wells in the dr and sr areas overall the na hco3 type is the predominant water type in most sr wells areas and it is assumed to be the baseline groundwater facies in the study area the ca hco3 and the mixed water types in the remaining sr wells are a direct influence of urban land use practices and other hydrogeological factors influencing the wells more so the mg ca cl na cl and ca hco3 types are prevalent in the wells of dr area the hydrolysis of products of the dominant water types also supports why the general ph of the groundwater is acidic and more acidic in the dr area the compositional changes and differentiation in the water types between wells in the sr and dr areas can be attributed to the impact of some identified urban land use activities over the years the impact of these practices has yielded additional major ions in the groundwater reservoir of the dr area which has effected changes in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater besides the direction of flow of the groundwater enhances the mixing propensity of the groundwater in the reservoirs and helps to distribute the major ions between the wells in the dr area and sr wells downstream in the direction of flow these results of the hydrochemical facies in this study have harmonized some of the differences in the reports of previous research which have characterized the groundwater in the area these spatial evolutionary trends in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater reflect some of the water types already reported in the study area further the statistical significance in change between the quality of the groundwater in the sr and dr areas was tested with the friedman nonparametric test and result suggested the probability that urban land practices might have influenced the changes in the groundwater quality looking forward to future research it is important to carry out detailed investigation tracing the sources of the major contaminant ions using stable isotope tracers for sustainable management of the groundwater resource

1433,groundwater samples from 61 randomly selected tube wells in densely residential dr and sparse residential sr parts of aba nigeria were analysed to elucidate the influence of urban land use on the quality and characterize the hydrochemistry of the groundwater twelve water quality indicators temperature ph ec and tds physicochemical as well as hco3 cl so4 no3 na k ca and mg major ions were analysed for each well the results of the analyses were grouped based on the influence of land use on the wells the descriptive statistics piper chadha s and bivariate scattered plots as well as index of base ion exchange and friedman nonparametric statistical test were used to delineate and ascertain the significance of the urban impact on the quality of the groundwater wells the results showed that the groundwater ph is acidic 3 7 5 6 and the mineralization low with tds ranging between 6 5 mg l 365 mg l the statistical mean and standard deviation x s d of the remaining quality indicators were found within the limits set by who in all the wells the piper and chadha s plots revealed four dominant water types with spatial differentiation in the area though there are several mixed water types in the sr area the na hco3 water type is dominant and represents the background hydrochemistry of the groundwater in the area whereas mg ca cl water types predominates in the dr wells other dominant water types found between the sr and dr areas are na cl and ca hco3 types the rapid compositional change and local alteration in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater were impacted by some identified urban land use practices which introduce additional major ions in the groundwater solution the mixed water types found in the sr wells were influenced by factors such as the direction of flow and mixing of the groundwater reservoirs impacted by the hydrochemistry of the dr groundwater which were upstream to the sr wells the results of indicators such as ec tds cl and no3 when compared showed observable local deterioration moving from wells in the sr to wells in the dr area this was supported by the friedman statistical test which revealed statistical significance of some urban practices on the quality of the groundwater these results highlight the current quality status and harmonize the reports of previous studies which have characterized the hydrochemistry of the groundwater in the study area keywords hydrochemistry groundwater nonparametric statistics urban hydrology nigeria 1 introduction in many developing urban centres the groundwater represents an important and reliable source of fresh water for domestic use barrett et al 2002 ocheri et al 2014 the rising trends in urban population and economic activities in these areas are putting pressure on different aspects of the environment and negatively affect the sustainable use and management of the resources vaux 2011 such environmental resources under stress e g groundwater should be properly managed apart from natural factors such as complexities in the lithology the direction of flow of the groundwater the quality of the recharging water etc anthropogenic activities through urban land practices pose a major threat to the groundwater these activities principally affect the quality and quantity of urban hydrology the recharge system in these developing urban areas is complicated because in some instance new recharge sources are introduced wakode 2016 while in other situation the permeability of the land cover is reduced leading to increased urban storm runoff in the area howard 2002 mallin 2009 the increased storm runoff situation in these developing urban areas is a diffused source of contamination this is because the runoff gathers surface contaminations from poor environmental land use management practices and deposit them in recharging ponds this is one of the ways by which the quality of the groundwater is degraded and the hydrochemistry impacted in the context of nigeria and many developing countries poor urban land use implementation is posing serious challenge to different aspects of the environment especially sources of water supply such urban land use practices include inappropriate disposal of municipal solid and industrial wastes by burying them underground the use of leaky septic tanks and on site sanitary facilities direct effluent discharge into the groundwater and other urban land stressors have been identified egboka et al 1989 ocheri et al 2014 ukpong et al 2015 ijioma 2020 some of these practices are alternative recharge system and have the potential to contaminate the groundwater in many developing urban areas therefore when assessing the quality of urban groundwater it is important to delineate the influence of anthropogenic pressure on the groundwater and as such unmask the effect of urban land use for the sustainable management of groundwater the use of stable isotope tracers has been explored in some studies and reviews to investigate the sources of anthropogenic contaminants in both developed and developing parts of the world lu et al 2015 harker et al 2015 nisi et al 2016 other studies which have characterized the groundwater facies in developing urban areas reported that the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is sometimes complex or dynamic for instance the characterization of the groundwater in tema metropolitan upper accra district of ghana revealed that the predominant groundwater facies are the na cl and ca mg so4 types fianko et al 2010 again seven water types ca hco3 ca cl mg hco3 na so4 mg cl na hco3 and na cl were reported in lagos the most populated urban area in nigeria despite the simple alluvium and coastal plain sands geological formations in lagos the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater were variable the outcome of the study highlights the impact of urban land use on the quality and complexity of the hydrochemistry of the groundwater akoteyon 2013 akoteyon et al 2018 this study addressed the quality and hydrochemical characterization of the groundwater the major source of water in aba nigeria some results of previous studies which have evaluated the hydrochemistry of the groundwater were inconclusive because the dominant types reported did not corroborate but revealed mixed water types in area amadi et al 2009 and agharanya and dim 2018 found in their characterization of the groundwater that the calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 type was predominant with other mixed water types in the area alichi et al 2010 in their review of the groundwater hydrochemistry in some parts of the area reported the sodium chloride na cl type as the dominant groundwater facies in the area however none of these studies has comprehensibly covered the entire study area hence the discrepancies observed in the outcome of the hydrochemical evaluations the geology soil type and terrain analyses are uniform throughout the area and will have minimum effect introducing sudden changes in the quality and hydrochemistry of the groundwater therefore it was hypothesized that urban land use practices might be responsible for the changes in the quality and hydrochemistry of the groundwater just like in the context of many developing urban areas where poor land management has been reported the study aimed to set a baseline for the status of the groundwater quality and characterize its hydrochemistry while unmasking the effect of urban land practices the specific objectives will a elucidate general trends in the physicochemical and major ion chemistry of the groundwater and b harmonize the hydrochemical results of some previous studies that have characterized the groundwater facies in the area the understanding of the evolutionary trends in the chemistry of the groundwater is important to ensure the sustainable use and management of the resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in aba and its environs the main economic nerve centre of abia state nigeria fig 1 it serves the commercial needs of important cities in the south eastern and south southern geo political regions of nigeria over one million people are estimated to be living in the 236 square km area according to the 2006 national population census in nigeria npc 2016 the vegetation and climate conditions are humid equatorial rainforest with annual mean rainfall ranging from 2150 to 2460 mm and mean daily temperatures ranging between 22 c and 33 c for the average minimum and maximum daily temperatures meteorological data were obtained from the national root crop research institute nrcri umudike and analysed over a 30 year 1986 2016 the geology is constituted by the sedimentary coastal plain sand of the benin formation with some localized clay lenses in some parts of the basin smedley 2003 the soil texture classification in the area is sandy loam adamu et al 2019 which consist of mostly ferralsol according to the fao soil map of nigeria classification esdac 1990 the petrographic characterization of the soil revealed that the sandy dominated soil type contains 95 96 quartz and 1 2 na k mica onyeagocha 1980 the lithology comprised of the medium grained sandy clay up to first 10 m and thereafter medium to coarse and very fine pebble that make up the vadose and the saturated zone up to first the 100 m ijioma 2020 the aquifer type is mostly unconfined and the water table elevation range 26 m 33 m below ground level with an average elevation depth of 28 6 m agharanya and dim 2018 ijioma 2020 the water table elevation implies that the wells are deep and the groundwater is usually abstracted from tube wells with submersible motor pumps the slope and terrain analyses of the dem revealed that the area is predominantly flat with poor drainage networks however some parts of the catchment area are drained by the aba river which forms part of the imo river tributary amadi et al 2012 and other recharging ponds as shown in the land use map fig 1c the land use characterization map for 2017 revealed four land use classes in the area the analysis of the land use classes between 1986 and 2017 showed that the built up area was made up of 36 7 of the area and it is rapidly expanding at an average annual rate of 1 3 km2 annum ijioma 2020 the growing population is putting pressure on the poorly implemented urban land use in the area refuse dumpsites are sporadically sited and are used as municipal waste disposal facility these sites can be spotted in fig 1d public water supply system is dysfunctional and the central sewage system is non existent to manage residential and industrial effluents the dysfunctional state of the public water supply system has led to the proliferation of private pumps which provide groundwater for domestic commercial and industrial purposes in the absence of the central sewerage use of cesspools septic systems direct discharge of effluents into the aquifer system have been observed in the area ijioma 2020 these current practices have the potential to harm the quality of the groundwater in the area 2 2 groundwater sampling procedures the groundwater sampling periods took place between the two main climate seasons in southern nigeria the rainy season campaign between july august 2018 and dry season campaign between february march 2019 the samples were collected from 61 randomly selected tube wells found in both the densely dr and sparse sr residential parts to cover the entire area the criteria for the tube wells selection were subject to the wells accessibility and the ability to take sample directly from the submersible motor pumps in the tube wells these wells supply groundwater to residential commercial and industrial facilities the wells were purged only for 2 3 min since the wells were always in use and to allow water in the column to be removed before samples were taken the spatial distribution of the tube wells overlaid on 2017 land use map of the area fig 1c which highlights the urban influence on the wells the groundwater samples were directly taken as it is pumped from the submersible motor pump physicochemical indicators including temperature ph and electrical conductivity were measured in situ using the wtw multi 1970i portable ph oxygen and conductivity measuring instrument manufacturer wtw weilheim germany samples for the cation s analyses were prepared by filtering them through a 0 45 μm filter disc into a 100 ml pet bottle and preserved with 10 nho3 to ph 2 for the analyses of the anions the samples were filtered and transferred to a 250 ml pe bottle without acidification all the samples obtained from the wells were stored in a cooling box under 6 c and transported to the laboratory for analysis immediately 2 3 groundwater quality evaluation twelve water quality indicators i e physicochemical and major ions in the groundwater were selected and analysed based on the standard operating procedures as summarized in table 1 the results of the samples were grouped into two classes based on the prevailing land use around the tube wells as illustrated in fig 1 c the spatial trends in the results of the analysis were graphically evaluated using some statistical tools such as descriptive statistics trend charts and friedman nonparametric ranking test and hydrochemical as well as geochemical methods piper plot chadha s plot bivariate cross plotting and index of ion exchange to visualize characterize and delineate the impact of urban land practices on the quality of the groundwater 2 4 hydrochemical methods the hydrochemical methods are used to describe the chemical behaviours of the groundwater system the methods mostly use major ions present in the water solution to describe visually the evolutionary trends and the mechanisms that influence the chemistry of the groundwater the following hydrochemical and geochemical methods were employed in this study piper diagram piper 1944 chadha plot chadha 1999 bivariate cross scattered plots ion exchange process according to the chloro alkaline indices of schoeller 1965 the piper diagram is one of the most frequently used hydrochemical models for evaluating the hydrochemical behaviour of the groundwater using a trilinear triangular as described in piper 1944 the method offers flexibility such that several samples can be investigated on a plot again the water types classification and the mixing propensity of waters in the plot is easy to visualize through this method leis 2018 however the demerits of the diagram are that it requires a special program to plot the chart and that the actual concentrations of the predetermined reacting ions are normalized before being implemented in the chart this makes it difficult to account for other ions in cases where other ions are significant chadha 1999 proposed a less complicated hydrochemical scattered chart which is comparable to the piper diagram this chart is effective in interpreting the association of the major ions in the groundwater it identified 8 quadrants positions and suggested four main geochemical fields in the chart the quadrants are likened to the triangular segments in the piper s diamond shape which represent the different hydrochemical facies in the groundwater the use of bivariate cross scattered plots demonstrates the relationship between the major ionic species in the groundwater the use of stoichiometry of the dissolved ions is used to determine the type of dissolved minerals and the sources from where they originate in the groundwater the combination of cross plots was proposed to establish which minerals furnished the major ions and the geochemical processes that define the groundwater chemistry the ion exchange process controls the background concentration of the major ions in the groundwater the chloro alkaline index cai also known as the index of base ion was first introduced by schoeller 1965 to explain the ion exchange process taking place in the groundwater the index describes the direction of movement of base cations between the groundwater and its host environment and it is controlled through the ion exchange process this involves the movement of the alkali metal ion group na k or the alkaline earth metal group ca mg between the rock and the groundwater hwang et al 2017 schoeller 1965 proposed the chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 respectively to demonstrate the direction of movement of the base ions as expressed in eqs 1 and 2 1 cai 1 cl na k cl 2 cai 2 cl na k hco 3 so 4 no 3 each of the chemical symbols in eqs 1 and 2 represents the reacting concentration of the ions in meq l when the sign in the score of the index is positive it means that the na k ions in the groundwater displace ca mg ions in the aquifer materials the reverse process occurs when na k in the aquifer medium displaces ca mg in the groundwater solution the direction of movement of the alkali ions changes the signs before the index 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of groundwater quality in the sr and dr area the results of the twelve physicochemical and major ion quality indicators for the 33 tube wells in sr and 28 tube wells obtained from the dr area were grouped and analysed table 2 the quality checks on the results of the major ion chemistry were determined by the charge balance error cbe test for all the wells the range of the cbe lies within 10 x 15 however these values are higher than the 5 10 recommended the reason for the high cbe is because the analyses of some major ions were performed in a commercial laboratory some of these laboratories do not perform customized calibrations specific for some of the selected ions and this might be responsible for the high cbe recorded in this study a cbe range of 15 can be accepted as recommended by andersen 2015 the important descriptive statistics table 2 summarized some of the results of the quality indicators and compared them against the maximum acceptable concentrations mac for drinking water quality set by the who 2011 the results can be visualized with the bar graph fig 2 comparing wells between the sr and dr areas respectively the analysis of the z factors in the sr and dr wells shows that the distribution in some indicators failed the normality test obtained from the skewness factor of the indicators for each well for sample size n 50 normality lies between 1 96 x 1 96 while x z factor apart from the results of the groundwater ph and temperature the mean values of the remaining indicators were by far below the mac values set by the who in the sr and dr wells but when compared the mean results of wells in the dr area were much higher than the ones in the sr wells fig 2 detailed analyses of each indicator are discussed for the grouped wells to elucidate the urban influence on the quality indicators 3 1 1 temperature some studies have reported that warmer temperatures in groundwater as a pollutant massmann et al 2008 saito et al 2016 groundwater temperature is an essential driver for quality assessment because its change influences some indicators that control the chemistry of the water menberg et al 2014 this parameter depends on the prevalent ambient air temperature and the temperature gradient of the area the average temperature in the sr and dr wells is the wells in the sr areas this result agrees with other studies which have found that groundwater temperatures are higher in densely built up areas relative to green areas gross 1991 berlin de 2011 the result shows that there is faster physical deterioration in the quality of the groundwater as the temperature slightly increases based on the mean values moving from the sr to the dr wells 3 1 2 ph the ph values of all the wells were acidic and did not conform to the recommended who maximum acceptable limits for drinking water 6 5 8 5 in both the sr and dr wells who 2011 the ph range lies 4 5 and 5 6 in the sr while in the dr wells it ranges between 3 7 and 4 9 however the modal ph of the groundwater is 4 8 in both areas based on this study the acidity of the groundwater reported in this study supports the findings of previous studies conducted in the area as well as the regional ph of the groundwater within the basin amadi et al 2009 alichi et al 2010 agharanya and dim 2018 the acidic ph values are typical of a humid environment where the base cations have been washed away from the host rock of the groundwater knutsson 1994 de ridder 1994 a scattered plot illustration correlating the impact of the ph and total cations present in the groundwater samples on the sr and dr wells is shown in fig 3 the illustration revealed that there is an inverse relationship between the groundwater ph and total concentrations of the major cations tc in the water solution the results revealed higher concentrations of tc in the dr wells at lower ph compared to the wells in the sr area this means that wells with higher dissolved cations concentrations have values the r2 values in the trend lines suggest that the more acidic groundwater i e low ph in the dr wells is responsible for the more dissolved cations compared to most wells in the sr area this trend in the wells of the dr area corroborates with the findings of o driscoll et al 2010 the more acidic groundwater reservoir in the dr wells suggests the presence of organic contaminations from anthropogenic sources in the groundwater which degrade to acidic carboxylic or phenolic anions hem 1985 the use of septic tanks and soak away pits bio waste treatment in the dr area and most parts of the congested commercial areas contribute to the high amounts of dissolved organic and inorganic substances in the groundwater in contrast the sr wells have slightly higher acidic groundwater ph with an average greater than 4 5 the sr wells are relatively less mineralized compared to the wells in the dr areas in general drinking water with acidic ph has no direct health implications however groundwater with acidic ph can dissolve more substances including trace metals in the surrounding thereby increasing the concentration of such ions in the water solution the presence of these metal ions can affect the taste appearance toxicity and general acceptability of the groundwater for drinking purpose 3 1 3 electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds the electrical conductivity ec simply describes how easily electric current is transferred through the ionic species in the groundwater the ec values for all the tube well samples were corrected to the corresponding specific electrical conductivity at 25 c these ec can be directly correlated to the dissolved inorganic ions in the groundwater and it is used as a proxy indicator for monitoring the quality of groundwater wells this is common in areas where the groundwater has a high possibility of saline intrusion the ec and total dissolved solids tds are interconvertible and can be related by the expression in eq 3 van der aa 2003 rusydi 2018 3 tds mg l ec 25 μs cm a where ec25 the specific electrical conductivity of the sample at 25 c a the ratio of tds to ec25 a range between 0 55 and 0 75 for freshwater but this study a 0 65 was adapted from rusydi 2018 where he found this value for freshwater based on eq 3 tds was calculated from measured ec25 the tds is used as a measure of the freshness of different natural water sources todd 1980 this indicator has been associated with the taste and acceptability of drinking water in different sources again the presence of dissolved inorganic and or organic substances in the groundwater impact taste on it who 2003a 2003b table 3 summarizes the rating of tds concentrations based on the taste it gives to drinking water according to the who guidelines for drinking water quality in table 2 the ratio of the mean results of ec and tds between the dr and sr wells is about nine times apart when compared this observation suggests the contribution of some urban land use practice on the quality of groundwater between these two parts in the area the lowest tds mineralization in the groundwater tds 6 5 mg l was found in a well very close to the stream head around aba river and represents the lowest background tds in the area with the least impact of human activities taking place the highest tds 364 mg l was recorded in a well at one of the densest residential parts around an informal settlement area the tube well was very closely sited to a cesspool in a highly congested dr part of the area based on the who s tds ratings for drinking water quality the results of most groundwater wells in the area fall within the excellent category though many of the dr wells have higher tds concentrations relative to the well in the sr area the tds values still lie between excellent to good ratings in general the low mineralization in the groundwater stem from the parent geological makeup in the area which is predominantly quartz with a very small portion of clay minerals onyeagocha 1980 lekwa and whiteside 1986 this sedimentary mineral yield trace ions in the groundwater via chemical weathering 3 2 major ion chemistry and characterization of groundwater the hydrochemical assessment specifically deals with the evaluation of the major ions na k ca mg so4 cl and hco3 present in the groundwater these ions determine the chemistry of the groundwater and the evaluation most often employ hydrochemical methods for the classification of the water types and main geochemical processes taking place in the groundwater the results of the major ions presented in table 2 were used to characterize the groundwater facies in the wells of the dr and sr areas using some selected hydrochemical and geochemical methods to draw the influence of land use on the chemistry of the groundwater 3 2 1 dominance array of the major ions in the sr and dr wells the concentrations of the major ions in milliequivalent weights are represented in the boxplots for wells in the sr and dr areas respectively figs 9a and b these illustrations present a quick overview of the dominance array based on the median values of the major cations and anions in the sr and dr areas in fig 4 a the dominance array of the cations can be ordered as na ca k mg and for the anions as hco3 cl so4 in the sr wells while in the dr wells the dominance array of the cations follows ca na mg k and the anions as cl hco3 so4 fig 4b it is worthy of mention that the sulphate concentrations in the groundwater are infinitesimal compared to the rest of the major anions in both the sr and dr wells this statistical approach gives a quick hierarchical overview of the dominant ionic species in the groundwater solution the dominance ions array in this case consider the position of the median equivalent weight concentration of the ions in the boxplot distribution the normalized milliequivalent weights of the grouped major ions in the sr and dr wells are distributed in a box plot fig 5 the implication of the results suggests that the grouped major cations and anions with the highest median value may represent the dominant hydrochemical facies in the groundwater solution such normalization approach forms the basis of the popular hydrochemical methods such as the chadha s plot and the piper s trilinear plot the results of the boxplot array revealed that the dominant water type in sr wells were biased towards na k hco3 type while the dominant water type in the dr wells is towards the ca mg cl type and ignoring the influence of so4 the pearson coefficient of variation cv test for the relationship between the normalized grouped major cations and anions in the dr wells revealed that the r2 0 26 and p 0 05 between the alkaline earth metal ions ca mg and the strong acid anions cl so4 this result means that there is no statistical significance between these grouped ions in other words this suggests that it is less probable that the source of these grouped major ions is geochemically related however the pearson correlation coefficient between the grouped alkali metal na k and the weak acidic bicarbonate ions hco3 is cv 0 5 and p 0 05 for wells in the sr areas this result shows a moderate linear relationship between the grouped cations and anions the association of the grouped in the groundwater is statistically significant and gives a pointer that these grouped ions might have originated from a common source 3 2 2 piper diagram the piper trilinear diagram was constructed from the per cent normalized concentrations of the major ions cations and anions in milliequivalent l per cent meq l figs 6 a and b represent the piper plots of all sr and dr wells respectively in the area each point in the trilinear triangle of the piper represents the constituent cations and anions in the individual tube wells and when projected onto the diamond shape of the piper diagrams defines the groundwater facies of the tube well the results of the groundwater facies in the area suggest that a reasonable number of the sr wells are found in the mixing zone represented by the green dots triangle 3 the mixing propensity implies a dynamic environment because of the groundwater flow and other interaction arising from urban land use activities in most parts of the sr area however the dominant water types in the sr wells are mostly na hco3 type represented by the green dots in triangle 6 ca hco3 represented by the green dots in triangle 1 and a few na cl type wells found in 2 found in fig 6c some of the mixed water types in the sr wells are detailed in appendix table a 3 fig 6 b illustrates the hydrochemical facies of the groundwater wells in the dr area the predominant water types in the dr area are the ca mg cl water type represented by the red dots in the triangle 5 ca hco3 type represented by the red dots in the triangle 1 and the na cl type represented by the red the wells in the 2 in the projected diamond shape of fig 4c all the water types in the dr wells are shown in appendix table a 4 3 2 3 chadha s plots the results of the more simplified chadha s plot also supported the hydrochemical outcomes of the piper s illustration for the groundwater wells in the sr and dr area fig 7 besides the hydrochemical facies in the piper diagram the chadha s plot predicts the main geochemical processes that control the chemistry of the groundwater the dominant facies are represented by the eight hydrochemical quadrants of the chart the result of the hydrochemical facies of the sr wells were found in quadrants 8 5 7 respectively this array showed that the dominant groundwater facies in the sr wells is the na hco3 type with 79 of the wells occurring in quadrant 8 making it the background water type in the area the na hco3 water type is usually found in deep wells where there is a stable equilibrium between the groundwater and the rock chae et al 2005 in such groundwater the ion exchange process regulates the displacement of ions between the groundwater and the host mineral other dominant water types found in the sr area include the ca hco3 and nacl just like in the piper the presence of the mixed water types is not usually clear in the chadha s plot the order of preponderance in the dr wells occur in 6 7 5 respectively in the dr area 67 of the wells are constituted of mg ca cl groundwater facies and this type is the most dominant water type in the dr area this category of water type is controlled by the reverse ion exchange process as the main geochemical process according to chadha 1999 this water type is generally associated with permanent hardness in the groundwater the remaining wells in the dr areas were found quadrants 5 and 7 which represent the ca hco3 and na cl water types respectively the compositional change in the dominant water types found between the dr and sr wells can be traced to the influence of anthropic activities on the groundwater especially in the dr area this is because the geology in the area is assumed uniform and geogenic processes are slow and take a long period to equilibrate thereby effecting any significant changes in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater therefore the rapid population growth industrial and economic activities in the area might be responsible for the additional major introduction in the groundwater reservoir of the dr areas the population pressure construction activities the use of the septic system for draining of household effluents within the dr areas contributing to the increase in some of the major ions found in the groundwater 3 2 4 bivariate cross plotting different bivariate cross plots have been presented to demonstrate important geochemical processes using the expected reacting ions taking place in the groundwater to describe the chemistry in the sr and dr wells to predict some of the major hydrogeochemical processes in the groundwater the concentrations of the reacting ions were expressed either in milliequivalent weights or molar concentrations see the scattered plots figs 8a d the lines in the cross plots describe the stoichiometry of the reacting units while the green and red dots represent the wells in the sr and dr areas respectively the weathering of the parent materials contributes to the major ions builds up in the groundwater berkowitz et al 2014 to determine the dominance between competing geochemical process of silicate vs carbonate weathering in the groundwater wells the usual cross plot of ca mg vs hco3 so4 was performed adopted from kumar et al 2009 fig 8a the results showed that the interaction between the reacting ions for all the wells in the sr area was below the equiline 1 1 the equiline represents the 1 1 line in the scatter plot whereas most of the wells in the dr wells were found lying above the 1 1 line the implication of this result confirms that silicate weathering is the natural source of the reacting ions when the wells lie under the 1 1 line this is true for all the wells in the sr and silicate weathering is suggested to be the background geochemical process in the groundwater of the study area this result makes sense because of the low mineralization recorded in the tds of the groundwater the quartz mineral is the predominant mineral in the soil type found in the area with trace amounts of kaolinite clay characterized in the area the quartz mineral is less reactive and constituted mainly 95 sio4 in the tectosilicate arrangement with trace impurities such as na k ca mg fe and h oh the traces are the more reactive part of the mineral and influence the chemistry of groundwater berkowitz et al 2014 the observed high concentrations of the reacting ca mg ions scattered in most of dr wells plot suggest that the ions do not come from the same geogenic sources with the hco3 so4 the illustrations in fig 8 b and c explained the correlation between the alkaline earth ions ca mg and the alkali ions na k against the total cations tc in the groundwater for the sr and dr wells respectively for the sr wells in fig 8 b the relationship between the ca mg ions and the tc revealed a weak association based on the 1 1 and 1 2 lines respectively however the relationship between ca mg and tc for wells in dr areas revealed that most of the wells aligned along the 1 2 line this stoichiometric arrangement in the dr wells suggests a possible reverse base ion exchange taking place between the na k in the groundwater and ca mg from the surrounding or increase in the concentration of ca mg ions washed into the groundwater from the surface a strong correlation was found in the sr wells fig 8c between the na k ions and tc as most of the wells aligned on the 1 1 equiline this strong correlation suggests that the na k ions come from a geogenic source and originate from the weathering of the parent materials most of the dr wells lie along the 1 2 line in the na k vs tc plots suggesting reverse ion exchange the illustration in fig 8 d was used to test the direction of movement of the base cations using the ca mg vs na k plots between the groundwater and the host environment for wells in the sr and dr areas while most of the dr wells are found around and above the 1 1 and 2 1 line this is not the same for the wells in the sr areas most of the wells in the sr area were found below the 1 1 and 1 2 lines suggesting the presence of more reacting ca mg ions from the surrounding than the na k ions in the groundwater 3 2 5 ion exchange process to further understand the origin concentration and mixing of the reacting major base ions in the groundwater reservoirs the concept of the chloro alkali index was further explored with some of the results of the major ions in the sr and dr wells the signs in the index score suggest the direction of movement of the base i e alkali metals or alkaline earth metal ions between the groundwater and the aquifer materials the results of the implemented chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 are summarized in the scattered plot fig 9 a and b for the wells sr and dr areas respectively these plots revealed that the scores of the indices for cai 1 and cai 2 have different magnitudes but the direction of the signs tells whether the process favours ion exchange or reverse ion exchange in the sr and dr wells in both cases the signs of the index suggest whether the process leads to ion exchange for an index with a negative sign or reversed ion exchange process for an index with a positive sign in the groundwater in fig 9 a the dr wells represented in the red dots have positive cai 1 indices the green dots referred to the sr wells showing a combination of positive and negative indices in the scattered chart 83 of all the wells both from the dr and sr areas have positive indices the results of the cai 2 fig 9b follow a similar trend like the results of cai 1 for the corresponding wells in fig 9 a however from the indices in the cai 2 it was found that only a few wells in the sr area have negative indices and favour ion exchange process in the groundwater when the index is negative then there are more na k ions in the groundwater solution than the chloride ion these wells were deeper and found in areas with a minimum urban influence the results of the bivariate cross plotting revealed that the chloride ions in the groundwater might not be from geogenic sources since the silicate weathering process is the dominant geochemical process in the sr wells in general most of the wells in the area have a positive chloro alkali index which means that the chloride cl concentration is higher than the concentration of alkali metal na k ions in the groundwater solution this situation was found common for all the dr wells in which a lot of major ions were furnished from surface contamination leached into the groundwater the reverse ion exchange process was also found in the sr wells more so the ions exchange is a reversible one therefore wells with the positive cai 1 index can undergo the reverse ion exchange and vice versa zaidi et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that the movement of the base ion in both directions can serve as a temporary ph buffering mechanism in the groundwater system toumi et al 2015 hence the concept of the base ion exchange process has been reported as the predominant geochemical process responsible for the mixing of the groundwater facies hamutoko et al 2017 the mechanism of the reaction of the base ion exchange is demonstrated in eq 4 4 ½ ca 2 a s na aq alkalinisation ½ ca 2 aq ½ na 2 a s earth metal alkalinisation where a adsorbing exchange medium which could be a clay mineral eq 4 is a reversible chemical process leading to either alkalinisation process i e mobilizing na or k ions in the groundwater for the backward reaction or the earth metal alkalinisation process i e mobilizing the ca or mg ions in the groundwater for the forward reaction this equation was modified from hölting and coldewey 2019 to illustrate the base ion exchange taking place between the groundwater and the host surrounding another factor influencing changes in the index of base ion exchange and the hydrochemistry of groundwater is the direction of flow of the groundwater in the reservoirs hwang et al 2017 this factor explains the mixing propensity of the groundwater reservoirs wallick and toth 1976 especially in most of the sr wells the positive and negative cai indices observed in the sr wells support the impact of the mixing of groundwater reservoirs this is influenced by the direction of flow of the groundwater from the more mineralized dr area downstream to some less mineralized sr wells causing the groundwater reservoirs to mix 3 3 anthropogenic sources of major ions in the groundwater the compositional changes observed in the hydrochemistry groundwater between the sr and dr wells has been traced to the direct consequence of rapid urban practices in the area these activities are beginning to influence both the quality and hydrochemistry of the groundwater in most of the densely residential dr area several poor land management practices have been observed the growing population means that the municipal authorities have a daunting task in managing wastes solid and effluents generated in the area most parts of the residential and industrial effluents are managed with cesspools on site sanitary and septic systems and these facilities form part of the groundwater recharge sources in the area some of the effluents drained through this system contain household cleaning products beverages black water etc and these forms some of the anthropogenic sources of chlorides in the groundwater mullaney et al 2009 refuse dumpsites are also found in different parts of the dr area and they contain food waste rubber and paper products mullaney et al 2009 these waste materials have high chlorides content and have been reported in dumpsite leachate who 2003b some of these sources also introduce anthropogenic na and k cations in the groundwater again intensive construction works to provide roads and real estate infrastructures for the growing population have been reported this was revealed in the urban sprawl development analysis between 1987 and 2017 in the area ijioma 2020 the construction activities use materials e g clay minerals which are rich sources of ca and mg ions commonly used in construction materials such as laterite cement gypsum etc kuriata potasznik and szymczyk 2015reported that the increased concentrations of ca and mg ions in natural water bodies come from storm runoff 3 4 influence of urban land use on the quality of groundwater the impact of urban land use on the groundwater quality was qualitatively and visually evaluated following the different in the trend line of some urban signature indicators such as ph tds chloride and nitrates in the groundwater between the well groups i e sr and dr wells fig 10 shows a semi log plot for the indicators drawn from the average results of the selected indicators and compared against the recommended mac for drinking water quality set by the who the results reveal that the selected signatures have higher concentrations in the dr wells compared to the wells in the sr area this explains the implications of some urban land use practices which adverse quality consequences on the groundwater wells in the dr area the extent of deterioration is represented by the shaded portion between the plots of the sr and dr wells in the illustration for instance the presence of nitrate in groundwater is a common anthropogenic signature mostly associated with agricultural land use however many developing urban areas without a central sewer system the build up of nitrate concentration in groundwater the nitrate sources come mainly from of use on site sanitary facilities and septic drains lapworth et al 2017 in the sr area the mean nitrate concentrations in the wells were basically under 1 mg l however an outlying concentration as much as 14 mg l was recorded in one of the wells in the dr area in both cases the mean concentration levels were well below 50 mg l for nitrate in drinking water the wide margin of nitrate concentrations between the sr and dr wells is an indication of the influence of urban land use in the groundwater from surface derived sources these results corroborate the report in misstear et al 2006 that rapid changes in the nitrate concentrations of natural water come from surface contamination 3 5 statistical significance of the impact of urban land use on the quality and hydrochemistry of the groundwater the line plots comparing the tube wells between the sr and dr areas used the means results of some selected urban stressors fig 10 following the implication of the illustration it is necessary to test the statistical significance of the null hypothesis that urban land use practices do not influence the quality of groundwater since the result of distribution for some quality indicators did not pass the normality test the friedman nonparametric ranking test was used to test the hypothesis by comparing the results of the twelve quality indicators for the tube wells between the sr and dr areas the friedman statistical test was performed and the results summarized in table 4 to reject the null hypothesis ho then f r ꭓ a k 1 2or the p value p χ2 fr based on this premise there is a chance that some urban land use has a significant influence on the quality of the groundwater since p 0 05 i e reject ho if p 0 05 then the alternative hypothesis is accepted as the test evaluates the spatial changes in the quality indicators between the sr and dr area but the results did not reveal which of the indicators have the most influence on the quality of the groundwater the statistical significance of this test corroborates with the impact of the reported poor land use activities already described as the use of on site such in many developing countries which form alternative recharge system for the urban groundwater and affect the quality wakode 2016 4 conclusion this study evaluated some physicochemical and major ion chemistry from samples of groundwater tube wells obtained within aba and its environs southeast nigeria the results of the analyses showed that the groundwater ph is generally acidic and the mineralization in the groundwater is low based on the tds results of the wells however when the mean results of the quality indicators were compared between the wells in sr and dr areas they showed that the quality of the groundwater is deteriorating the hydrochemical and geochemical evaluation revealed the extent of the spatial variation in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater between the wells in the dr and sr areas overall the na hco3 type is the predominant water type in most sr wells areas and it is assumed to be the baseline groundwater facies in the study area the ca hco3 and the mixed water types in the remaining sr wells are a direct influence of urban land use practices and other hydrogeological factors influencing the wells more so the mg ca cl na cl and ca hco3 types are prevalent in the wells of dr area the hydrolysis of products of the dominant water types also supports why the general ph of the groundwater is acidic and more acidic in the dr area the compositional changes and differentiation in the water types between wells in the sr and dr areas can be attributed to the impact of some identified urban land use activities over the years the impact of these practices has yielded additional major ions in the groundwater reservoir of the dr area which has effected changes in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater besides the direction of flow of the groundwater enhances the mixing propensity of the groundwater in the reservoirs and helps to distribute the major ions between the wells in the dr area and sr wells downstream in the direction of flow these results of the hydrochemical facies in this study have harmonized some of the differences in the reports of previous research which have characterized the groundwater in the area these spatial evolutionary trends in the hydrochemistry of the groundwater reflect some of the water types already reported in the study area further the statistical significance in change between the quality of the groundwater in the sr and dr areas was tested with the friedman nonparametric test and result suggested the probability that urban land practices might have influenced the changes in the groundwater quality looking forward to future research it is important to carry out detailed investigation tracing the sources of the major contaminant ions using stable isotope tracers for sustainable management of the groundwater resource

1434,this study integrated batch experiments and theoretical calculations to understand the equilibrium adsorption and kinetic interaction of cdses zns alloyed quantum dots nanoparticles qdnps in sand porous media under different ionic strengths iss 0 001 0 2 m nacl our experimental results showed that equilibrium was reached for qdnp concentration between solid phase and bulk solution due to reversible adsorption of the qdnps on sand surfaces derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction energy calculations showed that the repulsive energy barriers were low and primary energy wells were shallow i e comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid at all tested solution iss hence the qdnps could mobilize into and simultaneously escape from the primary wells by brownian diffusion resulting in the reversible adsorption additional batch experiments confirmed that a fraction of adsorbed qdnps was released even without any perturbation of system conditions the release was more evident at a lower is because the primary energy wells spanned more narrowly at low iss and thus the nanoparticles have a higher possibility to escape out the batch kinetic experiments showed that the adsorption of qdnps followed first and second order kinetic interactions at low and high iss respectively these results indicate that the well known colloid filtration theory that assumes irreversible first order kinetics for colloid deposition is not suitable for describing the qdnp adsorption the findings in our work can aid better description and prediction of fate and transport of qdnps in subsurface environments keywords quantum dots adsorption desorption transport and porous media 1 introduction quantum dots qds are new emerging engineered nanoparticles nps with diameters typically ranging between 2 and 10 nm qds have been used in diverse areas such as solar energy conversion medical diagnostics drug delivery and computing systems luque et al 2007 torkzaban et al 2013 due to their extremely small sizes qd nanoparticles qdnps exhibit unique properties that are not shared by their bulk counterparts with the same chemical compositions hu et al 2016 the production and use of qdnps will inevitably cause them to enter into subsurface environments including soil and sediments lin et al 2010 lowry et al 2012 bundschuh et al 2018 however commercial qdnps can release toxic heavy metal ions e g cd2 and se2 that may cause substantial cytotoxic effects to living organisms mahendra et al 2008 domingos et al 2011 tong et al 2017 the toxicity effects of qdnps can be further enhanced by polymer coatings used to encapsulate the qds priester et al 2009 grabowska jadach et al 2016 therefore it is critical to investigate fate and transport of qdnps in the subsurface environments such as soil to evaluate their environmental risks holbrook et al 2008 navarro et al 2009 darlington et al 2009 the transport of nanoparticles in porous media has been examined over two decades petosa et al 2010 phenrat et al 2010 wang et al 2008 wang et al 2016a 2016b meng and yang 2019 surprisingly only very limited attention has been paid to investigating the transport of qdnps in porous media to date quevedo and tufenkji 2009 2012 quevedo et al 2013 torkzaban et al 2010 2013 yu et al 2020 these reports revealed that the deposition of qdnps on collector surfaces increased with increasing solution ionic strength is and cation valence the results are consistent with the prediction by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory because increasing is decreases repulsive energy barrier and accordingly increases deposition in primary minima shen et al 2007 2018 the secondary minimum deposition should have a minor influence on the retention of qdnps because the depths of secondary minima are extremely shallow for the qdnps shen et al 2011 2012a 2012b 2012c bradford et al 2012 wang et al 2012 godinez et al 2013 the colloid filtration theory cft has been used to describe qdnps deposition in saturated quartz sand loamy sand quevedo and tufenkji 2012 the cft considers that particle deposition in primary minima is an irreversible immobilization process that follows the first order kinetic interaction ryan and elimelech 1996 shen et al 2020 however torkzaban et al 2013 using saturated column experiments showed that a fraction of deposited qdnps can be spontaneously detached from the sand collector surfaces without perturbation of any system condition this indicates that the qdnps deposition is a reversible process quevedo and tufenkji 2009 and torkzaban et al 2013 showed that almost all qdnps that were deposited in the presence of monovalent cations can be detached by introducing deionized di water to decrease is the rate of detachment was very fast which was comparable to that of deposition these results underline that an equilibrium partition between the solid and solution phases may be established for the qdnps although the assumption of equilibrium partition for colloids including nanoparticles and qdnps has been argued praetorius et al 2014 cornelis 2015 dale et al 2015 therefore the mechanisms controlling the deposition and transport of qdnps in porous media remain to be elucidated to date by integrating batch adsorption experiments and theoretical calculations this study specifically explored the kinetic and equilibrium interaction of cdses zns alloyed qdnps 6 nm with sand grains we revealed that the deposition of qdnps followed first and second order kinetic interactions at low and high iss respectively the deposition is a reversible process which resulted in equilibrium partition of the qdnps between the sand surfaces and solution these findings indicate that the qdnps behave more likely solutes instead of colloids and the cft that assumes irreversible first order kinetic interaction is not appropriate for modeling the adsorption of qdnps as such adsorption and desorption rather than deposition or attachment and detachment were used to describe the retention and release of qdnps respectively later in the paper to our knowledge our study was the first to show that the order of kinetic interaction of nps with collectors in porous media changed with is while the equilibrium partition for colloids e g qdnps has been argued in the literature praetorius et al 2014 cornelis 2015 dale et al 2015 shen et al 2020 we unambiguously provided experimental evidences on existence of the equilibrium partition of the qdnps 2 materials and methods 2 1 qdnps the 6 nm cdses qds with a carboxyl cooh functionalized zns 1 octadecylamine capping were purchased from sigma aldrich saint louis united states the manufacturer reports that the fluorescence emission wavelength and mass concentration of the qdnps in the stock suspension are 540 nm and 1 mg ml 1 respectively the method from treumann et al 2014 was used to prepare qdnp suspensions for batch equilibrium and kinetic experiments briefly nacl solutions with different solution iss 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m were prepared by dissolving analytical reagent grade nacl fisher scientific in di water the qds stock with a cdses zns suspension concentration of 1 mg ml 1 was diluted in the nacl solutions of different iss the qdnps concentration in the electrolyte solutions was estimated to be 10 mg l 1 the ph of the electrolyte solutions was maintained at 5 6 by adding nahco3 the zeta potentials and sizes of qdnps under different nacl concentrations were determined by measuring electrophoretic mobilities and dynamic light scattering via a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd southborough massachusetts at 25 c respectively the measured zeta potentials of the qdnps in 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m nacl solutions were 27 6 22 9 19 7 and 11 2 mv respectively see table 1 the hydrodynamic sizes of the qdnps were 21 25 48 and 54 nm in 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m nacl respectively 2 2 sand silicon quartz sand purchased from unimin corp le sueur minnesota united states was used as collector grains for the batch experiments sands with sizes ranging from 210 to 420 μm were adopted the cleaning protocol of torkzaban et al 2012 was used to purify the sand specifically the sand was soaked in 70 hno3 for 16 h then the sand was thoroughly rinsed with di water followed by five cycles of sonication 20 min per time in a water bath until the ph was equilibrated the sand was then immersed in 0 5 m nacl solution for 1 h in a sonication bath flushed with di water and finally sonicated in di water for 1 h these steps i e soaking in 0 5 m nacl solution rinsing with di water and sonication were repeated three times which were used to thoroughly remove the colloidal impurities in the sand the colloidal impurities can significantly influence the attachment detachment and concentration determination of qdnps the sand was finally rinsed with di water until the electrical conductivity of rinse water was less than 1 μs cm 1 and dried in an oven for 24 h at 105 c the treated sand was stored in a desiccator before use the method of tufenkji and elimelech 2004 was used to determine zeta potentials of the sand briefly 5 g sand was added into 50 ml electrolyte solutions at different iss and the suspension was sonicated for 5 min the supernatant was taken for the measurement the zeta potentials of the silica quartz sand in 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m nacl solutions were determined to be 59 3 48 8 22 1 and 16 8 mv respectively 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted to determine the kinetic interaction and equilibrium partition for qdnp adsorption onto silicon quartz sand these experiments were performed following the procedure of treumann et al 2014 specifically 35 g of cleaned sands and 35 ml of qdnp suspension 1 mg l 1 at different solution iss 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m were placed into 50 ml glass flasks the suspensions of the glass flasks were stirred in a flat shaker at a shaking speed of 120 rpm at 25 c then the concentration of qds nanoparticles was determined by taking 3 ml of supernatant from each batch sample at time intervals of 0 5 10 30 60 and 120 min total of 2 h and 7 samples for a given is if replicates were not accounted to determine the concentration of the qds nanoparticles each suspension of a glass flask was used only once so that the grain to solution ratios were kept consistent for all samples the optimal wavelength for qd concentration measurement was determined to be 250 nm using uv vis spectrophotometry du series 800 beckman instruments inc fullerton california control experiments in which the glass flasks containing only qdnp suspensions without sand were conducted to examine the stability of qdnps during the batch experiments we found that there was no further aggregation of the qdnps during the experiments in addition we have done batch experiments with using sand and qdnps free electrolyte solutions to check whether colloidal impurities can be released from the sand by the agitation we did not find detectable colloids in the supernatants after the sand was elaborately treated using the aforementioned cleaning method the decrease in colloidal concentration of the qd solutions in the batch systems with time was thus solely attributed to adsorption of qdnps onto the sand surfaces the amount of qdnps attached onto silicon quartz sand at time t denoted as q t mg kg 1 was calculated using the following expression 1 q t c 0 c t v w m s where c 0 is the initial qdnps concentration mg l 1 c t is the qdnps concentration at time t mg l 1 v w is the volume of the solution l and m s is the mass of sand kg equilibrium partition experiments were performed by mixing quartz sand with qdnps suspension with different concentrations 0 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l 1 in a set of 50 ml glass flasks the mixture of quartz sand and qdnps suspension was stirred for 24 h in a shaker at a speed of 120 rpm at 25 c the qdnps concentrations for the supernatant solutions were then measured the amount of qdnps adsorbed onto silicon quartz sand at equilibrium q e mg qds kg was calculated using the following expression 2 q e c 0 c e v w m s where c e is concentration of qdnps in solution at equilibrium time mg l 1 after the completion of the attachment some of the batch samples after the equilibrium experiments underwent additional experimental phase to examine the reversibility of qdnps i e desorption from sand surfaces specifically the mixture of sand and qdnps suspension were filtrated using a 2 μm membrane the sand with qdnps attached on the membrane was transfer to a flask containing qdnps free nacl solution which had the same is as that used for the equilibrium attachment the mixture was subsequently shaken for 1 min and the concentration of the released qdnps was determined the mixture was further kept for 2 h without any physical and chemical disturbance and the concentration of qdnps in the solution was again measured all batch adsorption and desorption experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure the repeatability and accuracy 2 4 equilibrium and kinetic models the langmuir freundlich and temkin models were used to simulate the equilibrium adsorption of qdnps in the sand the langmuir model assumes that the maximum adsorption corresponds to a saturated monolayer of solute molecules on the adsorbent surface with no lateral interaction between the adsorbed molecules the freundlich isotherm model is frequently used to describe the adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces and multilayer adsorption togue kamga 2018 the temkin model can also be used to describe the adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces or can account for direct adsorbate adsorbate or indirect adsorbate substrate interactions pursell et al 2011 this model assumes that the adsorption enthalpy changes linearly over the different adsorption sites on the heterogeneous surfaces or with the adsorption enthalpy due to the interactions between adsorbate and adsorbate or substrate interactions details of the expressions for these models can be found in supplementary material the pseudo first and second order and the elovich models were used to simulate the kinetic attachment of the qdnps in the sand the first order model assumes that the rate of adsorption is proportional to the number of unoccupied sites whereas the second order model considers that the rate of adsorption is related to the square of number of vacant sites on the adsorbent the second order interaction was frequently attributed to chemisorption which involves valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between the adsorbate and adsorbent francis and uchechukwu 2014 the elovich equation can also be used to describe chemisorption kinetics and adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces low 1960 detailed expressions of the first and second order kinetic and elovich models were shown in supplementary material 2 5 dlvo interaction energy calculations the dlvo interaction energies were determined to understand the attachment and detachment of qdnps on or from sand surfaces the qdnps and sand surfaces were assumed to be spherical and planar respectively the total dlvo interaction energy φτ between a qdnp and sand surface was considered to be a sum of van der waals attraction electrostatic double layer energy and born repulsion representing the short range repulsion ryan and elimelech 1996 bradford and torkzaban 2012 2013 torkzaban et al 2013 the surface element integration sei technique developed by bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 was adopted to calculate the total interaction energy for the sphere plate interaction configuration the sei technique was used because it can accurately calculate the dlvo interaction energy even for nps shen et al 2020 the value of hamaker constant for the qd water quartz system was taken to be 4 04 10 21 j torkzaban et al 2013 the calculated dlvo interaction energies were expressed in terms of kt where k is boltzmann constant and t is absolute temperature details about the use of sei technique for implementing the energy calculations can be found in supplementary material it should be noted that the qdnps were aggregated at all iss however we still used the size of the primary particles i e 6 nm for determining the interaction energies this is because lin and wiesner 2012 demonstrated that the interaction energy for an aggregate is similar to those of the primary particles of the aggregate and is significantly smaller than that of an equivalent particle of the aggregate e g defined by the gyration radius 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of qdnps and quartz sand table 1 presents sizes of qdnps and zeta potentials of the qdnps and quartz sand at different iss the sizes of qdnps increased with increasing is indicating that aggregation occurred under these chemical conditions the tendency towards aggregation for qdnps in solution has also been reported in previous studies quevedo and tufenkji 2009 2012 torkzaban et al 2010 the zeta potentials of the qdnps were less negative at higher is due to compression of the electrostatic double layer the negative zeta potential values of the qdnps and silica sand indicate unfavorable interaction conditions 3 2 kinetic interaction of qdnps with quartz sand fig 1 presents results from batch kinetic experiments by plotting the fraction of removed or adsorbed qdnps mg l 1 as a function of time at different iss the adsorption increased with increasing solution is the results are in agreement with the prediction by the energy calculations because increasing is decreases repulsive energy barriers and accordingly increases qdnps adsorption at primary minima fig 2 the repulsive energy barrier even completely disappears at 0 1 and 0 2 m indicating that the qdnps are favorable to be attached at primary minima at the two high iss the primary minimum depth is higher at 0 2 m than at 0 1 m see table 1 accordingly the qdnps experience higher adhesion at 0 2 m than at 0 1 m causing more adsorption the secondary minimum depth is extremely small at all iss 0 01 kt which is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of a colloid i e 1 5 kt therefore the qdnps cannot be adsorbed at such shallow secondary minima due to brownian diffusion note that the average kinetic energy of a qndp is also 1 5 kt as common colloids because all molecules and colloids have the same average translational kinetic energy according to the law of equipartition of energy among the degrees of freedom sonntag and strenge 1987 i e 3 1 2 m v 2 3 2 kt where m is mass of the molecules or colloids including quantum dots and v is the average velocity fig 1 shows that the adsorption of qdnps was initially very fast at is 0 1 m and the adsorption rate was then gradually decreased the adsorption reached quasi steady state at about 60 min as shown above the energy calculations showed that the repulsive energy barrier is absent at the two iss therefore transport over the repulsive energy barrier was not the rate limiting step controlling the adsorption rate instead the interaction of the surface with the qdnps e g chemisorption governed the adsorption rate the decrease of adsorption rate was likely due to blocking camesano et al 1999 specifically at the initial stage of qdnps adsorption the adsorbed qdnps on collector surfaces were sparingly distributed which did not have evident influence for the further adsorption of incoming qdnps from bulk solution the interactions between the adsorbed qdnps and the incoming qdnps became significant with increasing accumulation of qdnps on the collector surfaces the adsorbed qdnps prevented subsequent qdnps adsorption if the interaction between the adsorbed qdnps and incoming qdnps was unfavorable resulting in decreased rate of adsorption with time fig 1 shows that the adsorption kinetics of qdnps at 0 01 m was different from that at 0 1 m the adsorption increases at a nearly constant rate at the low iss the interaction energy calculations in fig 2 shows that repulsive energy barrier existed at 0 01 and 0 001 m the transport over the repulsive energy barrier was likely the step controlling the adsorption ruckenstein and prieve 1976 showed that if particle deposition is controlled by the transport over a repulsive energy barrier the deposition follows first order kinetic interaction fig 3 present modeling results of the kinetic adsorption data in fig 1 using the pseudo first the second order kinetic and the elovich equations the first order model described the kinetic adsorption at 0 001 and 0 01 m better than the second order model in contrast the second order equation was better to describe the kinetic data at 0 1 and 0 2 m than the other two models the modeling results confirmed the aforementioned interpretations using dlvo interaction energy calculations specifically the adsorption of the qdnps at low iss conformed to the first order kinetics indicating that the reactants i e qndps are excessive compared to the adsorption sites simonin 2016 xiao et al 2018 this is reasonable because only the surface sites e g at heterogeneities where the interaction energy barriers were reduced to be comparable to or smaller than the average kinetic energy of colloid can result in the adsorption the adsorption of the qdnps at high iss conformed to the second order kinetics revealing that the adsorption was controlled by the reaction of the qdnps with surfaces instead of diffusion due to absence of repulsive energy barriers chemisorption may be responsible for the second order kinetics of adsorption at high iss yan et al 2010 long 2013 note that previous studies saiers et al 1994 babakhani et al 2017 showed that the blocking can also results in a second order colloid deposition kinetics therefore blocking may also play a role in controlling colloid adsorption at the two high iss table 2 presents determined parameter values for the first and second order kinetic model and elovich model for qdnps adsorption in quartz sand in nacl at different iss the determined amount of adsorbed qdnps q e from second order kinetic model were close to the experimental observations at 0 1 and 0 2 m while the calculated values of q e by the first order model were significantly different compared to the experimental values at the two iss in contrast the calculated values of q e using first order model was approximately equal to the experimental values at the two low iss the modeling results further confirm that the adsorption of qdnps conformed to first order kinetics at 0 001 and 0 01 m and second order kinetics at 0 1 and 0 2 m 3 3 equilibrium partition fig 4 presents the equilibrium adsorption isotherms for qdnps in quartz sand at different iss similar to the kinetic adsorption data in fig 1 the adsorption increased with increasing solution is due to increased retention in primary minima by reducing repulsive energy barriers or increasing primary minimum depth the adsorption of qdnps onto quartz sand increased with increasing initial qdnp concentration from 0 5 to 10 mg l 1 the adsorption reached maximum when the equilibrium concentration of qdnps in solution was 5 mg l 1 at all solution iss the result indicates that the retention of qdnps was not an irreversible first order kinetics as assumed by the cft this is because all the qdnps would be adsorbed in sand i e the concentration of qdnps in solution would reach zero before reaching the maximum adsorption at a given is if the adsorption follows irreversible first order kinetics however there always existed a fraction of qdnps in solution after equilibrium even if the initial qdnps concentration was low there results unambiguously showed that the retention of qdnps was irreversible at least partially the results in fig 4 also indicate that the desorption rate was higher at a lower solution is therefore the equilibrium concentrations of qdnps in solution at the low iss e g 0 001 and 0 01 m can be even comparable to those at high solution iss although the amounts of adsorption were much smaller at the low iss the energy calculations in fig 2 can explain the more desorption at low solution iss specifically althought the primary minimum depth and accordingly the adhesion were larger at low iss the attractive primary wells were narrow i e the range of separation distances corresponding to the attractive primary minimum energies were small once the qdnps mobilize out of the attractive repulsive energy wells or overcome the detachment energy barriers by brownian diffusion the qdnps will experience repulsive dlvo forces denoted by the monotonic decrease of interaction energy with separation distance when the separation distance is larger than that corresponds to the maximum repulsive energy barrier and transport back to the bulk solution in contrast the attractive primary energy wells expand very long at the high iss the qdnps experience attractive forces at all separation distances and thus are not readily to escape back to the solution by brownian diffusion figs 5 present simulations of the adsorption isotherms for qdnp adsorption at different iss using langmuir freundlich and temkin equations the values of model parameters were shown in table 3 the langmuir model showed the best simulations compared to the other two models as indicated by the values of r 2 very close to 1 as mentioned previously the langmuir model assumes that maximum adsorption corresponds to a saturated monolayer of molecules on the adsorbent surface the modeling results suggest that ripening i e adsorption of qdnps onto the qdnps already adsorbed on the surfaces should not be significant in contrast the results in fig 1 show that blocking likely played an important role in the adsorption as discussed previously the equilibrium parameter r l can be used to indicate the adsorption mechanisms the adsorption is favorable and unfavorable if 0 r l 1 and r l 1 respectively the adsorption is linear and irreversible if r l 1 and r l 0 respectively the calculated values of r l were between 0 and 1 at the four solution iss indicating that the adsorption was favorable and not irreversible 3 4 desorption of qdnps in quartz sand fig 6 presents the desorption of qdnps after the kinetic adsorption experiments a fraction of qdnps was released back to the solution even without disturbance of chemical conditions more qdnps were released back into the solution when the samples were further kept for 2 h without any physical and chemical disturbances the results unambiguously verify that a fraction of qdnps was reversibly adsorbed and the desorption can occur without any system disturbance the observed reversibility of the qdnps confirmed the aforementioned theoretical modeling results of r l the energy calculations in fig 2 show that the detachment energy barriers from primary minimum or primary minimum depths were comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid therefore the qdnps can be released back to the bulk solution by brownian diffusion previous studies bradford and torkzaban 2013 shen et al 2012b 2012c 2020 showed that the presence of nanoscale surface roughness on collector surfaces can decrease the primary minimum depth and thus increase the detachment from the primary minimum atomic force microscopic afm examinations showed that the sand surfaces are always physically heterogeneous at nanoscale shen et al 2020 and the nanoscale surface roughness may enhance the desorption observed in fig 4 the desorption was more at a lower is in agreement with observations in fig 3 as mentioned previously the primary energy well spans more narrowly at a low is and accordingly the qdnps are more readily to escape from the energy well to bulk solution although colloids attached at secondary minima can also detach by brownian diffusion wang et al 2016a 2016b the qdnps should not be immobilized at the secondary minima because they are significantly smaller than the average kinetic energy of a colloid 3 5 implications the classic cft considers that deposition of colloids including nps and qdnps is an irreversible process and follows first order kinetics specifically the cft considers the so called perfect sink model to simulate the boundary condition of colloid deposition at a collector surface ryan and elimelech 1996 the perfect sink model assumes that all colloids approaching at the collector surface are irreversibly captured by a very fast immobilization interaction this means that the colloids are consumed in an infinite energy sink and disappear from the system this assumption is reasonable when the primary energy well is deep because the depth of primary minimum is proportional to the adhesive force that the colloids accordingly the cft correctly predicts the trend for the deposition of colloids under favorable conditions molnar et al 2015 the deposition of colloids under unfavorable conditions has also been considered as a first order kinetic interaction because transport over the repulsive energy barrier is the rate limiting step which was considered to follow first order kinetics ruckenstein and prieve 1976 therefore the use of other mechanisms such as equilibrium partition to simulate deposition was argued praetorius et al 2014 cornelis 2015 dale et al 2015 however various studies babakhani et al 2017 shen et al 2020 revealed that colloid deposition can be simulated using equilibrium partition model because equilibrium could form for colloid concentration between secondary minimum or shallow primary energy minimum e g due to nanoscale surface roughness and bulk solution our study showed that the primary minima were comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid at all solution iss for qdnps even without considering nanoscale surface roughness hence equilibrium partition can form for concentrations of qdnps between solid phase and bulk solution as confirmed by the batch experiments our study also showed that the adsorption of qdnps followed second order kinetics at high solution iss rather than first order kinetic as assumed by the cft these results have important implication to accurate modeling of fate and transport of qdnps in subsurface environments 4 conclusions through conducting batch experiments our work unambiguously showed that the qdnps behave more likely solutes specifically the adsorption of qdnps in sand was a reversible process even without any disturbance of system condition this is because the primary minimum depths of qdnps were comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid at all iss and the qdnps adsorbed at the shallow primary energy wells can escape by brownian diffusion the reversible adsorption resulted in equilibrium partition of qdnps between solid phase and bulk solution as confirmed by batch equilibrium experiments the batch kinetic experiments show that the adsorption of qdnps followed first and secondary order interaction kinetics at low and high solution iss respectively there results showed the failure of using cft for modeling the transport of qdnps in porous media alternatively it is necessary to consider empirical models used for describing solute transport to simulate qdnp transport in porous media as done for solutes author statement we declare that our work described has not

1434,this study integrated batch experiments and theoretical calculations to understand the equilibrium adsorption and kinetic interaction of cdses zns alloyed quantum dots nanoparticles qdnps in sand porous media under different ionic strengths iss 0 001 0 2 m nacl our experimental results showed that equilibrium was reached for qdnp concentration between solid phase and bulk solution due to reversible adsorption of the qdnps on sand surfaces derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction energy calculations showed that the repulsive energy barriers were low and primary energy wells were shallow i e comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid at all tested solution iss hence the qdnps could mobilize into and simultaneously escape from the primary wells by brownian diffusion resulting in the reversible adsorption additional batch experiments confirmed that a fraction of adsorbed qdnps was released even without any perturbation of system conditions the release was more evident at a lower is because the primary energy wells spanned more narrowly at low iss and thus the nanoparticles have a higher possibility to escape out the batch kinetic experiments showed that the adsorption of qdnps followed first and second order kinetic interactions at low and high iss respectively these results indicate that the well known colloid filtration theory that assumes irreversible first order kinetics for colloid deposition is not suitable for describing the qdnp adsorption the findings in our work can aid better description and prediction of fate and transport of qdnps in subsurface environments keywords quantum dots adsorption desorption transport and porous media 1 introduction quantum dots qds are new emerging engineered nanoparticles nps with diameters typically ranging between 2 and 10 nm qds have been used in diverse areas such as solar energy conversion medical diagnostics drug delivery and computing systems luque et al 2007 torkzaban et al 2013 due to their extremely small sizes qd nanoparticles qdnps exhibit unique properties that are not shared by their bulk counterparts with the same chemical compositions hu et al 2016 the production and use of qdnps will inevitably cause them to enter into subsurface environments including soil and sediments lin et al 2010 lowry et al 2012 bundschuh et al 2018 however commercial qdnps can release toxic heavy metal ions e g cd2 and se2 that may cause substantial cytotoxic effects to living organisms mahendra et al 2008 domingos et al 2011 tong et al 2017 the toxicity effects of qdnps can be further enhanced by polymer coatings used to encapsulate the qds priester et al 2009 grabowska jadach et al 2016 therefore it is critical to investigate fate and transport of qdnps in the subsurface environments such as soil to evaluate their environmental risks holbrook et al 2008 navarro et al 2009 darlington et al 2009 the transport of nanoparticles in porous media has been examined over two decades petosa et al 2010 phenrat et al 2010 wang et al 2008 wang et al 2016a 2016b meng and yang 2019 surprisingly only very limited attention has been paid to investigating the transport of qdnps in porous media to date quevedo and tufenkji 2009 2012 quevedo et al 2013 torkzaban et al 2010 2013 yu et al 2020 these reports revealed that the deposition of qdnps on collector surfaces increased with increasing solution ionic strength is and cation valence the results are consistent with the prediction by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory because increasing is decreases repulsive energy barrier and accordingly increases deposition in primary minima shen et al 2007 2018 the secondary minimum deposition should have a minor influence on the retention of qdnps because the depths of secondary minima are extremely shallow for the qdnps shen et al 2011 2012a 2012b 2012c bradford et al 2012 wang et al 2012 godinez et al 2013 the colloid filtration theory cft has been used to describe qdnps deposition in saturated quartz sand loamy sand quevedo and tufenkji 2012 the cft considers that particle deposition in primary minima is an irreversible immobilization process that follows the first order kinetic interaction ryan and elimelech 1996 shen et al 2020 however torkzaban et al 2013 using saturated column experiments showed that a fraction of deposited qdnps can be spontaneously detached from the sand collector surfaces without perturbation of any system condition this indicates that the qdnps deposition is a reversible process quevedo and tufenkji 2009 and torkzaban et al 2013 showed that almost all qdnps that were deposited in the presence of monovalent cations can be detached by introducing deionized di water to decrease is the rate of detachment was very fast which was comparable to that of deposition these results underline that an equilibrium partition between the solid and solution phases may be established for the qdnps although the assumption of equilibrium partition for colloids including nanoparticles and qdnps has been argued praetorius et al 2014 cornelis 2015 dale et al 2015 therefore the mechanisms controlling the deposition and transport of qdnps in porous media remain to be elucidated to date by integrating batch adsorption experiments and theoretical calculations this study specifically explored the kinetic and equilibrium interaction of cdses zns alloyed qdnps 6 nm with sand grains we revealed that the deposition of qdnps followed first and second order kinetic interactions at low and high iss respectively the deposition is a reversible process which resulted in equilibrium partition of the qdnps between the sand surfaces and solution these findings indicate that the qdnps behave more likely solutes instead of colloids and the cft that assumes irreversible first order kinetic interaction is not appropriate for modeling the adsorption of qdnps as such adsorption and desorption rather than deposition or attachment and detachment were used to describe the retention and release of qdnps respectively later in the paper to our knowledge our study was the first to show that the order of kinetic interaction of nps with collectors in porous media changed with is while the equilibrium partition for colloids e g qdnps has been argued in the literature praetorius et al 2014 cornelis 2015 dale et al 2015 shen et al 2020 we unambiguously provided experimental evidences on existence of the equilibrium partition of the qdnps 2 materials and methods 2 1 qdnps the 6 nm cdses qds with a carboxyl cooh functionalized zns 1 octadecylamine capping were purchased from sigma aldrich saint louis united states the manufacturer reports that the fluorescence emission wavelength and mass concentration of the qdnps in the stock suspension are 540 nm and 1 mg ml 1 respectively the method from treumann et al 2014 was used to prepare qdnp suspensions for batch equilibrium and kinetic experiments briefly nacl solutions with different solution iss 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m were prepared by dissolving analytical reagent grade nacl fisher scientific in di water the qds stock with a cdses zns suspension concentration of 1 mg ml 1 was diluted in the nacl solutions of different iss the qdnps concentration in the electrolyte solutions was estimated to be 10 mg l 1 the ph of the electrolyte solutions was maintained at 5 6 by adding nahco3 the zeta potentials and sizes of qdnps under different nacl concentrations were determined by measuring electrophoretic mobilities and dynamic light scattering via a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd southborough massachusetts at 25 c respectively the measured zeta potentials of the qdnps in 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m nacl solutions were 27 6 22 9 19 7 and 11 2 mv respectively see table 1 the hydrodynamic sizes of the qdnps were 21 25 48 and 54 nm in 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m nacl respectively 2 2 sand silicon quartz sand purchased from unimin corp le sueur minnesota united states was used as collector grains for the batch experiments sands with sizes ranging from 210 to 420 μm were adopted the cleaning protocol of torkzaban et al 2012 was used to purify the sand specifically the sand was soaked in 70 hno3 for 16 h then the sand was thoroughly rinsed with di water followed by five cycles of sonication 20 min per time in a water bath until the ph was equilibrated the sand was then immersed in 0 5 m nacl solution for 1 h in a sonication bath flushed with di water and finally sonicated in di water for 1 h these steps i e soaking in 0 5 m nacl solution rinsing with di water and sonication were repeated three times which were used to thoroughly remove the colloidal impurities in the sand the colloidal impurities can significantly influence the attachment detachment and concentration determination of qdnps the sand was finally rinsed with di water until the electrical conductivity of rinse water was less than 1 μs cm 1 and dried in an oven for 24 h at 105 c the treated sand was stored in a desiccator before use the method of tufenkji and elimelech 2004 was used to determine zeta potentials of the sand briefly 5 g sand was added into 50 ml electrolyte solutions at different iss and the suspension was sonicated for 5 min the supernatant was taken for the measurement the zeta potentials of the silica quartz sand in 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m nacl solutions were determined to be 59 3 48 8 22 1 and 16 8 mv respectively 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted to determine the kinetic interaction and equilibrium partition for qdnp adsorption onto silicon quartz sand these experiments were performed following the procedure of treumann et al 2014 specifically 35 g of cleaned sands and 35 ml of qdnp suspension 1 mg l 1 at different solution iss 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m were placed into 50 ml glass flasks the suspensions of the glass flasks were stirred in a flat shaker at a shaking speed of 120 rpm at 25 c then the concentration of qds nanoparticles was determined by taking 3 ml of supernatant from each batch sample at time intervals of 0 5 10 30 60 and 120 min total of 2 h and 7 samples for a given is if replicates were not accounted to determine the concentration of the qds nanoparticles each suspension of a glass flask was used only once so that the grain to solution ratios were kept consistent for all samples the optimal wavelength for qd concentration measurement was determined to be 250 nm using uv vis spectrophotometry du series 800 beckman instruments inc fullerton california control experiments in which the glass flasks containing only qdnp suspensions without sand were conducted to examine the stability of qdnps during the batch experiments we found that there was no further aggregation of the qdnps during the experiments in addition we have done batch experiments with using sand and qdnps free electrolyte solutions to check whether colloidal impurities can be released from the sand by the agitation we did not find detectable colloids in the supernatants after the sand was elaborately treated using the aforementioned cleaning method the decrease in colloidal concentration of the qd solutions in the batch systems with time was thus solely attributed to adsorption of qdnps onto the sand surfaces the amount of qdnps attached onto silicon quartz sand at time t denoted as q t mg kg 1 was calculated using the following expression 1 q t c 0 c t v w m s where c 0 is the initial qdnps concentration mg l 1 c t is the qdnps concentration at time t mg l 1 v w is the volume of the solution l and m s is the mass of sand kg equilibrium partition experiments were performed by mixing quartz sand with qdnps suspension with different concentrations 0 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l 1 in a set of 50 ml glass flasks the mixture of quartz sand and qdnps suspension was stirred for 24 h in a shaker at a speed of 120 rpm at 25 c the qdnps concentrations for the supernatant solutions were then measured the amount of qdnps adsorbed onto silicon quartz sand at equilibrium q e mg qds kg was calculated using the following expression 2 q e c 0 c e v w m s where c e is concentration of qdnps in solution at equilibrium time mg l 1 after the completion of the attachment some of the batch samples after the equilibrium experiments underwent additional experimental phase to examine the reversibility of qdnps i e desorption from sand surfaces specifically the mixture of sand and qdnps suspension were filtrated using a 2 μm membrane the sand with qdnps attached on the membrane was transfer to a flask containing qdnps free nacl solution which had the same is as that used for the equilibrium attachment the mixture was subsequently shaken for 1 min and the concentration of the released qdnps was determined the mixture was further kept for 2 h without any physical and chemical disturbance and the concentration of qdnps in the solution was again measured all batch adsorption and desorption experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure the repeatability and accuracy 2 4 equilibrium and kinetic models the langmuir freundlich and temkin models were used to simulate the equilibrium adsorption of qdnps in the sand the langmuir model assumes that the maximum adsorption corresponds to a saturated monolayer of solute molecules on the adsorbent surface with no lateral interaction between the adsorbed molecules the freundlich isotherm model is frequently used to describe the adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces and multilayer adsorption togue kamga 2018 the temkin model can also be used to describe the adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces or can account for direct adsorbate adsorbate or indirect adsorbate substrate interactions pursell et al 2011 this model assumes that the adsorption enthalpy changes linearly over the different adsorption sites on the heterogeneous surfaces or with the adsorption enthalpy due to the interactions between adsorbate and adsorbate or substrate interactions details of the expressions for these models can be found in supplementary material the pseudo first and second order and the elovich models were used to simulate the kinetic attachment of the qdnps in the sand the first order model assumes that the rate of adsorption is proportional to the number of unoccupied sites whereas the second order model considers that the rate of adsorption is related to the square of number of vacant sites on the adsorbent the second order interaction was frequently attributed to chemisorption which involves valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between the adsorbate and adsorbent francis and uchechukwu 2014 the elovich equation can also be used to describe chemisorption kinetics and adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces low 1960 detailed expressions of the first and second order kinetic and elovich models were shown in supplementary material 2 5 dlvo interaction energy calculations the dlvo interaction energies were determined to understand the attachment and detachment of qdnps on or from sand surfaces the qdnps and sand surfaces were assumed to be spherical and planar respectively the total dlvo interaction energy φτ between a qdnp and sand surface was considered to be a sum of van der waals attraction electrostatic double layer energy and born repulsion representing the short range repulsion ryan and elimelech 1996 bradford and torkzaban 2012 2013 torkzaban et al 2013 the surface element integration sei technique developed by bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 was adopted to calculate the total interaction energy for the sphere plate interaction configuration the sei technique was used because it can accurately calculate the dlvo interaction energy even for nps shen et al 2020 the value of hamaker constant for the qd water quartz system was taken to be 4 04 10 21 j torkzaban et al 2013 the calculated dlvo interaction energies were expressed in terms of kt where k is boltzmann constant and t is absolute temperature details about the use of sei technique for implementing the energy calculations can be found in supplementary material it should be noted that the qdnps were aggregated at all iss however we still used the size of the primary particles i e 6 nm for determining the interaction energies this is because lin and wiesner 2012 demonstrated that the interaction energy for an aggregate is similar to those of the primary particles of the aggregate and is significantly smaller than that of an equivalent particle of the aggregate e g defined by the gyration radius 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of qdnps and quartz sand table 1 presents sizes of qdnps and zeta potentials of the qdnps and quartz sand at different iss the sizes of qdnps increased with increasing is indicating that aggregation occurred under these chemical conditions the tendency towards aggregation for qdnps in solution has also been reported in previous studies quevedo and tufenkji 2009 2012 torkzaban et al 2010 the zeta potentials of the qdnps were less negative at higher is due to compression of the electrostatic double layer the negative zeta potential values of the qdnps and silica sand indicate unfavorable interaction conditions 3 2 kinetic interaction of qdnps with quartz sand fig 1 presents results from batch kinetic experiments by plotting the fraction of removed or adsorbed qdnps mg l 1 as a function of time at different iss the adsorption increased with increasing solution is the results are in agreement with the prediction by the energy calculations because increasing is decreases repulsive energy barriers and accordingly increases qdnps adsorption at primary minima fig 2 the repulsive energy barrier even completely disappears at 0 1 and 0 2 m indicating that the qdnps are favorable to be attached at primary minima at the two high iss the primary minimum depth is higher at 0 2 m than at 0 1 m see table 1 accordingly the qdnps experience higher adhesion at 0 2 m than at 0 1 m causing more adsorption the secondary minimum depth is extremely small at all iss 0 01 kt which is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of a colloid i e 1 5 kt therefore the qdnps cannot be adsorbed at such shallow secondary minima due to brownian diffusion note that the average kinetic energy of a qndp is also 1 5 kt as common colloids because all molecules and colloids have the same average translational kinetic energy according to the law of equipartition of energy among the degrees of freedom sonntag and strenge 1987 i e 3 1 2 m v 2 3 2 kt where m is mass of the molecules or colloids including quantum dots and v is the average velocity fig 1 shows that the adsorption of qdnps was initially very fast at is 0 1 m and the adsorption rate was then gradually decreased the adsorption reached quasi steady state at about 60 min as shown above the energy calculations showed that the repulsive energy barrier is absent at the two iss therefore transport over the repulsive energy barrier was not the rate limiting step controlling the adsorption rate instead the interaction of the surface with the qdnps e g chemisorption governed the adsorption rate the decrease of adsorption rate was likely due to blocking camesano et al 1999 specifically at the initial stage of qdnps adsorption the adsorbed qdnps on collector surfaces were sparingly distributed which did not have evident influence for the further adsorption of incoming qdnps from bulk solution the interactions between the adsorbed qdnps and the incoming qdnps became significant with increasing accumulation of qdnps on the collector surfaces the adsorbed qdnps prevented subsequent qdnps adsorption if the interaction between the adsorbed qdnps and incoming qdnps was unfavorable resulting in decreased rate of adsorption with time fig 1 shows that the adsorption kinetics of qdnps at 0 01 m was different from that at 0 1 m the adsorption increases at a nearly constant rate at the low iss the interaction energy calculations in fig 2 shows that repulsive energy barrier existed at 0 01 and 0 001 m the transport over the repulsive energy barrier was likely the step controlling the adsorption ruckenstein and prieve 1976 showed that if particle deposition is controlled by the transport over a repulsive energy barrier the deposition follows first order kinetic interaction fig 3 present modeling results of the kinetic adsorption data in fig 1 using the pseudo first the second order kinetic and the elovich equations the first order model described the kinetic adsorption at 0 001 and 0 01 m better than the second order model in contrast the second order equation was better to describe the kinetic data at 0 1 and 0 2 m than the other two models the modeling results confirmed the aforementioned interpretations using dlvo interaction energy calculations specifically the adsorption of the qdnps at low iss conformed to the first order kinetics indicating that the reactants i e qndps are excessive compared to the adsorption sites simonin 2016 xiao et al 2018 this is reasonable because only the surface sites e g at heterogeneities where the interaction energy barriers were reduced to be comparable to or smaller than the average kinetic energy of colloid can result in the adsorption the adsorption of the qdnps at high iss conformed to the second order kinetics revealing that the adsorption was controlled by the reaction of the qdnps with surfaces instead of diffusion due to absence of repulsive energy barriers chemisorption may be responsible for the second order kinetics of adsorption at high iss yan et al 2010 long 2013 note that previous studies saiers et al 1994 babakhani et al 2017 showed that the blocking can also results in a second order colloid deposition kinetics therefore blocking may also play a role in controlling colloid adsorption at the two high iss table 2 presents determined parameter values for the first and second order kinetic model and elovich model for qdnps adsorption in quartz sand in nacl at different iss the determined amount of adsorbed qdnps q e from second order kinetic model were close to the experimental observations at 0 1 and 0 2 m while the calculated values of q e by the first order model were significantly different compared to the experimental values at the two iss in contrast the calculated values of q e using first order model was approximately equal to the experimental values at the two low iss the modeling results further confirm that the adsorption of qdnps conformed to first order kinetics at 0 001 and 0 01 m and second order kinetics at 0 1 and 0 2 m 3 3 equilibrium partition fig 4 presents the equilibrium adsorption isotherms for qdnps in quartz sand at different iss similar to the kinetic adsorption data in fig 1 the adsorption increased with increasing solution is due to increased retention in primary minima by reducing repulsive energy barriers or increasing primary minimum depth the adsorption of qdnps onto quartz sand increased with increasing initial qdnp concentration from 0 5 to 10 mg l 1 the adsorption reached maximum when the equilibrium concentration of qdnps in solution was 5 mg l 1 at all solution iss the result indicates that the retention of qdnps was not an irreversible first order kinetics as assumed by the cft this is because all the qdnps would be adsorbed in sand i e the concentration of qdnps in solution would reach zero before reaching the maximum adsorption at a given is if the adsorption follows irreversible first order kinetics however there always existed a fraction of qdnps in solution after equilibrium even if the initial qdnps concentration was low there results unambiguously showed that the retention of qdnps was irreversible at least partially the results in fig 4 also indicate that the desorption rate was higher at a lower solution is therefore the equilibrium concentrations of qdnps in solution at the low iss e g 0 001 and 0 01 m can be even comparable to those at high solution iss although the amounts of adsorption were much smaller at the low iss the energy calculations in fig 2 can explain the more desorption at low solution iss specifically althought the primary minimum depth and accordingly the adhesion were larger at low iss the attractive primary wells were narrow i e the range of separation distances corresponding to the attractive primary minimum energies were small once the qdnps mobilize out of the attractive repulsive energy wells or overcome the detachment energy barriers by brownian diffusion the qdnps will experience repulsive dlvo forces denoted by the monotonic decrease of interaction energy with separation distance when the separation distance is larger than that corresponds to the maximum repulsive energy barrier and transport back to the bulk solution in contrast the attractive primary energy wells expand very long at the high iss the qdnps experience attractive forces at all separation distances and thus are not readily to escape back to the solution by brownian diffusion figs 5 present simulations of the adsorption isotherms for qdnp adsorption at different iss using langmuir freundlich and temkin equations the values of model parameters were shown in table 3 the langmuir model showed the best simulations compared to the other two models as indicated by the values of r 2 very close to 1 as mentioned previously the langmuir model assumes that maximum adsorption corresponds to a saturated monolayer of molecules on the adsorbent surface the modeling results suggest that ripening i e adsorption of qdnps onto the qdnps already adsorbed on the surfaces should not be significant in contrast the results in fig 1 show that blocking likely played an important role in the adsorption as discussed previously the equilibrium parameter r l can be used to indicate the adsorption mechanisms the adsorption is favorable and unfavorable if 0 r l 1 and r l 1 respectively the adsorption is linear and irreversible if r l 1 and r l 0 respectively the calculated values of r l were between 0 and 1 at the four solution iss indicating that the adsorption was favorable and not irreversible 3 4 desorption of qdnps in quartz sand fig 6 presents the desorption of qdnps after the kinetic adsorption experiments a fraction of qdnps was released back to the solution even without disturbance of chemical conditions more qdnps were released back into the solution when the samples were further kept for 2 h without any physical and chemical disturbances the results unambiguously verify that a fraction of qdnps was reversibly adsorbed and the desorption can occur without any system disturbance the observed reversibility of the qdnps confirmed the aforementioned theoretical modeling results of r l the energy calculations in fig 2 show that the detachment energy barriers from primary minimum or primary minimum depths were comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid therefore the qdnps can be released back to the bulk solution by brownian diffusion previous studies bradford and torkzaban 2013 shen et al 2012b 2012c 2020 showed that the presence of nanoscale surface roughness on collector surfaces can decrease the primary minimum depth and thus increase the detachment from the primary minimum atomic force microscopic afm examinations showed that the sand surfaces are always physically heterogeneous at nanoscale shen et al 2020 and the nanoscale surface roughness may enhance the desorption observed in fig 4 the desorption was more at a lower is in agreement with observations in fig 3 as mentioned previously the primary energy well spans more narrowly at a low is and accordingly the qdnps are more readily to escape from the energy well to bulk solution although colloids attached at secondary minima can also detach by brownian diffusion wang et al 2016a 2016b the qdnps should not be immobilized at the secondary minima because they are significantly smaller than the average kinetic energy of a colloid 3 5 implications the classic cft considers that deposition of colloids including nps and qdnps is an irreversible process and follows first order kinetics specifically the cft considers the so called perfect sink model to simulate the boundary condition of colloid deposition at a collector surface ryan and elimelech 1996 the perfect sink model assumes that all colloids approaching at the collector surface are irreversibly captured by a very fast immobilization interaction this means that the colloids are consumed in an infinite energy sink and disappear from the system this assumption is reasonable when the primary energy well is deep because the depth of primary minimum is proportional to the adhesive force that the colloids accordingly the cft correctly predicts the trend for the deposition of colloids under favorable conditions molnar et al 2015 the deposition of colloids under unfavorable conditions has also been considered as a first order kinetic interaction because transport over the repulsive energy barrier is the rate limiting step which was considered to follow first order kinetics ruckenstein and prieve 1976 therefore the use of other mechanisms such as equilibrium partition to simulate deposition was argued praetorius et al 2014 cornelis 2015 dale et al 2015 however various studies babakhani et al 2017 shen et al 2020 revealed that colloid deposition can be simulated using equilibrium partition model because equilibrium could form for colloid concentration between secondary minimum or shallow primary energy minimum e g due to nanoscale surface roughness and bulk solution our study showed that the primary minima were comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid at all solution iss for qdnps even without considering nanoscale surface roughness hence equilibrium partition can form for concentrations of qdnps between solid phase and bulk solution as confirmed by the batch experiments our study also showed that the adsorption of qdnps followed second order kinetics at high solution iss rather than first order kinetic as assumed by the cft these results have important implication to accurate modeling of fate and transport of qdnps in subsurface environments 4 conclusions through conducting batch experiments our work unambiguously showed that the qdnps behave more likely solutes specifically the adsorption of qdnps in sand was a reversible process even without any disturbance of system condition this is because the primary minimum depths of qdnps were comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid at all iss and the qdnps adsorbed at the shallow primary energy wells can escape by brownian diffusion the reversible adsorption resulted in equilibrium partition of qdnps between solid phase and bulk solution as confirmed by batch equilibrium experiments the batch kinetic experiments show that the adsorption of qdnps followed first and secondary order interaction kinetics at low and high solution iss respectively there results showed the failure of using cft for modeling the transport of qdnps in porous media alternatively it is necessary to consider empirical models used for describing solute transport to simulate qdnp transport in porous media as done for solutes author statement we declare that our work described has not
