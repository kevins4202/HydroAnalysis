16375,bisphenol e bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane bpe as a typical endocrine disrupting chemical is commonly detected in source water and drinking water which poses potential risks to human health and ecological environment this paper investigated the removal of bpe by ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi in water under the optimal condition of fe vi 0 bpe 0 10 1 and ph 8 0 a removal efficiency of 99 was achived in 180 s sixteen intermediates of bpe were detected and four possible reaction pathways were proposed which mainly involved the reaction modes of double oxygen and single oxygen transfer bond breaking carboxylation and polymerization the double oxygen transfer mechanism different from traditional mechanisms was newly proposed to illustrate the direct generation of di hydroxylated products from parent bpe which was demonstrated by theoretical calculations for its rationality significantly no2 hco3 cu2 and humic acid constituents of water promoted the removal of bpe additionally samples from river tap water synthetic wastewater and secondary effluent were tested to explore the feasibility of fe vi oxidation for treating bpe in water it was found that 99 of bpe was degraded within 300 s in these waters except for synthetic wastewater the toxicity of bpe and its intermediates was evaluated by ecosar program and the results showed that fe vi oxidation decreased the toxicity of reaction solutions these findings demonstrated that the fe vi oxidation process was an efficient and green method for the treatment of bpe and the new insights into the double oxygen transfer mechanism aid to understand the reaction mechanisms of organic pollutants oxidized by fe vi keywords ferrate vi bisphenol e double oxygen transfer theoretical calculation toxicity assessment 1 introduction endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are typical environmental hormones that have become an issue of high environmental concern they are harmful to organisms even at low doses and have been associated with toxic effects on nervous immune and reproductive systems fujiwara et al 2018 casals casas and desvergne 2011 as one class of the most widely studied edcs bisphenols are commonly used monomers in the production of polycarbonates that are widely applied in various industrial activities due to their excellent performance in recent years the use of bisphenol a bpa has been banned in several counties chen et al 2016 due to the similar properties bisphenol e bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane bpe has become a substitute for bpa to be used as raw materials in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins bpe has been detected in source waters drinking water and bottled water although at concentrations lower than bpa zhang et al 2019 known data showed that the average inlet concentration of bpe in wastewater treatment plants in xiamen city of china was about 4 51 ng l coha et al 2021 bpe can be enriched in organisms and the acute toxicity and estrogen activity of bpe were reported to be comparable to that of bisphenol a lee et al 2004 the 24h ec50 of bpe to daphnia magna was measured as 36 mg l and significant estrogenic activity was observed in a bpe concentration range of 10 6 10 4 m chen et al 2002 ji et al 2013 lee et al 2013 given the potential hazards to human health and ecological environment much attention should be paid to the efficient removal of bpe in environment many methods have been proposed to treat bpa in the environment but few for the treatment of bpe wang et al 2006 investigated the degradation of bpe in a tio2 photocatalytic reaction system and found that β cyclodextrin could enhance the photocatalytic degradation of bpe under the irradiation of near uv light moreover the reactivity and decomposition of bpe was examined in high temperature liquid water and the results showed that the conversion of bpe was essentially completed in 60 min at 350 c with phenol as the major product savage et al 2006 in a more recent study microorganism consortia isolated from river water and activated sludge showed a degradation efficiency of no more than 50 for bpe after 50 days of experiment suggesting that bpe is resistant to biodegradation frankowski et al 2020 in general these existing technologies for the removal of bpe from aqueous solutions have limitations such as low degradation efficiency and secondary pollution therefore it is particularly urgent and significant to develop a green and efficient technology to deal with bpe pollution in water environments recently ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi has received much research attention for its use as a green agent for water purification yang et al 2014 fe vi is reduced to ferric oxide hydroxide in the reaction process which can be used as an inorganic flocculant to remove suspended matter in water effectively moreover fe vi shows great potential in treating refractory organic substances and has been applied to oxidize a variety of aqueous organic pollutants including pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products karlesa et al 2014 sharma et al 2013 it was generally found that fe vi may directly attack pollutants through 1 e transfer 2 e transfer and oxygen atom transfer and fe vi itself was converted to fe v and fe iv during the oxidation processes sharma et al 2015 hu et al 2009 more specifically fe vi has been used to remove some bisphenols in aqueous solutions in a comparative study of fe vi oxidation of edcs li et al 2008 observed that bpa was more difficult to remove by fe vi than four other steroid estrogens but it could be completely degraded in less than 300 s under studied conditions it was found that bisphenol f bpf was highly reactive with fe vi and when the molar ratio of fe vi to bpf was 20 1 the toxicity of bpf could be effectively eliminated by the fe vi oxidation yang et al 2020 hence fe vi is expected to be an effective treatment method for the elimination of bpe pollution in recent years the computational chemistry simulation based on first principles or empirical methods has been extensively applied to predict the transformation behavior of pollutants he et al 2021 in this context we systematically studied for the first time the degradation process and the reaction mechanism of bpe by fe vi in aqueous solutions first the effects solution ph on the removal of bpe were studied to obtain the optimal reaction conditions then reaction intermediates of bpe were identified by liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry lc tof ms from which possible reaction pathways were proposed moreover theoretical calculations were performed on the gaussian 09 software to demonstrate the rationality of proposed reaction mechanisms in addition the removal efficiencies of bpe in natural water samples were measured to examine the practical application of fe vi oxidation and the influence of water components such as common cations anions and dissolved organic matter were considered finally the ecosar program was used to evaluate the toxicity of reaction intermediates generated during the fe vi oxidation process this research may provide critical information for treating bpe in waters and wastewaters the research presented herein will aid in advancing the understanding on the reaction mechanism of fe vi oxidation of bisphenol compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals detailed information of chemicals used in this study are given in text s1 2 2 oxidation experiments batch degradation experiments were performed in a series of 50 0 ml conical flasks at room temperature 25 0 c with a stirring speed of 500 rpm the total volume of reaction solutions was 30 0 ml and 20 0 mm borate buffer was used to maintain solution ph within 0 1 range a desired volume of bpe stock was diluted with borate buffer to prepare the reaction solutions and then an aliquot of freshly prepared ferrate solution was added to initiate the reaction under stirring after 0 5 10 15 30 60 and 180 s 900 μl of reaction solution was taken out and mixed with 100 μl of 0 2 m sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 to terminate the reaction lim and kim 2009 then samples were centrifuged at 12 000 r min for 5 0 min to remove suspended solids and the supernatant was transferred into a hplc vial for subsequent hplc analysis samples 3 0 ml were collected to measure the concentration of residual fe vi by uv spectrophotometry all experiments were done in triplicate kinetic experiments were carried out under different oxidant concentrations and ph in addition natural water samples were also used to study the universal applicability of fe vi in different waters the tap water tw river water rw and secondary effluent se were collected from nanjing tap water general company nanjing china jiuxiang river nanjing china and xianlin sewage treatment plant nanjing china respectively synthetic wastewater sw was prepared to simulate wastewaters from chemical pharmaceutical industry according to the method of babic et al babic et al 2013 after passing through 0 45 μm glass fiber membranes gf f waterman maidstone u k these water samples were stored at 4 c for use and the detailed physiochemical parameters were shown in table s1 another batch of experiments were performed for the identification of products at different reaction times 3 0 ml of 0 2 m na2s2o3 was directly added into 30 0 ml of reaction solutions to quench the reaction then reaction solutions were purified and concentrated through solid phase extraction spe method using cnwbond lcc18 spe cartridges 2 ca0955 0001 1 0 g 6 0 ml which were eluted with 2 0 ml of methanol for subsequent lc ms analysis 2 3 analytic methods the bpe was quantified by using a hitachi l 2100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc instrument reaction intermediates were identified by an agilent 1260 infinity hplc system coupled with a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof x500r ab sciex usa the detailed information of hplc and lc tof ms methods were shown in text s2 and text s3 the residual concentration of fe vi was measured by recording the absorbance at 510 nm using tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd beijing china 2 4 theoretical calculations theoretical calculations were performed with density functional theory dft method at the m062x lanl2dz level using the gaussian 09 software package to rationalize the proposed reaction pathways frisch et al 2015 wu et al 2021 r y xiao et al 2020 the solvent effect was solved using quantum self consistent reaction field scrf method the geometric structures of reaction species including reactants res transition states tss intermediates ims and products prs were optimized with subsequent frequency analysis to obtain the minimum energy on the potential energy surface wu et al 2020 as for the search of tss a relaxed scan on the length of the chemical bond broken formed in the reaction was first performed by the coordinate driving method to obtain the approximate structure then the initial guess structure based newton raphson method was used to calculate the precise structure of tss finally intrinsic reaction coordinate irc calculations were conducted to verify that all tss were connected to reactants and the corresponding products on the potential energy surface fukui 1981 after the gaussian work the output files were searched to calculate the energy difference δe between the tss prs and the res 2 5 toxicity evaluation the toxicity of bpe and its intermediates to three representative aquatic species was predicted by the ecosar program which were verified and extensively used by the us epa oecd and eu andreozzi et al 2008 the acute toxicity was expressed as the half lethal concentration lc50 for fish and water flea daphnia spp and the half effective concentration ec50 for green algae 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics the degradation of bpe by fe vi under excess concentration of fe vi was investigated as a function of time at different ph ph 7 0 10 0 fig s1 the results observed in the study were plotted ln bpe t bpe 0 versus fe vi t fig 1 a a linear relationship was observed at studied ph r2 0 99 and the slope gave the second order rate constant k app at different ph the values of k app decreased from 1 3 0 03 103 m 1 s 1 to 2 2 0 04 102 m 1 s 1 as the ph increase from 7 0 to 10 0 fig 1b this suggests fe vi is more effective in removing bpe at lower ph i e ph 7 0 than at higher ph i e ph 10 0 fe vi has higher redox potential under acidic conditions than at basic conditions sharma 2011 and therefore giving higher ability to oxidize bpe at ph 7 0 the trend in k app as a function ph may be described by considering the equilibrium species of ferrate vi h3feo4 h h2feo4 pk a1 1 9 h2feo4 h hfeo4 pk a2 3 5 hfeo4 h feo4 2 pk a3 7 23 sharma et al 2001a and bpe pk a1 10 10 wang et al 2018 in the studied ph range fe vi exists mainly as hfeo4 and feo4 2 and bpe has also two species protonated and un protonated species written as bpe and bpe and following reactions take place eqs 1 4 1 hfeo 4 bpe products k 1 2 feo 4 2 bpe products k 2 3 hfeo 4 bp e products k 3 4 feo 4 2 bp e products k 2 the values of k app may be expressed by eq 5 5 k app k 1 α hfeo 4 β bpe k 2 α feo 4 2 β bpe k 3 α hfeo 4 β bp e k 4 α feo 4 2 β bp e where αhfeo4 10 ph 10 ph 10 7 23 and αfeo4 2 10 7 23 10 ph 10 7 23 βbpe 10 ph 10 ph 10 10 1 and βbpe 10 10 1 10 ph 10 10 1 the values of αhfeo4 αfeo4 2 βbpe and βbpe were calculated at different ph and the experimental data in fig 1b were fitted using eq 5 it was found that experimental data could be fit nicely using only the reactions 1 and 2 r2 0 97 the solid line in fig 1b the species specific rate constants for reactions 1 and 2 were obtained as 1 7 0 1 103 m 1 s 1 and 4 7 0 6 102 m 1 s 1 the protonated form of fe vi i e hfeo4 reacted about four times faster with protonated bpe than did the un protonated fe vi i e feo4 2 the fraction of hfeo4 αhfeo4 decreases with increases in ph causing the rates of the oxidation of bpe by fe vi decreased fig 1b many studies have shown similar trend for the oxidation pollutants kim et al 2015 sharma et al 2005 yngard et al 2007 it has been shown that protonated fe vi may have stronger free radical character on the oxygen atoms to oxidize with pollutants terryn et al 2017 based on the results of fig 1b the application of fe vi is suitable for neutral and weak alkaline conditions considering the overall removal and possible practical applications subsequent experiments were carried out at ph 8 0 in addition the decomposition of fe vi would generate fe iv fe v which may also contribute to the decomposition of bpe the quenching experiment was conducted using pmso as a scavenger the results were shown in fig s2 which showed that fe iv fe v makes some contribution to pollutants oxidation but fe vi still played a dominant role in the degradation of bpe which led to 76 removal of the substrate 3 2 identification of transformation products and possible reaction pathways the reaction intermediates of bpe oxidized by fe vi were tentatively identified sixteen products were detected and their detailed ms information and fragmentation patterns in the ms ms spectra are given in table s2 and fig s3 it was worth noting that the difference of the measured mass and the theoretical mass was always 5 ppm which ensured the high reliability in proposed molecular formulas structures of oxidation intermediates were further determined through analyzing parent ions in total ion current tic chromatogram and fragment ions in ms ms spectra fig 2 illustrated the evolution profiles of bpe reaction products over time which was obtained by recording peak areas of the extracted ion chromatogram xic and could be used to analyze the possible formation sequence of the products according to the identified products and previous studies on bpe and its structure analogue bpa li et al 2008 pozdnyakov et al 2011 chen et al 2019 four possible pathways for the oxidation of bpe by fe vi are proposed in fig 3 as seen five main reaction modes i e double oxygen transfer single oxygen transfer bond breaking carboxylation and polymerization were involved in the oxidation process among them both single oxygen transfer and double oxygen transfer could give hydroxylation products most notably the detailed product analysis allowed to propose for the first time that fe vi could directly oxidize bisphenol compounds to produce di hydroxylated products by the double oxygen transfer pathway i was initiated by the hydroxylation of the parent molecule during fe vi oxidation followed by subsequent oxidation reactions to form a series of intermediates p4 p11 as seen in fig 3 in the pathway i b single oxygen transfer of bpe occurred to generate the mono hydroxylated product p7 which could undergo further hydroxylation to form the di hydroxylated product p4 b the single oxygen transfer is accepted as a well known mechanism for the generation of hydroxylation products in the fe vi oxidation process chen et al 2019 however a previous study has shown that hydroxyl radicals oh can be formed from the self decomposition of fe vi in aqueous solution lee et al 2005 moreover chen et al 2018 also detected the signal of oh in fe vi solution by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra thus direct attack of oh on bpe might also be another mechanism to produce hydroxylated intermediates in a parallel way two adjacent hydroxyl groups in p7 were oxidized to the quinone type intermediate p8 which then underwent ring opening reaction to give the product p9 p7 p8 p9 it has been reported that the aromatic compounds containing two ortho oh groups could be oxidized more easily and then the benzene ring was opened to generate carboxylic acid type intermediates jiang et al 2015 similarly p4 b was oxidized into p10 and then the ring opening product p11 as seen in fig 2c p9 and p11 accumulated to the maximum at 30 s followed with a gradual decline indicating that they might eventually disappear over time due to the transformation into small molecular weight acids besides the mass abundance of the di hydroxylated product p4 was significantly higher than that of the mono hydroxylated product p7 and a large amount of p4 was observed at the time the reaction initiated fig 2a and fig 2d which indicated that p4 could be generated more quickly and easier than p7 therefore it was reasonable to propose that there was another mechanism of hydroxylation in fe vi oxidation in addition to the single oxygen transfer or the direct attack of oh mentioned above pathway i a illustrates this double oxygen transfer mechanism of fe vi for the direct generation of product p4 a from bpe then p4 a could undergo sequential mono hydroxylation reaction to produce a polyhydroxylated compound p6 p4 a p5 p6 or it was directly converted to p6 through a double oxygen transfer of fe vi the double oxygen transfer mechanism was firstly proposed in fe vi oxidation of bisphenols which would be further verified by gaussian program for its possibility to generate di hydroxylated products directly from the parent compound see section 3 3 for details fig 2b showed that the content of p6 was gradually increased during the reaction period of 180 s however due to the presence of ortho oh groups it seems likely that p6 may undergo ring opening reaction and ultimately be mineralized into co2 and h2o to reduce the toxicity of reaction solutions in pathway ⅱ fe vi attacked the cc bond bridging the two benzene rings in bpe molecule resulting in the production of two monocyclic products p12 and p13 subsequently p13 was oxidized into the ketone compound p14 in addition carboxylated products were detected with a high mass response it was speculated in pathway ⅲ that the sequential carboxylation of bpe occurred to form the product p16 bpe p15 p16 the p15 and p16 showed a similar polygonal line type variation trend but the turning point of p16 appeared later than that of p15 which proved that p16 was derived from p15 according to previous studies this carboxylation reaction may occur through the kolbe schmitt reaction mechanism or the carbon dioxide anion radicals co2 initiated radical addition mechanism markovic et al 2007 neta et al 1988 thus moiety of dissolved hco3 may be bonded to organic molecules to generate the corresponding carboxylation products during fe vi oxidation process the pathway ⅳ mainly described the polymerization reaction as an oxidizing agent fe vi can abstract a hydrogen atom from different positions of bpe to form radicals r1 and r2 chen et al 2019 meanwhile the phenolic radical r3 could also be formed after the cc bond breaking in bpe these free radicals could couple with each other to produce dimers the cross coupling of r1 with r2 yielded the product p1 while r2 coupled with r3 to generate p2 as for the product p3 it was produced by the self coupling of r3 as shown in fig 3a c and d the largest peak area of p1 and p2 were observed in 5 s while the content of p3 reached the maximum at 30 s subsequently these products were oxidized by fe vi following the reactions described in pathways ⅰ ⅲ and accordingly their relative contents were decreased this phenomenon indicated that the polymerization reaction occurs rapidly but the polymerization products could not exist for a long time 3 3 theoretical calculations on double oxygen transfer mechanism in section 3 2 it was speculated that fe vi oxidized bpe directly to produce di hydroxylated products by the double oxygen transfer mechanism in order to rationalize this newly proposed oxidation mechanism of fe vi theoretical calculations were carried out in recent years theoretical calculations have been applied as a successful tool to reveal the reaction pathways and mechanisms between organic contaminants and oxidants r y xiao et al 2020 pan et al 2018 qu et al 2018 in this work density functional theory dft calculations were conducted at the m062x lanl2dz level to evaluate the feasibility of the double oxygen transfer for fe vi oxidizing bpe to form the di hydroxylated products and the energy profiles for all the elementary reactions involved are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 first with the opening of the two fe vi o bonds fe vi attacked the two adjacent c 5 and c 6 atoms on the benzene ring of bpe forming the five membered ring adduct intermediate of fe vi o c c o im1 with an energy barrier of 42 72 kj mol the im1 was structurally unstable which can be hydrolyzed twice to produce the intermediate im3 the corresponding δe of these two hydrolysis reactions were calculated to be 8 05 kj mol and 33 28 kj mol respectively after hydrolysis two o atoms from fe vi combined with two h atoms from h2o to form the oh groups in im3 meanwhile it was important to note that fe vi was converted to fe iv directly without the involvement of fe v in this process then another fe vi grabbed the two original h atoms at c 5 and c 6 sites of im3 to finally give the di hydroxylated product pr through the hydrogen abstraction reaction during which fe vi was reduced into fe iv once again based on the calculations the activation energy of the hydrogen abstraction step was 17 33 kj mol in short the di hydroxylated product p4 was formed in four steps of reaction and meanwhile two molecules of fe iv were generated by the consumption of same amount of fe vi the calculation results above proved that the double oxygen transfer mechanism of fe iv was reasonable which helps to reveal the oxidation mechanisms of other organic compounds by fe iv treatment moreover the energy profiles for single oxygen transfer mechanism was also considered for comparison in the pathway of the single oxygen transfer fe vi first attacked the c 6 atom forming an intermediate which was subsequently hydrolyzed to obtain the mono hydroxylated product p7 with the simultaneous generation of one molecule of fe iv fig s4 since the rate determining step for the double oxygen transfer mechanism was the initial process of fe vi attacking on two adjacent c atoms of bpe only the first step of fe vi attack was calculated for single oxygen transfer as seen a much higher activation energy of 50 70 kj mol was needed for the attack of fe vi on c 6 atom fig s4 confirming that the double oxygen transfer was more prone than single oxygen transfer 3 4 removal of bpe 3 4 1 effect of fe vi dosage in water the effect of fe vi dosage on the removal of bpe was investigated and the result are shown in fig 5 d the reactions were carried out at the bpe concentration of 20 0 μm and the solution ph of 8 0 and the molar ratios of fe vi 0 bpe 0 were set as 5 1 10 1 15 1 and 20 1 as seen from fig 5d the increase in the concentration of fe vi ions in the solution improved the removal efficiency of bpe when the fe vi 0 bpe 0 molar ratio was in the range from 10 1 to 20 1 bpe in solutions was completely removed at 180 s the results sugest that the optimal oxidant dosage for bpe degradation by fe vi was fe vi 0 bpe 0 10 1 at ph 8 0 3 4 2 effect of inorganic ions inorganic ions are ubiquitously present in wastewaters and natural waters which may affect the oxidation of organic pollutants during advanced oxidation processes in this work we first investigated the effects of common anions cl no3 no2 hco3 and cations mg2 ca2 cu2 fe3 on the degradation of bpe by fe vi the experiments were carried out under the condition of ph 8 0 with an initial bpe concentration of 20 0 μm and the molar ratio of fe vi 0 bpe 0 5 1 considering the actual concentrations in different waters the ions were used at two concentrations of 0 5 mm and 5 0 mm fig 5a b and fig s5 showed the degradation efficiencies of bpe by fe vi in presence of different inorganic ions sodium salts were used to examine the effects of anions as presented in fig 5a cl and no3 had little effect on the degradation of bpe by fe vi which was consistent with the results of feng et al 2016 and lee and von gunten 2010 the removal efficiency of bpe was promoted by no2 and the promoting effect was further enhanced with the increase of no2 concentration fig s5 li et al 2020 also observed a similar phenomenon during the ozonation of polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides according to previous studies fe vi can react with no2 to form fe ⅳ species which are much more reactive than parent fe vi for the removal of trimethoprim tmp feng et al 2018 sharma and bielski 2002 therefore the promoted degradation of bpe observed in this work was possibly attributed to the formation of reactive fe ⅳ species similar to no2 hco3 could also promote the removal efficiency of bpe luo et al 2019 found that bicarbonate can stabilize the intermediate fe v species produced from fe vi via complexation and the prolonged lifetime of fe v would contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants in addition the influence of cations especially metal ions on the oxidation process were also examined chloride salts were selected to inspect the effects of cation fig 5b illustrated that two cations mg2 and ca2 had negligible effects on the degradation of bpe by fe vi by contrast cu2 and fe3 significantly enhanced the removal of bpe by fe vi the removal efficiency of bpe after 60 s was increased from 74 to 80 and 78 in solutions containing 0 5 mm cu2 and fe3 respectively when the concentration of cu2 or fe3 was increased to 5 0 mm more than 99 of bpe in reaction solutions could be removed by fe vi in 60 s fig s5 in the presence of fe3 its redox reaction with feo4 2 could occur to form intermediate state fe ⅳ and fe ⅴ species which played positive roles in oxidation aggregation and flocculation of solid oxidants to promote the oxidation ability of fe vi jointly li et al 2005 sharma et al 2001b 3 4 3 effect of ha humic acid ha is a major component of dissolved organic matter in water environments which could exert some influence on the transformation behavior of organic pollutants qi et al 2019 generally the concentration of ha in waters is about 10 0 mg l accounting for 50 90 of the total organic matter ge et al 2007 in addition to forming complex with most heavy metals ha can also be oxidized by most oxidants in water treatment thus ha was chosen as a representative to investigate the influence of organic matter on the degradation of bpe by fe vi in waters three different concentrations of ha 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l were set to study the effect on bpe removal under experimental conditions of bpe 20 0 μm fe vi 0 bpe 0 5 1 ph 8 0 and t 25 0 c as presented in fig 5c ha exerted a significant promotion on the degradation of bpe by fe vi but the promoting effect was only slightly changed with the increasing concentration of ha similar to the results zheng et al 2021 also observed a promoting effect of ha on fe vi oxidation of 4 tert butylphenol in general ha was expected to cause decreased removal efficiency of organic pollutants due to competitive consumption of fe vi horst et al 2013 however previous studies have shown that oxidation mediators such as phenoxy radicals or benzoquinone like compounds are produced during the oxidation of ha by fe vi which would subsequently cross couple with pollutant molecules to enhance their transformation sun et al 2017 dong et al 2017 with the more generation of these reactive species the oxidation of bpe was largely promoted at higher ha concentrations 3 4 4 degradation in different water matrices the composition of natural waters is very complex containing various inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter in order to evaluate the feasibility of fe vi oxidation for real applications the degradation experiments of bpe were carried out in four kinds of waters including river water rw tap water tw synthetic wastewater sw and secondary effluent se as shown in fig 5e bpe was degraded by more than 95 after 180 s in all water matrices except sw the oxidation of bpe continued after 180 s and more than 99 of bpe was removed at 300 s in all water matrices except sw the largest removal of bpe was observed in rw possibly because rw has a stronger buffer capacity to inhibit the increase of solution ph caused by the reaction after 300 s of reaction the ph of rw reaction solution changed little and the final ph was close to 8 0 which was lower than the ph values in other water samples table s3 as for the lower degradation efficiency of sw degradation rate 87 there are two possible reasons 1 no buffer was used in the experiment in natural water matrices the ph of sw solution reached 9 2 after reaction which was not conductive to the oxidation of bpe 2 sw contains more reducing substances or organic compounds such as the citric acid ascorbic acid and saccharose which could compete with bpe for fe vi the experimental result in fig s6 showed that the addition of citric acid ascorbic acid and saccharose caused obvious inhibition of the degradation which explained the adverse effects observed in sw thus fe vi could remove more than 99 of bpe in natural waters within 300 s however the degradation efficiency of bpe was slightly inhibited in pharmaceutical industry wastewater which contains a large amount of reducing substances and organic compounds in general the application of fe vi oxidation for treating the pollution of bisphenols in actual waters is suitable 3 4 5 kinetics of bpe at a low concentration by referring to the concentration of bisphenol a in industrial effluent we selected some appropriate concentrations of bpe 1 0 μm 0 5 μm and 0 1 μm to simulate the degradation of bpe at the environmental concentration furhacker et al 2000 as presented fig 5 f bpe of 1 0 μm 0 5 μm and 0 1 μm could be degraded more than 92 at 300 s when fe vi 0 bpe 0 was 50 1 80 1 and 200 1 respectively which indicated that fe vi can effectively degrade bpe rapidly at environmental concentrations 3 5 toxicity assessment in recent years the ecosar program has been widely used to evaluate the toxicity of organic compounds in water treatment process feng et al 2016 in this work the acute and chronic toxicity of bpe and its degradation products to three aquatic species fish daphnia and green algae were estimated by the ecosar program the toxicity classification of intermediates was conducted according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals the changes in the toxicity of reaction solutions to fish daphnia and green algae associated with the transformation of bpe into reaction intermediates through different pathways are shown in fig 6 fig s7 and fig s8 respectively in general the toxicity of reaction intermediates from pathways i iii was decreased to varying degrees compared with the parent bpe molecule when it comes to pathway iv the low solubility of polymeric products might limit the accurate predictions of the toxicity data by the ecosar program in addition the polymeric products were almost completely degraded within 180 s see in fig 2 so it seemed less important to evaluate their toxicity to sum up the oxidation of fe vi reduced the environmental toxicity of bpe which was significant for the ecological and environmental protection in the chemical treatment process in this sense fe vi can be used as a green and effective oxidant to treat waters and wastewaters containing bisphenol compounds 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that the fe vi oxidation process is an efficient and green method for the removal of bpe in aqueous solutions under optimal reaction conditions of fe vi 0 bpe 0 10 1 ph 8 0 and reaction temperature 25 0 c and 20 0 μm bpe could be almost completely removed by fe vi in 180 s the k app decreased with increase in ph hence the removal of bpe by fe vi a total of sixteen reaction intermediates of bpe were identified by the high reaction technique four pathways were proposed which mainly involved the double oxygen transfer single oxygen transfer bond breaking carboxylation and polymerization reaction notably the double oxygen transfer mechanism is proposed during the oxidation of bisphenol by fe vi which was further rationalized by the dft calculations the four steps involved in this reaction process were the formation of the five membered ring adduct two steps of hydrolysis and the hydrogen abstraction with the corresponding activation energy of 42 72 8 05 33 28 and 17 33 kj mol respectively in four real water samples river water tap water synthetic wastewater and secondary effluent 99 of bpe was degraded by fe vi at the tested dosage within 300 s of reaction except for synthetic wastewater as for the influence of water components no2 hco3 cu2 fe3 and ha in water promoted the removal of bpe by fe vi because they could enhance the stability of fe vi or cause the formation of highly reactive fe v fe iv species according to toxicity evaluation by the ecosar program fe vi oxidation generally decreased the toxicity of bpe solution to common aquatic species fish daphnia and green algae declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was financially supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities no

16375,bisphenol e bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane bpe as a typical endocrine disrupting chemical is commonly detected in source water and drinking water which poses potential risks to human health and ecological environment this paper investigated the removal of bpe by ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi in water under the optimal condition of fe vi 0 bpe 0 10 1 and ph 8 0 a removal efficiency of 99 was achived in 180 s sixteen intermediates of bpe were detected and four possible reaction pathways were proposed which mainly involved the reaction modes of double oxygen and single oxygen transfer bond breaking carboxylation and polymerization the double oxygen transfer mechanism different from traditional mechanisms was newly proposed to illustrate the direct generation of di hydroxylated products from parent bpe which was demonstrated by theoretical calculations for its rationality significantly no2 hco3 cu2 and humic acid constituents of water promoted the removal of bpe additionally samples from river tap water synthetic wastewater and secondary effluent were tested to explore the feasibility of fe vi oxidation for treating bpe in water it was found that 99 of bpe was degraded within 300 s in these waters except for synthetic wastewater the toxicity of bpe and its intermediates was evaluated by ecosar program and the results showed that fe vi oxidation decreased the toxicity of reaction solutions these findings demonstrated that the fe vi oxidation process was an efficient and green method for the treatment of bpe and the new insights into the double oxygen transfer mechanism aid to understand the reaction mechanisms of organic pollutants oxidized by fe vi keywords ferrate vi bisphenol e double oxygen transfer theoretical calculation toxicity assessment 1 introduction endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are typical environmental hormones that have become an issue of high environmental concern they are harmful to organisms even at low doses and have been associated with toxic effects on nervous immune and reproductive systems fujiwara et al 2018 casals casas and desvergne 2011 as one class of the most widely studied edcs bisphenols are commonly used monomers in the production of polycarbonates that are widely applied in various industrial activities due to their excellent performance in recent years the use of bisphenol a bpa has been banned in several counties chen et al 2016 due to the similar properties bisphenol e bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane bpe has become a substitute for bpa to be used as raw materials in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins bpe has been detected in source waters drinking water and bottled water although at concentrations lower than bpa zhang et al 2019 known data showed that the average inlet concentration of bpe in wastewater treatment plants in xiamen city of china was about 4 51 ng l coha et al 2021 bpe can be enriched in organisms and the acute toxicity and estrogen activity of bpe were reported to be comparable to that of bisphenol a lee et al 2004 the 24h ec50 of bpe to daphnia magna was measured as 36 mg l and significant estrogenic activity was observed in a bpe concentration range of 10 6 10 4 m chen et al 2002 ji et al 2013 lee et al 2013 given the potential hazards to human health and ecological environment much attention should be paid to the efficient removal of bpe in environment many methods have been proposed to treat bpa in the environment but few for the treatment of bpe wang et al 2006 investigated the degradation of bpe in a tio2 photocatalytic reaction system and found that β cyclodextrin could enhance the photocatalytic degradation of bpe under the irradiation of near uv light moreover the reactivity and decomposition of bpe was examined in high temperature liquid water and the results showed that the conversion of bpe was essentially completed in 60 min at 350 c with phenol as the major product savage et al 2006 in a more recent study microorganism consortia isolated from river water and activated sludge showed a degradation efficiency of no more than 50 for bpe after 50 days of experiment suggesting that bpe is resistant to biodegradation frankowski et al 2020 in general these existing technologies for the removal of bpe from aqueous solutions have limitations such as low degradation efficiency and secondary pollution therefore it is particularly urgent and significant to develop a green and efficient technology to deal with bpe pollution in water environments recently ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi has received much research attention for its use as a green agent for water purification yang et al 2014 fe vi is reduced to ferric oxide hydroxide in the reaction process which can be used as an inorganic flocculant to remove suspended matter in water effectively moreover fe vi shows great potential in treating refractory organic substances and has been applied to oxidize a variety of aqueous organic pollutants including pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products karlesa et al 2014 sharma et al 2013 it was generally found that fe vi may directly attack pollutants through 1 e transfer 2 e transfer and oxygen atom transfer and fe vi itself was converted to fe v and fe iv during the oxidation processes sharma et al 2015 hu et al 2009 more specifically fe vi has been used to remove some bisphenols in aqueous solutions in a comparative study of fe vi oxidation of edcs li et al 2008 observed that bpa was more difficult to remove by fe vi than four other steroid estrogens but it could be completely degraded in less than 300 s under studied conditions it was found that bisphenol f bpf was highly reactive with fe vi and when the molar ratio of fe vi to bpf was 20 1 the toxicity of bpf could be effectively eliminated by the fe vi oxidation yang et al 2020 hence fe vi is expected to be an effective treatment method for the elimination of bpe pollution in recent years the computational chemistry simulation based on first principles or empirical methods has been extensively applied to predict the transformation behavior of pollutants he et al 2021 in this context we systematically studied for the first time the degradation process and the reaction mechanism of bpe by fe vi in aqueous solutions first the effects solution ph on the removal of bpe were studied to obtain the optimal reaction conditions then reaction intermediates of bpe were identified by liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry lc tof ms from which possible reaction pathways were proposed moreover theoretical calculations were performed on the gaussian 09 software to demonstrate the rationality of proposed reaction mechanisms in addition the removal efficiencies of bpe in natural water samples were measured to examine the practical application of fe vi oxidation and the influence of water components such as common cations anions and dissolved organic matter were considered finally the ecosar program was used to evaluate the toxicity of reaction intermediates generated during the fe vi oxidation process this research may provide critical information for treating bpe in waters and wastewaters the research presented herein will aid in advancing the understanding on the reaction mechanism of fe vi oxidation of bisphenol compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals detailed information of chemicals used in this study are given in text s1 2 2 oxidation experiments batch degradation experiments were performed in a series of 50 0 ml conical flasks at room temperature 25 0 c with a stirring speed of 500 rpm the total volume of reaction solutions was 30 0 ml and 20 0 mm borate buffer was used to maintain solution ph within 0 1 range a desired volume of bpe stock was diluted with borate buffer to prepare the reaction solutions and then an aliquot of freshly prepared ferrate solution was added to initiate the reaction under stirring after 0 5 10 15 30 60 and 180 s 900 μl of reaction solution was taken out and mixed with 100 μl of 0 2 m sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 to terminate the reaction lim and kim 2009 then samples were centrifuged at 12 000 r min for 5 0 min to remove suspended solids and the supernatant was transferred into a hplc vial for subsequent hplc analysis samples 3 0 ml were collected to measure the concentration of residual fe vi by uv spectrophotometry all experiments were done in triplicate kinetic experiments were carried out under different oxidant concentrations and ph in addition natural water samples were also used to study the universal applicability of fe vi in different waters the tap water tw river water rw and secondary effluent se were collected from nanjing tap water general company nanjing china jiuxiang river nanjing china and xianlin sewage treatment plant nanjing china respectively synthetic wastewater sw was prepared to simulate wastewaters from chemical pharmaceutical industry according to the method of babic et al babic et al 2013 after passing through 0 45 μm glass fiber membranes gf f waterman maidstone u k these water samples were stored at 4 c for use and the detailed physiochemical parameters were shown in table s1 another batch of experiments were performed for the identification of products at different reaction times 3 0 ml of 0 2 m na2s2o3 was directly added into 30 0 ml of reaction solutions to quench the reaction then reaction solutions were purified and concentrated through solid phase extraction spe method using cnwbond lcc18 spe cartridges 2 ca0955 0001 1 0 g 6 0 ml which were eluted with 2 0 ml of methanol for subsequent lc ms analysis 2 3 analytic methods the bpe was quantified by using a hitachi l 2100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc instrument reaction intermediates were identified by an agilent 1260 infinity hplc system coupled with a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof x500r ab sciex usa the detailed information of hplc and lc tof ms methods were shown in text s2 and text s3 the residual concentration of fe vi was measured by recording the absorbance at 510 nm using tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd beijing china 2 4 theoretical calculations theoretical calculations were performed with density functional theory dft method at the m062x lanl2dz level using the gaussian 09 software package to rationalize the proposed reaction pathways frisch et al 2015 wu et al 2021 r y xiao et al 2020 the solvent effect was solved using quantum self consistent reaction field scrf method the geometric structures of reaction species including reactants res transition states tss intermediates ims and products prs were optimized with subsequent frequency analysis to obtain the minimum energy on the potential energy surface wu et al 2020 as for the search of tss a relaxed scan on the length of the chemical bond broken formed in the reaction was first performed by the coordinate driving method to obtain the approximate structure then the initial guess structure based newton raphson method was used to calculate the precise structure of tss finally intrinsic reaction coordinate irc calculations were conducted to verify that all tss were connected to reactants and the corresponding products on the potential energy surface fukui 1981 after the gaussian work the output files were searched to calculate the energy difference δe between the tss prs and the res 2 5 toxicity evaluation the toxicity of bpe and its intermediates to three representative aquatic species was predicted by the ecosar program which were verified and extensively used by the us epa oecd and eu andreozzi et al 2008 the acute toxicity was expressed as the half lethal concentration lc50 for fish and water flea daphnia spp and the half effective concentration ec50 for green algae 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics the degradation of bpe by fe vi under excess concentration of fe vi was investigated as a function of time at different ph ph 7 0 10 0 fig s1 the results observed in the study were plotted ln bpe t bpe 0 versus fe vi t fig 1 a a linear relationship was observed at studied ph r2 0 99 and the slope gave the second order rate constant k app at different ph the values of k app decreased from 1 3 0 03 103 m 1 s 1 to 2 2 0 04 102 m 1 s 1 as the ph increase from 7 0 to 10 0 fig 1b this suggests fe vi is more effective in removing bpe at lower ph i e ph 7 0 than at higher ph i e ph 10 0 fe vi has higher redox potential under acidic conditions than at basic conditions sharma 2011 and therefore giving higher ability to oxidize bpe at ph 7 0 the trend in k app as a function ph may be described by considering the equilibrium species of ferrate vi h3feo4 h h2feo4 pk a1 1 9 h2feo4 h hfeo4 pk a2 3 5 hfeo4 h feo4 2 pk a3 7 23 sharma et al 2001a and bpe pk a1 10 10 wang et al 2018 in the studied ph range fe vi exists mainly as hfeo4 and feo4 2 and bpe has also two species protonated and un protonated species written as bpe and bpe and following reactions take place eqs 1 4 1 hfeo 4 bpe products k 1 2 feo 4 2 bpe products k 2 3 hfeo 4 bp e products k 3 4 feo 4 2 bp e products k 2 the values of k app may be expressed by eq 5 5 k app k 1 α hfeo 4 β bpe k 2 α feo 4 2 β bpe k 3 α hfeo 4 β bp e k 4 α feo 4 2 β bp e where αhfeo4 10 ph 10 ph 10 7 23 and αfeo4 2 10 7 23 10 ph 10 7 23 βbpe 10 ph 10 ph 10 10 1 and βbpe 10 10 1 10 ph 10 10 1 the values of αhfeo4 αfeo4 2 βbpe and βbpe were calculated at different ph and the experimental data in fig 1b were fitted using eq 5 it was found that experimental data could be fit nicely using only the reactions 1 and 2 r2 0 97 the solid line in fig 1b the species specific rate constants for reactions 1 and 2 were obtained as 1 7 0 1 103 m 1 s 1 and 4 7 0 6 102 m 1 s 1 the protonated form of fe vi i e hfeo4 reacted about four times faster with protonated bpe than did the un protonated fe vi i e feo4 2 the fraction of hfeo4 αhfeo4 decreases with increases in ph causing the rates of the oxidation of bpe by fe vi decreased fig 1b many studies have shown similar trend for the oxidation pollutants kim et al 2015 sharma et al 2005 yngard et al 2007 it has been shown that protonated fe vi may have stronger free radical character on the oxygen atoms to oxidize with pollutants terryn et al 2017 based on the results of fig 1b the application of fe vi is suitable for neutral and weak alkaline conditions considering the overall removal and possible practical applications subsequent experiments were carried out at ph 8 0 in addition the decomposition of fe vi would generate fe iv fe v which may also contribute to the decomposition of bpe the quenching experiment was conducted using pmso as a scavenger the results were shown in fig s2 which showed that fe iv fe v makes some contribution to pollutants oxidation but fe vi still played a dominant role in the degradation of bpe which led to 76 removal of the substrate 3 2 identification of transformation products and possible reaction pathways the reaction intermediates of bpe oxidized by fe vi were tentatively identified sixteen products were detected and their detailed ms information and fragmentation patterns in the ms ms spectra are given in table s2 and fig s3 it was worth noting that the difference of the measured mass and the theoretical mass was always 5 ppm which ensured the high reliability in proposed molecular formulas structures of oxidation intermediates were further determined through analyzing parent ions in total ion current tic chromatogram and fragment ions in ms ms spectra fig 2 illustrated the evolution profiles of bpe reaction products over time which was obtained by recording peak areas of the extracted ion chromatogram xic and could be used to analyze the possible formation sequence of the products according to the identified products and previous studies on bpe and its structure analogue bpa li et al 2008 pozdnyakov et al 2011 chen et al 2019 four possible pathways for the oxidation of bpe by fe vi are proposed in fig 3 as seen five main reaction modes i e double oxygen transfer single oxygen transfer bond breaking carboxylation and polymerization were involved in the oxidation process among them both single oxygen transfer and double oxygen transfer could give hydroxylation products most notably the detailed product analysis allowed to propose for the first time that fe vi could directly oxidize bisphenol compounds to produce di hydroxylated products by the double oxygen transfer pathway i was initiated by the hydroxylation of the parent molecule during fe vi oxidation followed by subsequent oxidation reactions to form a series of intermediates p4 p11 as seen in fig 3 in the pathway i b single oxygen transfer of bpe occurred to generate the mono hydroxylated product p7 which could undergo further hydroxylation to form the di hydroxylated product p4 b the single oxygen transfer is accepted as a well known mechanism for the generation of hydroxylation products in the fe vi oxidation process chen et al 2019 however a previous study has shown that hydroxyl radicals oh can be formed from the self decomposition of fe vi in aqueous solution lee et al 2005 moreover chen et al 2018 also detected the signal of oh in fe vi solution by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra thus direct attack of oh on bpe might also be another mechanism to produce hydroxylated intermediates in a parallel way two adjacent hydroxyl groups in p7 were oxidized to the quinone type intermediate p8 which then underwent ring opening reaction to give the product p9 p7 p8 p9 it has been reported that the aromatic compounds containing two ortho oh groups could be oxidized more easily and then the benzene ring was opened to generate carboxylic acid type intermediates jiang et al 2015 similarly p4 b was oxidized into p10 and then the ring opening product p11 as seen in fig 2c p9 and p11 accumulated to the maximum at 30 s followed with a gradual decline indicating that they might eventually disappear over time due to the transformation into small molecular weight acids besides the mass abundance of the di hydroxylated product p4 was significantly higher than that of the mono hydroxylated product p7 and a large amount of p4 was observed at the time the reaction initiated fig 2a and fig 2d which indicated that p4 could be generated more quickly and easier than p7 therefore it was reasonable to propose that there was another mechanism of hydroxylation in fe vi oxidation in addition to the single oxygen transfer or the direct attack of oh mentioned above pathway i a illustrates this double oxygen transfer mechanism of fe vi for the direct generation of product p4 a from bpe then p4 a could undergo sequential mono hydroxylation reaction to produce a polyhydroxylated compound p6 p4 a p5 p6 or it was directly converted to p6 through a double oxygen transfer of fe vi the double oxygen transfer mechanism was firstly proposed in fe vi oxidation of bisphenols which would be further verified by gaussian program for its possibility to generate di hydroxylated products directly from the parent compound see section 3 3 for details fig 2b showed that the content of p6 was gradually increased during the reaction period of 180 s however due to the presence of ortho oh groups it seems likely that p6 may undergo ring opening reaction and ultimately be mineralized into co2 and h2o to reduce the toxicity of reaction solutions in pathway ⅱ fe vi attacked the cc bond bridging the two benzene rings in bpe molecule resulting in the production of two monocyclic products p12 and p13 subsequently p13 was oxidized into the ketone compound p14 in addition carboxylated products were detected with a high mass response it was speculated in pathway ⅲ that the sequential carboxylation of bpe occurred to form the product p16 bpe p15 p16 the p15 and p16 showed a similar polygonal line type variation trend but the turning point of p16 appeared later than that of p15 which proved that p16 was derived from p15 according to previous studies this carboxylation reaction may occur through the kolbe schmitt reaction mechanism or the carbon dioxide anion radicals co2 initiated radical addition mechanism markovic et al 2007 neta et al 1988 thus moiety of dissolved hco3 may be bonded to organic molecules to generate the corresponding carboxylation products during fe vi oxidation process the pathway ⅳ mainly described the polymerization reaction as an oxidizing agent fe vi can abstract a hydrogen atom from different positions of bpe to form radicals r1 and r2 chen et al 2019 meanwhile the phenolic radical r3 could also be formed after the cc bond breaking in bpe these free radicals could couple with each other to produce dimers the cross coupling of r1 with r2 yielded the product p1 while r2 coupled with r3 to generate p2 as for the product p3 it was produced by the self coupling of r3 as shown in fig 3a c and d the largest peak area of p1 and p2 were observed in 5 s while the content of p3 reached the maximum at 30 s subsequently these products were oxidized by fe vi following the reactions described in pathways ⅰ ⅲ and accordingly their relative contents were decreased this phenomenon indicated that the polymerization reaction occurs rapidly but the polymerization products could not exist for a long time 3 3 theoretical calculations on double oxygen transfer mechanism in section 3 2 it was speculated that fe vi oxidized bpe directly to produce di hydroxylated products by the double oxygen transfer mechanism in order to rationalize this newly proposed oxidation mechanism of fe vi theoretical calculations were carried out in recent years theoretical calculations have been applied as a successful tool to reveal the reaction pathways and mechanisms between organic contaminants and oxidants r y xiao et al 2020 pan et al 2018 qu et al 2018 in this work density functional theory dft calculations were conducted at the m062x lanl2dz level to evaluate the feasibility of the double oxygen transfer for fe vi oxidizing bpe to form the di hydroxylated products and the energy profiles for all the elementary reactions involved are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 first with the opening of the two fe vi o bonds fe vi attacked the two adjacent c 5 and c 6 atoms on the benzene ring of bpe forming the five membered ring adduct intermediate of fe vi o c c o im1 with an energy barrier of 42 72 kj mol the im1 was structurally unstable which can be hydrolyzed twice to produce the intermediate im3 the corresponding δe of these two hydrolysis reactions were calculated to be 8 05 kj mol and 33 28 kj mol respectively after hydrolysis two o atoms from fe vi combined with two h atoms from h2o to form the oh groups in im3 meanwhile it was important to note that fe vi was converted to fe iv directly without the involvement of fe v in this process then another fe vi grabbed the two original h atoms at c 5 and c 6 sites of im3 to finally give the di hydroxylated product pr through the hydrogen abstraction reaction during which fe vi was reduced into fe iv once again based on the calculations the activation energy of the hydrogen abstraction step was 17 33 kj mol in short the di hydroxylated product p4 was formed in four steps of reaction and meanwhile two molecules of fe iv were generated by the consumption of same amount of fe vi the calculation results above proved that the double oxygen transfer mechanism of fe iv was reasonable which helps to reveal the oxidation mechanisms of other organic compounds by fe iv treatment moreover the energy profiles for single oxygen transfer mechanism was also considered for comparison in the pathway of the single oxygen transfer fe vi first attacked the c 6 atom forming an intermediate which was subsequently hydrolyzed to obtain the mono hydroxylated product p7 with the simultaneous generation of one molecule of fe iv fig s4 since the rate determining step for the double oxygen transfer mechanism was the initial process of fe vi attacking on two adjacent c atoms of bpe only the first step of fe vi attack was calculated for single oxygen transfer as seen a much higher activation energy of 50 70 kj mol was needed for the attack of fe vi on c 6 atom fig s4 confirming that the double oxygen transfer was more prone than single oxygen transfer 3 4 removal of bpe 3 4 1 effect of fe vi dosage in water the effect of fe vi dosage on the removal of bpe was investigated and the result are shown in fig 5 d the reactions were carried out at the bpe concentration of 20 0 μm and the solution ph of 8 0 and the molar ratios of fe vi 0 bpe 0 were set as 5 1 10 1 15 1 and 20 1 as seen from fig 5d the increase in the concentration of fe vi ions in the solution improved the removal efficiency of bpe when the fe vi 0 bpe 0 molar ratio was in the range from 10 1 to 20 1 bpe in solutions was completely removed at 180 s the results sugest that the optimal oxidant dosage for bpe degradation by fe vi was fe vi 0 bpe 0 10 1 at ph 8 0 3 4 2 effect of inorganic ions inorganic ions are ubiquitously present in wastewaters and natural waters which may affect the oxidation of organic pollutants during advanced oxidation processes in this work we first investigated the effects of common anions cl no3 no2 hco3 and cations mg2 ca2 cu2 fe3 on the degradation of bpe by fe vi the experiments were carried out under the condition of ph 8 0 with an initial bpe concentration of 20 0 μm and the molar ratio of fe vi 0 bpe 0 5 1 considering the actual concentrations in different waters the ions were used at two concentrations of 0 5 mm and 5 0 mm fig 5a b and fig s5 showed the degradation efficiencies of bpe by fe vi in presence of different inorganic ions sodium salts were used to examine the effects of anions as presented in fig 5a cl and no3 had little effect on the degradation of bpe by fe vi which was consistent with the results of feng et al 2016 and lee and von gunten 2010 the removal efficiency of bpe was promoted by no2 and the promoting effect was further enhanced with the increase of no2 concentration fig s5 li et al 2020 also observed a similar phenomenon during the ozonation of polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides according to previous studies fe vi can react with no2 to form fe ⅳ species which are much more reactive than parent fe vi for the removal of trimethoprim tmp feng et al 2018 sharma and bielski 2002 therefore the promoted degradation of bpe observed in this work was possibly attributed to the formation of reactive fe ⅳ species similar to no2 hco3 could also promote the removal efficiency of bpe luo et al 2019 found that bicarbonate can stabilize the intermediate fe v species produced from fe vi via complexation and the prolonged lifetime of fe v would contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants in addition the influence of cations especially metal ions on the oxidation process were also examined chloride salts were selected to inspect the effects of cation fig 5b illustrated that two cations mg2 and ca2 had negligible effects on the degradation of bpe by fe vi by contrast cu2 and fe3 significantly enhanced the removal of bpe by fe vi the removal efficiency of bpe after 60 s was increased from 74 to 80 and 78 in solutions containing 0 5 mm cu2 and fe3 respectively when the concentration of cu2 or fe3 was increased to 5 0 mm more than 99 of bpe in reaction solutions could be removed by fe vi in 60 s fig s5 in the presence of fe3 its redox reaction with feo4 2 could occur to form intermediate state fe ⅳ and fe ⅴ species which played positive roles in oxidation aggregation and flocculation of solid oxidants to promote the oxidation ability of fe vi jointly li et al 2005 sharma et al 2001b 3 4 3 effect of ha humic acid ha is a major component of dissolved organic matter in water environments which could exert some influence on the transformation behavior of organic pollutants qi et al 2019 generally the concentration of ha in waters is about 10 0 mg l accounting for 50 90 of the total organic matter ge et al 2007 in addition to forming complex with most heavy metals ha can also be oxidized by most oxidants in water treatment thus ha was chosen as a representative to investigate the influence of organic matter on the degradation of bpe by fe vi in waters three different concentrations of ha 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l were set to study the effect on bpe removal under experimental conditions of bpe 20 0 μm fe vi 0 bpe 0 5 1 ph 8 0 and t 25 0 c as presented in fig 5c ha exerted a significant promotion on the degradation of bpe by fe vi but the promoting effect was only slightly changed with the increasing concentration of ha similar to the results zheng et al 2021 also observed a promoting effect of ha on fe vi oxidation of 4 tert butylphenol in general ha was expected to cause decreased removal efficiency of organic pollutants due to competitive consumption of fe vi horst et al 2013 however previous studies have shown that oxidation mediators such as phenoxy radicals or benzoquinone like compounds are produced during the oxidation of ha by fe vi which would subsequently cross couple with pollutant molecules to enhance their transformation sun et al 2017 dong et al 2017 with the more generation of these reactive species the oxidation of bpe was largely promoted at higher ha concentrations 3 4 4 degradation in different water matrices the composition of natural waters is very complex containing various inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter in order to evaluate the feasibility of fe vi oxidation for real applications the degradation experiments of bpe were carried out in four kinds of waters including river water rw tap water tw synthetic wastewater sw and secondary effluent se as shown in fig 5e bpe was degraded by more than 95 after 180 s in all water matrices except sw the oxidation of bpe continued after 180 s and more than 99 of bpe was removed at 300 s in all water matrices except sw the largest removal of bpe was observed in rw possibly because rw has a stronger buffer capacity to inhibit the increase of solution ph caused by the reaction after 300 s of reaction the ph of rw reaction solution changed little and the final ph was close to 8 0 which was lower than the ph values in other water samples table s3 as for the lower degradation efficiency of sw degradation rate 87 there are two possible reasons 1 no buffer was used in the experiment in natural water matrices the ph of sw solution reached 9 2 after reaction which was not conductive to the oxidation of bpe 2 sw contains more reducing substances or organic compounds such as the citric acid ascorbic acid and saccharose which could compete with bpe for fe vi the experimental result in fig s6 showed that the addition of citric acid ascorbic acid and saccharose caused obvious inhibition of the degradation which explained the adverse effects observed in sw thus fe vi could remove more than 99 of bpe in natural waters within 300 s however the degradation efficiency of bpe was slightly inhibited in pharmaceutical industry wastewater which contains a large amount of reducing substances and organic compounds in general the application of fe vi oxidation for treating the pollution of bisphenols in actual waters is suitable 3 4 5 kinetics of bpe at a low concentration by referring to the concentration of bisphenol a in industrial effluent we selected some appropriate concentrations of bpe 1 0 μm 0 5 μm and 0 1 μm to simulate the degradation of bpe at the environmental concentration furhacker et al 2000 as presented fig 5 f bpe of 1 0 μm 0 5 μm and 0 1 μm could be degraded more than 92 at 300 s when fe vi 0 bpe 0 was 50 1 80 1 and 200 1 respectively which indicated that fe vi can effectively degrade bpe rapidly at environmental concentrations 3 5 toxicity assessment in recent years the ecosar program has been widely used to evaluate the toxicity of organic compounds in water treatment process feng et al 2016 in this work the acute and chronic toxicity of bpe and its degradation products to three aquatic species fish daphnia and green algae were estimated by the ecosar program the toxicity classification of intermediates was conducted according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals the changes in the toxicity of reaction solutions to fish daphnia and green algae associated with the transformation of bpe into reaction intermediates through different pathways are shown in fig 6 fig s7 and fig s8 respectively in general the toxicity of reaction intermediates from pathways i iii was decreased to varying degrees compared with the parent bpe molecule when it comes to pathway iv the low solubility of polymeric products might limit the accurate predictions of the toxicity data by the ecosar program in addition the polymeric products were almost completely degraded within 180 s see in fig 2 so it seemed less important to evaluate their toxicity to sum up the oxidation of fe vi reduced the environmental toxicity of bpe which was significant for the ecological and environmental protection in the chemical treatment process in this sense fe vi can be used as a green and effective oxidant to treat waters and wastewaters containing bisphenol compounds 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that the fe vi oxidation process is an efficient and green method for the removal of bpe in aqueous solutions under optimal reaction conditions of fe vi 0 bpe 0 10 1 ph 8 0 and reaction temperature 25 0 c and 20 0 μm bpe could be almost completely removed by fe vi in 180 s the k app decreased with increase in ph hence the removal of bpe by fe vi a total of sixteen reaction intermediates of bpe were identified by the high reaction technique four pathways were proposed which mainly involved the double oxygen transfer single oxygen transfer bond breaking carboxylation and polymerization reaction notably the double oxygen transfer mechanism is proposed during the oxidation of bisphenol by fe vi which was further rationalized by the dft calculations the four steps involved in this reaction process were the formation of the five membered ring adduct two steps of hydrolysis and the hydrogen abstraction with the corresponding activation energy of 42 72 8 05 33 28 and 17 33 kj mol respectively in four real water samples river water tap water synthetic wastewater and secondary effluent 99 of bpe was degraded by fe vi at the tested dosage within 300 s of reaction except for synthetic wastewater as for the influence of water components no2 hco3 cu2 fe3 and ha in water promoted the removal of bpe by fe vi because they could enhance the stability of fe vi or

16376,the nitrate no3 contamination of karst aquifers as an important drinking water reservoir is increasing globally understanding the behavior of nitrogen n in karst aquifers is imperative for effective groundwater quality management this study combined multiple stable isotopes δ2h h2o δ18o h2o δ13c dic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 including hydro chemical data with a tracer test and a bayesian isotope mixing siar model to elucidate the no3 sources and n cycling within the babu karst aquifer in guizhou province southwest china nitrate isotopes and siar model revealed that manure and sewage nitrogen fertilizer and soil organic nitrogen were the three dominant no3 sources in winter contributing to 37 32 and 31 to spring no3 and 38 31 and 31 to surface water no3 respectively the δ18o no3 values of sampled waters ranging from 0 3 to 13 7 mean of 7 7 3 0 n 63 and the significant negative correlations between δ15n no3 and δ13c dic in the spring waters p 0 01 revealed that nitrification was the primary n transformation process in the babu watershed whereas denitrification might still occur locally confirmed by the enriched values of δ15n no3 14 3 7 6 n 6 and high denitrification extent 46 6 22 2 n 6 in the springs from residential areas and by elevated δ13c dic 11 2 0 6 n 26 and δ15n no3 values 18 9 5 2 n 26 in the boreholes during the base flow period point inputs of the amd impacted stream and sewage waters and short transit time 5 days were conducive to nitrification processes in the karst conduit resulting in elevated no3 concentration and no3 cl ratio at the watershed outlet approximately 50 of no3 flux at the outlet was derived from nitrification indicating that a significant extent of nitrification occurred in the nh4 contaminated karst conduit which may be a new no3 source to receiving rivers and lakes this study provided an integrated method for exploring the n dynamics in contaminated karst aquifers moreover the study highlighted that the point n sources

because it has natural inertia in hydrological systems grimvall et al 2000 the identification of no3 sources has been identified as the first step to mitigate no3 pollution in aquatic environments given its inherent advantages nitrate isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 have been widely used to trace no3 sources in the past two decades minet et al 2017 in addition previous studies have successfully used δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 combining with no3 concentrations to quantify no3 sources within several karst watersheds husic et al 2020b yue et al 2020 in complex systems however where overlapping isotopic ranges of no3 source end numbers occurs together with interference caused by nitrification denitrification ammonia volatilization anammox and or other unknown processes the apportionment of

carbon isotope δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic is a useful tool to trace the origins and transformations of dic in karst waters the reason is that more dic from soil co2 new carbon results in a lower δ13c dic value eq 1 table 1 and more dic from carbonate rocks old carbon dissolution induced by strong acid e g hno3 leads to a higher δ13c dic value eq 2 table 1 if nitrification occurs a decrease of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values and an increase of δ13c dic eqs 2 and 3a table 1 vitòria et al 2008 and no3 may be identified eq 3b table 1 moreover the value of δ18o no3 is dependent on h2o and o2 dissolved in water eq 4 table 1 andersson and hooper 1983 during the processes of denitrification the values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 become elevated in the residual no3 with the slope in the range of 0 5 to 0 8 böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 denitrification resulting from the oxidation of organic matter leads to a decrease in the δ13c dic value and a simultaneous increase of hco3

murgulet and tick 2013 accordingly several studies tried to combine nitrate isotopes with carbon isotope and hydro chemistry to study the cycling of n e g vitòria et al 2008 li et al 2019 otero et al 2009 previous studies showed that even small variations of water transit time also exert an important effect on isotopic and chemical compositions vystavna et al 2020 compared with the pore and fissure aquifers karst aquifers are unfavorable for denitrification because of its fast flow paths and shorter transit time on the order of hours to days husic et al 2020b however denitrification exists in some karst aquifers with different groundwater transporting times such as the laolongdong karst aquifer china yang et al 2020 and the floridian karst aquifer usa heffernan et al 2012 the complexity of the n cycle associated with groundwater regimes makes their interpretation more challenging than previously understood archana et al 2018 thus the knowledge of flow regimes in karst aquifers is imperative for the understanding of the processes affecting local n transformations hosono et al 2013 husic et al 2020a however few studies have combined multiple stable isotopes and hydro geochemistry with flow regimes to trace the behavior of n within karst watersheds yue et al 2020 to overcome these limitations of using nitrate isotopes alone based on previous studies addressing karst water n sources and cycling our study applied a multiple isotopes approach δ2h h2o δ18o h2o δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ13c dic combined with chemical data ca2 mg2 no3 no2 nh4 hco3 cl and so4 2 tracer test and siar mixing model in the babu watershed southwest china a tracer test was applied to delineate groundwater sources flow paths and transit time the main objectives of this integrated analysis were the following 1 identify and apportion karst water no3 sources 2 reveal the n dynamics in a karst aquifer with mixed nitrogen inputs and 3 assess the role of flow regime on karst water n transformation processes the results of this study are beneficial to improve the knowledge about nitrogen sources and dynamics in karst aquifers and can provide valuable information for effective groundwater management strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the babu watershed is located in the mid west of guizhou province southwest china fig 1 a with a population of approximately 30 000 in an area of 18 08 km2 this watershed is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and precipitation of 14 4 c and 1400 mm respectively ren et al 2021 approximately 84 of the annual precipitation falls in the monsoon season may october the watershed is underlain by the longtan changxing p3 l c dalong p3 d yelang t1 y guanling t2 g and jialingjiang t1 j sedimentary rocks comprising interbedded layers of shale coal seams dolostone limestone and mudstone fig 1b ren et al 2021 revealed the existence of many karst features such as karst depressions sinkholes subterranean stream and springs the babu karst aquifer accounts for 85 of the total water resources for the local people in the form of epikarst springs karst fissure springs and subterranean stream waters the subterranean stream mouth is the only drainage outlet of the babu watershed wo including surface and groundwater and the discharge fluctuates between 0 1 and 1 5 m3 s with a mean value of 0 45 m3 s ren et al 2021 land use in this watershed is roughly divided into six categories fig 1c less developed shrubs and woods 37 agricultural 42 residential 8 lake 5 traffic 5 and industrial areas 5 soil thickness is thinner on the hill slopes 0 30 cm than that in the valleys 100 500 cm the less developed area is mainly distributed on the hill slopes the agricultural area spreads throughout the valleys and hill slopes and the residential area concentrates in the valleys the treated wastewater from local sewage treatment plants showing high nh4 n concentrations 9 82 mg l drains directly into the babu karst aquifer via sinkhole s 2 fig 1c ren et al 2021 fine materials deposited in the houlongshan tailings pond are the by products of burning fes2 rich coal at the zhijin coal fired power plant where ammonia flue gas desulfurization process is adopted to remove sulfur thus the acid mine drainage amd water derived from the dump with a low ph and high pollution concentrations e g fe mn so4 2 no3 and nh4 is discharged into the hou stream then the amd impacted stream enters the babu karst aquifer via sinkhole s 1 ren et al 2021 2 2 tracer test our previous study showed that the direct connections existed between sinkholes s 1 and s 2 and wo ren et al 2021 thus the design of the tracer test attempted to estimate the groundwater flow dynamics within the karst aquifer rather than to investigate the hydraulic connection between sinkhole s 2 and wo the distance between sinkhole s 2 and wo is 3 85 km potassium iodide ki was selected as a tracer because of the following 1 groundwater from the site wo is pumped to supply drinking water for the local residents 2 background concentrations of i in groundwater not impacted by marine sources are generally expected to be low usually less than 10 μg l zhang et al 2013 ransom et al 2016 and 3 i has very little sorption to sediments and geologic materials ransom et al 2016 a total of 50 kg ki was injected into sinkhole 2 at 11 30 on 03 12 2019 and the tracer test was finished at 12 00 on 18 12 2019 prior to the experiment one groundwater sample was taken from the wo to obtain the initial concentration of i during the tracer test 120 groundwater samples were collected using an automatic sampler jc 8000d china at the babu watershed outlet with an interval of 4 h 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 field sampling water samples were collected in december 2019 including 28 spring waters sp1 sp28 26 monitoring borehole groundwaters bh1 1 bh1 11 from bh 1 and bh2 1 bh2 15 from bh 2 six surface waters two river waters of sr1 sr2 four lake waters of l1 l4 one sewage one amd water one amd impacted stream water and one watershed outlet water wo sewage amd and amd impacted water samples represent the isotopic composition of no3 from treated wastewater amd water derived from the houlongshan tailings dump and amd impacted stream respectively within the babu watershed groundwater from two monitoring boreholes was sampled using a fixed depth sampler aod 425 solinst canada at 10 m intervals from the top of the water column 18 7 m of bh 1 and 12 6 m of bh 2 to the bottom of the boreholes 132 m of bh 1 and 165 m of bh 2 this process was to track n transformation from shallow to deep groundwater and to determine whether or not the deep aquifer is contaminated all containers were rinsed three or four times with filtered water 0 45 μm prior to sampling three 50 ml volumes of filtered water were placed in polyethylene bottles for laboratory analyzes then one of which was acidified to ph 2 using hno3 for the measurement of cations and the remaining two non acidified were used for anion and nitrate isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 testing the samples used for water isotopes δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o analyzes were stored in amber glass bottles unacidified water samples for carbon isotope δ13c dic measurement were collected in 50 ml brown polyethylene bottles and spiked with 0 5 0 6 ml saturated hgcl2 to prevent microbial activities the samples were stored at 4 c in the dark before testing 2 3 2 water quality and isotope analysis electrical conductivity ec ph temperature t and do were measured in situ using wtw3430 wtw germany with the resolutions of 0 1 μs cm 0 01 0 1 c and 0 01 mg l respectively hco3 was measured in site using a titration kit merck germany with a precision of 0 1 mmol l cations ca2 mg2 k na and fe were measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icap 7600 thermo fisher usa anions no3 so4 2 cl and i were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 thermo fisher usa the concentrations of no2 and nh4 were detected using a visible spectrophotometer t6 xinrui china the detection limits of ca2 mg2 k na fe no3 so4 2 cl no2 i and nh4 were 0 011 0 013 0 02 0 005 0 003 0 05 0 2 0 1 0 002 0 03 and 0 02 mg l respectively analytical qualities were controlled by standard reference materials and repeated and blank samples and the relative standard deviations rsd were 3 for cations and anions ren et al 2021 water isotopes δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were determined by gasbench ii thermo fisher usa coupled to mat 253 thermo fisher usa analytical precision was 0 5 for δ2h h2o and 0 2 for δ18o h2o based on three internal standards gbw04401 gbw04402 and gbw04403 nitrate isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were determined using the bacterial denitrifier method after no2 removal with sulfamic acid the isotopic compositions of produced n2o no3 n2o were determined on delta plus thermo finnigan usa fitted to auto sampler equipment combi pal ctc switzerland and a trace gas pre concentrator unit the analytical quality was controlled by blanks and four international standards usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea n3 and the analytical precision was generally better than 0 1 for δ15n no3 and 0 5 for δ18o no3 respectively xu et al 2016 the carbon isotope of dic was measured by gasbench irms thermo fisher usa after being acidified by phosphoric acid the value of δ13c dic was calibrated using three international standards nbs 18 nbs 19 and nbs 30 and four internal standards gbw04405 gbw04406 gbw04416 and gbw04417 and the analytical precision was generally better than 0 2 isotope values are expressed in delta δ with respect to air n v smow h o or v pdb c 2 4 siar mixing model the bayesian isotope mixing model was widely used to estimate the relative contributions of different no3 sources to sampled waters in aquatic environment xue et al 2012 torres martínez et al 2021 by defining a set of n mixture measurements on j isotopes with k source contributors the siar can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 7 x i j k 1 k p k s j k c j k ε i j s j k n μ j k ω j k 2 c j k n λ j k τ j k 2 ε i j n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of the mixture i i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j sjk represents the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation sd ωjk pk indicates the proportional contribution of source k which needs to be estimated by the siar model cjk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with mean λjk and sd τjk finally εij is the residual error representing the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean zero and sd σj a detailed description of this model can be found in parnell et al 2010 and xue et al 2009 2012 in the present study typical end member isotopic values of nf soil organic n son and manure and sewage m s used in the siar model were derived from chenqi basin another karst watershed in guizhou province of southwest china with similar lifestyles agricultural practices and nitrate sources to our own yue et al 2020 table s1 isotopic fractionation during the denitrification process was incorporated in the siar model the fractionation factor ε is unlikely to be directly obtained from our study due to the weak correlations between δ15n no3 and ln no3 fig s1a and between δ18o no3 and ln no3 fig s1b thus the λjk mean and τjk sd of the fractionation factor were derived from other studies table s1 2 5 rayleigh fractionation method under favorable conditions the extent of denitrification can be calculated using the rayleigh fractionation equation 8 δ r δ 0 ε l n f where δ r represents the isotopic compositions δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 of the residual no3 δ 0 represents the isotopic compositions δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 of the initial no3 f represents the remaining fraction of no3 the low δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 values in the sampled spring assigned as δ 0 and the ε value of 12 4 derived from chenqi basin yue et al 2020 were used to calculated the extent of denitrification 1 f 3 results

characteristics the measured ph values of sp surface water and bh were mildly alkaline with a mean value of 7 40 7 48 and 7 39 respectively the amd water had the lowest ph value 2 65 causing the amd impacted stream and outlet water slightly acidic the do concentrations of sp and surface water ranged from 1 26 to 8 37 mg l and 5 14 to 10 21 mg l with a mean value of 5 43 n 28 and 8 29 mg l n 6 respectively indicating well oxygenated conditions considering no3 the modified piper diagram was adopted to explore the hydro chemical types of each water fig 2 as expected from the karst settings most of the groundwater sp and bh samples were dominated by ca hco3 and or ca mg hco3 types however some sp water samples such as sp5 sp13 sp21 sp23 and sp27 in agricultural land and sp16 in residential land belonged to the ca mg hco3 cl no3 type suggesting anthropogenic pollution e g cl and no3 sources compared with local groundwater the surface water types had higher variability sr1 l3 and l4 ca mg hco3 so4 sr2 ca hco3 l1 ca mg so4 hco3 and l2 ca mg hco3 respectively among the collected samples amd water was characterized by the highest major ions except for hco3 classified in the mg so4 type with the highest ec value the water type of amd impacted stream outlet water and sewage was mg ca so4 ca mg so4 and ca mg hco3 respectively 3 2 nitrogen species the detection rate of no3 n for sp water was 100 with no3 n concentrations ranging from 0 57 to 16 38 mg l mean value 8 16 4 76 mg l n 28 table 2 no3 accounted for 95 of the tin and turned into the major pollutant in the springs indicating that the babu watershed was more susceptible to no3 pollution the highest no3 n 16 38 mg l and nh4 n 0 65 mg l concentrations were observed at sp23 and sp18 and both were from agricultural land the highest no2 n 1 63 mg l value was the sp8 sample in residential land approximately 36 of the sp water samples had no3 n concentrations exceeding the natural threshold for drinking water 10 mg l who and china indicating severe no3 contamination no3 n in surface water ranged from 0 57 to 1 86 mg l mean of 1 21 0 49 mg l n 6 which was much less than that of sp and the highest nh4 n was found close to the residential land 9 36 mg l at l2 the monitoring borehole water recorded the lowest no3 n concentrations mean of 0 83 0 18 mg l n 26 compared with the sp and surface waters the amd water showed the highest nh4 n concentration 1522 89 mg l followed by 149 58 mg l in the amd impacted stream moderate nh4 n 9 82 mg l and low no3 n 0 82 mg l concentrations were measured at the sewage sample notably the groundwater at the watershed outlet was characterized by the highest contaminations of no3 n 18 00 mg l and nh4 n 17 63 mg l relative to the sp bh and surface water samples 3 3 isotopic compositions 3 3 1 water isotopes stable water isotopes in the sp samples varied from 60 5 to 49 1 mean value 54 9 2 4 n 28 for δ2h h2o and 8 8 to 7 4 mean value 8 2 0 3 n 28 for δ18o h2o table 2 less variations were found for bh water samples the outlet water exhibited moderate isotopic values with 54 3 for δ2h h2o and 8 1 for δ18o h2o the surface water samples showed higher isotopic values relative to groundwater ranging from 49 7 to 33 8 mean value 43 8 5 9 n 6 for δ2h h2o and from 7 0 to 3 7 mean value 6 0 1 3 n 6 for δ18o h2o 3 3 2 nitrate isotopes measured mean values were 7 6 5 4 and 6 7 2 5 for spring water δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and 7 6 1 8 and 5 9 3 3 for surface water respectively table 2 no significant difference was observed between spring and surface water by contrast nitrate isotopes were higher in the bh samples with mean values of 18 9 5 2 for δ15n no3 and 9 5 2 4 for δ18o no3 n 26 the highest δ15n no3 value 30 3 was observed at sp7 in residential land and the highest δ18o no3 value was at the sewage water 61 3 on the whole the sewage water showed higher δ15n no3 20 9 and δ18o no3 61 3 values than other samples 3 3 3 carbon isotope the values of δ13c dic for sp bh and surface waters ranged from 13 7 to 8 5 mean value 10 8 1 2 n 28 12 1 to 9 6 mean value 11 2 0 6 n 26 and 7 2 to 0 2 mean value 4 1 2 5 n 6 respectively table 2 the surface water exhibited a higher mean δ13c dic value compared with sp and bh waters among the samples the highest δ13c dic values were observed in the amd 2 8 and amd impacted 1 5 waters whereas the lowest was at sp7 in residential land with a value of 13 7 the outlet water displayed a moderate δ13c dic value 6 8 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 hydrogeological characteristics of the karst aquifer 4 1 1 origin of groundwater the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values of water samples were plotted against the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl defined from local precipitation fig 3 to identify the source of water and hydrogeological processes the samples of sp and bh were plotted close to or on the gmwl and lmwl indicating a local meteoric origin of groundwater as expected the most enriched δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values occurred in the surface water with a large variation the outlet water was a mixture of amd impacted river spring and sewage water inputs evidenced by its moderate δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values the slope of the regression line for surface water 4 15 was much lower than that of the lmwl 8 8 falling within the range of 2 to 6 reported as indicative of open water evaporation kehew 2001 merchán et al 2014 the reason might be that the effect of evaporation owing to 18o h2o will be more enriched than 2h h2o during evaporation hu et al 2019 the deuterium excess d δ2h h2o 8 δ18o h2o is used to illustrate the degree of deviation from the equilibrium of isotopic fractionation caused by the kinetic fractionation in the evaporation of vapors torres martínez et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the calculated d excess values of sp and bh ranged from 8 9 to 12 8 mean value 10 6 1 0 n 28 and from 9 9 to 13 3 mean value 11 7 0 9 n 26 respectively similar to the gmwl 10 dansgaard 1964 vystavna et al 2020 this result proved that the impact of evaporation on sp and bh waters was relatively insignificant by contrast the values of d excess for surface water mean sewage amd impacted stream and amd water were 4 6 5 5 n 6 6 4 8 7 and 11 5 respectively these values are much lower than 10 indicating a significant evaporation effect specifically for the amd sample 4 1 2 groundwater transit time the tracer test is a useful method for investigating groundwater flow regimes and contaminant e g no3 transportation processes within aquifers käss 1998 specifically in karst aquifers owing to relatively rapid groundwater flow velocities magal et al 2013 yang et al 2019 the maximum and dominant flow velocities are calculated based on the first detected elevated and maximum tracer concentrations respectively according to the results of the tracer test fig 4 a noticeable increase in the concentration of i was first detected at 16 00 on 07 12 2019 100 h after ki injection moreover the concentration peak was observed at 04 00 on 09 12 2019 136 h after ki injection therefore the maximum and dominant flow velocities from sinkhole s 2 to wo were 38 5 and 28 3 m h respectively which is consistent with reporting in the shuifangquan karst aquifer china 32 2 and 30 2 m h yang et al 2019 the fast velocity may be related to the gradient of slope up to 5 2 between sinkhole s 2 and wo the residence time of the quick pathways was 5 days during the weak hydrodynamic condition husic et al 2020a the single peak curve and high recovery rate 85 based on i concentration and discharge of i indicated a single conduit within the babu karst aquifer from sinkhole s 2 to the outlet 4 2 identification of no3 sources 4 2 1 tincl method the entry of contaminants e g sewage fertilizers and human animal waste into karst aquifers frequently leads to an increase in tin and or cl concentrations in groundwater panno et al 2006a confirmed that the tincl method is effective in screening groundwater contaminants low tin and cl point to the less developed human activities low tin and high cl point to cl containing fertilizer high tin and low cl point to n containing fertilizer high tin and high cl point to animal human waste and moderate tin and cl point to a mixed source panno et al 2006a 2006b panno et al 2006a 2006b set the limits of tin and cl concentrations in karst water at 2 5 and 15 mg l respectively such that anthropogenic origins should be considered if sample concentrations exceed these limits in addition a tin concentration of 15 mg l indicates significant groundwater contamination by human animal waste zhang et al 2014 found that the cl concentrations of most spring water samples were 15 mg l in the il karst watershed usa including those with anthropogenic contamination therefore the researchers asserted that the limit for cl in their study area should be lowered to 7 mg l cl concentrations in the spring water from the babu watershed have a higher variability but the cl concentrations of the springs in forestry land e g sp3 4 21 mg l and sp26 3 53 mg l have lower degrees of human influence at 7 mg l therefore in the presented study the cl limit was also set to 7 mg l background level of groundwater in guizhou province song et al 2019 most of the water sample data were plotted in three sources mixed sources fertilizer and human animal waste suggesting anthropogenic contaminations e g fertilizers manure and wastewater sources tin and cl concentrations in groundwater monitoring boreholes were low indicating an absence of fertilizers and animal human waste noting that the tin concentrations were very high in the two amd impacted samples amd impacted stream 170 12 mg l and outlet water 36 91 mg l as a result of high tin rich amd water 1571 89 mg l input to them 4 2 2 nitrate isotopic indicators in addition to n containing fertilizer and manure and wastewater sources no3 may also be derived from atmospheric deposition ad and son ad includes no3 and nh4 in rainwater in our study area nh4 n concentrations of precipitation were below the detection limit and the concentrations of no3 n were very low with a mean value of 0 38 mg l n 3 table s3 therefore ad is unlikely to be a direct source of n within the watershed region nitrate fertilizer accounts for less than 2 of the n fertilizers applied in china chen et al 2007 in the babu watershed ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 n p k compound fertilizer and manure are widely used in agricultural land thus nitrate fertilizer can be excluded from the sources zhang et al 2018 no3 sources were also identified by comparing δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values measured in the sampled waters of the babu watershed with those of typical values of major no3 sources from literature fig 6a as expected no sample sites fell in the ad and nitrate fertilizer source windows which illustrated that nf son and m s were the three main no3 sources within the babu watershed unexpectedly a measure of highly denitrified sewage sample containing 61 3 δ18o no3 was surprisingly high and such value had not been reported earlier stoewer et al 2015 therefore the range of literature sewage effluent data was extended by our observation being more representative of the site specific isotopic compositions the sewage did not seem to be a major n source due to none of these collected waters had δ18o no3 values of 15 fig 6a based on field investigation we found that the wastewater effluent mainly flowed along with the sewer and then discharged into the babu karst aquifer via sinkhole s 2 fig 1 while we could exclude that extensive sewage inputs anywhere not including the outlet water within the babu watershed it is plausible to assume that particularly in the residential areas infiltration of wastewater from septic tanks and or unsewered farmyards to the soil and epikarst zones may occur locally due to improper disposal of effluent waters this was confirmed by the higher δ15n no3 of 14 3 7 6 n 6 a value typical for m s derived no3 kendall et al 2007 in the residential springs than those observed in the less developed and agricultural regions 5 8 2 2 n 22 the observed watershed outlet water δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in fig 6a fell in the expected range from three no3 sources amd impacted river karst fissure spring sp28 and sewage effluent it should be noted that the outlet water recorded a higher no3 concentration than that of the three identified no3 sources fig 6b this result suggests that more no3 inputs and or no3 production e g nitrification occurred along the karst conduit water flow path see next section 4 3 nitrogen transformation 4 3 1 nitrate and water isotopic indicators the δ18o value of new no3 produced through nitrification which is much lighter than no3 derived from atmospheric deposition and nitrate fertilizers kendall et al 2007 is assumed to be within the range of 10 to 10 15 xue et al 2009 theoretically no3 produced by nitrification obtains one third of its oxygen from atmospheric oxygen 23 5 and the remaining from ambient water böttcher et al 1990 according to eq 3a neglecting kinetic and equilibrium fractionation as shown in fig 7a most water samples displayed δ18o no3 around this value indicating that nitrification was the major biogeochemical process influencing n cycling within the babu watershed compared with the theoretical values fig 7a lower values were observed in the amd impacted stream and two surface waters sr2 and l2 high nh4 concentrations in the amd impacted stream 149 58 mg l sr2 0 28 mg l and l2 9 36 mg l can increase the nitrification rate and use more o from ambient water zaman et al 1999 resulting in a decreased δ18o value of the newly formed no3 furthermore more than 93 of the sp water including outlet water and 100 of surface water including sewage effluent and amd impacted stream shown δ18o no3 values within the range of 10 to 10 expected for no3 formed through microbial nitrification kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 this result further confirmed that nitrification was the major source of no3 in this area moreover the low concentrations of nh4 64 lower detection limit and 93 less than 0 1 mg l supported the isotopic interpretation of complete nitrification in the soil layer and spring water yue et al 2020 some sp and bh samples showed slightly higher δ18o no3 values relative to the theoretical value which may be caused by oxygen exchange between no3 and ambient water with high δ18o values and or result from other biogeochemical processes such as denitrification and assimilation murgulet and tick 2013 denitrification was not a major process impacting the nitrate isotopes in the spring water for the following reasons 1 the estimated slope between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of the spring water slope 0 23 fig s2 was lower than slope between 0 5 and 0 8 which is expected for water to experience a considerable denitrification böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 2 no significant negative relationship was observed between δ15n no3 and ln no3 fig s1a p 0 05 and between δ18o no3 and ln no3 fig s1b p 0 05 which may result from an increase in the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the residual no3 and a decrease in the no3 concentrations during denitrification kendall et al 2007 and 3 high do levels mean value 5 73 mg l except for sp7 and sp10 in spring water were much higher compared with the expected condition for denitrification 2 mg l hu et al 2019 riuett et al 2008 however partial denitrification cannot be ruled out because of local oxygen deficient conditions in certain springs do sp7 1 26 mg l and sp10 1 92 mg l this event explains the observed negative correlations between δ15n no3 and ln no3 and low no3 n concentrations at sp7 and sp10 in the residential area no3 sp7 1 17 mg l and sp10 3 67 mg l stoewer et al 2015 in addition based on the rayleigh fractionation equation denitrification contributed 0 2 n 2 6 8 15 1 n 20 and 46 6 22 2 n 6 to no3 removal in springs from the less developed agricultural and residential areas respectively the results also indicated that denitrification occurred locally particularly in the residential areas where anoxic conditions may occur and degradable organic carbon is available grimmeisen et al 2017 during the sampling period the low soil moisture in the less developed and agricultural areas limited the potential for denitrification resulting in a smaller denitrification extent relative to the chenqi basin mean 23 9 yue et al 2020 we also excluded denitrification as a possible n transformation process in surface water owing to both sr and l samples had do 5 mg l with a mean value of 8 29 mg l not favoring no3 removal through denitrification archana et al 2018 unlike spring water the estimated slope between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 for surface water was up to 1 61 which is much higher than 0 8 high do the presence of nh4 except l1 and low δ18o no3 values favor no3 production through nitrification in addition during the sampling period plankton and algae observed in the biyun lake and surface river might prefer to uptake lighter 16o and 14 n resulting in the increased isotopic values of the residual no3 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2020 in our study it is therefore feasible that the high slope of 1 61 revealed the influence of simultaneous nitrification and assimilation causing a greater enrichment of δ18o no3 than δ15n no3 branching fractionation wankel et al 2007 moreover similar slopes induced through nitrification and assimilation were observed in the pearl river estuary china slope 1 63 archana et al 2018 and in the elkhorn slough estuary usa slope 1 5 wankel et al 2009 no3 in the groundwater monitoring boreholes seemed affected directly by m s leading to higher δ15n no3 values than 8 18 9 5 2 n 26 kendall et al 2007 in bh 1 and bh 2 water fig 7b these borehole samples also showed higher δ18o no3 values of 9 5 2 4 n 26 relative to spring and surface waters table 2 however the cl concentrations were less than 5 6 mg l and below the natural background level 7 mg l in groundwater of guizhou province china fig 5 song et al 2019 this case indicates that the borehole groundwater was less disturbed by anthropogenic no3 sources borehole groundwater experienced insignificant evaporation fig 3 and was unfavorable to the growth of plankton and algae for lacking sunshine thereby ruling out ammonia volatilization and assimilation notably nh4 n concentrations of bh 2 ranged from 0 07 to 0 26 mg l with a mean value of 0 16 0 06 mg l n 15 the total fe concentrations of bh 1 and bh 2 ranged from 0 46 to 8 44 mg l mean value 2 78 2 19 mg l n 11 and from 11 7 to 24 37 mg l mean value 15 92 3 91 mg l n 15 respectively one plausible reason for the presence of nh4 and fe may be attributed to fe0 and or fe ii driven denitrification with nh4 and fe as the by product eqs 9 and 10 hu et al 2019 however δ15n no3 alone is a poor indicator as both fe0 and fe ii driven denitrification cause similar δ15n no3 fractionation and result in increased nh4 n concentrations eqs 9 and 10 one difference between fe0 and fe ii driven denitrification is how the ph of groundwater is affected however distinguishing which reaction is present predominant basing only on nitrate isotopes is still difficult because karst aquifers are a natural ph buffering system ren et al 2021 with the help of δ13c dic these difficulties may be solved see next sections 9 4 f e 0 n o 3 7 h 2 o n h 4 4 f e 2 10 o h 10 8 f e 2 no 3 21 h 2 o nh 4 8 fe oh 3 14 h 4 3 2 dic isotopic indicator guizhou province is populated primarily by c3 vegetation and the δ13cdic value of soil co2 is approximately 24 lang et al 2006 the δ13c dic value of permian and triassic carbonate rocks widely distributed in our study area fig 1 in guizhou province was 0 lang et al 2006 under natural conditions the theoretical δ13c value of dic in groundwater derived from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid would be 12 because of the equilibrium between carbonate dissolution and soil co2 vitòria et al 2008 li et al 2010 ji and jiang 2012 nitrification is a reaction that produces h and enhances the weathering of carbonate rocks according to eqs 3a and 11 resulting in an increase in δ13c dic 12 coupled with a decline in δ15n no3 values from another perspective the hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ration of 2 for eq 11 will shift toward a value of 2 owing to an increase in the ca2 and mg2 concentrations linked to nitrification kim et al 2014 we revealed clear negative correlations between δ13c dic and δ15n no3 in the sp samples fig 8a most of them had a hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ratio of 2 and had a δ13c dic value of 12 fig 8b thus indicating that nitrification was responsible for the n cycling in spring waters 11 2 c a 1 x m g x c o 3 h 2 c o 3 hn o 3 2 1 x ca 2 xmg 3 hco 3 no 3 unlike nitrification fe ii driven denitrification can lead to an increase not only in δ13c dic values and ca2 and mg2 concentrations but also in δ15n no3 values eqs 10 and 11 a significant positive correlation p 0 01 fig 8a between δ13c dic and δ15n no3 values was observed in the bh 2 samples with a hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ratio of 2 and a δ13c dic value of 12 fig 8b confirming the occurrence of fe ii driven denitrification in groundwater monitoring borehole bh 2 thus with the increasing depth of groundwater increasing δ15n for no3 and increasing δ13c for dic were observed in bh 2 fig s3 our data further showed that δ13c dic along with hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ratio added some useful complementary information to n cycling studies particularly in those areas where nitrate isotopic data are not conclusive 4 4 apportionment of no3 sources and nitrification within the karst conduit according to the results of siar model fig s4 the main source of spring no3 was m s 37 followed by nf 32 and then son 31 whereas the main source of surface water no3 was m s 38 followed by son 31 and nf 31 in general results obtained from the siar model were consistent with interpretations based on the measured isotopic and hydro chemical data although one limitation of this method is that the isotopic compositions of no3 source end members were derived from other studies we also believe that further constraints of the isotopic compositions of local end members during different seasons and different hydrodynamic conditions is essential to reduce uncertainties of the siar results torres martínez et al 2020 tracing no3 from its eventual fate back to its origin remains a challenge resulting from the heterogeneity of the karst aquifer system and no3 sources husic et al 2020b in karst areas subsurface and epikarst flow can lose the hydraulic connection with phreatic water after experiencing long rain free days fig 9a during this period nitrated no3 from soil organic n fertilizer and manure and sewage will be accumulated in the soil layer or be temporarily stored in the epikarst zone during rainy days the accumulated no3 can find its way to reach the groundwater table as soon as the soil and epikarst zones are rewetted and are reconnected to the subsurface conveyance channel husic et al 2020b contributing to elevated no3 n concentrations in many karst groundwaters yue et al 2020 in this study the soil and epikarst zones might be disconnected from karst conduit this notion is supported by the following 1 all of the epikarst springs did not flow during the sampling period 2 the recharge and discharge water of this watershed was balance 2 table s4 and 3 the input and output cl fluxes of this watershed was balance 2 table s4 based on this we assumed that no external no3 end members exist along the groundwater flow pathway such as no3 build up in the soil and epikarst zones and or no3 released from the conduit sediments thus we can conclude that no3 in the conduit water was primarily derived from a mixture of three sources karst fissure spring sp28 sewage effluent and the amd impacted stream fig 9b quick flow minimizes the residence time and possible occurrence of denitrification in the karst conduit musgrove et al 2016 husic et al 2021 by contrast nitrification can occur rapidly and the presence of wastewater nh4 can increase the background nitrification rate up to three fold mclaughlin et al 2017 in this study the sufficient supply of do and nh4 table 2 as well as the short water transit time 5 days providing favorable conditions for nitrification to occur wells et al 2018 the occurrence of nitrification in the babu karst conduit was confirmed by the increase in no3 concentration no3 flux and no3 cl ratio in the outlet water with moderate mixed dual nitrate isotope signatures compared with inputs fig 7 b and table s4 shabaga and hill 2010 wells et al 2016 reduced concentrations and fluxes of nh4 and no2 at the watershed outlet relative to the inputs further supported this result table s4 in addition if carbonate weathering is promoted by the nitrification process then no3 and ca2 mg2 concentrations increase eq 10 yue et al 2013 moreover the increased ca2 mg2 flux from inputs 1631 kg d to the outlet 1908 kg d was also observed in our study table s4 all of these pieces of evidence suggested that nitrification occurred in the n contaminated karst conduit the flux of nitrified no3 f nitrified within the conduit can be determined using a three component mixing analysis 12 f nitrified f out f in 13 f out q out c out 14 f in q in sp c in sp q in amd c in amd q in se c in sew where f out is the no3 flux of the outlet water f in are the no3 fluxes from the spring 28 amd impacted stream and sewage q out and c out are the flow and no3 content of the outlet water q in sp q in amd and q in sew are the flows of the spring 28 amd impacted stream and sewage respectively c in sp c in amd and c in sew are the concentrations of no3 in the spring 28 amd impacted stream and sewage respectively the calculated load of the newly formed no3 through nitrification within the karst conduit contributed 51 to no3 flux at the outlet water this 51 is an amazing contributor indicating that nitrification is becoming a new no3 source within karst aquifers with mixed n inputs which may deteriorate the quality of receiving waters such as rivers lakes reservoirs and wetlands in our study the contaminated karst aquifer might act as a hotspot for n cycling rather than n removal and a similar phenomenon was also observed in another contaminated aquifer below the leuna industrial site germany wells et al 2018 note that even with a water balance it is still possible that some of the sewage effluent seeps into the streambeds and that an equivalent amount of epikarst and or matrix pore water flows into the conduit during transport resulting in overestimated nitrified no3 flux at the watershed outlet despite the limitations and uncertainties we highlighted the negative influences of point nh4 rich inputs on karst groundwater characterized by high do levels and a short transit time through nitrification during the base flow periods fig 9 b according to the law of china also same as many other countries the discharge of untreated wastewater into karst aquifers is prohibited and the treated wastewater must meet environmental standards thus domestic sewage and industrial discharges e g amd water in terms of water quality should be monitored and illegal dumplings to karst aquifers through sinkholes and karst fractures must be avoided torres martinez et al 2020 finally the following reasonable steps should be taken 1 increase n uptake efficiency of crops galloway et al 2008 2 improve wastewater e g domestic sewage and amd water and manure management strategies and 3 encourage farmers to use bio based fertilizers tur cardona et al 2018 these above mentioned strategies can mitigate the accumulated no3 in the soil and epikarst zones fig 9a to protect groundwater 5 conclusion water δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and carbon δ13c dic isotopes combined with an understanding of groundwater flow regimes have proven powerful methods in determining nitrogen dynamics in the babu karst aquifer with mixed nitrogen inputs in southwest china water isotopes and the tracer test indicated that the spring and borehole groundwater mainly originated from local precipitation experiencing no significant evaporation and the karst conduit water with mixed sources had a short transit time 5 days m s nf and son were the three dominant no3 sources 37 32 and 31 of no3 to spring and 38 31 and 31 of no3 to surface water respectively evidence from hydro geochemistry and isotopes revealed that nitrification was the dominant n transformation process within this study area whereas denitrification might still occur locally the nitrification in spring water led to the increased δ13c dic values and decreased δ15n no3 values the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and assimilation in surface water caused a greater enrichment of δ18o no3 than δ15n no3 slope of 1 61 the fe ii driven denitrification in groundwater monitoring borehole bh 2 resulted in increased δ13c dic and δ15n no3 values nh4 rich and high do water inputs from amd impacted stream and sewage and short transit time provided favorable conditions for nitrification in the karst conduit resulting in elevated no3 concentration and no3 cl ratio at the watershed outlet up to 51 of the total no3 flux at the outlet was derived from nitrification indicating that a significant degree of nitrification is occurring in the nh4 contaminated karst conduit which may be a new no3 source to receiving waters this study demonstrated that nitrate isotopes combined with carbon isotope are useful means to elucidate n cycling because they can complement each other specifically in karst aquifers compliance with ethical standards funding information this

16376,the nitrate no3 contamination of karst aquifers as an important drinking water reservoir is increasing globally understanding the behavior of nitrogen n in karst aquifers is imperative for effective groundwater quality management this study combined multiple stable isotopes δ2h h2o δ18o h2o δ13c dic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 including hydro chemical data with a tracer test and a bayesian isotope mixing siar model to elucidate the no3 sources and n cycling within the babu karst aquifer in guizhou province southwest china nitrate isotopes and siar model revealed that manure and sewage nitrogen fertilizer and soil organic nitrogen were the three dominant no3 sources in winter contributing to 37 32 and 31 to spring no3 and 38 31 and 31 to surface water no3 respectively the δ18o no3 values of sampled waters ranging from 0 3 to 13 7 mean of 7 7 3 0 n 63 and the significant negative correlations between δ15n no3 and δ13c dic in the spring waters p 0 01 revealed that nitrification was the primary n transformation process in the babu watershed whereas denitrification might still occur locally confirmed by the enriched values of δ15n no3 14 3 7 6 n 6 and high denitrification extent 46 6 22 2 n 6 in the springs from residential areas and by elevated δ13c dic 11 2 0 6 n 26 and δ15n no3 values 18 9 5 2 n 26 in the boreholes during the base flow period point inputs of the amd impacted stream and sewage waters and short transit time 5 days were conducive to nitrification processes in the karst conduit resulting in elevated no3 concentration and no3 cl ratio at the watershed outlet approximately 50 of no3 flux at the outlet was derived from nitrification indicating that a significant extent of nitrification occurred in the nh4 contaminated karst conduit which may be a new

carbon isotope δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic is a useful tool to trace the origins and transformations of dic in karst waters the reason is that more dic from soil co2 new carbon results in a

2009 previous studies showed that even small variations of water transit time also exert an important effect on isotopic and chemical compositions vystavna et al 2020 compared with the pore and fissure aquifers karst aquifers are unfavorable for denitrification because of its fast flow paths and shorter transit time on the order of hours to days husic et al 2020b however denitrification exists in some karst aquifers with different groundwater transporting times such as the laolongdong karst aquifer china yang et al 2020 and the floridian karst aquifer usa heffernan et al 2012 the complexity of the n cycle associated with groundwater regimes makes their interpretation more challenging than previously understood archana et al 2018 thus the knowledge of flow regimes in karst aquifers is imperative for the understanding of the processes affecting local n transformations hosono et al 2013 husic et al 2020a however few studies have combined multiple stable isotopes and hydro

transformation processes the results of this study are beneficial to improve the knowledge about nitrogen sources and dynamics in karst aquifers and can provide valuable information for effective groundwater management strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the babu watershed is located in the mid west of guizhou province southwest china fig 1 a with a population of approximately 30 000 in an area of 18 08 km2 this watershed is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and precipitation of 14 4 c and 1400 mm respectively ren et al 2021 approximately 84 of the annual precipitation falls in the monsoon season may october the watershed is underlain by the longtan changxing p3 l c dalong p3 d yelang t1 y guanling t2 g and jialingjiang t1 j sedimentary rocks comprising interbedded layers of shale coal seams dolostone limestone and mudstone fig 1b ren et al 2021 revealed the existence of many karst features such as karst depressions sinkholes subterranean stream and springs the babu karst aquifer accounts for 85 of the total water resources for the local people in the form of epikarst springs karst fissure springs and subterranean stream waters the subterranean stream mouth is the only drainage outlet of the babu watershed wo including surface and groundwater and the discharge fluctuates between 0 1 and 1 5 m3 s with a mean value of 0 45 m3 s ren et al 2021 land use in this watershed is roughly divided into six categories fig 1c less developed shrubs and woods 37 agricultural 42 residential 8 lake 5 traffic 5

spreads throughout the valleys and hill slopes and the residential area concentrates in the valleys the treated wastewater from local sewage treatment plants showing high nh4 n concentrations 9 82 mg

study showed that the direct connections existed between sinkholes s 1 and s 2 and wo ren et al 2021 thus the design of the tracer test attempted to estimate the groundwater flow dynamics within the karst aquifer rather than to investigate the hydraulic connection between sinkhole s 2 and wo the distance between sinkhole s 2 and wo is 3 85 km potassium iodide ki was selected as a tracer because of the following 1 groundwater from the site wo is pumped to supply drinking water for the local residents 2 background concentrations of i in groundwater not impacted by marine sources are generally expected to be low usually less than 10 μg l zhang et al 2013 ransom et al 2016 and 3 i has very little sorption to sediments and geologic materials ransom et al 2016 a total of 50 kg ki was injected into sinkhole 2 at 11 30 on 03 12 2019 and the tracer test was finished at 12 00 on 18 12 2019 prior to the experiment one groundwater sample was taken from the wo to obtain the initial concentration of i during the tracer test 120 groundwater samples were collected using an automatic sampler jc 8000d china at the babu watershed outlet with an interval of 4 h 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 field

four times with filtered water 0 45 μm prior to sampling three 50 ml volumes of filtered water were placed in polyethylene bottles for laboratory analyzes then one of which was acidified to ph 2 using hno3 for the measurement of cations and the remaining two non acidified were used for anion and nitrate isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 testing the samples used for water isotopes δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o

the bacterial denitrifier method after no2 removal with sulfamic acid the isotopic compositions of produced n2o no3 n2o were determined on delta plus thermo finnigan usa fitted to auto sampler equipment combi pal ctc switzerland and a trace gas pre concentrator unit the analytical quality was controlled by blanks and four international standards usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea n3 and the analytical precision was generally better than 0 1 for δ15n no3 and 0 5 for δ18o no3 respectively xu et al 2016 the carbon isotope of dic was measured by gasbench irms thermo fisher usa after being acidified by phosphoric acid the value of δ13c dic was calibrated using three international standards nbs 18 nbs 19 and nbs 30 and four internal standards gbw04405 gbw04406 gbw04416 and gbw04417 and the analytical precision was generally better than 0 2 isotope values are expressed in delta δ with respect to air n v smow h o or v pdb c 2 4 siar mixing model the bayesian isotope mixing model was widely used to estimate the relative contributions of different no3 sources to sampled waters in aquatic environment xue et al 2012 torres martínez et al 2021 by defining a set of n mixture measurements on j isotopes with k source contributors the siar can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 7 x i j k 1 k p k s j k c j k ε i j s j k n μ j k ω j k 2 c j k n λ j k τ j k 2 ε i j n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of the mixture i i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j sjk represents the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation sd ωjk pk indicates the proportional contribution of source k which needs to be estimated by the siar model cjk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with mean λjk and sd τjk finally εij is the residual error representing the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean zero and sd σj a detailed description of this model can be found in parnell et al 2010 and xue et al 2009 2012 in the present study typical end member isotopic values of nf soil organic n son and manure and sewage m s used in the siar model were derived from chenqi basin another karst watershed in guizhou province of southwest china with similar lifestyles agricultural practices and nitrate sources to our own yue et al 2020 table s1 isotopic fractionation during the denitrification process was incorporated in the siar model the fractionation factor ε is unlikely to be directly obtained from our study due to the weak correlations between δ15n no3 and ln no3 fig s1a and between δ18o no3 and ln no3 fig s1b thus the λjk mean and τjk sd of the fractionation factor were derived from other studies table s1 2 5 rayleigh fractionation method under favorable conditions the extent of denitrification can be calculated using the rayleigh fractionation equation 8 δ r δ 0 ε l n f where δ r represents the isotopic compositions δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 of the residual no3 δ 0 represents the isotopic compositions δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 of the initial no3 f represents the remaining fraction of no3 the low δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 values in the sampled spring assigned as δ 0 and the ε value of 12 4 derived from chenqi basin yue et al 2020 were used to calculated the extent of denitrification 1 f 3 results

characteristics the measured ph values of sp surface water and bh were mildly alkaline with a mean value of 7 40 7 48 and 7 39 respectively the amd water had the lowest ph value 2 65 causing the amd impacted stream and outlet water slightly acidic the do concentrations of sp and surface water ranged from 1 26 to 8 37 mg l and 5 14 to 10 21 mg l with a mean value of 5 43 n 28 and 8 29 mg l n 6 respectively indicating well oxygenated conditions considering no3 the modified piper diagram was adopted to explore the hydro chemical types of each water fig 2 as expected from the karst settings most of the groundwater sp and bh samples were dominated by ca hco3 and or ca mg hco3 types however some sp water samples such as sp5 sp13 sp21 sp23 and sp27 in agricultural land and sp16 in residential land belonged to the ca mg hco3 cl no3 type suggesting anthropogenic pollution e g cl and no3 sources compared with local groundwater the surface water types had higher variability sr1 l3 and l4 ca mg hco3 so4 sr2 ca hco3 l1 ca mg so4 hco3 and l2 ca mg hco3 respectively among the collected samples amd water was characterized by the highest major ions except for hco3 classified in the mg so4 type with the highest ec value the water type of amd impacted stream outlet water and sewage was mg ca so4 ca mg so4 and ca mg hco3 respectively 3 2 nitrogen species the detection rate of no3 n for sp water was 100 with no3 n concentrations ranging from 0 57 to 16 38 mg l mean value 8 16 4 76 mg l n 28 table 2 no3 accounted for 95 of the tin and turned into the major pollutant in the springs indicating that the babu watershed was more susceptible to no3 pollution the highest no3 n 16 38 mg l and nh4 n 0 65 mg l concentrations were observed at sp23 and sp18 and both were from agricultural land the highest no2 n 1 63 mg l value was the sp8 sample in residential land approximately 36 of the sp water samples had no3 n concentrations exceeding the natural threshold for drinking water 10 mg l who and china indicating severe no3 contamination no3 n in surface water ranged from 0 57 to 1 86 mg l mean of 1 21 0 49 mg l n 6 which was much less than that of sp and the highest nh4 n was found close to the residential land 9 36 mg l at l2 the monitoring borehole water recorded the lowest no3 n concentrations mean of 0 83 0 18 mg l n 26 compared with the sp and surface waters the amd water showed the highest nh4 n concentration 1522 89 mg l followed by 149 58 mg l in the amd impacted stream moderate nh4 n 9 82 mg l and low no3 n 0 82 mg l concentrations were measured at the sewage sample notably the groundwater at the watershed outlet was characterized by the highest contaminations of no3 n 18 00 mg l and nh4 n 17 63 mg l relative to the sp bh and surface water samples 3 3 isotopic compositions 3 3 1 water isotopes stable water isotopes in the sp samples varied from 60 5 to 49 1 mean value 54 9 2 4 n 28 for δ2h h2o and 8 8 to 7 4 mean value 8 2 0 3 n 28 for δ18o h2o table 2 less variations were found for bh water samples the outlet water exhibited moderate isotopic values with 54 3 for δ2h h2o and 8 1 for δ18o h2o the surface water samples showed higher isotopic values relative to groundwater ranging from 49 7 to 33 8 mean value 43 8 5 9 n 6 for δ2h h2o and from 7 0 to 3 7 mean value 6 0 1 3 n 6 for δ18o h2o 3 3 2 nitrate isotopes measured mean values were 7 6 5 4 and 6 7 2 5 for spring water δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and 7 6 1 8 and 5 9 3 3 for surface water respectively table 2 no significant difference was observed between spring and surface water by contrast nitrate isotopes were higher in the bh samples with mean values of 18 9 5 2 for δ15n no3 and 9 5 2 4 for δ18o no3 n 26 the highest δ15n no3 value 30 3 was observed at sp7 in residential land and the highest δ18o no3 value was at the sewage water 61 3 on the whole the sewage water showed higher δ15n no3 20 9 and δ18o no3 61 3 values than other samples 3 3 3 carbon isotope the values of δ13c dic for sp bh and surface waters ranged from 13 7 to 8 5 mean value 10 8 1 2 n 28 12 1 to 9 6 mean value 11 2 0 6 n 26 and 7 2 to 0 2 mean value 4 1 2 5 n 6 respectively table 2 the surface water exhibited a higher mean δ13c dic value compared with sp and bh waters among the samples the highest δ13c dic values were observed in the amd 2 8 and amd impacted 1 5 waters whereas the lowest was at sp7 in residential land with a value of 13 7 the outlet water displayed a moderate δ13c dic value 6 8 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 hydrogeological characteristics of the karst aquifer 4 1 1 origin of groundwater the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values of water samples were plotted against the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl defined from local precipitation fig 3 to identify the source of water and hydrogeological processes the samples of sp and bh were plotted close to or on the gmwl and lmwl indicating a local meteoric origin of groundwater as expected the most enriched δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values occurred in the surface water with a large variation the outlet water was a mixture of amd impacted river spring and sewage water inputs evidenced by its moderate δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values the slope of the regression line for surface water 4 15 was much lower than that of the lmwl 8 8 falling within the range of 2 to 6 reported as indicative of open water evaporation kehew 2001 merchán et al 2014 the reason might be that the effect of evaporation owing to 18o h2o will be more enriched than 2h h2o during evaporation hu et al 2019 the deuterium excess d δ2h h2o 8 δ18o h2o is used to illustrate the degree of deviation from the equilibrium of isotopic fractionation caused by the kinetic fractionation in the evaporation of vapors torres martínez et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the calculated d excess values of sp and bh ranged from 8 9 to 12 8 mean value 10 6 1 0 n 28 and from 9 9 to 13 3 mean value 11 7 0 9 n 26 respectively similar to the gmwl 10 dansgaard 1964 vystavna et al 2020 this result proved that the impact of evaporation on sp and bh waters was relatively insignificant by contrast the values of d excess for surface water mean sewage amd impacted stream and amd water were 4 6 5 5 n 6 6 4 8 7 and 11 5 respectively these values are much lower than 10 indicating a significant evaporation effect specifically for the amd sample 4 1 2 groundwater transit time the tracer test is a useful method for investigating groundwater flow regimes and contaminant e g no3 transportation processes within aquifers käss 1998 specifically in karst aquifers owing to relatively rapid groundwater flow velocities magal et al 2013 yang et al 2019 the maximum and dominant flow velocities are calculated based on the first detected elevated and maximum tracer concentrations respectively according to the results of the tracer test fig 4 a noticeable increase in the concentration of i was first detected at 16 00 on 07 12 2019 100 h after ki injection moreover the concentration peak was observed at 04 00 on 09 12 2019 136 h after ki injection therefore the maximum and dominant flow velocities from sinkhole s 2 to wo were 38 5 and 28 3 m h respectively which is consistent with reporting in the shuifangquan karst aquifer china 32 2 and 30 2 m h yang et al 2019 the fast velocity may be related to the gradient of slope up to 5 2 between sinkhole s 2 and wo the residence time of the quick pathways was 5 days during the weak hydrodynamic condition husic et al 2020a the single peak curve and high recovery rate 85 based on i concentration and discharge of i indicated a single conduit within the babu karst aquifer from sinkhole s 2 to the outlet 4 2 identification of no3 sources 4 2 1 tincl method the entry of contaminants e g sewage fertilizers and human animal waste into karst aquifers frequently leads to an increase in tin and or cl concentrations in groundwater panno et al 2006a confirmed that the tincl method is effective in screening groundwater contaminants low tin and cl point to the less developed human activities low tin and high cl point to cl containing fertilizer high tin and low cl point to n containing fertilizer high tin and high cl point to animal human waste and moderate tin and cl point to a mixed source panno et al 2006a 2006b panno et al 2006a 2006b set the limits of tin and cl concentrations in karst water at 2 5 and 15 mg l respectively such that anthropogenic origins should be considered if sample concentrations exceed these limits in addition a tin concentration of 15 mg l indicates significant groundwater contamination by human animal waste zhang et al 2014 found that the cl concentrations of most spring water samples were 15 mg l in the il karst watershed usa including those with anthropogenic contamination therefore the researchers asserted that the limit for cl in their study area should be lowered to 7 mg l cl concentrations in the spring water from the babu watershed have a higher variability but the cl concentrations of the springs in forestry land e g sp3 4 21 mg l and sp26 3 53 mg l have lower degrees of human influence at 7 mg l therefore in the presented study the cl limit was also set to 7 mg l background level of groundwater in guizhou province song et al 2019 most of the water sample data were plotted in three sources mixed sources fertilizer and human animal waste suggesting anthropogenic contaminations e g fertilizers manure and wastewater sources tin and cl concentrations in groundwater monitoring boreholes were low indicating an absence of fertilizers and animal human waste noting that the tin concentrations were very high in the two amd impacted samples amd impacted stream 170 12 mg l and outlet water 36 91 mg l as a result of high tin rich amd water 1571 89 mg l input to them 4 2 2 nitrate isotopic indicators in addition to n containing fertilizer and manure and wastewater sources no3 may also be derived from atmospheric deposition ad and son ad includes no3 and nh4 in rainwater in our study area nh4 n concentrations of precipitation were below the detection limit and the concentrations of no3 n were very low with a mean value of 0 38 mg l n 3 table s3 therefore ad is unlikely to be a direct source of n within the watershed region nitrate fertilizer accounts for less than 2 of the n fertilizers applied in china chen et al 2007 in the babu watershed ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 n p k compound fertilizer and manure are widely used in agricultural land thus nitrate fertilizer can be excluded from the sources zhang et al 2018 no3 sources were also identified by comparing δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values measured in the sampled waters of the babu watershed with those of typical values of major no3 sources from literature fig 6a as expected no sample sites fell in the ad and nitrate fertilizer source windows which illustrated that nf son and m s were the three main no3 sources within the babu watershed unexpectedly a measure of highly denitrified sewage sample containing 61 3 δ18o no3 was surprisingly high and such value had not been reported earlier stoewer et al 2015 therefore the range of literature sewage effluent data was extended by our observation being more representative of the site specific isotopic compositions the sewage did not seem to be a major n source due to none of these collected waters had δ18o no3 values of 15 fig 6a based on field investigation we found that the wastewater effluent mainly flowed along with the sewer and then discharged into the babu karst aquifer via sinkhole s 2 fig 1 while we could exclude that extensive sewage inputs anywhere not including the outlet water within the babu watershed it is plausible to assume that particularly in the residential areas infiltration of wastewater from septic tanks and or unsewered farmyards to the soil and epikarst zones may occur locally due to improper disposal of effluent waters this was confirmed by the higher δ15n no3 of 14 3 7 6 n 6 a value typical for m s derived no3 kendall et al 2007 in the residential springs than those observed in the less developed and agricultural regions 5 8 2 2 n 22 the observed watershed outlet water δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in fig 6a fell in the expected range from three no3 sources amd impacted river karst fissure spring sp28 and sewage effluent it should be noted that the outlet water recorded a higher no3 concentration than that of the three identified no3 sources fig 6b this result suggests that more no3 inputs and or no3 production e g nitrification occurred along the karst conduit water flow path see next section 4 3 nitrogen transformation 4 3 1 nitrate and water isotopic indicators the δ18o value of new no3 produced through nitrification which is much lighter than no3 derived from atmospheric deposition and nitrate fertilizers kendall et al 2007 is assumed to be within the range of 10 to 10 15 xue et al 2009 theoretically no3 produced by nitrification obtains one third of its oxygen from atmospheric oxygen 23 5 and the remaining from ambient water böttcher et al 1990 according to eq 3a neglecting kinetic and equilibrium fractionation as shown in fig 7a most water samples displayed δ18o no3 around this value indicating that nitrification was the major biogeochemical process influencing n cycling within the babu watershed compared with the theoretical values fig 7a lower values were observed in the amd impacted stream and two surface waters sr2 and l2 high nh4 concentrations in the amd impacted stream 149 58 mg l sr2 0 28 mg l and l2 9 36 mg l can increase the nitrification rate and use more o from ambient water zaman et al 1999 resulting in a decreased δ18o value of the newly formed no3 furthermore more than 93 of the sp water including outlet water and 100 of surface water including sewage effluent and amd impacted stream shown δ18o no3 values within the range of 10 to 10 expected for no3 formed through microbial nitrification kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 this result further confirmed that nitrification was the major source of no3 in this area moreover the low concentrations of nh4 64 lower detection limit and 93 less than 0 1 mg l supported the isotopic interpretation of complete nitrification in the soil layer and spring water yue et al 2020 some sp and bh samples showed slightly higher δ18o no3 values relative to the theoretical value which may be caused by oxygen exchange between no3 and ambient water with high δ18o values and or result from other biogeochemical processes such as denitrification and assimilation murgulet and tick 2013 denitrification was not a major process impacting the nitrate isotopes in the spring water for the following reasons 1 the estimated slope between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of the spring water slope 0 23 fig s2 was lower than slope between 0 5 and 0 8 which is expected for water to experience a considerable denitrification böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 2 no significant negative relationship was observed between δ15n no3 and ln no3 fig s1a p 0 05 and between δ18o no3 and ln no3 fig s1b p 0 05 which may result from an increase in the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the residual no3 and a decrease in the no3 concentrations during denitrification kendall et al 2007 and 3 high do levels mean value 5 73 mg l except for sp7 and sp10 in spring water were much higher compared with the expected condition for denitrification 2 mg l hu et al 2019 riuett et al 2008 however partial denitrification cannot be ruled out because of local oxygen deficient conditions in certain springs do sp7 1 26 mg l and sp10 1 92 mg l this event explains the observed negative correlations between δ15n no3 and ln no3 and low no3 n concentrations at sp7 and sp10 in the residential area no3 sp7 1 17 mg l and sp10 3 67 mg l stoewer et al 2015 in addition based on the rayleigh fractionation equation denitrification contributed 0 2 n 2 6 8 15 1 n 20 and 46 6 22 2 n 6 to no3 removal in springs from the less developed agricultural and residential areas respectively the results also indicated that denitrification occurred locally particularly in the residential areas where anoxic conditions may occur and degradable organic carbon is available grimmeisen et al 2017 during the sampling period the low soil moisture in the less developed and agricultural areas limited the potential for denitrification resulting in a smaller denitrification extent relative to the chenqi basin mean 23 9 yue et al 2020 we also excluded denitrification as a possible n transformation process in surface water owing to both sr and l samples had do 5 mg l with a mean value of 8 29 mg l not favoring no3 removal through denitrification archana et al 2018 unlike spring water the estimated slope between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 for surface water was up to 1 61 which is much higher than 0 8 high do the presence of nh4 except l1 and low δ18o no3 values favor no3 production through nitrification in addition during the sampling period plankton and algae observed in the biyun lake and surface river might prefer to uptake lighter 16o and 14 n resulting in the increased isotopic values of the residual no3 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2020 in our study it is therefore feasible that the high slope of 1 61 revealed the influence of simultaneous nitrification and assimilation causing a greater enrichment of δ18o no3 than δ15n no3 branching fractionation wankel et al 2007 moreover similar slopes induced through nitrification and assimilation were observed in the pearl river estuary china slope 1 63 archana et al 2018 and in the elkhorn slough estuary usa slope 1 5 wankel et al 2009 no3 in the groundwater monitoring boreholes seemed affected directly by m s leading to higher δ15n no3 values than 8 18 9 5 2 n 26 kendall et al 2007 in bh 1 and bh 2 water fig 7b these borehole samples also showed higher δ18o no3 values of 9 5 2 4 n 26 relative to spring and surface waters table 2 however the cl concentrations were less than 5 6 mg l and below the natural background level 7 mg l in groundwater of guizhou province china fig 5 song et al 2019 this case indicates that the borehole groundwater was less disturbed by anthropogenic no3 sources borehole groundwater experienced insignificant evaporation fig 3 and was unfavorable to the growth of plankton and algae for lacking sunshine thereby ruling out ammonia volatilization and assimilation notably nh4 n concentrations of bh 2 ranged from 0 07 to 0 26 mg l with a mean value of 0 16 0 06 mg l n 15 the total fe concentrations of bh 1 and bh 2 ranged from 0 46 to 8 44 mg l mean value 2 78 2 19 mg l n 11 and from 11 7 to 24 37 mg l mean value 15 92 3 91 mg l n 15 respectively one plausible reason for the presence of nh4 and fe may be attributed to fe0 and or fe ii driven denitrification with nh4 and fe as the by product eqs 9 and 10 hu et al 2019 however δ15n no3 alone is a poor indicator as both fe0 and fe ii driven denitrification cause similar δ15n no3 fractionation and result in increased nh4 n concentrations eqs 9 and 10 one difference between fe0 and fe ii driven denitrification is how the ph of groundwater is affected however distinguishing which reaction is present predominant basing only on nitrate isotopes is still difficult because karst aquifers are a natural ph buffering system ren et al 2021 with the help of δ13c dic these difficulties may be solved see next sections 9 4 f e 0 n o 3 7 h 2 o n h 4 4 f e

et al 2006 the δ13c dic value of permian and triassic carbonate rocks widely distributed in our study area fig 1 in guizhou province was 0 lang et al 2006 under natural conditions the theoretical δ13c value of dic in groundwater derived from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid would be 12 because of the equilibrium between carbonate dissolution and soil co2 vitòria et al 2008 li et al 2010 ji and jiang 2012 nitrification is a reaction that produces h and enhances the weathering of carbonate rocks according to eqs 3a and 11 resulting in an increase in δ13c dic 12 coupled with a decline in δ15n no3 values from another perspective the hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ration of 2 for eq 11 will shift toward a value of 2 owing to an increase in the ca2 and mg2 concentrations linked to nitrification kim et al 2014 we revealed clear negative correlations between δ13c dic and δ15n no3 in the sp samples fig 8a most of them had a hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ratio of 2 and had a δ13c dic value of 12 fig 8b thus indicating that nitrification was responsible for the n cycling in spring waters 11 2 c a 1 x m g x c o 3 h 2 c o 3 hn o 3 2 1 x ca 2 xmg 3 hco 3 no 3 unlike nitrification fe ii driven denitrification can lead to an increase not only in δ13c dic values and ca2 and mg2 concentrations but also in δ15n no3 values eqs 10 and 11 a significant positive correlation p 0 01 fig 8a between δ13c dic and δ15n no3 values was observed in the bh 2 samples with a hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ratio of 2 and a δ13c dic value of 12 fig 8b confirming the occurrence of fe ii driven denitrification in groundwater monitoring borehole bh 2 thus with the increasing depth of groundwater increasing δ15n for no3 and increasing δ13c for dic were observed in bh 2 fig s3 our data further showed that δ13c dic along with hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ratio added some useful complementary information to n cycling studies particularly in those areas where nitrate isotopic data are not conclusive 4 4 apportionment of no3 sources and nitrification within the karst conduit according to the results of siar model fig s4 the main source of spring no3 was m s 37 followed by nf 32 and then son 31 whereas the main source of surface water no3 was m s 38 followed by son 31 and nf 31 in general results obtained from the siar model were consistent with interpretations based on the measured isotopic and hydro chemical data although one limitation of this method is that the isotopic compositions of no3 source end members were derived from other studies we also believe that further constraints of the isotopic compositions of local end members during different seasons and different hydrodynamic conditions is essential to reduce uncertainties of the siar results torres martínez et al 2020 tracing no3 from its eventual fate back to its origin remains a challenge resulting from the heterogeneity of the karst aquifer system and no3 sources husic et al 2020b in karst areas subsurface and epikarst flow can lose the hydraulic connection with phreatic water after experiencing long rain free days fig 9a during this period nitrated no3 from soil organic n fertilizer and manure and sewage will be accumulated in the soil layer or be temporarily stored in the epikarst zone during rainy days the accumulated no3 can find its way to reach the groundwater table as soon as the soil and epikarst zones are rewetted and are reconnected to the subsurface conveyance channel husic et al 2020b contributing to elevated no3 n concentrations in many karst groundwaters yue et al 2020 in this study the soil and epikarst zones might be disconnected from karst conduit this notion is supported by the following 1 all of the epikarst springs did not flow during the sampling period 2 the recharge and discharge water of this watershed was balance 2 table s4 and 3 the input and output cl fluxes of this watershed was balance 2 table s4 based on this we assumed that no external no3 end members exist along the groundwater flow pathway such as no3 build up in the soil and epikarst zones and or no3 released from the conduit sediments thus we can conclude that no3 in the conduit water was primarily derived from a mixture of three sources karst fissure spring sp28 sewage effluent and the amd impacted stream fig 9b quick flow minimizes the residence time and possible occurrence of denitrification in the karst conduit musgrove et al 2016 husic et al 2021 by contrast nitrification can occur rapidly and the presence of wastewater nh4 can increase the background nitrification rate up to three fold mclaughlin et al 2017 in this study the sufficient supply of do and nh4 table 2 as well as the short water transit time 5 days providing favorable conditions for nitrification to occur wells et al 2018 the occurrence of nitrification in the babu karst conduit was confirmed by the increase in no3 concentration no3 flux and no3 cl ratio in the outlet water with moderate mixed dual nitrate isotope signatures compared with inputs fig 7 b and table s4 shabaga and hill 2010 wells et al 2016 reduced concentrations and fluxes of nh4 and no2 at the watershed outlet relative to the inputs further supported this result table s4 in addition if carbonate weathering is promoted by the nitrification process then no3 and ca2 mg2 concentrations increase eq 10 yue et al 2013 moreover the increased ca2 mg2 flux from inputs 1631 kg d to the outlet 1908 kg d was also observed in our study table s4 all of these pieces of evidence suggested that nitrification occurred in the n contaminated karst conduit the flux of nitrified no3 f nitrified within the conduit can be determined using a three component mixing analysis 12 f nitrified f out f in 13 f out q out c out 14 f in q in sp c in sp q in amd c in amd q in se c in sew where f out is the no3 flux of the outlet water f in are the no3 fluxes from the spring 28 amd impacted stream and sewage q out and c out are the flow and no3 content of the outlet water q in sp q in amd and q in sew are the flows of the spring 28 amd impacted stream and sewage respectively c in sp c in amd and c in sew are the concentrations of no3 in the spring 28 amd impacted stream and sewage respectively the calculated load of the newly formed no3 through nitrification within the karst conduit contributed 51 to no3 flux at the outlet water this 51 is an amazing contributor indicating that nitrification is becoming a new no3 source within karst aquifers with mixed n inputs which may deteriorate the quality of receiving waters such as rivers lakes reservoirs and wetlands in our study the contaminated karst aquifer might act as a hotspot for n cycling rather than n removal and a similar phenomenon was also observed in another contaminated aquifer below the leuna industrial site germany wells et al 2018 note that even with a water balance it is still possible that some of the sewage effluent seeps into the streambeds and that an equivalent amount of epikarst and or matrix pore water flows into the conduit during transport resulting in overestimated nitrified no3 flux at the watershed outlet despite the limitations and uncertainties we highlighted the negative influences of point nh4 rich inputs on karst groundwater characterized by high do levels and a short transit time through nitrification during the base flow periods fig 9 b according to the law of china also same as many other countries the discharge of untreated wastewater into karst aquifers is prohibited and the treated wastewater must meet environmental standards thus domestic sewage and industrial discharges e g amd water in terms of water quality should be monitored and illegal dumplings to karst aquifers through sinkholes and karst fractures must be avoided torres martinez et al 2020 finally the following reasonable steps should be taken 1 increase n uptake efficiency of crops galloway et al 2008 2 improve wastewater e g domestic sewage and amd water and manure management strategies and 3 encourage farmers to use bio based fertilizers tur cardona et al 2018 these above mentioned strategies can mitigate the accumulated no3 in the soil and epikarst zones fig 9a to protect groundwater 5 conclusion water δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and carbon δ13c dic isotopes combined with an understanding of groundwater flow regimes have proven powerful methods in determining nitrogen dynamics in the babu karst aquifer with mixed nitrogen inputs in southwest china water isotopes and the tracer test indicated that the spring and borehole groundwater mainly originated from local precipitation experiencing no significant evaporation and the karst conduit water with mixed sources had a short transit time 5 days m s nf and son were the three dominant no3 sources 37 32 and 31 of no3 to spring and 38 31 and 31 of no3 to surface water respectively evidence from hydro geochemistry and isotopes revealed that nitrification was the dominant n transformation process within this study area whereas denitrification might still occur locally the nitrification in spring water led to the increased δ13c dic values and decreased δ15n no3 values the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and assimilation in surface water caused a greater enrichment of δ18o no3 than δ15n no3 slope of 1 61 the fe ii driven denitrification in groundwater monitoring borehole bh 2 resulted in increased δ13c dic and δ15n no3 values nh4 rich and high do water inputs from amd impacted stream and sewage and short transit time provided favorable conditions for nitrification in the karst conduit resulting in elevated no3 concentration and no3 cl ratio at the watershed outlet up to 51 of the total no3 flux at the outlet was derived from nitrification indicating that a significant degree of nitrification is occurring in the nh4 contaminated karst conduit which may be a new no3 source to receiving waters this study demonstrated that nitrate isotopes combined with carbon isotope are useful means to elucidate n cycling because they can complement each other specifically in karst aquifers compliance with ethical standards funding information this

16377,many nations are taking measures to address the negative impacts of development projects in order to achieve the goal of no net loss nnl of ecosystem services it still faces the most fundamental and critical problem the unified accounting of ecosystem service to address this problem we conducted an emergy based ecosystem service assessment to tackle the challenges and obstacles of current accounting methods and established a new accounting framework to provide a unified measurement for ecosystem service marketing we adopted the credit debit method of wetland mitigation banking and the emergy based method to evaluate the ecosystem services of 82 ecological projects the results have shown that 1 the emergy based credit covers more types of ecosystem services and shows advantages in terms of objectivity accuracy dynamic monitoring and generalization 2 the new accounting method can provide cross scale and cross type ecosystem service 3 the em credit helps to promote the trans regional eco bank system in a large scale and at multiple levels and it can improve the effective supervision and predict the eco bank in a long period graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecological credit emergy accounting wetland mitigation banking gis engineering effect analysis 1 introduction the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem services es a crucial factor in reaching the objectives fixed by the sustainable development goals sdgs and to guarantee the availability of a resource basis for the survival of humans and the biosphere as well as to support human activities wetlands provide food production water supply climate regulation biodiversity and other ecological services in the process of realizing sustainable development goals peng et al 2021 these services are relevant both in relation to sustainable development goals sdgs and as a basis for human survival and socioeconomic development cochran et al 2020 such a relevance was recognized by the literature in particular wetland es provided an economic value of 47 4 trillion while lakes and rivers delivered a value of 5 5 trillion per year mitsch et al 2015 wetlands facing extensive drainage and pollution need to be restored through coordinated large scale plans davidson et al 2019 canning et al 2021 in order to solve the problem of the loss and reduction of ecosystem services many countries have adopted various market based solutions to protect ecosystems daily et al 2009 kinzig et al 2011 wunder and wertz kanounnikoff 2009 these solutions legally require land developers to strictly follow an ecological compensation system which includes avoiding minimizing or offsetting any foreseen impact levrel et al 2017 wetland mitigation banking wmb the largest functioning market in ecosystem services in the united states manages a mechanism for ecological compensation and ecological restoration of wetlands that combines government and market and makes full use of social resources bendor and riggsbee 2011 the purpose of the wmbs is to secure ecosystem services necessary for human survival by resolving conflicts between ecosystem conservation and economic development to preserve dwindling natural resources fox and nino murcia 2005 and to provide compensatory mitigation solutions for multiple upcoming wetland development projects known as preservation enhancement restoration and creation perc credits are the trading media used to represent the ecological gains at a bank site u s and engineers february 2013 wmbs either generate or increase and store the quantified wetland ecosystem service value wetland credits then traded with the projects developers under the supervision of the wetland management agency yan et al 2021 by increasing the chances of success in obtaining compensation for wetland losses shabman et al 1994 wmbs achieved the federal government s goals of no net loss nnl and overall growth resulting in a dynamic balance and even an increase in the number of wetlands across the united states wmbs offers a number of advantages over traditional permitted responsible compensatory mitigation including reduced uncertainty about the ability to successfully offset project impacts reduced permit processing time and more cost effective compensatory mitigation opportunities such compensation market mechanisms have demonstrated the ecological benefits of transforming conservation to management of ecological and environmental resources and their manageability developing an assessment method that measures the ecosystem service value is the critical first step in developing a framework for any trading based mechanism salzman and ruhl 2006 in the case of wmbs it would be necessary to have a more accurate accounting of es to determine the credit values for transactions ruhl and salzman 2006 this unified accounting method must be based on the assessment of impacts and compensations to ensure a transparent measurement and credit grimm 2020 marshall et al 2020 however in the case of es compensation it is currently hard to find the right combination between indicators complexity and their usability marshall et al 2020 maseyk et al 2016 in particular it is very difficult or even impossible to maximize all the benefits of an ecosystem at the same time due to the interactions between different ecosystem services yang et al 2018b in the case of wetlands ecosystem services depend to a large extent on hydrological and geomorphic conditions hruby 2014 more generally different ecological systems on different scales countries cities and plots are nested the interactions among and within the scales are nested as well as their functions yan et al 2020 the wetlands act as complex ecosystems made of interacting components and also interacting with other ecosystems through the flow of resources besides ecosystems require spatial connectivity to maximize the ecosystem services provided maintaining the connectivity between habitats and across wetlands is critical to biodiversity conservation allen et al 2020 however a difficulty arises in defining the boundaries between different ecosystems a correct assessment of ecosystems boundaries is crucial to avoid interventions which might generate an unwanted loss of ecosystem components or functions these difficulties reflect the actual need of identifying the potential existence of multiple ecosystems on which the accurate assessment of ecosystem services changes also depends measuring the variability of ecosystem functions as losses and gains is one of the most complex issues in mitigation banking robertson 2004 still facing the most basic and most critical challenge i e a unified accounting of the value of ecosystem services froger et al 2015 current accounting methods typically based and implemented on regional scale usdep and ace february 2013 vary from state to state and from bank to bank moreover a uniform accounting framework among banks and institutions is still lacking while the es that should be assessed still remain largely undefined robertson 2004 in particular both the measurement of credit and the es types to be covered have not been widely recognized for wmb transactions these problems hamper the generation of mature es markets the promotion of credit based eco banking on a large scale and at multiple levels the implementation of cross regional transactions as well as an effective supervision of credit values on a longer period thus a more comprehensive systematic monitorable and implementable accounting framework for es should be investigated in order to provide a unified framework for decision making at all levels to solve the problems in marketized payments for ecosystem services and to provide a basis in this field for policy making pirard 2012 this work aims at defining a new unified assessment method of credit of ecosystem service in particular the new ecosystem services accounting on which credit accounting is based is derived on a physical basis being universal in terms of metrics and rooted in thermodynamic theory this will provide a more fundamental understanding of ecosystem services and additivity principle to test the new method 82 ecological projects in xixian new area shannxi province china were considered as case study to compare the new method with the traditional credit debit method applied to wmb 2 history operation mechanism practices and problems of wetland mitigation bank 2 1 history and practice of wetland mitigation bank mitigation banks are system of credits and debits developed by regulatory agencies to ensure that ecological losses especially those resulting from various development projects are compensated through the protection and restoration of wetlands natural habitats and streams in other areas easi 2020 the united states wmbs consist of a third party compensation mechanism with clearly defined property rights established under the government s nnl wetland policy supervised and managed by the government in accordance with relevant laws and regulations the section 404 of clean water act cwa requires that discharges to water bodies require a permit prior to any discharge or landfill activity of dredged material the us environmental protection agency usepa adopted it as a national policy under section 404 cwa in 1980 requiring compensatory mitigation for projects that would adversely affect wetlands usepa and ace 2008 the purpose of the wmb is to secure ecosystem services necessary for human survival by resolving the conflicts between ecosystem conservation and economic development with the aim of preserving dwindling natural resources fox and nino murcia 2005 and of providing compensatory mitigation solutions for multiple upcoming wetland development projects known as preservation enhancement restoration and creation perc the market demand is driven by regulations which require those seeking permits to mitigate or compensate for their environmental impact palmer and filoso 2009 the impacts on wetlands and their related losses must be compensated commensurable with gains derived from mitigated sites ideally the customer will buy enough bank credit to cover the lost ecosystem services at the impact site robertson 2004 the type function and quantity of offsets should be ecologically equal to impacts to avoid trade offs between different resources wmbs can apply for wetland credits after completing the set goals of wetland construction or complete construction of wetlands kinzig et al 2011 in particular the evaluation criteria include the number of target floral and faunal communities the restoration status of wetland functions the geographical location and wetland structure in which the wetland is located considering also the existing hydrological conditions stefanik and mitsch 2012 wmbs consist of public commercial banks private commercial banks private non commercial banks mixed commercial banks and single user commercial banks currently private commercial banks account for about 70 of wmbs bean et al 2008 the number of approved wmbs has generally risen each year while the first wmb appeared in 1983 there were only 46 wmbs nationwide in 1992 reaching 3815 currently usace 2009 wetland and river conservation deals per year averaged nearly 3 billion restoring an average of over 73 km of river ecology per year bendor et al 2011 and protecting approximately 369 882 hectares of wetlands and streams usace 2009 between 2008 and 2016 the transaction value of wmbs rose from 2 2 billion to 6 7 billion ola et al 2019 an important factor that eases the successful operation of banks is the joint efforts of all stakeholders with clear transparency and accountability the developed regulation mechanism has begun to emulate financial markets this choice has increased the transparency and standardization of transactions with improved regulatory standards and external investment the success of wmbs has made them the largest and most mature market for trading ecosystem services and they have been replicated globally and have spawned for example biodiversity conservation banks wmbs in terms of institutional innovation and complete market based operation mechanism show to some extent the future trend of wetland mitigation however it still facing the risk of wetland destruction due to lack of long term management robertson 2008 and most basic and most critical problem of the unified accounting of credit measurement froger et al 2015 2 2 current problems in wmb credit assessment 2 2 1 the existing measurement of wmb credit the amount of credit available to wetland banks is determined by the value of wetland ecosystem services the number of credits increased by a bank is based on the quantity and quality of the ecosystem service that are preserved enhanced restored created or established usdep and ace february 2013 there are many explorations on the determining of credit in terms of acreage functional units or some other assessment method table 1 credit calculating methods differ from state to state and even within states such as in the case of alaska where they vary among banks since banks vary in the type and extent of functional lift of resources for calculating credits the ratio method is the most commonly this method is based on the planned acreage for each mitigation activity proposed for the bank site conversion rates in particular the quantification of areal extension constitutes the basis for defining the credit derived from mitigation activities while being simple to understand and easy to apply this method has limited power in assessing the growth and dynamics of es and in drawing a connection between the existing es in impacted sites and in mitigation sites although ecological restoration projects implemented for mitigation purposes may meet legal requirements sometimes based on simple area compensation they may not be able to provide a full set of ecological services compensation palmer and filoso 2009 wetlands perform functions in different ways depends to a large degree on hydrologic and geomorphic conditions brinson 1993 if the impacted sites include the same hydrogeomorphic classification hgm and wetland rating the confidence in determining the amount of compensation credit is higher u s and ace february 2013 many banks use semi quantitative methods to estimate the ecosystem services lift they are typically based on regionally developed function assessment methods such as credit debit method used in washington state u s washington state department of ecology 2013 and the uniform mitigation assessment method umam applied in florida umam is an ecological function based approach that determines wetland credits by assessing the ecosystem services of compensatory wetlands mainly including three aspects of landscape condition hydrologic conditions and community structure as well as further consideration of temporal factors and risk levels after the introduction of mitigation banking the qualitative description provides the evaluation context and benchmark for the quantitative description and the quantitative assessment scores the ecological function indicators based on the wetland construction objectives positioned in the quantitative description on a scale of 0 10 reiss and hernandez 2018 the credit debit method can eliminate some of the conjecture associated with the ratio method and can provide a greater level of confidence in determining appropriate compensatory mitigation since it is based on a rating system that allows comparing credit lost and gained directly in 2 2 2 section we introduce this method and take 82 ecological projects as case study to evaluate the credit 2 2 2 the credit debit method the credit debit method rating wetlands to determine wetland credit hruby 2012 in particular it provides a semi quantitative index that converts the ecological resource status of wetlands into mitigation ratios stein et al 2000 the credit debit method firstly classifies wetlands and then assigns a three level rating low medium high based on wetland water quality improvement hydrological adjustment and habitat function and finally according to the impact point or mitigation point of the ecosystem the credit debit method requires a four step calculation 1 classifying the wetland type based on geomorphic and hydrological characteristics the hydrogeomorphic hgm classification 2 grading the ecological service function 3 scoring the ecological service function 4 calculating credit see fig 1 this method substitutes a rating of three wetland functions and their ecosystem services values including improving water quality flood storage and flow reductions hydrologic function and habitat for plants and animals habitat function the service functions are scored according to the following factors the potential of the site to provide the function site potential the potential of the landscape to maintain each function at the site scale landscape potential the value each function has for society value potential the scoring is qualitatively rated according to three levels of high medium or low representing 1 2 3 points the score of the service is multiplied by the area and risk factor to determine the credit of the wetland the increase in ecosystem services is affected by the mitigation time and there are also certain risks so time needs to be considered risk factors adjust the increment of ecosystem services and wetland credit is equal to the product of the adjusted increment of ecosystem services and area a certain time usually at least 5 to 10 years is necessary to observe the effects of ecological engineering works a study showed that even if mitigation measures are taken at the same time it will take decades or even hundreds of years to fully restore the function of the wetland sheldon et al 2005 generally the risk of failure was compensated by increasing the area of mitigation required the mitigation ratio national research council 2002 2 2 3 the problems of current the measurement of wmb credit a unified accounting of ecosystem services is necessary for assessing wmb credits however the exiting methods cannot be evaluated objectively quickly and conveniently for example credit debit method and the umam are both based on rating different wetland types by assessing their service levels is subjective and often leads to inaccuracy besides they need conduct massive field survey moreover qualitative the system of metric standards for compensating wetland restoration effectiveness has not been standardized it is reported that 31 9 of those involved in wetland mitigation banking felt that the umam method was not very scientific and even 2 1 felt that the method was not applicable at all florida department of environmental protection 2014 the credit debit method also has shortcomings the definition of grades of credit debit method depends on answering different questions for scoring the range of scoring is relatively large and the difference between different grades may be very small if the potential of improving water quality is 7 points and 8 points although the difference is only one point 7 points belong to the medium level m and 8 points belong to the high level h each level is re converted into 1 2 or 3 points in addition this method requires that the scorers must be trained in advance otherwise the scoring results have an average deviation of at least 1 point besides untrained raters will on average underestimate or overestimate the amount of relief required by 15 and the actual difference can be as high as 40 hruby 2014 moreover it is based on a variety of conditional assumptions but certain assumptions have not been extensively tested thompson et al 2013 both the credit debit method and umam rely on the assessor s familiarity and professional judgment of the type of wetland being assessed reiss and hernandez 2018 both require training of the assessor and there is error between different assessors in reality credit assessment of these methods is time consuming and labor intensive not easy to operate and different states and regions have their own set of assessment systems making it difficult to apply uniform standards the use of ecosystem science to define ecosystem services in easily measured abstract units that can be transacted across space without losing their value has proven to be very difficult in practice robertson 2004 based on the above analysis it is urgent to improve the accuracy quantitative full service and comparability of ecosystem services accounting and solve the problems that it is difficult to achieve unified accounting and the challenge the hard to realize the quantitative summation of multiple services across regions 3 methods 3 1 new wmb eco credit accounting method based on emergy finding an inherently uniform measure or scale is key to ecosystem service value accounting according to ecological theory solar energy is absorbed by plants to produce chemical energy stored in organic matter of chlorophyll and the energy is transmitted through the ecosystem in layers through the food chain which is accompanied by plant based and animal based production various systems were evaluated by emergy analysis at different spatial scales lan et al 2002 jiang et al 2007 and including different types of ecosystems he et al 2020 the proposed alternative calculation approach is based on emergy theory which was first proposed in the late 1980s being based on open system thermodynamics and general systems theory odum 1996 the method is also considered as an environmental accounting tool for measuring the contribution of natural resources to economic activities brown and ulgiati 1999 this approach has at least three major advantages for environmental accounting and measurement tian and sarkis 2020 firstly emergy theory is concerned with the donor side meaning that emergy method accounts for the contribution by nature in terms of amount of different resources i e materials energy information supporting the generation and operativity of different natural and anthropogenic processes secondly under this approach the structure and dynamics natural assets and ecosystem services being associated to the availability and use of materials is described in terms of available energy being used cumulatively to support any process this allows the quantification of the environmental workload for each amount or flow of material in non monetary terms through a universal energy metrics yang et al 2019a avoiding the variability of value assessment existing in the case of a monetary valuation finally the different existing forms of ecosystem services correspond to different types of utility are commensurable with each other and can be directly aggregated by emergy based method chen et al 2006 in detail an emergy i e cumulative available energy value can be attributed to flows of resources and to stocks i e system variables when resource flows i e energy per time or power are expressed in their emergy equivalents the resulting quantity is termed empower or emergy per time brown and reiss 2010 in a unified unit of solar equivalent joule sej in this study we adopted solar energy value based on emergy theory as the credit accounting dimension and emergy based eco credit em credit hereafter is defined as the utility of ecological capital service value contained in a certain amount of solar energy the use of solar energy value as a unified unit for ecosystem services breaks through the traditional barrier that different ecosystem services are not summable and facilitates comparative analysis between different ecosystem services in the same region and between the same ecosystem services in different regions thus better unifying the measurement of national ecosystem services and promoting a complete ecosystem project is an organic complex and comprehensive space formed by the interrelated components of water grasses woods etc each component has its own specific material exchange and energy flow between and within the components their functions and services are also different this method takes the solar energy required by each type of ecological resources to provide ecosystem services as a link and combines the ecological resources possessed by various ecological resources such as woodland shrubs high medium low coverage grasslands rivers lakes reservoirs and swamps separately and finally expresses them in em credit a unified unit of solar equivalent joule sej the em credit accounting framework is based on emergy it quantifies the wetland ecosystems according to the vegetations including woodland with trees shrubs grassland with high coverage medium coverage low coverage of grasses water without any vegetation such as lakes rivers swamps reservoirs since each ecological project contains water grasses and or woods see fig 2 the calculation include different fators woods e m d i

this study takes 23 lake oriented and 59 river oriented ecological projects as case study as shown in fig 3 these projects are located in the xixian new area xna which is foud in the border area of xi an and xianyang cities shaanxi province china xna was officially approved by the state council playing an important fulcrum of the belt and road the area of xna is 882 km2 and the area of ecological protection red line is 86 02 km2 accounting for 9 74 of xna the government has been attaching great importance to ecological and environmental protection in particular it has drawn up and implemented the urban water system plan with the investment over 67 00 billion rmb to build wetland systems adding more than 20 00 km2 of water area at present 16 wetland projects have been launched forming 4 00 km2 of wetlands in particular there are 1 28 km2 of trees were planted and 87 07 km2 of seedlings and flowers were planted in recent years the horizontal ecological compensation mechanism has been established in xna it s worth noting that there are many national level historical and cultural protection sites in the new area such as afang palace of qin dynasty chang an city of han dynasty etc more than 100 km2 of this new area are forbidden to be built in order to protect historical sites it is unusual in the world to have such a large area of historic preservation in a city 3 2 2 data source three main types of data were used in this study remote sensing data of land use and land coverage lulc ecological parameters project data from local government planning the lulc data are remote sensing data with a resolution of 30 m 30 m in shaanxi province in 2018 xu et al 2018 the ecological parameters used in the emergy based method accounting mainly include solar radiation precipitation unit emergy value uev digital elevation model dem net primary productivity npp evapotranspiration et and normalized difference vegetation ndm the area vegetation investments of each project used in credit debit method and emergy based method are mainly from the local government planning including water planning and urban planning the data sources are detailed in table 2 notably in the early stages of wmbs implementation some projects emphasized only the positive impacts of mitigation measures and claimed that economic and ecological balance could be achieved within the project implementation period froger et al 2015 stephen and peter 2001 however subsequent studies have found that rapid offsets through artificial restoration have the potential to interfere with the natural build up of biodiversity and thus affect the long term sustainability of wetlands therefore the accounting of em credit also considered the risk factor 4 results 4 1 credits accounting of 82 ecological projects among the 82 ecological projects em credit and credit values differ greatly and the overall distribution trend is similar which is closely related to the area the em credit range from 5 01e 17 sej to 5 00e 21 sej the credit varies 2 29 e 04 acre point to 1 05e 08 acre point as fig 4 a and d show em credit and credit are low despite the size of some projects which is related to the type of mitigation the total and average amount of credit and em credit in river oriented projects differed relatively slightly however they are greatly different among lake oriented projects enhancement of lake oriented projects lifts mostly with 1 22e 17 sej and 2 84e 04 acre point on average with a ratio of em credit and credit of 4 28e 13 restoration of river oriented projects lifts 8 51e 16 sej and 2 58e 03 acre point on average with a ratio of 3 30e 13 creation of river oriented projects lifts 7 04e 06 sej and 2 88e 04 acre point with a ratio of 2 44e 13 overall the ratio ranges from 2 44e 13 to 7 59e 13 4 2 per unit area and cost of credits and em credit lifts in terms of values per unit area the overall characteristics are similar from both the perspective of em credit and credit see figure 5 overall mitigation projects of river oriented perform better than that of lake oriented restoration of river oriented projects are most effective with 2 3e 09 sej per square meter and 2 12e 03 acre point per square meter creation of lake oriented lifts least per unit area from the perspective of em credit with only 2 5e 09 sej m2 however it lifts more than restoration of lake oriented projects in terms of cost we considered the investment of projects enhancement of lake oriented projects was most beneficial with the lowest investment per lifts 2 21e 05 rmb per unit credit or 5 17e 08 per unit of sej the creation of lake oriented projects was costliest with 1 02e 06 rmb per credit or 2 54e 07 rmb per sej from the perspective of credit overall river oriented projects were more economically effective that lake oriented projects however form the perspective of em credit it depends on the mitigation activities overall restoration of river oriented was the most effective mitigation activity since the lifts per unit area is the highest and the cost per unit of lifts is lowest totally with 32 57 billion rmb invested the em credit lifts about 3 54e 17 sej nearly per em credit cost 0 01 rbm credit lifts 1 07e 05 acre point almost per credit cost 305 000 rmb 4 3 dependence of credit estimation of the resolution and quality of ecosystem types data the proportions of the three functions of credit are almost identical whether by wetland type or by mitigation measures fig 6 right side however it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of different types of wetlands different mitigation measures to the improvement of credit from the point of view of em credit among all the mitigation activities the grassland contributes about 45 of ecological projects lift being even higher in enhancement and restoration performance fig 6 left side water and woodland in different types of mitigation measures are functioning unevenly in fact water plays an important role in lake oriented projects especially in creation and restoration activities besides there are at least 8 types of ecosystem services covered by emergy based method where water contributes mostly in microclimate regulation accounting for more than 95 although it has a fewer types of ecosystem services than woodland and grassland the proportion of grassland and woodland of river oriented and lake oriented projects is close in various ecosystem services among them microclimate regulation and reducing soil erosion are the two main portion however air purification groundwater recharge soil formation cannot be ignored for grassland and woodland similarly water purification plays a small but important role in river oriented and lake oriented projects the services of groundwater recharge and water purification in emergy based method are based on the evaluation of water function in generating and supporting ecosystem services measured through by an indicator of water and hydrologic quality improvement in the case of credit debit method it can be seen that the proportion of water function in the overall service in em credit is not large but it is a huge portion in credit habitat accounts for nearly 35 of credit obviously em credit does not show the service of habitat directly but its related indicators such as carbon sequestration and oxygen release soil formation microclimate regulation reducing erosion and climate regulation these indicators are not directly reflecting habitat function but their relationship will be further analyzed in the discussion section 5 discussion 5 1 the relationship between credit and em credit the credit and em credit are significantly different while the overall trend is consistent since the regression analysis shows that em credit and credit have a strong correlation with the r2 0 8556 see fig 7 the highly correlated relationship indicates that the possibility of the em credit being applied in wetland mitigation bank this verifies that the new method has a certain degree of persuasion and substitution compared to the ratio method that is usually defined the area as the credit derived from mitigation activities addition to area both credit debit method and emergy based method consider the field indicators and ecosystem functions importantly they would be used to evaluate functions at both the bank site and the site of impact the size of the circle represents the size of the area the larger the area the higher the value of em credit and credit the area is an important factor affecting its ecosystem services l17 l24 and l25 are the projects on kunming lake which covers more than 10 km2 and plays an important role in the ecosystem of xna their credit varies despite their proximity to each other in geography and size they are all adopted by enhancement activities in different duration this is closely related to what they build leading directly to differences in ecosystem services similarly l11 and l23 although the area is proximity the values of credit and em credit are reversed the same to r13 r16 and r19 this is because of the ecosystem services of both method cover are obviously different and related to the accounting process l19 is a newly built project in 2020 with a width of about 15 m forms a good coastline and fully integrates with commercial and residential land on both sides of the river and l22 is the enhancement project completed in 2017 it lifts the services of improving water quality regulating micro climate and reducing soil erosion significantly 5 2 the advantages of emergy based method the em credit evaluated by new method is more accurate convenient predictable and scalable the value of em credit and credit differs significantly since the ecosystem services covered vary the credit debit method classifies the wetland type and then rates the function level however the emergy based method quantifies the vegetations of the wetlands without any vegetations water with grasses or woods besides credit debit method only covers the functions of water quality improvement hydrological regulation and habitat and they share similarly of credit value it seems to ignore the impact of climate regulation however it is crucial while emergy based method covers eight types of the ecosystem including climate regulation reducing soil erosion air purification water purification microclimate regulation groundwater recharge soil formation carbon sequestration and oxygen release and their contributions significant difference vary from 0 1 to 96 46 indicating different vegetation type of ecological engineering effect quite differently it can be more targeted and selective in mitigation performance of each project water of river and lake projects plays crucial roles in microclimate regulation projects with grasses can reduce the soil erosion and projects with woods can reduce soil erosion and regulate microclimate in addition em credit and credit cover the water functions the em credit of groundwater recharge and water purification contributes only 10 while the credit of improving water quality occupies about 35 and the credit of hydrologic contributes nearly 33 the credit debit method classifies wetlands into multiple types based on their hydrological characteristics but in fact no matter which type of wetland has a variety of plants such as shrubs and grasslands so it causes a large error to measure the grade by counting therefore this method of grading based on subjective judgments superimposes errors in different stages resulting in more errors in wetland credit which cannot truly reflect the value of ecosystem services each service calculated by the emergy based method is quantitatively calculated based on data such as land use and land cover remote sensing data and ecological parameters as table 2 shows the basic data of emergy based method are objective multi scale and long period which is conducive to the provision of ecosystem services will help promote cross regional payments for ecosystem services most importantly it can avoid the error of subjective judgment it takes solar value as a unified dimension of ecosystem services and breaks through the traditional obstacles that cannot be uniformly measured in multiple ecosystems such as mountains waters forests and lakes different ecosystems and their different types of services are compared and analyzed to better measure the national ecosystem services and promote the marketization of ecosystem services it can provide the standard of the ecosystem services between different land uses and promoting to realize the compensation between different types of ecosystem services besides this method can distinguish the differences of different service types in the same ecosystem which is conducive to providing more accurate types of ecosystem services in future ecological banking transactions and both buyers and sellers choose the corresponding ecological product according to its supply or demand 5 3 em credit mechanism the emergy based approach takes solar energy value as a unified dimension of ecosystem services which makes the ecosystems such as mountains waters forests fields lakes sands and other ecosystems and their different types of services summarize this approach that supports the conversion of different input flows in a system into a unified unit of measurement helps to identify appropriate investment and policy measures for decision makers and even corporate and organizational decision makers in the process of urban development land use changes are diverse e g woodland to grassland forestland to wetland or wetland to grassland etc and different ecosystems have similarities or substitutability in some functions payments for ecosystem services system can selectively conduct cross ecosystem transactions not limited to a certain type of ecosystem this will enable the destruction of the ecosystem caused by land use and development which can be compensated in different places through a variety of land use types the application of this method relies on the availability of data the accuracy of the ecosystem service value em credit would be poorer without sufficient quality and resolution of data as in any type of assessment or forecast process this indicates the relevance of maintaining or even improving the collection and storage of observational data based on multi scale and multi parametric approaches lega et al 2018 the em credit based mitigation bank provides a platform for cross regional flows and compensatory services between the supply and demand sides of ecological resources to reduce the loss of ecosystem services caused by human activities through compensation regions and different scales show different spatial heterogeneity and unique functions 5 4 future research on credit accounting the assessment of ecosystem services values related to the social dimension is still difficult to quantify while such kind of data would make the results more comprehensive and convincing although it is based on semi quantitative analysis credit debit method considers the impact of ecosystem services on society in addition habitat as well we have distilled the indicators of social and cultural services as well as habitat from the texts of detailed local planning for the 82 projects in xna listed in table s1 the information of local planning infrastructures landscape pollutant habitat and boating are extension or suffix for em credit accounting as shows in the fig 2 due to the different calculation logic of cultural services we did not include it in the calculation results of em credit yet this information can be used to assess the social or cultural services as was scored the potential of the site valuable to society in the credit debit method this information can be graded and then converted into a proportion using the idea of the credit debit method as shown in fig 6 the functions of the three wetlands assessed by the credit debit method account for similar proportions with habitat function and social value accounting for approximately in addition in some landscape studies various proportions of landscape social and cultural services are obtained through questionnaire survey it can also be assumed that after em credit is quantitatively calculated the credit of social and cultural services is finally calculated according to these proportions riechers et al 2016 it is undeniable that credit of habitat is an important aspect of measuring ecosystem services services such as climate regulation included in em credit are not specific although they are habitat related as for habitat services the npp calculated in this study also includes vegetation fraction vf which reflects the value of habitat to some extent however this study takes npp and vf into accounting of carbon sequestration sediment formation water purification in future applications the proposed method should be improved in terms of biodiversity assessment where emergy based method is used to account the biophysical aspects and economic impacts generated by biodiversity yang et al 2021 it s worth noting that coastal wetlands provide about 135 000 ha year in ecosystem services costanza et al 2021 coastal ecosystem services study based on emergy analysis show that the total service value of coastal ecosystem in the world is about 4 13e 23sej yr liu et al 2021 we believe that the established emergy based framework can also be used to evaluate the value of coastal wetlands however the guidelines of credit debit method indicate that the method is only applicable to freshwater wetlands salinity below 0 5 while it tidal fringe with salinity higher than 0 5 so the method does not evaluate the function of tidal fringe wetlands hruby 2012 besides the study area is inland of china far from the coast the em credit of emergy based accounting framework have not involved the coastal wetlands the service of storm surge controlling played an important role importantly in the accounting framework we did consider tidal energy wave and wind in the accounting of carbon sequestration sediment formation and water purification as the step by step calculating in the supporting information we argue that the credit em credit calculation of coastal wetland even ocean is vital for sdgs their ecosystem services should also be considered and traded in the future as stated in the guidelines of credit debit method untrained raters will on average underestimate or overestimate the amount of credit by 15 hruby 2014 the credit results of credit debit method in this study may also have such errors similarly as a new approach to evaluate the credit of ecosystems it necessary that to establish an open website and publish a series of guidelines 6 conclusion through a comparative analysis we proved that method proposed in this work has advantages in accounting for ecosystem services 1 it embodies abstract services strips away differentiated evaluations of people s feelings and makes the accounting results more objective 2 it improves the quality of accounting for different types of ecosystem services while differentiating the impacts of different ecosystem services with a higher accuracy 3 it provides a monitorable predictable and long term ecosystem service value accounting result 4 it is a time saving labor saving and low cost accounting method based on a reliable approach as assessed by the literature 5 it can provide cross scale and cross type ecosystem service accounting in summary this study believes that the accuracy of the accounting of the credit debit method needs to be improved due to high time and labor costs and the current difficulty to promote it on a larger scale as a quantitative method the emergy based method is easier to promote and more objective holistic and predictable being based on universal physical principles and metrics it helps to exam whether the mitigation process is delivering no net loss and our objectives are achieving thus in the future the proposed method could be a valid alternative to the current credit debit one the possibility to further extend the application of this work depends on the availability and quality of observational data thus we recall the importance of investments in preserving and upgrading the existing observational instruments stations and networks would be beneficial supporting

16377,many nations are taking measures to address the negative impacts of development projects in order to achieve the goal of no net loss nnl of ecosystem services it still faces the most fundamental and critical problem the unified accounting of ecosystem service to address this problem we conducted an emergy based ecosystem service assessment to tackle the challenges and obstacles of current accounting methods and established a new accounting framework to provide a unified measurement for ecosystem service marketing we adopted the credit debit method of wetland mitigation banking and the emergy based method to evaluate the ecosystem services of 82 ecological projects the results have shown that 1 the emergy based credit covers more types of ecosystem services and shows advantages in terms of objectivity accuracy dynamic monitoring and generalization 2 the new accounting method can provide cross scale and cross type ecosystem service 3 the em credit helps to promote the trans regional eco bank system in a large scale and at multiple levels and it can improve the effective supervision and predict the eco bank in a long period graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecological credit emergy accounting wetland mitigation banking gis engineering effect analysis 1 introduction the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem services es a crucial factor in reaching the objectives fixed by the sustainable development goals sdgs and to guarantee the availability of a resource basis for the survival of humans and the biosphere as well as to support human activities wetlands provide food production water supply climate regulation biodiversity and other ecological services in the process of realizing sustainable development goals peng et al 2021 these services are relevant both in relation to sustainable development goals sdgs and as a basis for human survival and socioeconomic development cochran et al 2020 such a relevance was recognized by the literature in particular wetland es provided an economic value of 47 4 trillion while lakes and rivers delivered a value of 5 5 trillion per year mitsch et al 2015 wetlands facing extensive drainage and pollution need to be restored through coordinated large scale plans davidson et al 2019 canning et al 2021 in order to solve the problem of the loss and reduction of ecosystem services many countries have adopted various market based solutions to protect ecosystems daily et al 2009 kinzig et al 2011 wunder and wertz kanounnikoff 2009 these solutions legally require land developers to strictly follow an ecological compensation system which includes avoiding minimizing or offsetting any foreseen impact levrel et al 2017 wetland mitigation banking wmb the largest functioning market in ecosystem services in the united states manages a mechanism for ecological compensation and ecological restoration of wetlands that combines government and market and makes full use of social resources bendor and riggsbee 2011 the purpose of the wmbs is to secure ecosystem services necessary for human survival by resolving conflicts between ecosystem conservation and economic development to preserve dwindling natural resources fox and nino murcia 2005 and to provide compensatory mitigation solutions for multiple upcoming wetland development projects known as preservation enhancement restoration and creation perc credits are the trading media used to represent the ecological gains at a bank site u s and engineers february 2013 wmbs either generate or increase and store the quantified wetland ecosystem service value wetland credits then traded with the projects developers under the supervision of the wetland management agency yan et al 2021 by increasing the chances of success in obtaining compensation for wetland losses shabman et al 1994 wmbs achieved the federal government s goals of no net loss nnl and overall growth resulting in a dynamic balance and even an increase in the number of wetlands across the united states wmbs offers a number of advantages over traditional permitted responsible compensatory mitigation including reduced uncertainty about the ability to successfully offset project impacts reduced permit processing time and more cost effective compensatory mitigation opportunities such compensation market mechanisms have demonstrated the ecological benefits of transforming conservation to management of ecological and environmental resources and their manageability developing an assessment method that measures the ecosystem service value is the critical first step in developing a framework for any trading based mechanism salzman and ruhl 2006 in the case of wmbs it would be necessary to have a more accurate accounting of es to determine the credit values for transactions ruhl and salzman 2006 this unified accounting method must be based on the assessment of impacts and compensations to ensure a transparent measurement and credit grimm 2020 marshall et al 2020 however in the case of es compensation it is currently hard to find the right combination between indicators complexity and their usability marshall et al 2020 maseyk et al 2016 in particular it is very difficult or even impossible to maximize all the benefits of an ecosystem at the same time due to the interactions between different ecosystem services yang et al 2018b in the case of wetlands ecosystem services depend to a large extent on hydrological and geomorphic conditions hruby 2014 more generally different ecological systems on different scales countries cities and plots are nested the interactions among and within the scales are nested as well as their functions yan et al 2020 the wetlands act as complex ecosystems made of interacting components and also interacting with other ecosystems through the flow of resources besides ecosystems require spatial connectivity to maximize the ecosystem services provided maintaining the connectivity between habitats and across wetlands is critical to biodiversity conservation allen et al 2020 however a difficulty arises in defining the boundaries between different ecosystems a correct assessment of ecosystems boundaries is crucial to avoid interventions which might generate an unwanted loss of ecosystem components or functions these difficulties reflect the actual need of identifying the potential existence of multiple ecosystems on which the accurate assessment of ecosystem services changes also depends measuring the variability of ecosystem functions as losses and gains is one of the most complex issues in mitigation banking robertson 2004 still facing the most basic and most critical challenge i e a unified accounting of the value of ecosystem services froger et al 2015 current accounting methods typically based and implemented on regional scale usdep and ace february 2013 vary from state to state and from bank to bank moreover a uniform accounting framework among banks and institutions is still lacking while the es that should be assessed still remain largely undefined robertson 2004 in particular both the measurement of credit and the es types to be covered have not been widely recognized for wmb transactions these problems hamper the generation of mature es markets the promotion of credit based eco banking on a large scale and at multiple levels the implementation of cross regional transactions as well as an effective supervision of credit values on a longer period thus a more comprehensive systematic monitorable and implementable accounting framework for es should be investigated in order to provide a unified framework for decision making at all levels to solve the problems in marketized payments for ecosystem services and to provide a basis in this field for policy making pirard 2012 this work aims at defining a new unified assessment method of credit of ecosystem service in particular the new ecosystem services accounting on which credit accounting is based is derived on a physical basis being universal in terms of metrics and rooted in thermodynamic theory this will provide a more fundamental understanding of ecosystem services and additivity principle to test the new method 82 ecological projects in xixian new area shannxi province china were considered as case study to compare the new method with the traditional credit debit method applied to wmb 2 history operation mechanism practices and problems of wetland mitigation bank 2 1 history and practice of wetland mitigation bank mitigation banks are system of credits and debits developed by regulatory agencies to ensure that ecological losses especially those resulting from various development projects are compensated through the protection and restoration of wetlands natural habitats and streams in other areas easi 2020 the united states wmbs consist of a third party compensation mechanism with clearly defined property rights established under the government s nnl wetland policy supervised and managed by the government in accordance with relevant laws and regulations the section 404 of clean water act cwa requires that discharges to water bodies require a permit prior to any discharge or landfill activity of dredged material the us environmental protection agency usepa adopted it as a national policy under section 404 cwa in 1980 requiring compensatory mitigation for projects that would adversely affect wetlands usepa and ace 2008 the purpose of the wmb is to secure ecosystem services necessary for human survival by resolving the conflicts between ecosystem conservation and economic development with the aim of preserving dwindling natural resources fox and nino murcia 2005 and of providing compensatory mitigation solutions for multiple upcoming wetland development projects known as preservation enhancement restoration and creation perc the market demand is driven by regulations which require those seeking permits to mitigate or compensate for their environmental impact palmer and filoso 2009 the impacts on wetlands and their related losses must be compensated commensurable with gains derived from mitigated sites ideally the customer will buy enough bank credit to cover the lost ecosystem services at the impact site robertson 2004 the type function and quantity of offsets should be ecologically equal to impacts to avoid trade offs between different resources wmbs can apply for wetland credits after completing the set goals of wetland construction or complete construction of wetlands kinzig et al 2011 in particular the evaluation criteria include the number of target floral and faunal communities the restoration status of wetland functions the geographical location and wetland structure in which the wetland is located considering also the existing hydrological conditions stefanik and mitsch 2012 wmbs consist of public commercial banks private commercial banks private non commercial banks mixed commercial banks and single user commercial banks currently private commercial banks account for about 70 of wmbs bean et al 2008 the number of approved wmbs has generally risen each year while the first wmb appeared in 1983 there were only 46 wmbs nationwide in 1992 reaching 3815 currently usace 2009 wetland and river conservation deals per year averaged nearly 3 billion restoring an average of over 73 km of river ecology per year bendor et al 2011 and protecting approximately 369 882 hectares of wetlands and streams usace 2009 between 2008 and 2016 the transaction value of wmbs rose from 2 2 billion to 6 7 billion ola et al 2019 an important factor that eases the successful operation of banks is the joint efforts of all stakeholders with clear transparency and accountability the developed regulation mechanism has begun to emulate financial markets this choice has increased the transparency and standardization of transactions with improved regulatory standards and external investment the success of wmbs has made them the largest and most mature market for trading ecosystem services and they have been replicated globally and have spawned for example biodiversity conservation banks wmbs in terms of institutional innovation and complete market based operation mechanism show to some extent the future trend of wetland mitigation however it still facing the risk of wetland destruction due to lack of long term management robertson 2008 and most basic and most critical problem of the unified accounting of credit measurement froger et al 2015 2 2 current problems in wmb credit assessment 2 2 1 the existing measurement of wmb credit the amount of credit available to wetland banks is determined by the value of wetland ecosystem services the number of credits increased by a bank is based on the quantity and quality of the ecosystem service that are preserved enhanced restored created or established usdep and ace february 2013 there are many explorations on the determining of credit in terms of acreage functional units or some other assessment method table 1 credit calculating methods differ from state to state and even within states such as in the case of alaska where they vary among banks since banks vary in the type and extent of functional lift of resources for calculating credits the ratio method is the most commonly this method is based on the planned acreage for each mitigation activity proposed for the bank site conversion rates in particular the quantification of areal extension constitutes the basis for defining the credit derived from mitigation activities while being simple to understand and easy to apply this method has limited power in assessing the growth and dynamics of es and in drawing a connection between the existing es in impacted sites and in mitigation sites although ecological restoration projects implemented for mitigation purposes may meet legal requirements sometimes based on simple area compensation they may not be able to provide a full set of ecological services compensation palmer and filoso 2009 wetlands perform functions in different ways depends to a large degree on hydrologic and geomorphic conditions brinson 1993 if the impacted sites include the same hydrogeomorphic classification hgm and wetland rating the confidence in determining the amount of compensation credit is higher u s and ace february 2013 many banks use semi quantitative methods to estimate the ecosystem services lift they are typically based on regionally developed function assessment methods such as credit debit method used in washington state u s washington state department of ecology 2013 and the uniform mitigation assessment method umam applied in florida umam is an ecological function based approach that determines wetland credits by assessing the ecosystem services of compensatory wetlands mainly including three aspects of landscape condition hydrologic conditions and community structure as well as further consideration of temporal factors and risk levels after the introduction of mitigation banking the qualitative description provides the evaluation context and benchmark for the quantitative description and the quantitative assessment scores the ecological function indicators based on the wetland construction objectives positioned in the quantitative description on a scale of 0 10 reiss and hernandez 2018 the credit debit method can eliminate some of the conjecture associated with the ratio method and can provide a greater level of confidence in determining appropriate compensatory mitigation since it is based on a rating system that allows comparing credit lost and gained directly in 2 2 2 section we introduce this method and take 82 ecological projects as case study to evaluate the credit 2 2 2 the credit debit method the credit debit method rating wetlands to determine wetland credit hruby 2012 in particular it provides a semi quantitative index that converts the ecological resource status of wetlands into mitigation ratios stein et al 2000 the credit debit method firstly classifies wetlands and then assigns a three level rating low medium high based on wetland water quality improvement hydrological adjustment and habitat function and finally according to the impact point or mitigation point of the ecosystem the credit debit method requires a four step calculation 1 classifying the wetland type based on geomorphic and hydrological characteristics the hydrogeomorphic hgm classification 2 grading the ecological service function 3 scoring the ecological service function 4 calculating credit see fig 1 this method substitutes a rating of three wetland functions and their ecosystem services values including improving water quality flood storage and flow reductions hydrologic function and habitat for plants and animals habitat function the service functions are scored according to the following factors the potential of the site to provide the function site potential the potential of the landscape to maintain each function at the site scale landscape potential the value each function has for society value potential the scoring is qualitatively rated according to three levels of high medium or low representing 1 2 3 points the score of the service is multiplied by the area and risk factor to determine the credit of the wetland the increase in ecosystem services is affected by the mitigation time and there are also certain risks so time needs to be considered risk factors adjust the increment of ecosystem services and wetland credit is equal to the product of the adjusted increment of ecosystem services and area a certain time usually at least 5 to 10 years is necessary to observe the effects of ecological engineering works a study showed that even if mitigation measures are taken at the same time it will take decades or even hundreds of years to fully restore the function of the wetland sheldon et al 2005 generally the risk of failure was compensated by increasing the area of mitigation required the mitigation ratio national research council 2002 2 2 3 the problems of current the measurement of wmb credit a unified accounting of ecosystem services is necessary for assessing wmb credits however the exiting methods cannot be evaluated objectively quickly and conveniently for example credit debit method and the umam are both based on rating different wetland types by assessing their service levels is subjective and often leads to inaccuracy besides they need conduct massive field survey moreover qualitative the system of metric standards for compensating wetland restoration effectiveness has not been standardized it is reported that 31 9 of those involved in wetland mitigation banking felt that the umam method was not very scientific and even 2 1 felt that the method was not applicable at all florida department of environmental protection 2014 the credit debit method also has shortcomings the definition of grades of credit debit method depends on answering different questions for scoring the range of scoring is relatively large and the difference between different grades may be very small if the potential of improving water quality is 7 points and 8 points although the difference is only one point 7 points belong to the medium level m and 8 points belong to the high level h each level is re converted into 1 2 or 3 points in addition this method requires that the scorers must be trained in advance otherwise the scoring results have an average deviation of at least 1 point besides untrained raters will on average underestimate or overestimate the amount of relief required by 15 and the actual difference can be as high as 40 hruby 2014 moreover it is based on a variety of conditional assumptions but certain assumptions have not been extensively tested thompson et al 2013 both the credit debit method and umam rely on the assessor s familiarity and professional judgment of the type of wetland being assessed reiss and hernandez 2018 both require training of the assessor and there is error between different assessors in reality credit assessment of these methods is time consuming and labor intensive not easy to operate and different states and regions have their own set of assessment systems making it difficult to apply uniform standards the use of ecosystem science to define ecosystem services in easily measured abstract units that can be transacted across space without losing their value has proven to be very difficult in practice robertson 2004 based on the above analysis it is urgent to improve the accuracy quantitative full service and comparability of ecosystem services accounting and solve the problems that it is difficult to achieve unified accounting and the challenge the hard to realize the quantitative summation of multiple services across regions 3 methods 3 1 new wmb eco credit accounting method based on emergy finding an inherently uniform measure or scale is key to ecosystem service value accounting according to ecological theory solar energy is absorbed by plants to produce chemical energy stored in organic matter of chlorophyll and the energy is transmitted through the ecosystem in layers through the food chain which is accompanied by plant based and animal based production various systems were evaluated by emergy analysis at different spatial scales lan et al 2002 jiang et al 2007 and including different types of ecosystems he et al 2020 the proposed alternative calculation approach is based on emergy theory which was first proposed in the late 1980s being based on open system thermodynamics and general systems theory odum 1996 the method is also considered as an environmental accounting tool for measuring the contribution of natural resources to economic activities brown and ulgiati 1999 this approach has at least three major advantages for environmental accounting and measurement tian and sarkis 2020 firstly emergy theory is concerned with the donor side meaning that emergy method accounts for the contribution by nature in terms of amount of different resources i e materials energy information supporting the generation and operativity of different natural and anthropogenic processes secondly under this approach the structure and dynamics natural assets and ecosystem services being associated to the availability and use of materials is described in terms of available energy being used cumulatively to support any process this allows the quantification of the environmental workload for each amount or flow of material in non monetary terms through a universal energy metrics yang et al 2019a avoiding the variability of value assessment existing in the case of a monetary valuation finally the different existing forms of ecosystem services correspond to different types of utility are commensurable with each other and can be directly aggregated by emergy based method chen et al 2006 in detail an emergy i e cumulative available energy value can be attributed to flows of resources and to stocks i e system variables when resource flows i e energy per time or power are expressed in their emergy equivalents the resulting quantity is termed empower or emergy per time brown and reiss 2010 in a unified unit of solar equivalent joule sej in this study we adopted solar energy value based on emergy theory as the credit accounting dimension and emergy based eco credit em credit hereafter is defined as the utility of ecological capital service value contained in a certain amount of solar energy the use of solar energy value as a unified unit for ecosystem services breaks through the traditional barrier that different ecosystem services are not summable and facilitates comparative analysis between different ecosystem services in the same region and between the same ecosystem services in different regions thus better unifying the measurement of national ecosystem services and promoting a complete ecosystem project is an organic complex and comprehensive space formed by the interrelated components of water grasses woods etc each component has its own specific material exchange and energy flow between and within the components their functions and services are also different this method takes the solar energy required by each type of ecological resources to provide ecosystem services as a link and combines the ecological resources possessed by various ecological resources such as woodland shrubs high medium low coverage grasslands rivers lakes reservoirs and swamps separately and finally expresses them in em credit a unified unit of solar equivalent joule sej the em credit accounting framework is based on emergy it quantifies the wetland ecosystems according to the vegetations including woodland with trees shrubs grassland with high coverage medium coverage low coverage of grasses water without any vegetation such as lakes rivers swamps reservoirs since each ecological project contains water grasses and or woods see fig 2 the calculation include different fators woods e m d i

this study takes 23 lake oriented and 59 river oriented ecological projects as case study as shown in fig 3 these projects are located in the xixian new area xna which is foud in the border area of xi an and xianyang cities shaanxi province china xna was officially approved by the state council playing an important fulcrum of the belt and road the area of xna is 882 km2 and the area of ecological protection red line is 86 02 km2 accounting for 9 74 of xna the government has been attaching great importance to ecological and environmental protection in particular it has drawn up and implemented the urban water system plan with the investment over 67 00 billion rmb to build wetland systems adding more than 20 00 km2 of water area at present 16 wetland projects have been launched forming 4 00 km2 of wetlands in particular there are 1 28 km2 of trees were planted and 87 07 km2 of seedlings and flowers were planted in recent years the horizontal ecological compensation mechanism has been established in xna it s worth noting that there are many national level historical and cultural protection sites in the new area such as afang palace of qin dynasty chang an city of han dynasty etc more than 100 km2 of this new area are forbidden to be built in order to protect historical sites it is unusual in the world to have such a large area of historic preservation in a city 3 2 2 data source three main types of data were used in this study remote sensing data of land use and land coverage lulc ecological parameters project data from local government planning the lulc data are remote sensing data with a resolution of 30 m 30 m in shaanxi province in 2018 xu et al 2018 the ecological parameters used in the emergy based method accounting mainly include solar radiation precipitation unit emergy value uev digital elevation model dem net primary productivity npp evapotranspiration et and normalized difference vegetation ndm the area vegetation investments of each project used in credit debit method and emergy based method are mainly from the local government planning including water planning and urban planning the data sources are detailed in table 2 notably in the early stages of wmbs implementation some projects emphasized only the positive impacts of mitigation measures and claimed that economic and ecological balance could be achieved within the project implementation period froger et al 2015 stephen and peter 2001 however subsequent studies have found that rapid offsets through artificial restoration have the potential to interfere with the natural build up of biodiversity and thus affect the long term sustainability of wetlands therefore the accounting of em credit also considered the risk factor 4 results 4 1 credits accounting of 82 ecological projects among the 82 ecological projects em credit and credit values differ greatly and the overall distribution trend is similar which is closely related to the area the em credit range from 5 01e 17 sej to 5 00e 21 sej the credit varies 2 29 e 04 acre point to 1 05e 08 acre point as fig 4 a and d show em credit and credit are low despite the size of some projects which is related to the type of mitigation the total and average amount of credit and em credit in river oriented projects differed relatively slightly however they are greatly different among lake oriented projects enhancement of lake oriented projects lifts mostly with 1 22e 17 sej and 2 84e 04 acre point on average with a ratio of em credit and credit of 4 28e 13 restoration of river oriented projects lifts 8 51e 16 sej and 2 58e 03 acre point on average with a ratio of 3 30e 13 creation of river oriented projects lifts 7 04e 06 sej and 2 88e 04 acre point with a ratio of 2 44e 13 overall the ratio ranges from 2 44e 13 to 7 59e 13 4 2 per unit area and cost of credits and em credit lifts in terms of values per unit area the overall characteristics are similar from both the perspective of em credit and credit see figure 5 overall mitigation projects of river oriented perform better than that of lake oriented restoration of river oriented projects are most effective with 2 3e 09 sej per square meter and 2 12e 03 acre point per square meter creation of lake oriented lifts least per unit area from the perspective of em credit with only 2 5e 09 sej m2 however it lifts more than restoration of lake oriented projects in terms of cost we considered the investment of projects enhancement of lake oriented projects was most beneficial with the lowest investment per lifts 2 21e 05 rmb per unit credit or 5 17e 08 per unit of sej the creation of lake oriented projects was costliest with 1 02e 06 rmb per credit or 2 54e 07 rmb per sej from the perspective of credit overall river oriented projects were more economically effective that lake oriented projects however form the perspective of em credit it depends on the mitigation activities overall restoration of river oriented was the most effective mitigation activity since the lifts per unit area is the highest and the cost per unit of lifts is lowest totally with 32 57 billion rmb invested the em credit lifts about 3 54e 17 sej nearly per em credit cost 0 01 rbm credit lifts 1 07e 05 acre point almost per credit cost 305 000 rmb 4 3 dependence of credit estimation of the resolution and quality of ecosystem types data the proportions of the three functions of credit are almost identical whether by wetland type or by mitigation measures fig 6 right side however it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of different types of wetlands different mitigation measures to the improvement of credit from the point of view of em credit among all the mitigation activities the grassland contributes about 45 of ecological projects lift being even higher in enhancement and restoration performance fig 6 left side water and woodland in different types of mitigation measures are functioning unevenly in fact water plays an important role in lake oriented projects especially in creation and restoration activities besides there are at least 8 types of ecosystem services covered by emergy based method where water contributes mostly in microclimate regulation accounting for more than 95 although it has a fewer types of ecosystem services than woodland and grassland the proportion of grassland and woodland of river oriented and lake oriented projects is close in various ecosystem services among them microclimate regulation and reducing soil erosion are the two main portion however air purification groundwater recharge soil formation cannot be ignored for grassland and woodland similarly water purification plays a small but important role in river oriented and lake oriented projects the services of groundwater recharge and water purification in emergy based method are based on the evaluation of water function in generating and supporting ecosystem services measured through by an indicator of water and hydrologic quality improvement in the case of credit debit method it can be seen that the proportion of water function in the overall service in em credit is not large but it is a huge portion in credit habitat accounts for nearly 35 of credit obviously em credit does not show the service of habitat directly but its related indicators such as carbon sequestration and oxygen release soil formation microclimate regulation reducing erosion and climate regulation these indicators are not directly reflecting habitat function but their relationship will be further analyzed in the discussion section 5 discussion 5 1 the relationship between credit and em credit the credit and em credit are significantly different while the overall trend is consistent since the regression analysis shows that em credit and credit have a strong correlation with the r2 0 8556 see fig 7 the highly correlated relationship indicates that the possibility of the em credit being applied in wetland mitigation bank this verifies that the new method has a certain degree of persuasion and substitution compared to the ratio method that is usually defined the area as the credit derived from mitigation activities addition to area both credit debit method and emergy based method consider the field indicators and ecosystem functions importantly they would be used to evaluate functions at both the bank site and the site of impact the size of the circle represents the size of the area the larger the area the higher the value of em credit and credit the area is an important factor affecting its ecosystem services l17 l24 and l25 are the projects on kunming lake which covers more than 10 km2 and plays an important role in the ecosystem of xna their credit varies despite their proximity to each other in geography and size they are all adopted by enhancement activities in different duration this is closely related to what they build leading directly to differences in ecosystem services similarly l11 and l23 although the area is proximity the values of credit and em credit are reversed the same to r13 r16 and r19 this is because of the ecosystem services of both method cover are obviously different and related to the accounting process l19 is a newly built project in 2020 with a width of about 15 m forms a good coastline and fully integrates with commercial and residential land on both sides of the river and l22 is the enhancement project completed in 2017 it lifts the services of improving water quality regulating micro climate and reducing soil erosion significantly 5 2 the advantages of emergy based method the em credit evaluated by new method is more accurate convenient predictable and scalable the value of em credit and credit differs significantly since the ecosystem services covered vary the credit debit method classifies the wetland type and then rates the function level however the emergy based method quantifies the vegetations of the wetlands without any vegetations water with grasses or woods besides credit debit method only covers the functions of water quality improvement hydrological regulation and habitat and they share similarly of credit value it seems to ignore the impact of climate regulation however it is crucial while emergy based method covers eight types of the ecosystem including climate regulation reducing soil erosion air purification water purification microclimate regulation groundwater recharge soil formation carbon sequestration and oxygen release and their contributions significant difference vary from 0 1 to 96 46 indicating different vegetation type of ecological engineering effect quite differently it can be more targeted and selective in mitigation performance of each project water of river and lake projects plays crucial roles in microclimate regulation projects with grasses can reduce the soil erosion and projects with woods can reduce soil erosion and regulate microclimate in addition em credit and credit cover the water functions the em credit of groundwater recharge and water purification contributes only 10 while the credit of improving water quality occupies about 35 and the credit of hydrologic contributes nearly 33 the credit debit method classifies wetlands into multiple types based on their hydrological characteristics but in fact no matter which type of wetland has a variety of plants such as shrubs and grasslands so it causes a large error to measure the grade by counting therefore this method of grading based on subjective judgments superimposes errors in different stages resulting in more errors in wetland credit which cannot truly reflect the value of ecosystem services each service calculated by the emergy based method is quantitatively calculated based on data such as land use and land cover remote sensing data and ecological parameters as table 2 shows the basic data of emergy based method are objective multi scale and long period which is conducive to the provision of ecosystem services will help promote cross regional payments for ecosystem services most importantly it can avoid the error of subjective judgment it takes solar value as a unified dimension of ecosystem services and breaks through the traditional obstacles that cannot be uniformly measured in multiple ecosystems such as mountains waters forests and lakes different ecosystems and their different types of services are compared and analyzed to better measure the national ecosystem services and promote the marketization of ecosystem services it can provide the standard of the ecosystem services between different land uses and promoting to realize the compensation between different types of ecosystem services besides this method can distinguish the differences of different service types in the same ecosystem which is conducive to providing more accurate types of ecosystem services in future ecological banking transactions and both buyers and sellers choose the corresponding ecological product according to its supply or demand 5 3 em credit mechanism the emergy based approach takes solar energy value as a unified dimension of ecosystem services which makes the ecosystems such as mountains waters forests fields lakes sands and other ecosystems and their different types of services summarize this approach that supports the conversion of different input flows in a system into a unified unit of measurement helps to identify appropriate investment and policy measures for decision makers and even corporate and organizational decision makers in the process of urban development land use changes are diverse e g woodland to grassland forestland to wetland or wetland to grassland etc and different ecosystems have similarities or substitutability in some functions payments for ecosystem services system can selectively conduct cross ecosystem transactions not limited to a certain type of ecosystem this will enable the destruction of the ecosystem caused by land use and development which can be compensated in different places through a variety of land use types the application of this method relies on the availability of data the accuracy of the ecosystem service value em credit would be poorer without sufficient quality and resolution of data as in any type of assessment or forecast process this indicates the relevance of maintaining or even improving the collection and storage of observational data based on multi scale and multi parametric approaches lega et al 2018 the em credit based mitigation bank provides a platform for cross regional flows and compensatory services between the supply and demand sides of ecological resources to reduce the loss of ecosystem services caused by human activities through compensation regions and different scales show different spatial heterogeneity and unique functions 5 4 future research on credit accounting the assessment of ecosystem services values related to the social dimension is still difficult to quantify while such kind of data would make the results more comprehensive and convincing although it is based on semi quantitative analysis credit debit method considers the impact of ecosystem services on society in addition habitat as well we have distilled the indicators of social and cultural services as well as habitat from the texts of detailed local planning for the 82 projects in xna listed in table s1 the information of local planning infrastructures landscape pollutant habitat and boating are extension or suffix for em credit accounting as shows in the fig 2 due to the different calculation logic of cultural services we did not include it in the calculation results of em credit yet this information can be used to assess the social or cultural services as was scored the potential of the site valuable to society in the credit debit method this information can be graded and then converted into a proportion using the idea of the credit debit method as shown in fig 6 the functions of the three wetlands assessed by the credit debit method account for similar proportions with habitat function and social value accounting for approximately in addition in some landscape studies various proportions of landscape social and cultural services are obtained through questionnaire survey it can also be assumed that after em credit is quantitatively calculated the credit of social and cultural services is finally calculated according to these proportions riechers et al 2016 it is undeniable that credit of habitat is an important aspect of measuring ecosystem services services such as climate regulation included in em credit are not specific although they are habitat related as for habitat services the npp calculated in this study also includes vegetation fraction vf which reflects the value of habitat to some extent however this study takes npp and vf into accounting of carbon sequestration sediment formation water purification in future applications the proposed method should be improved in terms of biodiversity assessment where emergy based method is used to account the biophysical aspects and economic impacts generated by biodiversity yang et al 2021 it s worth noting that coastal wetlands provide about 135 000 ha year in ecosystem services costanza et al 2021 coastal ecosystem services study based on emergy analysis show that the total service value of coastal ecosystem in the world is about 4 13e 23sej yr liu et al 2021 we believe that the established emergy based framework can also be used to evaluate the value of coastal wetlands however the guidelines of credit debit method indicate that the method is only applicable to freshwater wetlands salinity below 0 5 while it tidal fringe with salinity higher than 0 5 so the method does not evaluate the function of tidal fringe wetlands hruby 2012 besides the study area is inland of china far from the coast the em credit of emergy based accounting framework have not involved the coastal wetlands the service of storm surge controlling played an important role importantly in the accounting framework we did consider tidal energy wave and wind in the accounting of carbon sequestration sediment formation and water purification as the step by step calculating in the supporting information we argue that the credit em credit calculation of coastal wetland even ocean is vital for sdgs their ecosystem services should also be considered and traded in the future as stated in the guidelines of credit debit method untrained raters will on average underestimate or overestimate the amount of credit by 15 hruby 2014 the credit results of credit debit method in this study may also have such errors similarly as a new approach to evaluate the credit of ecosystems it necessary that to establish an open website and publish a series of guidelines 6 conclusion through a comparative analysis we proved that method proposed in this work has advantages in accounting for ecosystem services 1 it embodies abstract services strips away differentiated evaluations of people s feelings and makes the accounting results more objective 2 it improves the quality of accounting for different types of ecosystem services while differentiating the impacts of different ecosystem services with a higher accuracy 3 it provides a monitorable predictable and long term ecosystem service value accounting result 4 it is a time saving labor saving and low cost accounting method based on a reliable approach as assessed by the literature 5 it can provide cross scale and cross type ecosystem service accounting in summary this study believes that the accuracy of the accounting of the credit debit method needs to be improved due to high time and labor costs and the current difficulty to promote it on a larger scale as a quantitative method the emergy based method is easier to promote and more objective holistic and predictable being based on universal physical principles and metrics it helps to exam whether the mitigation process is delivering no net loss and our objectives are achieving thus in the future the proposed method could be a valid alternative to the current credit debit one the possibility to further extend the application of this work depends on the availability and quality of observational data thus we recall the importance of investments in preserving and upgrading the existing observational instruments stations and networks would be beneficial supporting

16378,haloacetic acids haas as a representative category of halogenated disinfection byproducts are widely detected in disinfected water in this work the vacuum ultraviolet vuv sulfite process under n2 saturated conditions was proposed to eliminate a series of haas i e monochloroacetic acid mcaa difluoroacetic acid dfaa trifluoroacetic acid tfaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa etc the in situ generated hydrated electron eaq demonstrated to be the main species to fulfill the initial degradation and dechlorination of mcaa while hydroxyl radicals oh were in charge of the mineralization of mcaa this means that the vuv sulfite system is a combination of advanced reduction and oxidation processes arps and aops a significant enhancement of mcaa removal was observed with increasing ph values from 6 0 to 10 0 and surprisingly k obs correlated well with the proportion of so3 2 as the ph changed this can be explained by the production of eaq from vuv irradiation of so3 2 rather than hso3 and also due to eaq being more stable under alkaline conditions increasing the sulfite dosage also elevated the degradation of mcaa however the addition of certain anions i e chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and nitrate no3 and dissolved organic matter dom inhibited the removal of mcaa to varying degrees the vuv sulfite system was effective toward various types of halogenated disinfection byproducts supporting its broad applicability nevertheless even in real waters the vuv sulfite system was also promising for the simultaneous abatement of haas and other oxyanions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrated electron monochloroacetic acid vacuum ultraviolet advanced reduction process advanced oxidation process 1 introduction haloacetic acids haas are a group of typical

lin et al 2020a pan et al 2014 richardson 1998 although haas are generally observed at low concentrations they may pose a potential threat to human health and natural ecosystems leading to teratogenesis carcinogenesis and mutagenesis li et al 2012c wagner and plewa 2017 the environmental protection agency of united states usepa s stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rule specifies that haa5 sum of monochloroacetic acid mcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa should be controlled at 60 μg l 1 given its wide occurrence and potential impact developing efficient removal processes of haas has become necessary in recent years haas have been treated with activated carbon adsorption membrane filtration electrochemical treatment advanced reduction processes arps etc park et al 2019 vaidya et al 2019 activated carbon adsorption and membrane filtration can remove or enrich haas but cannot decompose them electrochemical treatment could lead to virtually complete dehalogenation of brominated haas however the electrochemical treatment of chlorinated acetic acids was accompanied by the formation of monochloroacetate or monochloroacetic acid mcaa whose direct electrochemical reduction is difficult photochemical decomposition techniques are efficient in removing many chemical toxins and unwanted byproducts liu et al 2020 during the process in situ generated hydrated electrons and hydrogen radicals from electron beam irradiating h2o are effective for the dehalogenation of haas by breaking the c x x f cl br and i bonds which are the main cause of the persistence and biological toxicity li et al 2012b muir and howard 2006 ultraviolet uv radiation covers the wavelength range from 1 to 380 nm uv can be broken down into uv a 380 315 nm uv b 315 280 nm uv c 280 200 nm vacuum uv vuv 200 100 nm and extreme uv 100 1 nm oppenlander 2003 the most common sources for uv radiation are low pressure mercury vapor lamps post development of quartz tubes and germicidal effect of uv irradiation the emission spectra of mercury vapor lamps are concentrated at a limited number of well defined lines i e 254 nm and 185 nm the 254 nm emission lines are widely used for disinfection in field experiments while the 185 nm lines are usually eliminated by using appropriate glass materials such as optical glass or quartz doped with titanium dioxide masschelein 2002 compared to uv radiation alone higher eaq was yielded in uv combined with sulfite li et al 2014 song et al 2013 iodide sarkhosh et al 2019 benzoquinone gu et al 2018 and nitrilotriacetic acid sun et al 2018 among these the uv sulfite system is an attractive option due to its high efficiency and lack of formation of toxic final products of sulfite under natural and even alkaline conditions entezari et al 2019 tan et al 2021 yazdanbakhsh et al 2018 under oxygen free conditions the uv sulfite process generates eaq which eliminates halogenated organic compounds mostly via dehalogenation li et al 2014 li et al 2012b liu et al 2014 liu et al 2013 in the presence of oxygen the uv sulfite process could yield oxysulfur radicals to degrade organic contaminants cao et al 2021 in addition recent studies reported that vuv with a wavelength of 185 254 nm is considered more effective in pollutant decomposition due to the production of high energy photons compared with uv irradiation at 254 nm gonzalez et al 2004 vuv irradiation can generate larger amounts of active radicals eaq h and oh by photolysis of h2o than uv irradiation relevant literature also showed that the vuv lamp had a partial degradation effect on haas under alkaline conditions jun et al 2019 moussavi and rezaei 2017 vuv may be a promising alternative to uv in systems with sulfite gu et al gu et al 2017 reported that the vuv sulfite system showed greater performance in the decomposition of perfluorooctane sulfonate than the uv sulfite system suggesting that vuv sulfite might be a promising process to eliminate halogenated organic compounds however until now there has been no information on the degradation of haas by the vuv sulfite process not even for the detailed kinetics mechanism and influencing factors of this system therefore in this work we will systemically explore the decomposition of various haas including monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa difluoroacetic acid dfaa and trifluoroacetic acid tfaa by the vuv sulfite process the main objectives of this work are to i elucidate the mechanism for the vuv sulfite system and recognize the primary active species in this process by choosing mcaa as the target contaminant ii evaluate the influences of reaction parameters ph and sulfite dosage and water matrix including inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter dom on the performance of the vuv sulfite system and iii estimate the efficiency of the vuv sulfite system toward various haas 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals and reagents in text s1 of the supplementary material sm were at least of analytical grade and used without further purification all solutions were prepared in milli q ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm millipore the fresh stock solution of na2so3 was prepared with n2 saturated milli q water prior to each set of experiments 2 2 experimental procedures as illustrated in fig s2 a new apparatus was designed and fabricated for bench scale photochemical studies the core part of the reactor was a cylindrical and jacketed quartz wall photoreactor length 300 mm outer diameter 40 mm the cooling water circulated through the outer chamber between the two quartz walls ensuring a stable vuv or uv output preventing the lamp tube from overheating while retaining a constant solution temperature the lamp installed on the central axis of the cylindrical photoreactor can be removed and replaced in the experiment two kinds of lamps were used one was an 8 w cold cathode low pressure mercury lamp arc length 200 mm wanhua company zhejiang china the high purity synthetic quartz wall surface emits 185 nm and 254 nm vuv beams called vuv lamps the other was an 8 w cold cathode low pressure mercury lamp arc length 200 mm wanhua company zhejiang china which used an ordinary glass wall that emitted a 254 nm uv beam called uv lamp according to the photolysis kinetics of diluted h2o2 the average effective path length l of ultraviolet photons 254 nm was determined to be approximately 3 02 cm crittenden et al 1999 xie et al 2015 the photon intensity i0 entering the solution from the vuv source at 185 nm was calculated to be approximately 0 153 μeinstein s 1 according to the method described previously sun and bolton 1996 xie et al 2018 another uv lamp that was expected to have a similar photon flux at 254 nm 3 difference as the aforementioned vuv lamp was used as a reference the photon intensity i0 254 nm entering the solution was determined to be approximately 0 153 μeinstein s 1 by using the ki kio3 method rahn 1997 details for the determination of photon intensity i0 at 185 and 254 nm and average effective path length l are shown in texts s2 s4 and fig s1 the reaction solution was circulated using a pump a magnetic stirrer was applied at the bottom of the vessel to reduce the mass transfer resistance between the reactants and the reactive species the temperature of the reaction solution was controlled at 25 0 5 c by a water jacket the solution ph 6 0 10 0 was adjusted with 10 mm h2so4 and 10 mm naoh and the ph change was less than 0 1 during the whole reaction before each set of irradiation experiments the lamp was illuminated for at least 30 min and the solution was purged with n2 for 15 min to completely remove dissolved o2 unless otherwise stated to lower the degradation efficiency of monochloroacetic acid under aerobic conditions fig s3 samples were withdrawn from the reactor at predetermined time intervals and analyzed immediately or sealed in the absence of light 4 c before analysis all experiments were conducted at least in duplicate 2 3

routinely before measurements at room temperature anions were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex a dionex as19 analytical column 4 250 mm and an ag19 guard column 4 250 mm were used to separate cl mcaa and other haas whereas a dionex as20 analytical column 4 250 mm and an ag20 guard column 4 250 mm were selected for the separation of so3 2 and so4 2 total organic carbon was analyzed using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation and dechlorination of mcaa by vuv sulfite system under n2 saturated condition fig 1 shows the degradation and dechlorination of mcaa at phini 9 0 in five systems sulfite uv vuv uv sulfite and vuv sulfite neither sulfite nor uv at 254 nm achieved any degradation or dechlorination of mcaa within 10 min gu et al 2017 jo et al 2011 while the vuv system showed considerable removal of mcaa due to the generation of plausible reactive species i e eaq h and oh eq 1 2 by 185 nm photons splitting water wang et al 2021 it is well known that eaq so 3 and h could be formed in situ during the uv sulfite process eq 3 4 fischer and warneck 1996 li et al 2012b however the uv sulfite system exhibited lower activity than the vuv system which may imply that oh as a strong oxidative species may also play an important role in the removal of mcaa 1 h 2 o 185 nm h oh 2 h 2 o 185 nm h oh e aq 3 so 3 2 hv so 3 e aq 4

constants k obs min 1 of mcaa degradation in the vuv sulfite system were 5 5 fold and 16 5 fold faster than those in the vuv and uv sulfite systems respectively according to the synergistic factor eq 5 yang and zhang 2019 the fvuv sulfite ratio was calculated to be 4 10 and the synergistic improvement was 310 which suggested that vuv sulfite was a promising technique for the abatement of mcaa 5 f vuv sulfite k obs vuv sulfite k obs vuv k obs uv sulfite k obs uv where k obs vuv sulfite k obs vuv k obs uv sulfite and k obs uv are the k obs of mcaa degradation by vuv sulfite vuv uv sulfite and uv systems respectively 3 2 mechanism of vuv sulfite system 3 2 1 degradation pathways of mcaa under n2 saturated condition according to the result from fig 1 the 185 nm emission line presents a tremendous contribution to the degradation of mcaa including direct photolysis and attack from the active species in the vuv sulfite system active radicals can be produced via two main pathways i vuv photolyzes h2o to generate oh h and eaq eq 1 2 and ii vuv activates sulfite to yield eaq so 3 and h eq 3 4 since both reductive and oxidative species were produced in the vuv sulfite system to elucidate the mechanism we examined the intermediates of mcaa during vuv irradiation in the presence of sulfite both acetic acid and formic acid were identified by ion chromatography ic and other intermediates were proposed based on the literature li et al 2012a li et al 2012b mas et al 2005 yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 the mass balance of carbon remained at almost 100 during the whole reaction indicating that all the degradative products of mcaa in the vuv sulfite system were counted as shown in fig s4 and scheme 1 the dechlorination of mcaa to form acetic acid was the first and fast step and the loss of methyl groups from acetic acid to generate formic acid was the secondary and relatively slow step thus we observed the accumulation of acetic acid with increased reaction time fig s4 3 2 2 comparison between nitrogen and oxygen saturated systems according to previous literature the dechlorination of mcaa was mainly caused by the attack of eaq at diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988a li et al 2012b while the degradation and mineralization of acetic acid were due to the attack by oh muruganandham et al 2014 generally oxidative radicals initially attack c c bonds while reductive species favor c x bonds bao et al 2018 it is well established that the quantum yield of eaq under vuv irradiation in an anaerobic environment is higher than that in an aerobic environment and vice versa for oh as shown in eq 6 8 all the reductive species including eaq so 3 and h can be scavenged rapidly with oxygen wu et al 2021 but oxygen can also promote mcaa decay via eq 9 13 fu et al 2011 ye et al 2013 eaq can be quenched by oh at a rate of 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 eq 14 sánchez polo et al 2009 unfortunately the recombination between reactive radicals could possibly result in lower removal of mcaa according to eq 14 15 khan et al 2015 sánchez polo et al 2009 thus we compared the removals of mcaa under anaerobic and aerobic environments to elucidate which is the dominant reactive species eaq or oh 6 e aq o 2 o 2 k 1 9 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 7 h o 2 ho 2 k 1 2 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 8 so 3 o 2 so 5 k 1 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 9 o 2 hv 190 nm o 3 p o 1 d 10 o 3 p o 2 o 3 k 6 0 1 0 34 m 1 s 1

generally the sulfite photochemistry system exhibits arp in the absence of oxygen while it is an aop in the presence of oxygen cao et al 2021 to verify which process is more efficient for haas decay we illustrated the comparison of mcaa decomposition between the oxygen and oxygen saturated systems as shown in fig s3 dissolved oxygen largely inhibited mcaa decay which indicated that the reductive species generated in the vuv sulfite system were mainly responsible for the removal of mcaa since oh is highly efficient for the mineralization of small fatty acids muruganandham et al 2014 to quantify the contribution from oh toc changes were monitored in different systems as shown in fig s5 the toc removals of the vuv and vuv sulfite systems were 36 and 57 respectively remarkably the toc value rarely dropped in the uv sulfite system a previous study yu et al 2019 showed that the uv sulfite system was an eaq driven arp in which the mineralization of mcaa was unsatisfactory interestingly both the vuv and vuv sulfite systems presented appreciable toc removal indicating that the degradation pathways of mcaa in the vuv sulfite system were not the same as those in the uv based system this means that oxidative species play an indispensable role in removal of toc in the vuv sulfite system notably we observed a gradually decreased carbon mass balance with extending reaction time indicating that there might be other products i e sulfoacetic acid and succinic acid generated in the vuv sulfite system 3 2 3 recognition of reactive species and their contributions under n2 saturated condition furthermore we tried to analyze the mass balance of chlorine namely tcl tcl mcaa cl the tcl remained constant at ph 6 0 and 9 0 fig s6 which means that in the vuv sulfite process the chlorine in the mcaa molecule was released in the form of cl through the dechlorination pathway which confirmed the major contribution of reductive species so 3 is considered a mild oxidant and bad reductant with a redox potential e so 3 0 8 v largely higher than eaq e e aq 2 9 v and h e h 2 3 v but lower than oh e oh 2 8 v buxton et al 1988a it was reported that the so 3 hardly dedicated to the dechlorination of mcaa in the uv sulfite system li et al 2012b hence the contribution from so 3 was minor for the dechlorination of mcaa in the vuv sulfite system h attacks the β hydrogen of mcaa to generate h2 rather than the dechlorinated products buxton et al 1988a thus eaq can be safely recognized as the major species for dechlorination in the vuv sulfite system to quantify the contribution of each reactive species produced in the vuv sulfite system species quenching experiments were conducted no2 and no3 are good quenchers for eaq eq 16 17 while no2 reacts more rapidly with h than no3 eq 18 19 buxton et al 1988b li et al 2012b with the introduction of 400 μm no2 or no3 the removal of mcaa tended to be stagnant fig s7 which confirmed that eaq and or h were the main species for mcaa decomposition meoh and tba can be used as effective scavengers for oh k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1s 1 and k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 lin et al 2020b with the introduction of 10 mm meoh or tba the removal of mcaa slightly dropped from 92 8 to 84 4 and 86 4 respectively fig s7 in sum it could be inferred that oh participated in the removal of mcaa although its contribution was minor 16 no 2 e aq no 2 2 k 4 1 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 17 no 3 e aq no 3 2 k 9 7 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 18 no 2 h n o o h k 7 1 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 19 no 3 h n o 3 h k 1 4 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 the contribution r from each reactive species can be expressed as eq 20 20 r k i k obs k i k e aq k h k oh 100 where k i represents k e aq k h or k oh and ʃk obs equals k e aq k h k oh the contribution of eaq h and oh by using the pseudo first order reaction rate constant min 1 r eaq r h r oh and r other species were calculated as 61 1 9 7 27 1 and 2 1 respectively clearly eaq was the primary species for the degradation of mcaa via the dechlorination pathway while oh contributed to minor removal but was the main mineralization of mcaa thus the vuv sulfite system was a technique coupling both arps and aops and its exact working mechanism is displayed in scheme 1a finally all possible degradation pathways of mcaa are proposed in scheme 1b eaq h and oh could decompose mcaa with eaq as the greatest contributor mcaa was initially attacked by eaq leading to the formation of ch2coo radicals and cl li et al 2012a li et al 2012b zhu et al 2015 the ch2coo radical was further transformed to acetic acid via a hydrogenation reaction followed by the cleavage of acetic acid to the ch3 radical and coo through attack by oh wang et al 2020 formic acid was produced from the oxidation of ch3 radicals by oh and it was finally converted to co2 by oh moussavi and rezaei 2017 in addition those in situ formed radicals might recombine producing oocch2ch2coo o3sch2coo and other compounds in the vuv sulfite system li et al 2012b 3 3 effects of major parameters on the vuv sulfite system under n2 saturated condition 3 3 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on the degradation of mcaa was examined through batch experiments as shown in fig 2 the performance of vuv sulfite apparently improved as the ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 mcaa removal increased from 13 1 to 92 8 and its k obs increased almost 20 fold from 0 0137 min 1 to 0 2617 min 1 however further increasing the ph from 9 0 to 10 0 only slightly accelerated the decay of mcaa there was no buffer used for ph control in these experiments and ph values were stable changes in ph values 0 15 due to the buffering of sulfite fig s8 in addition the distribution of sulfite species including so3 2 hso3 and h2so3 also depends on ph eldridge et al 2016 as shown in fig s9 the change in sulfite species fluctuated sharply over a ph range of 6 0 8 5 surprisingly the k obs of mcaa decay correlated well with the proportion of so3 2 when ph changed indicating that the k obs of mcaa decay would be influenced by the distribution of sulfite species fig s10 attributed to i eaq was yielded from vuv irradiating so3 2 instead of hso3 fischer and warneck 1996 li et al 2012b and ii eaq is more stable under alkaline conditions fischer and warneck 1996 fischer and warneck fischer and warneck 1996 also illustrated that reactive reduction products of so3 2 and hso3 were eaq and h respectively which was consistent with our observation hence with increasing ph from 6 0 to 10 0 the proportion of so3 2 became dominant which led to the large formation of desirable eaq species eaq is highly unstable under acidic conditions and is quickly consumed by the coexisting h in the solution with a diffusion controlled reaction rate of 2 3 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988a in the uv sulfite system with eaq as the major reactive species the decomposition of mcaa under alkaline conditions was also faster than that under acidic conditions li et al 2012b in summary more eaq was generated under alkaline conditions due to its satisfactory stability and the dominant proportion of so3 2 hence the vuv sulfite system was more efficient for mcaa decay in alkaline solution than acidic solution 3 3 2 effect of sulfite dosage fig 3 a shows that the removal of mcaa and k obs of mcaa decay increased from 30 9 to 96 0 and from 0 0371 min 1 to 0 3147 min 1 with increasing sulfite dosage from 0 25 mm to 10 00 mm the correlation between the k obs and dosage of sulfate can be divided into two stages fast and slow fig 3b in both the fast and slow stages the decay of mcaa was proportional to the sulfite dosage but with different slopes indicating that the quantum yield of eaq was proportional to the sulfite dosage at both stages song et al 2013 at the slow stage the excessively high concentration of eaq could be consumed by sulfite eq 21 22 liu et al 2015 maza et al 2019 and transformed to other species with lower reactivity to mcaa 21 e aq so 3 2 product k 1 3 1

to so4 2 since there was no so2 in the alkaline solution some so3 2 might be oxidized to other products i e s2o6 2 and o3sch2coo eq 23 24 instead of so4 2 li et al 2012b yu et al 2018 23 so 3 so 3 s 2

aerobic environment however 500 mg l 1 or more sulfate in drinking water will cause some health problems such as diarrhea and dehydration according to the who guidelines cotruvo 2017 since sulfite at 1 mm 80 mg l 1 presented a satisfying performance in the vuv sulfite system 1 mm was chosen as the main concentration in further experiments 3 3 3 effect of coexisting water matrices cl hco3 no3 and humic acid ha are widespread in natural waters and may affect the degradation of mcaa by vuv sulfite in addition eaq shows high activity toward oxyanions i e hco3 and no3 buxton et al 1988a thus it is necessary to investigate the effects of typical inorganic anions cl hco3 and no3 and organic constituents ha on the performance of vuv sulfite as the concentration of cl increased from 1 mm to 8 mm the removal of mcaa decreased from 90 4 to 67 7 fig s12 and its k obs decreased from 0 2359 min 1 to 0 1122 min 1 cl has a high molar absorption coefficient ε at 185 nm ε185nm 3500 m 1 cm 1 which could be provoked to cl by vuv eq 25 han et al 2021 moreover cl could react rapidly with oh to generate other secondary radicals such as clo h and cl 2 according to eq 26 27 fang et al 2014 gao et al 2020 han et al 2021 who cannot decompose mcaa thus the existence of cl had a negative effect on mcaa degradation in the vuv sulfite process similarly hco3 also had an inhibitive effect on mcaa decay fig s13 vuv had a slight influence on hco3 due to its relatively weak absorption at 185 nm ε185nm 269 m 1 cm 1 duca et al 2017 however hco3 can scavenge oh to form co 3 eq 28 sayed et al 2016 which are less reactive than oh resulting in decreased degradation of mcaa of course hco3 also reacts with eaq but at a slow rate of 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988a suggesting that the inhibition caused by hco3 was mainly from the quenching of oh 25 c l 185 nm c l e aq φ 0 4 26 c l oh clo h k 4 3 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 27 c l c l cl 2 k 6 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 k 1 1 1 0 5 m 1 s 1 28 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o k 1 0 1 0 7 m 1 s 1 with increasing no3 concentration the degradation of mcaa was inhibited linearly fig 4 no3 reacts with eaq 10 fold faster than mcaa buxton et al 1988a making much eaq trapped by no3 instead of mcaa no3 was gradually reduced to no2 by eaq and then to nh3 which was finally reduced to n2 eq 29 31 yu 2018 other studies also suggested that no2 was first reduced to no by eaq and then no reacted rapidly with h to form n2o and h2o finally n2o could be reduced to n2 eq 32 34 buxton et al 1988a li et al 2012b teng 2014 in our study continuous n2 flow could blow off the nh3 in the alkaline solution hence the observed ammonia concentration might be lower than its real production it should be noted that no3 also absorbs photons strongly under uv or vuv irradiation leading to the lower formation of reactive species namely eaq and oh considering that both mcaa and nitrate nitrite can be removed the vuv sulfite process is a promising technology not only for the degradation of haas but also for denitrification via photochemical processes 29 no 3 2 h 2 e aq hv no 2 h 2 o 30 no 2 7 h 6 e aq hv n h 3 2 h 2 o 31 2 n h 3 6 h 6 e aq hv n 2 6 h 2 32 no 2 h 2 o 2 e aq n o 2 o h 33 2 n o 2 h

and then generate singlet oxygen 1o2 eq 36 lester et al 2013 dom and its singlet or triplet excited species would also transform to a charge transfer state dom by photon radiation according to eq 37 39 which could react with o2 to generate h2o2 eq 40 41 dalrymple et al 2010 1o2 and h2o2 quench reductive species i e eaq and h leading to lower degradation of mcaa directly 35 dom hv 1 dom 3 dom 36 o

would lower the efficiency of the vuv sulfite system but with distinct reaction mechanisms cl and hco3 consumed oh converting to secondary radicals such as clo h cl 2 and co 3 whose reactivity toward mcaa was much lower than oh no3 as a representative oxyanion would largely consume the major reactive species eaq with itself being reduced to ammonia or nitrogen gas for dom oxidative species 1o2 and h2o2 might be formed under vuv irradiation which could scavenge eaq rapidly in addition both no3 and dom have a strong molar ratio for the vuv which would lower the production of photons and the yield of eaq and oh hence the degradation of mcaa declined significantly in the presence of cl hco3 no3 and dom the performance of vuv sulfite in two tapwaters obtained in the laboratory and dormitory and the parameters are presented in table s2 was examined fig s15 the degradation of mcaa in tapwater was lower than that in pure water the reasons were summarized as below i the ratio of so3 2 species in tapwater was lower than that in pure water due to the lower ph value of tapwater leading to a lower yield of eaq ii the anions i e cl hco3 and no3 and dom in tapwater inhibited mcaa decay iii residual disinfectant namely hclo clo in tapwater also consumed so3 2 resulting in a lower concentration of so3 2 thus the reaction time should be prolonged to obtain a comparable removal of mcaa when the vuv sulfite system is applied to real water treatment 3 4 broad spectrum of vuv sulfite under n2 saturated condition toward various haas to investigate the broad spectrum of the vuv sulfite system we examined the decomposition and dehalogenation of haas with different haloid substituents and halogenation degrees difluoroacetic acid dfaa trifluoroacetic acid tfaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa and mcaa were chosen as model compounds the degradation rates of haas increased with increasing halogenation degree i e trihalogenated haas dihalogenated haas monohalogenated haas jo et al 2011 and increasing molecular weight of halogens i e br cl f haas wang et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the vuv sulfite system was only ineffective against fluoroacetic acid i e tfaa and dfaa among the seven haas which are not widely detected in the conventional disinfection process except for fluoroacetic acids mcaa as the most resistant haas was found to be relatively retarded whereas tbaa was recognized to be the most vulnerable species to the vuv sulfite system fig 5 this can be explained by the following 3 reasons i the bond dissociation energy of carbon halogen c x ranked as c f 485 kj mol 1 c cl 397 kj mol 1 c br 280 kj mol 1 xiao et al 2014 ii chlorinated compounds with higher vuv uv absorbing capacity displayed higher degradation xiao et al 2016 and iii the steric and electronic effects of halogens resulted in different electron withdrawing efficacies wang et al 2017 the vuv sulfite system is a broad spectrum technique for most haas and a promising water treatment technology 4 conclusion this study investigated the degradation and dehalogenation of mcaa and six others haas by the vuv sulfite system compared with previously reported results i e uv sulfite vuv the combination of vuv and sulfite significantly improved the degradation of mcaa the vuv sulfite system was a technique coupling both arps and aops with eaq as the primary reactive species and oh as the secondary reactive species eaq causes the dehalogenation of haas while oh leads to the mineralization of dehalogenated products the first order reaction rate k obs of mcaa degradation increased sharply as the ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 and surprisingly k obs correlated well with the proportion of so3 2 as the ph changed this can be explained by that i eaq was yielded from vuv irradiating so3 2 instead of hso3 and ii eaq is more stable under alkaline the existence of ha and no3 significantly inhibited the decomposition of mcaa while cl and hco3 showed relatively weak inhibition thus the performance of the vuv sulfite system in real tap waters was lower than that in pure water due to the lower ph of tap waters and hence the lower proportion of so3 2 and higher quenching of eaq by h the vuv sulfite system is a broad spectrum technique with the degradative kinetics of seven haas increasing with the increasing halogenation degree and the rising molecular weight of halogens i e br cl f haas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

16378,haloacetic acids haas as a representative category of halogenated disinfection byproducts are widely detected in disinfected water in this work the vacuum ultraviolet vuv sulfite process under n2 saturated conditions was proposed to eliminate a series of haas i e monochloroacetic acid mcaa difluoroacetic acid dfaa trifluoroacetic acid tfaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa etc the in situ generated hydrated electron eaq demonstrated to be the main species to fulfill the initial degradation and dechlorination of mcaa while hydroxyl radicals oh were in charge of the mineralization of mcaa this means that the vuv sulfite system is a combination of advanced reduction and oxidation processes arps and aops a significant enhancement of mcaa removal was observed with increasing ph values from 6 0 to 10 0 and surprisingly k obs correlated well with the proportion of so3 2 as the ph changed this can be explained by the production of eaq from vuv irradiation of so3 2 rather than hso3 and also due to eaq being more stable under alkaline conditions increasing the sulfite dosage also elevated the degradation of mcaa however the addition of certain anions i e chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and nitrate no3 and dissolved organic matter dom inhibited the removal of mcaa to varying degrees the vuv sulfite system was effective toward various types of halogenated disinfection byproducts supporting its broad applicability nevertheless even in real waters the vuv sulfite system was also promising for the simultaneous abatement of haas and other oxyanions graphical abstract image

lin et al 2020a pan et al 2014 richardson 1998 although haas are generally observed at low concentrations they may pose a potential threat to human health and natural ecosystems leading to teratogenesis carcinogenesis and mutagenesis li et al 2012c wagner and plewa 2017 the environmental protection agency of united states usepa s stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rule specifies that haa5 sum of monochloroacetic acid mcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa should be controlled at 60 μg l 1 given its wide occurrence and potential impact developing efficient removal processes of haas has become necessary in recent years haas have been treated with activated carbon adsorption membrane filtration electrochemical treatment advanced reduction processes arps etc park et al 2019 vaidya et al 2019 activated carbon adsorption and membrane filtration can remove or enrich haas but cannot decompose them electrochemical treatment could lead to virtually complete dehalogenation of brominated haas however the electrochemical treatment of chlorinated acetic acids was accompanied by the formation of monochloroacetate or monochloroacetic acid mcaa whose direct electrochemical reduction is difficult photochemical decomposition techniques are efficient in removing many chemical toxins and unwanted byproducts liu et al 2020 during the process in situ generated hydrated electrons and hydrogen radicals from electron beam irradiating h2o are effective for the dehalogenation of haas by breaking the c x x f cl br and i bonds which are the main cause of the persistence and biological toxicity li et al 2012b muir and howard 2006 ultraviolet uv radiation covers the wavelength range from 1 to 380 nm uv can be broken down into uv a 380 315 nm uv b 315 280 nm uv c 280 200 nm vacuum uv vuv 200 100 nm and extreme uv 100 1 nm oppenlander 2003 the most common sources for uv radiation are low pressure mercury vapor lamps post development of quartz tubes and germicidal effect of uv irradiation the emission spectra of mercury vapor lamps are concentrated at a limited number of well defined lines i e 254 nm and 185 nm the 254 nm emission lines are widely used for disinfection in field experiments while the 185 nm lines are usually eliminated by using appropriate glass materials such as optical glass or quartz doped with titanium dioxide masschelein 2002 compared to uv radiation alone higher eaq was yielded in uv combined with sulfite li et al 2014 song et al 2013 iodide sarkhosh et al 2019 benzoquinone gu et al 2018 and nitrilotriacetic acid sun et al 2018 among these the uv sulfite system is an attractive option due to its high efficiency and lack of formation of toxic final products of sulfite under natural and even alkaline conditions entezari et al 2019 tan et al 2021 yazdanbakhsh et al 2018 under oxygen free conditions the uv sulfite process generates eaq which eliminates halogenated organic compounds mostly via dehalogenation li et al 2014 li et al 2012b liu et al 2014 liu et al 2013 in the presence of oxygen the uv sulfite process could yield oxysulfur radicals to degrade organic contaminants cao et al 2021 in addition recent studies reported that vuv with a wavelength of 185 254 nm is considered more effective in pollutant decomposition due to the production of high energy photons compared with uv irradiation at 254 nm gonzalez et al 2004 vuv irradiation can generate larger amounts of active radicals eaq h and oh by photolysis of h2o than uv irradiation relevant literature also showed that the vuv lamp had a partial degradation effect on haas under alkaline conditions jun et al 2019 moussavi and rezaei 2017 vuv may be a promising alternative to uv in systems with sulfite gu et al gu et al 2017 reported that the vuv sulfite system showed greater performance in the decomposition of perfluorooctane sulfonate than the uv sulfite system suggesting that vuv sulfite might be a promising process to eliminate halogenated organic compounds however until now there has been no information on the degradation of haas by the vuv sulfite process not even for the detailed kinetics mechanism and influencing factors of this system therefore in this work we will systemically explore the decomposition of various haas including monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa difluoroacetic acid dfaa and trifluoroacetic acid tfaa by the vuv sulfite process the main objectives of this work are to i elucidate the mechanism for the vuv sulfite system and recognize the primary active species in this process by choosing mcaa as the target contaminant ii evaluate the influences of reaction parameters ph and sulfite dosage and water matrix including inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter dom on the performance of the vuv sulfite system and iii estimate the efficiency of the vuv sulfite system toward various haas 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals and reagents in text s1 of the supplementary material sm were at least of analytical grade and used without further purification all solutions were prepared in milli q ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm millipore the fresh stock solution of na2so3 was prepared with n2 saturated milli q water prior to each set of experiments 2 2 experimental procedures as illustrated in fig s2 a new apparatus was designed and fabricated for bench scale photochemical studies the core part of the reactor was a cylindrical and jacketed quartz wall photoreactor length 300 mm outer diameter 40 mm the cooling water circulated through the outer chamber between the two quartz walls ensuring a stable vuv or uv output preventing the lamp tube from overheating while retaining a constant solution temperature the lamp installed on the central axis of the cylindrical photoreactor can be removed and replaced in the experiment two kinds of lamps were used one was an 8 w cold cathode low pressure mercury lamp arc length 200 mm wanhua company zhejiang china the high purity synthetic quartz wall surface emits 185 nm and 254 nm vuv beams called vuv lamps the other was an 8 w cold cathode low pressure mercury lamp arc length 200 mm wanhua company zhejiang china which used an ordinary glass wall that emitted a 254 nm uv beam called uv lamp according to the photolysis kinetics of diluted h2o2 the average effective path length l of ultraviolet photons 254 nm was determined to be approximately 3 02 cm crittenden et al 1999 xie et al 2015 the photon intensity i0 entering the solution from the vuv source at 185 nm was calculated to be approximately 0 153 μeinstein s 1 according to the method described previously sun and bolton 1996 xie et al 2018 another uv lamp that was expected to have a similar photon flux at 254 nm 3 difference as the aforementioned vuv lamp was used as a reference the photon intensity i0 254 nm entering the solution was determined to be approximately 0 153 μeinstein s 1 by using the ki kio3 method rahn 1997 details for the determination of photon intensity i0 at 185 and 254 nm and average effective path length l are shown in texts s2 s4 and fig s1 the reaction solution was circulated using a pump a magnetic stirrer was applied at the bottom of the vessel to reduce the mass transfer resistance between the reactants and the reactive species the temperature of the reaction solution was controlled at 25 0 5 c by a water jacket the solution ph 6 0 10 0 was adjusted with 10 mm h2so4 and 10 mm naoh and the ph change was less than 0 1 during the whole reaction before each set of irradiation experiments the lamp was illuminated for at least 30 min and the solution was purged with n2 for 15 min to completely remove dissolved o2 unless otherwise stated to lower the degradation efficiency of monochloroacetic acid under aerobic conditions fig s3 samples were withdrawn from the reactor at predetermined time intervals and analyzed immediately or sealed in the absence of light 4 c before analysis all experiments were conducted at least in duplicate 2 3 analytical methods the ph was determined using a ph monitor phs 3e shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china and calibration with standard buffers at ph 4 00 7 00 and 9 00 was conducted routinely before measurements at room temperature anions were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex a dionex as19 analytical column 4 250 mm and an ag19 guard column 4 250 mm were used to separate cl mcaa and other haas whereas a dionex as20 analytical column 4 250 mm and an ag20 guard column 4 250 mm were selected for the separation of so3 2 and so4 2 total organic carbon was analyzed

dechlorination of mcaa at phini 9 0 in five systems sulfite uv vuv uv sulfite and vuv sulfite neither sulfite nor uv at 254 nm achieved any degradation or dechlorination of mcaa within 10 min gu et al 2017 jo et al 2011 while the vuv system showed considerable removal of mcaa due to the generation of plausible reactive species i e eaq h and oh eq 1 2 by 185 nm photons splitting water wang et al 2021 it is well known that eaq so 3 and h could be formed in situ during the uv sulfite process eq 3 4 fischer and warneck 1996 li et al 2012b however the uv sulfite system exhibited lower activity than the vuv system which may imply that oh as a strong oxidative species may also play an important role in the removal of mcaa 1 h 2 o 185 nm h oh 2 h 2 o 185 nm h oh e aq 3 so 3 2 hv so 3 e aq 4

constants k obs min 1 of mcaa degradation in the vuv sulfite system were 5 5 fold and 16 5 fold faster than those in the vuv and uv sulfite systems respectively according to the synergistic factor eq 5 yang and zhang 2019 the fvuv sulfite ratio was calculated to be 4 10 and the synergistic improvement was 310 which suggested that vuv sulfite was a promising technique for the abatement of mcaa 5 f

systems respectively 3 2 mechanism of vuv sulfite system 3 2 1 degradation pathways of mcaa under n2 saturated condition according to the result from fig 1 the 185 nm emission line presents a tremendous contribution to the degradation of mcaa including direct photolysis and attack from the active species in the vuv sulfite system active radicals can be produced via two main pathways i vuv photolyzes h2o to generate oh h and eaq eq 1 2 and ii vuv activates sulfite to yield eaq so 3 and h eq 3 4 since both reductive and oxidative species were produced in the vuv sulfite system to elucidate the mechanism we examined the intermediates of mcaa during vuv irradiation in the presence of sulfite both acetic acid and formic acid were identified by ion chromatography ic and other intermediates were proposed based on the literature li et al 2012a li et al 2012b mas et al 2005 yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 the mass balance of carbon remained at almost 100 during the whole reaction indicating that all the degradative products of mcaa in the vuv sulfite system were counted as shown in fig s4 and scheme 1 the dechlorination of mcaa to form acetic acid was the first and fast step and the loss of methyl groups from acetic acid to generate formic acid was the secondary and relatively slow step thus we observed the accumulation of acetic acid with increased reaction time fig s4 3 2 2 comparison between nitrogen and oxygen saturated systems according to previous literature the dechlorination of mcaa was mainly caused by the attack of eaq at diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988a li et al 2012b while the degradation and mineralization of acetic acid were due to the attack by oh muruganandham et al 2014 generally oxidative radicals initially attack c c bonds while reductive species favor c x bonds bao et al 2018 it is well established that the quantum yield of eaq under vuv irradiation in an anaerobic environment is higher than that in an aerobic environment and vice versa for oh as shown in eq 6 8 all the reductive species including eaq so 3 and h can be scavenged rapidly with oxygen wu et al 2021 but oxygen can also promote mcaa decay via eq 9 13 fu et al 2011 ye et al 2013 eaq can be quenched by oh at a rate of 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 eq 14 sánchez polo et al 2009 unfortunately the recombination between reactive radicals could possibly result in lower removal of mcaa according to eq 14 15 khan et al 2015 sánchez polo et al 2009 thus we compared the removals of mcaa under anaerobic and aerobic environments to elucidate which is the dominant

generally the sulfite photochemistry system exhibits arp in the absence of oxygen while it is an aop in the presence of oxygen cao et al 2021 to verify which process is more efficient for haas decay we illustrated the comparison of mcaa decomposition between the oxygen and oxygen saturated systems as shown in fig s3 dissolved oxygen largely inhibited mcaa decay which indicated that the reductive species generated in the vuv sulfite system were mainly responsible for the removal of mcaa since oh is highly efficient for the mineralization of small fatty acids muruganandham et al 2014 to quantify the contribution from oh toc changes were monitored in different systems as shown in fig s5 the toc removals of the vuv and vuv sulfite systems were 36 and 57 respectively remarkably the toc value rarely dropped in the uv sulfite system a previous study yu et al 2019 showed that the uv sulfite system was an eaq driven arp in which the mineralization of mcaa was unsatisfactory interestingly both the vuv and vuv sulfite systems presented appreciable toc removal indicating that the degradation pathways of mcaa in the vuv sulfite system were not the same as those in the uv based system this means that oxidative species play an indispensable role in removal of toc in the vuv sulfite system notably we observed a gradually decreased carbon mass balance with extending reaction time indicating that there might be other products i e sulfoacetic acid and succinic acid generated in the vuv sulfite system 3 2 3 recognition of reactive species and their contributions under n2 saturated condition furthermore we tried to analyze the mass balance of chlorine namely tcl tcl mcaa cl the tcl remained constant at ph 6 0 and 9 0 fig s6 which means that in the vuv sulfite process the chlorine in the mcaa molecule was released in the form of cl through the dechlorination pathway which confirmed the major contribution of reductive species so 3 is considered a mild oxidant and bad reductant with a redox potential e so 3 0 8 v largely higher than eaq e e aq 2 9 v and h e h 2 3 v but lower than oh e oh 2 8 v buxton et al 1988a it was reported that the so 3 hardly dedicated to the dechlorination of mcaa in the uv sulfite system li et al 2012b hence the contribution from so 3 was minor for the dechlorination of mcaa in the vuv sulfite system h attacks the β hydrogen of mcaa to generate h2 rather than the dechlorinated products buxton et al 1988a thus eaq can be safely recognized as the major species for dechlorination in the vuv sulfite system to quantify the contribution of each reactive species produced in the vuv sulfite system species quenching experiments were conducted no2 and no3 are good quenchers for eaq eq 16 17 while no2 reacts more rapidly with h than no3 eq 18 19 buxton et al 1988b li et al 2012b with the introduction of 400 μm no2 or no3 the removal of mcaa tended to be stagnant fig s7 which confirmed that eaq and or h were the main species for mcaa decomposition meoh and tba can be used as effective scavengers for oh k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1s 1 and k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 lin et al 2020b with the introduction of 10 mm meoh or tba the removal of mcaa slightly dropped from 92 8 to 84 4 and 86 4 respectively fig s7 in sum it could be inferred that oh participated in the removal of mcaa although its contribution was minor 16 no 2 e aq no 2 2 k 4 1 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 17 no 3 e aq no 3 2 k 9 7 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 18 no 2 h n o o h k 7 1 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 19 no 3 h n o 3 h k 1 4 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 the contribution r from each reactive species can be expressed as eq 20 20 r k i k obs k i k e aq k h k oh 100 where k i represents k e aq k h or k oh and ʃk obs equals k e aq k h k oh the contribution of eaq h and oh by using the pseudo first order reaction rate constant min 1 r eaq r h r oh and r other species were calculated as 61 1 9 7 27 1 and 2 1 respectively clearly eaq was the primary species for the degradation of mcaa via the dechlorination pathway while oh contributed to minor removal but was the main mineralization of mcaa thus the vuv sulfite system was a technique coupling both arps and aops and its exact working mechanism is displayed in scheme 1a finally all possible degradation pathways of mcaa are proposed in scheme 1b eaq h and oh could decompose mcaa with eaq as the greatest contributor mcaa was initially attacked by eaq leading to the formation of ch2coo radicals and cl li et al 2012a li et al 2012b zhu et al 2015 the ch2coo radical was further transformed to acetic acid via a hydrogenation reaction followed by the cleavage of acetic acid to the ch3 radical and coo through attack by oh wang et al 2020 formic acid was produced from the oxidation of ch3 radicals by oh and it was finally converted to co2 by oh moussavi and rezaei 2017 in addition those in situ formed radicals might recombine producing oocch2ch2coo o3sch2coo and other compounds in the vuv sulfite system li et al 2012b 3 3 effects of major parameters on the vuv sulfite system under n2 saturated condition 3 3 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on the degradation of mcaa was examined through batch experiments as shown in fig 2 the performance of vuv sulfite apparently improved as the ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 mcaa removal increased from 13 1 to 92 8 and its k obs increased almost 20 fold from 0 0137 min 1 to 0 2617 min 1 however further increasing the ph from 9 0 to 10 0 only slightly accelerated the decay of mcaa there was no buffer used for ph control in these experiments and ph values were stable changes in ph values 0 15 due to the buffering of sulfite fig s8 in addition the distribution of sulfite species including so3 2 hso3 and h2so3 also depends on ph eldridge et al 2016 as shown in fig s9 the change in sulfite species fluctuated sharply over a ph range of 6 0 8 5 surprisingly the k obs of mcaa decay correlated well with the proportion of so3 2 when ph changed indicating that the k obs of mcaa decay would be influenced by the distribution of sulfite species fig s10 attributed to i eaq was yielded from vuv irradiating so3 2 instead of hso3 fischer and warneck 1996 li et al 2012b and ii eaq is more stable under alkaline conditions fischer and warneck 1996 fischer and warneck fischer and warneck 1996 also illustrated that reactive reduction products of so3 2 and hso3 were eaq and h respectively which was consistent with our observation hence with increasing ph from 6 0 to 10 0 the proportion of so3 2 became dominant which led to the large formation of desirable eaq species eaq is highly unstable under acidic conditions and is quickly consumed by the coexisting h in the solution with a diffusion controlled reaction rate of 2 3 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988a in the uv sulfite system with eaq as the major reactive species the decomposition of mcaa under alkaline conditions was also faster than that under acidic conditions li et al 2012b in summary more eaq was generated under alkaline conditions due to its satisfactory stability and the dominant proportion of so3 2 hence the vuv sulfite system was more efficient for mcaa decay in alkaline solution than acidic solution 3 3 2 effect of sulfite dosage fig 3 a shows that the removal of mcaa and k obs of mcaa decay increased from 30 9 to 96 0 and from 0 0371 min 1 to 0 3147 min 1 with increasing sulfite dosage from 0 25 mm to 10 00 mm the correlation between the k obs and dosage of sulfate can be divided into two stages fast and slow fig 3b in both the fast and slow stages the decay of mcaa was proportional to the sulfite dosage but with different slopes indicating that the quantum yield of eaq was proportional to the sulfite dosage at both stages song et al 2013 at the slow stage the excessively high concentration of eaq could be consumed by sulfite eq 21 22 liu et al 2015 maza et al 2019 and transformed to other species with lower reactivity to mcaa 21 e aq so 3 2 product k 1 3 1

to so4 2 since there was no so2 in the alkaline solution some so3 2 might be oxidized to other products i e s2o6 2 and o3sch2coo eq 23 24 instead of so4 2 li et al 2012b yu et al 2018 23 so 3 so 3 s 2 o 6 2 24 c h 2 co o so 3 o 3 sc h 2 co o as a food additive sulfite is harmless to the human body when used sparingly in our work residual sulfite could be oxidized to nontoxic sulfate by vuv in an aerobic environment however 500 mg l 1 or more sulfate in drinking water will cause some health problems such as diarrhea and dehydration according to the who guidelines cotruvo 2017 since sulfite at 1 mm 80 mg l 1 presented a satisfying performance in the vuv sulfite system 1 mm was chosen as the main concentration in further experiments 3 3 3 effect of coexisting water matrices cl hco3 no3 and humic acid ha are widespread in natural waters and may affect the degradation of mcaa by vuv sulfite in addition eaq shows high activity toward oxyanions i e hco3 and no3 buxton et al 1988a thus it is necessary to investigate the effects of typical inorganic anions cl hco3 and no3 and organic constituents ha on the performance of vuv sulfite as the concentration of cl increased from 1 mm to 8 mm the removal of mcaa decreased from 90 4 to 67 7 fig s12 and its k obs decreased from 0 2359 min 1 to 0 1122 min 1 cl has a high molar absorption coefficient ε at 185 nm ε185nm 3500 m 1 cm 1 which could be provoked to cl by vuv eq 25 han et al 2021 moreover cl could react rapidly with oh to generate other secondary radicals such as clo h and cl 2 according to eq 26 27 fang et al 2014 gao et al 2020 han et al 2021 who cannot decompose mcaa thus the existence of cl had a negative effect on mcaa degradation in the vuv sulfite process similarly hco3 also had an inhibitive effect on mcaa decay fig s13 vuv had a slight influence on hco3 due to its relatively weak absorption at 185 nm ε185nm 269 m 1 cm 1 duca et al 2017 however hco3 can scavenge oh to form co 3 eq 28 sayed et al 2016 which are less reactive than oh resulting in decreased degradation of mcaa of course hco3 also reacts with eaq but at a slow rate of 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988a suggesting that the inhibition caused by hco3 was mainly from the quenching of oh 25 c l 185 nm c l e aq φ 0 4 26 c l oh clo h k 4 3 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 27 c l c l cl 2 k 6 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 k 1 1 1 0 5 m 1 s 1 28 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o k 1 0 1 0 7 m 1 s 1 with increasing no3 concentration the degradation of mcaa was inhibited linearly fig 4 no3 reacts with eaq 10 fold faster than mcaa buxton et al 1988a making much eaq trapped by no3 instead of mcaa no3 was gradually reduced to no2 by eaq and then to nh3 which was finally reduced to n2 eq 29 31 yu 2018 other studies also suggested that no2 was first reduced to no by eaq and then no reacted rapidly with h to form n2o and h2o finally n2o could be reduced to n2 eq 32 34 buxton et al 1988a li et al 2012b teng 2014 in our study continuous n2 flow could blow off the nh3 in the alkaline solution hence the observed ammonia concentration might be lower than its real production it should be noted that no3 also absorbs photons strongly under uv or vuv irradiation leading to the lower formation of reactive species namely eaq and oh considering that both mcaa and nitrate nitrite can be removed the vuv sulfite process is a promising technology not only for the degradation of haas but also for denitrification via photochemical processes 29 no 3 2 h 2 e aq hv no 2 h 2 o 30 no 2 7 h 6 e aq hv n h 3 2 h 2 o 31 2 n h 3 6 h 6 e aq hv n 2 6 h 2 32 no 2 h 2 o 2 e aq n o 2 o h 33 2 n o 2 h

and then generate singlet oxygen 1o2 eq 36 lester et al 2013 dom and its singlet or triplet excited species would also transform to a charge transfer state dom by photon radiation according to eq 37 39 which could react with o2 to generate h2o2 eq 40 41 dalrymple et al 2010 1o2 and h2o2 quench reductive species i e eaq and h leading to lower degradation of mcaa directly 35 dom hv 1 dom 3 dom 36 o

would lower the efficiency of the vuv sulfite system but with distinct reaction mechanisms cl and hco3 consumed oh converting to secondary radicals such as clo h cl 2 and co 3 whose reactivity toward mcaa was much lower than oh no3 as a representative oxyanion would largely consume the major reactive species eaq with itself being reduced to ammonia or nitrogen gas for dom oxidative species 1o2 and h2o2 might be formed under vuv irradiation which could scavenge eaq rapidly in addition both no3 and dom have a strong molar ratio for the vuv which would lower the production of photons and the yield of eaq and oh hence the degradation of mcaa declined significantly in the presence of cl hco3 no3 and dom the performance of vuv sulfite in two tapwaters obtained in the laboratory and dormitory and the parameters are presented in table s2 was examined fig s15 the degradation of mcaa in tapwater was lower than that in pure water the reasons were summarized as below i the ratio of so3 2 species in tapwater was lower than that in pure water due to the lower ph value of tapwater leading to a lower yield of eaq ii the anions i e cl hco3 and no3 and dom in tapwater inhibited mcaa decay iii residual disinfectant namely hclo clo in tapwater also consumed so3 2 resulting in a lower concentration of so3 2 thus the reaction time should be prolonged to obtain a comparable removal of mcaa when the vuv sulfite system is applied to real water treatment 3 4 broad spectrum of vuv sulfite under n2 saturated condition toward various haas to investigate the broad spectrum of the vuv sulfite system we examined the decomposition and dehalogenation of haas with different haloid substituents and halogenation degrees difluoroacetic acid dfaa trifluoroacetic acid tfaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa and mcaa were chosen as model compounds the degradation rates of haas increased with increasing halogenation degree i e trihalogenated haas dihalogenated haas monohalogenated haas jo et al 2011 and increasing molecular weight of halogens i e br cl f haas wang et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the vuv sulfite system was only ineffective against fluoroacetic acid i e tfaa and dfaa among the seven haas which are not widely detected in the conventional disinfection process except for fluoroacetic acids mcaa as the most resistant haas was found to be relatively retarded whereas tbaa was recognized to be the most vulnerable species to the vuv sulfite system fig 5 this can be explained by the following 3 reasons i the bond dissociation energy of carbon halogen c x ranked as c f 485 kj mol 1 c cl 397 kj mol 1 c br 280 kj mol 1 xiao et al 2014 ii chlorinated compounds with higher vuv uv absorbing capacity displayed higher degradation xiao et al 2016 and iii the steric and electronic effects of halogens resulted in different electron withdrawing efficacies wang et al 2017 the vuv sulfite system is a broad spectrum technique for most haas and a promising water treatment technology 4 conclusion this study investigated the degradation and dehalogenation of mcaa and six others haas by the vuv sulfite system compared with previously reported results i e uv sulfite vuv the combination of vuv and sulfite significantly improved the degradation of mcaa the vuv sulfite system was a technique coupling both arps and aops with eaq as the primary reactive species and oh as the secondary reactive species eaq causes the dehalogenation of haas while oh leads to the mineralization of dehalogenated products the first order reaction rate k obs of mcaa degradation increased sharply as the ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 and surprisingly k obs correlated well with the proportion of so3 2 as the ph changed this can be explained by that i eaq was yielded from vuv irradiating so3 2 instead of hso3 and ii eaq is more stable under alkaline the existence of ha and no3 significantly inhibited the decomposition of mcaa while cl and hco3 showed relatively weak inhibition thus the performance of the vuv sulfite system in real tap waters was lower than that in pure water due to the lower ph of tap waters and hence the lower proportion of so3 2 and higher quenching of eaq by h the vuv sulfite system is a broad spectrum technique with the degradative kinetics of seven haas increasing with the increasing halogenation degree and the rising molecular weight of halogens i e br cl f haas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

16379,sewage sludge as a reservoir of viruses may pose threats to human health understanding how virus particles interact with sludge is the key to controlling virus exposure and transmission in this study we investigated the recovery survivability and sorption of four typical virus surrogates with different structures phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 in sewage sludge the most effective elution method varies by viral analyte while the ultrafiltration method could significantly reduce the recovery loss for all four viruses compared with nonenveloped viruses the poor recoveries of phi6 during elution 15 limited its efficient detection the inactivation kinetics of four viruses in solid containing sludge were significantly faster than those in solid removed samples at 25 c indicating that the solid fraction of sludge played an important role in virus inactivation although enveloped phi6 was more vulnerable in both solid removed and solid containing sludge samples it could remain viable for several hours at 25 c and several days at 4 c which may pose an infection risk during sludge collection transportation and treatment process the adsorption and desorption behavior of viruses in sludge could be affected by virus envelope structure capsid proteins and virus particle size phi6 adsorption to sludge was great with log k f of 6 51 0 53 followed by phix174 ms2 and t4 additionally more than 95 of phi6 ms2 and t4 adsorbed to sludge were strongly bound and a considerable fraction of strongly bound virus was confirmed to retain viability these results shed light on the environmental behavior of viruses in sewage sludge and provide a theoretical basis for the risk assessment for sludge treatment and disposal image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge virus recovery survivability sorption 1 introduction viruses are the most challenging pathogens due to their nano sizes low infective doses and persistence in environments corpuz et al 2020 as the destination of human viruses excreted through the fecal chain wastewater treatment plants wwtps have become an important spot for virus transmission and monitoring medema et al 2020 sewage sludge the by product of wwtps was believed to be a reservoir with high concentrations of human viruses especially for hydrophobic enveloped viruses implying the potential exposure and transmission risk of viruses during sludge treatment and disposal yang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to understand the occurrence and fate of different viruses in sludge which is significant for preventing and controlling environmental risks and public health the efficient extraction and various behavior of viruses in sewage sludge depend on the complex interactions between viruses and sludge differ from the extraction of virus from aquatic environment samples the chemical and or physical elution methods are necessary for virus extraction from sludge because sludge is heterogeneous matrices and viruses tend to be adsorbed or entrapped in sludge flocs at present numerous elution and concentration methods have been developed for nonenveloped enteric viruses in sludge hjelmsø et al 2017 murthi et al 2012 virus infectivity is a key indicator for the public health perspective and ecological risk and it is essential to preserve the viability of the virus during the sampling and extraction processes of sludge samples however a robust extracting approach may lyse the virus s capsid and damage the nucleic acid which limited the accuracy of detection results therefore these existing methods maybe not be suitable for enveloped viruses due to their fragile lipid envelop wigginton et al 2015 besides the binding strength between viruses and sludge could be influenced by the viral structure and a single method is generally not capable of eluting or concentrating all viruses equally in a given sludge sample corpuz et al 2020 indicating that the elution and concentration methods should be optimized for the certain virus viruses can remain infective in the environment for a certain time and heterogeneity among viruses impacts their persistence it was reported that viruses with dna ssdna and dsdna and dsrna have higher resistance than ssrna viruses decrey and kohn 2017 while enveloped viruses are generally presumed to be fragile sassi et al 2018 however not all enveloped viruses rapidly lose their infectivity wigginton et al 2015 and some coronavirus e g sars cov 2 and hku1 even appeared in digested sludge with high occurrence bhattarai et al 2021 bibby and peccia 2013 despite the sars cov 2 genome decreasing during sludge treatment and disposal the variability and persistence of the enveloped virus in sludge were little known in addition the survival and persistence of viruses adsorbed to or entrapped in sludge may be different from that of suspending viruses which need to be systemically studied greater persistence of viruses adsorbed onto clays in natural habitats has been observed syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 while only 14 and 27 of enveloped phi6 aggregated with kaolinite and illite retained viability al et al 2018 different viruses appear to have different attachment patterns to solids various surface phosphor lipids and membrane proteins of viruses would cause different electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effects with solids armanious et al 2016 kitamura et al 2020 in addition virus adsorption and desorption behavior can also be influenced by the properties of sorbent e g sorbent structure ionic strength yin et al 2018 despite the interaction of different viruses with sorbents including soils and clays has been widely studied wong et al 2013 xing et al 2020 the irregular porous structure and complex properties of sludge may lead to different virus sorption behavior which received little attention the interaction between virus particles and sludge solids is a key factor controlling virus exposure and transmission during sludge treatment and disposal process but it is not fully understood given various virus structures and complex sludge components this study aims to investigate the environmental behavior of different viruses in sludge and the interaction between viruses and sludge we selected four typical bacteriophages with different structures phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 as virus surrogates and systematically evaluated the recoveries of infective viruses from sewage sludge by using different elution buffers homogenization approaches and concentration methods the inactivation kinetics of different virus surrogates in the liquid and solid phases of sludge at 4 c and 25 c were compared the adsorption and desorption behavior of different viruses in sludge and the effects of temperature ph and cations on adsorption capacity were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge bacteriophages and culture conditions waste activated sludge samples were obtained from one of the biggest wwtps in shanghai china multimode a2 o process was used in this wwtp with a designed scale of around 2 8 million m3 d 1 all samples were collected and sealed in sterile plastic bottles and immediately transported on ice to the laboratory virus extraction and analysis of sludge parameters were performed within 24 h and the physico chemical characterizations of sludge samples were shown in table s1 we chose to study bacteriophages phi6 because it was a common surrogate for human enveloped viruses while ms2 phix174 and t4 were chosen as model nonenveloped viruses because they have been used as surrogates in many studies the characteristics of these viruses are provided in table 1 bacteriophages phi6 ms2 phix174 t4 and their bacterial host were purchased from different culture collection see si for details four phages were propagated and enumerated based on published methods decrey and kohn 2017 ye et al 2016 briefly the bacterial host of phi6 was grown in luria bertani lb medium containing 5 g l 1 nacl at 26 c while that of ms2 phix174 and t4 were grown in lb medium containing 10 g l 1 nacl at 37 c bacteriophages phi6 ms2 phix174 and t4 were then propagated and assayed in their host based on the double layer technique the obtained stocks were all purified with centrifugation at 4000 g and 4 c for 10 min and filtered through a 0 22 μm pore sized sterile poly ether sulfone pes membrane filter the final stocks were stocked at 4 c 2 2 recovery methods virus recovery methods were evaluated and optimized in waste activated sludge because waste activated sludge had greater adsorption capacity and lower recovery for viruses than anaerobically digested sludge fig s1 four coliphages phi6 ms2 phix174 and t4 were mixed with waste activated sludge for 2 h before the extraction process while the ph of sludge spiked with ms2 t4 and phix174 was adjusted to 3 5 with 5 m hcl to enhance the adsorption the 2 h incubation time was chosen based on that more than 99 of the virus adsorbed in waste activated sludge six elution buffers three homogenization approaches and two concentration methods were selected in this study and the specific operations are as follows fig 1 bibby and peccia 2013 corpuz et al 2020 2 2 1 elution virus recovery was firstly evaluated using different elution buffers following the incubation sludge samples 20 ml were centrifugated at 4000 g

incubation and centrifugation sludge samples 20 ml with spiked viruses were mixed with the optimal elution buffer for each virus and carried out different homogenization approaches before agitation

each virus with 50 ml waste activated sludge before virus concentration and recoveries of two virus concentration methods were then compared for the peg precipitation method the elution filtrate 50 ml was mixed with 8 w v of peg 8000 and kept at 4 c overnight the mixture was then centrifuged at 12 000 g and 4 c for 45 min and the peg pellet was resuspended in 1 ml pbs ph 7 2 for the ultrafiltration method the elution filtrate 50 ml was concentrated with amicon ultra centrifugal filters millipore 10 kda to a final volume of 1 ml following the manufacturer s instructions and then assayed for infective viruses virus recovery was calculated as follows 1 v i r u s r e c o v e r y n u m b e r o f v i r u s i n e l u a n t o r c o n c e n t r a t e n u m b e r o f v i r u s i n s p i k e d s l

liquid fraction of sludge was obtained via centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min i e solid removed samples while sewage sludge without extra treatment was defined as solid containing samples virus surrogates were spiked into 60 ml of solid removed or solid containing sludge to final concentrations of 3 8 107 pfu ml 1 for phi6 and 2 9 108 pfu ml 1 for ms2 t4 and phix174 the lower phi6 concentrations were due to its lower stock concentrations sludge samples were quickly mixed with spiked virus surrogates and then incubated at 4 c or 25 c the temperature of 4 c and 25 c were selected to mimic the low end and typical sludge temperatures respectively aliquots of solid removed samples were removed at specific incubation times including 0 h filtrated through a 0 22 μm sterile filter to avoid decontamination and assayed infective virus concentrations aliquots of solid containing samples were removed at specific incubation times including 0 h and mixed with equivalent optimal elution buffer after being vortexed for 1 min the mixture was agitated at 200 r min 1 and 4 c for 30 min the solutions were centrifuged at 10 000 g and 4 c for 15 min and filtrated through a 0 22 μm sterile pes membrane the final filtrate was neutralized with pbs ph 7 2 and then assayed for infective viruses the first order kinetics can be described as follows popat et al 2010 2 ln c t c 0 k 1 t 3 ln c t ex c 0 ex k 2 t where ct and c0 are the infective virus concentration pfu ml 1 in solid removed samples at t and 0 h ct ex and c0 ex are the infective virus concentration pfu ml 1 in extraction solutions of solid containing samples at t and 0 h k 1 and k 2 are the first order virus inactivation constant in solid removed and solid containing samples and t is the incubation time h 2 4 sorption experiments to evaluate the sorption kinetics of different viruses in sewage sludge virus stocks were mixed with sludge at total solid ts of 1 5 and agitated at 4 c and 200 r min 1 for specific times ts of 1 5 was chosen to facilitate the observation of virus sorption kinetics in sludge based on pre experiment fig s2 the mixture was centrifugated 4000 g 10 min filtrated 0 22 μm and subsequently assayed effects of ph and cation were also studied by adjusting ph of 5 5 8 5 and adding 0 1 m nacl kcl cacl2 and mgcl2 respectively to compare the rate of virus adsorption to sludge and virus inactivation in the liquid and solid phase of sludge the nondimensional concentration of infective virus in the liquid of sewage sludge ct ss c0 was fitted with a piecewise linear model 4 ln c t ss c 0 ss k 31 t 0 t t p k 32 t t p t where ct ss and c0 ss are the infective virus concentration pfu ml 1 in the liquid phase of solid containing sludge samples at t and 0 h t p is the time when the rate begins to decrease significantly which was believed to reach adsorption saturation k 3 k 31 and k 32 is the value fitted by a piecewise linear model to test sorption isotherm virus stock with a series of desired concentrations was mixed with sludge at ts of 1 5 the sludge virus mixture was maintained at a thermostatic oscillator at 200 r min 1 and 4 c for equilibrium time the equilibrium time for phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 was 5 h 10 h 5 h and 10 h respectively the mixture was centrifugated 4000 g 10 min filtrated 0 22 μm and subsequently assayed the freundlich equation can be described as follows wong et al 2013 5 log c s eq log k f n log c l eq where c s e q and c l e q are the equilibrium concentration of virus in solid pfu g 1 and liquid phase pfu ml 1 log kf is the freundlich sorption coefficient and n is the exponential coefficient desorption experiments were implemented after reaching sorption equilibrium and the supernatant of the mixture was replaced by mill q water yin et al 2018 then the tubes were agitated at 4 c and 200 r min 1 for 12 h or 24 h and the titer in the supernatant was analyzed the percentage of virus desorbed from each sequential extraction was calculated as 6 d e s o r b e d v i r u s v i r u s t i t e r d e s o r b e d a t e a c h s e q u e n t i a l e x t r a c t i o n v i r u s t i t e r s o r b e d t o s l u d g e a f t e r s o r p t i

differences were considered significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of infective virus surrogates recovery from sewage sludge the efficient extraction of viruses including the elution and concentration process is essential for accurate detection and the establishment of a recovery method is the basis for investigating the persistence and sorption mechanism of viruses in sludge the recovery of infective virus surrogates with different genomes and structures from sludge was evaluated and improved by optimizing elution and concentration methods be buffers always had higher recoveries than gb and pbs and recoveries could be further enhanced by optimizing the concentration and ph of be buffer fig 2 phix174 was the easiest virus to be eluted among the four viruses with recoveries of 25 24 0 99 to 60 49 8 54 while low recoveries of phi6 1 73 0 83 to 14 13 3 99 were observed with different elution buffers ms2 and t4 had significant high recoveries of 38 65 7 58 and 31 67 4 16 respectively using 10 be ph 7 2 and phi6 could reach the highest recoveries of 14 13 3 99 using 3 be ph 7 2 the elution of virus from sludge was virus type dependent which may be due to the differences in survivability and sorption among viruses with different structures the sensitivity to environmental factors and high affinity to solid of enveloped phi6 may be the main reason for its low elution from sludge low recoveries of enveloped murine hepatitis virus mhv from wastewater solids have been reported using various solutions including 3 be and 0 05 m gb 1 to 3 7 which was consistent with its faster inactivation in wastewater ye et al 2016 meanwhile the elution of different nonenveloped viruses from sludge also varied greatly and similar results have been reported for bacteriophages and human enteric viruses from membrane filters hamza et al 2009 pisharody et al 2020 implying the different interaction mechanisms between different viruses and sludge thus the eluents should be optimized for certain virus to ensure efficient recovery to further improve virus recovery ultrasonic treatment and surfactants were chosen to remove adhering viruses by disturbing the adsorption between virus and sludge the ultrasonic method can disintegrate sludge particles and disperse biological flocs which may promote the release of viruses entrapped in sludge floc chen et al 2017 significant higher numbers of bacteriophages and human viruses were recovered from various aquatic environments when ultrasonication was applied to membrane filters during the elution step jones et al 2009 mackowiak et al 2018 in this study ultrasonic treatment during the elution process resulted in significantly higher recoveries of phix174 while it did not significantly improve the recoveries of ms2 and t4 compared with the other three viruses phi6 was more susceptible to ultrasound pretreatment with slightly decreased recoveries and the fragility may be attributed to the lipid envelope which requires special elution buffers or methods although surfactants were reported to compete with available sorption sites of phages and decrease the adsorption of sludge to the virus they may adversely affect phage survivability under some conditions which did not significantly improve the elution of the virus and even inhibited recovery chattopadhyay et al 2002 simon et al 2021 surfactants may be more suitable for the extraction of viral genomes rather than viral infectivity it was reported that the extraction of extracellular resistance genes in sludge was improved with the addition of surfactants zou et al 2020 two concentration methods i e peg precipitation and ultrafiltration with different mechanisms were compared for the concentration in eluant the ultrafiltration method can retain larger sized particles like viruses via size exclusion while the peg method precipitates virus particles by changing the dielectric constant of the liquid around the virus particles cashdollar and wymer 2013 nour et al 2021 significantly higher recoveries 50 39 88 89 p 0 05 of the four coliphages were obtained with ultrafiltration than peg precipitation fig 2 similarly high recoveries of both infective enveloped virus and virus rna in wastewater samples concentrating by ultrafiltration have been reported by other studies ahmed et al 2020 laturner et al 2021 ye et al 2016 the precipitation of inhibitor and destruction of envelope structure may cause low recoveries for different viruses with peg deboosere et al 2012 hamza et al 2009 these results suggest that ultrafiltration may be suitable for recovering both infective viruses and virus genes for qpcr detection in addition it was found that the recoveries of virus concentrating by both peg precipitation and ultrafiltration methods were influenced by virus types the recoveries of infective ms2 were always lower than that of the other three viruses which may be due to the structure and molecular mass of their capsid proteins in sum the optimal recoveries of 58 74 8 31 36 52 9 44 20 01 6 52 and 9 72 3 44 for phix174 t4 ms2 and phi6 was obtained by combining the optimal elution approaches and ultrafiltration methods 3 2 survivability of infective virus surrogates in sewage sludge the potential exposure and transmission risk of the infective virus through sludge treatment and disposal is always associated with viral survival and persistence yang et al 2020 we compared the effects of sludge fractions the liquid and solid fraction on the survivability of infective virus surrogates fig 3 table s2 when it comes to the liquid fraction i e solid removed samples there were greater inactivation rates in phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 with the t90 values i e the calculated time to reach 90 inactivation of 80 h 269 h and not applicable na respectively at the temperature of 4 c similar trends were found at the temperature of 25 c suggesting the differences in the persistence of the various virus we further found that raising temperature was responsible for the increase in the inactivation rates relative to the incubation condition at 4 c the first order kinetics increased by 3 0 folds for phi6 and 2 3 folds for ms2 respectively however the inactivation rates of t4 and phix174 were still not observed at the temperature of 25 c revealing their great persistence in the solid removed fraction of sludge these results showed that nonenveloped viruses were stable in the sludge system and this may be attributed to the structural difference of the virus similar results were found in the urine and wastewater environments and t4 and phix174 thus had been considered as conservative indicators of tolerated enterovirus al et al 2018 decrey and kohn 2017 magri et al 2015 in contrast as enveloped virus the high inactivation rate of phi6 was due to its fragile lipid envelope structure the increased temperature further accelerated the inactivation process by increasing the viral sensitivity to physical or biological influencing factors on the other hand virus genome types may also contribute to the various persistence ssrna viruses were shown to be the most sensitive to ammonia in human excreta compared with dna viruses and dsrna viruses decrey and kohn 2017 which may cause the faster inactivation for ms2 in sludge supernatant than that for t4 and phix174 the inactivation of the virus in the solid containing sludge samples was further investigated by using the optimal elution methods similar to the inactivation in the solid removed sludge samples the inactivation of viruses was also affected by the virus types and temperature in solid containing sludge samples for example the t90 of phi6 t4 phix174 and ms2 at 4 c were 40 1 h 69 10 h 159 70 h and na respectively the t90 of enveloped phi6 in sludge could be shortened to 10 2 h at the temperature of 25 c and that of nonenveloped viruses could be shortened to 26 5 h suggesting that there were significant differences in the sensitivity of virus types to temperature in addition the inactivation of the four viruses was not statistically different in solid removed and solid containing sludge samples at low temperature 4 c while the inactivation kinetics 0 09 0 02 to 0 25 0 05 h 1 of the four viruses in solid containing sludge samples at 25 c were significantly faster than those in solid removed sludge samples na to 0 10 0 01 h 1 table s2 indicating that the solid fraction of sludge played an important role in virus inactivation biosolids often were considered to slow virus inactivation but the faster inactivation of phix174 and ms2 in solid containing samples were also observed in the previous study roberts et al 2016 ye et al 2016 which may be caused by biosolid types a greater reduction in infectivity of phi6 was observed after virus was adsorbed by montmorillonite or kaolinite and the disassembly of the viral envelope was found to be the main reason for infectivity loss al et al 2018 it has been reported that the inactivation rate constant of phi6 on solid surfaces at 4 c was consistent with that in solids removed samples which was similar to the results of this study on the contrary the faster inactivation in solid containing sludge samples at 25 c may be due to the enhanced inactivation on the solid surfaces or irreversible binding to the surface in addition the inactivation rate of phi6 in the liquid fraction of sludge increased by 3 folds with the increase of temperature while that in the solid fraction increased by 6 folds table s2 indicating that the increase of temperature might lead to the increase of the contribution of irreversible adsorption overall viruses including enveloped phi6 in sludge can survive for several hours to days and even weeks under low temperature which significantly increases the exposure and transmission risk of the virus during sludge treatment and disposal using phi6 as a candidate surrogate indicator of enveloped virus in sludge is of great significance but it may underestimate the persistence of human enveloped virus given that phi6 inactivates faster than some other enveloped viruses such as mhv and influenza virus carvalho et al 2017 compared with enveloped viruses nonenveloped viruses such as ms2 t4 and phix174 in sludge can survive longer and some enteroviruses have been reported to persist in the form of vesicle encapsulated virus clusters that can resist environmental stress and uv254 disinfection zhang et al 2021 therefore the prevention and control of infective nonenveloped virus dissemination in sludge should be focused on and strengthened furthermore the exposure and transmission risk of the viruses in the sludge at low temperatures is of great concern and needs to be carefully assessed 3 3 sorption behavior of virus surrogates to sewage sludge 3 3 1 different adsorption behavior of virus surrogates in sludge in addition to the inactivation in the liquid or solid phase of sludge adsorption to and desorption from sludge were some of the most important factors controlling the removal and transport of viruses grant et al 1993 when the viruses were spiked into sludge samples the normalized virus concentration in supernatant firstly decrease rapidly and then slowed to a rate that was equal to or slower than virus inactivation in the solid containing sludge samples fig 4 table s3 the adsorption of viruses onto sludge solid was rapid but not instantaneous and the required time to reach adsorption saturation t p varied 5 h was needed for phi6 and t4 while 10 h was needed for ms2 and phix174 according to the time point when the rate turned meanwhile adsorption isotherms for four viruses on sludge could be fitted by the freundlich isotherms with the determination coefficient r 2 more than 0 94 the adsorption capacity log kf of sludge on enveloped phi6 was higher than nonenveloped viruses and log kf of phi6 phix174 ms2 and t4 were 6 51 0 54 5 73 0 17 5 09 0 69 and 3 93 0 12 respectively fig s3 table s4 the results indicated that the adsorption capacity and rate of sludge for phi6 were greater than that for ms2 t4 and phix174 the higher adsorption capacity and faster aggregation rate of sludge for enveloped phi6 have been confirmed to be governed by the hydrophobic interaction brought by its lipid layer structure al et al 2018 similar results have been observed when studying the heteroaggregation of enveloped viruses with colloidal sediments and wastewater solids al et al 2018 ye et al 2016 the aggregation of enveloped viruses with sediments may cause virus disassembly and infectivity loss but the infectivity of enveloped influenza virus was not compromised despite aggregation and deformation block et al 2016 indicating that the various surface phosphor lipids and membrane proteins may make enveloped viruses in adsorbed status significantly different stabilities therefore more enveloped viruses will need to be tested to evaluate the effects of their unique lipids on sorption and persistence additionally there were differences in adsorption among nonenveloped viruses and phix174 adsorption to sludge was strong with log kf of 5 73 0 17 followed by ms2 and t4 the adsorption between nonenveloped virus and solid surfaces was reported to be governed by long ranged electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction armanious et al 2016 as both the sludge and bacteriophages were negatively charged at natural ph conditions the slightly greater adsorption for phix174 than ms2 may be consistent with its higher isoelectric point value and lower electrostatic repulsion similar results have been observed when investigating the affinity of phix174 and ms2 for ottawa sand jin et al 2000 besides the electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction virus transport was also virus size dependent weisbrod et al 2013 the lower adsorption of t4 may relate to it being bigger x223c80 110 nm head x223c110 20 nm tail than ms2 and phix174 x223c25 nm which would collide rarely with sludge particles due to brownian motion similarly ye et al 2016 also reported the nonsignificant partitioning to wastewater solids for t3 those results indicated that the sorption mechanisms for different viruses to sludge varied greatly on the other hand the adsorption behavior of viruses was also influenced by the structure and characteristics of sorbents it was reported that the log kf values for ms2 and phix174 in nonsterilized red soil were 3 25 and 2 26 hui et al 2010 and that in clay minerals were 2 88 3 64 and 2 24 3 35 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2012 obviously the affinity of both viruses to sludge was greater 5 09 0 69 of ms2 and 5 73 0 17 of phix174 than that to red soil and clay minerals compared with soil and clay minerals sludge has more complex floc structures and compositions viruses can not only be entrapped by the irregular macroporous of sludge but also attach to sludge through hydrogen and chemical bonding cui et al 2011 various extracellular organic contents including proteins and lipids can provide large amounts of binding sites for virus adsorption sheng et al 2010 heavy metals and other pollutants absorbed in sludge may also affect the adsorption capacity for viruses in addition the mechanisms of sorption for viruses to different sorbents also varied greatly greater adsorption for ms2 than phix174 onto quartz sands clays and red soils was reported and hydrophobic effect rather than electrostatic interactions was the main contributor given the higher hydrophobicity of ms2 brought by its hydrophobic protein coat chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2012 hui et al 2010 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 3 3 2 effects of temperature ph and cations on adsorption of virus surrogates to sludge the sorption process of sludge for all viruses increased with increasing temperature fig 4 which may be related to the more stable hydrophobicity at a higher temperature syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 the results were consistent with ms2 and phix174 in kaolinite and bentonite bellou et al 2015 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 on contrary the human adenovirus was more tightly adsorbed on kaolinite and bentonite at 4 c than 25 c bellou et al 2015 implying that ms2 and phix174 maybe not suitable surrogates for the sorption behavior of human adenoviruses in addition with increasing temperature the conversion of reversibly adsorbed viruses to irreversibly adsorbed states in sludge system was involved according to the adsorption and inactivation kinetics generally the ph value can influence electrostatic interactions by affecting the virus and sorbent surfaces charges and the electrostatic repulsion between viral and solids increases at higher ph according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory armanious et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 increasing adsorption capacity of sludge for four viruses was obtained in this study when the sludge ph decreased from 8 5 to 6 5 fig 5 a however when sludge ph further decreased to 5 5 the adsorption capacity of sludge for phi6 ms2 and t4 did not increase but decreased indicating that electrostatic interaction was not the dominant sorption mechanism of these three viruses at a lower ph value in addition to changes in sludge surface charge the sludge ph can also affect the floc structure and relative hydrophobicity raynaud et al 2012 the breakage of sludge flocs and degradation of extracellular polymeric substances at acidic or alkaline ph conditions can affect the sorption process directly or indirectly through the varied sludge relative hydrophobicity ou et al 2020 wei et al 2019 therefore it is not easier to study the interaction mechanism between sludge and viruses due to the complexity of sludge composition and structure and more characterization methods are needed for studying the interactions between sludge and viruses however what is certain is that the dominant interaction between phix174 and sludge was different from that of the other three viruses given that the adsorption capacity of phix174 onto sludge increased with decreasing ph value as an inevitable component of domestic wastewater excess concentration of cations was found to lead to the destruction of sludge structure and the deterioration in sludge settleability kara et al 2010 on the other hand it was also found that the presence of cations can enhance the virus adsorption onto the sand by shielding charge and shrinking the electrostatic double layer nasser et al 1993 wong et al 2012 effects of cations on virus adsorption onto sludge were then evaluated by extra addition fig 5 b the adsorption capacity of sludge to phi6 t4 and phix174 increased with the addition of metal cations the multivalent cations showed greater ability to promote adsorption of t4 by sludge which was consistent with the results of adsorption behaviors of human adenovirus onto sand reported by wong et al 2013 however there were no significant effects of cation valence on the adsorption of phi6 and phix174 to sludge effects of cations on virus adsorption were also related to the organic matter in sludge for instance the addition of cations na ca2 and mg2 did not enhance the adsorption for both ms2 and rotavirus onto hematite nanoparticles present with the natural organic matter gutierrez et al 2009 which may explain the different adsorption behavior of ms2 in presence of cations in this study interestingly the adsorption capacity of sludge for viruses was often higher under the typical conditions of room temperature neutral ph and the presence of cations suggesting that untreated sewage sludge could be the reservoir of viruses without additional conditioning fortunately sludge solids could increase the sensitivity of adsorbed viruses to temperature so further increasing temperature may be beneficial to the inactivation of viruses in the sludge system 3 3 3 different desorption from sludge solids the desorption capacity of viruses from waste activated sludge was also virus type dependent fig 6 phix174 was the easiest to be desorbed naturally with the total percentage of 21 87 2 30 for 24 h followed by ms2 t4 and phi6 which was consistent with the recoveries during virus elution process compared with the other three viruses the bound of phix174 to sludge was weak and a considerable fraction of phix174 was able to remain infective during the adsorption or desorption process inevitably a high level of easily desorbed viruses may be released from sludge during rain events during sludge storage and land application which have a high potential to contaminate surface and ground waters more than 95 of phi6 ms2 and t4 adsorbed to sludge could not be desorbed naturally which limited the efficient elution and recovery of the virus xing et al divided the binding strength between ms2 and colloid into weakly bound and strongly bound by the fraction of natural desorption and found more than 90 of ms2 was strongly bound or entrapped on colloid xing et al 2020 in addition virus desorption would be impacted by the types and organic contents of sorbents in this study the fraction of desorbed ms2 and phix174 in sewage sludge were 2 97 0 80 and 21 87 2 30 while that in red soil were reported to be average 4 02 and 1 86 respectively hui et al 2010 the desorption of viruses from sludge solid could be enhanced by mixing with elution buffers including be and gb indicating that a considerable fraction of strongly bound viruses may maintain their structural integrity and infectivity large numbers of phi6 were also reported to remain viable post aggregation with colloidal sediments despite the fragility of the viral envelope al et al 2018 however due to the limited recovery of strongly bound viruses during the elution process it is difficult to accurately evaluate the titer of infectious viruses adsorbed to solids which may underestimate virus concentration and risk in sludge samples 4 conclusion the optimal effective elution method varies by the viral analyte compared with nonenveloped viruses ms2 t4 and phix174 the poor recoveries of enveloped phi6 during elution and vulnerability to homogenization methods such as ultrasound treatment limited the efficient detection which needs to be further optimized for virus concentration the ultrafiltration method reduced the recovery loss for four virus surrogates with higher recoveries 50 39 to 88 89 p 0 05 faster inactivation for viruses in solid containing sludge than that in solid removed samples at 25 c was observed regardless of virus type implying the solid fraction of sludge at high temperature played an important role in virus inactivation although the inactivation kinetics of envelope virus phi6 and ssrna virus ms2 in sludge was faster long survivability needs to be of great concern during sludge collection transportation and treatment process especially at low temperatures the adsorption and desorption behavior of viruses in sludge is virus type dependent and greater adsorption capacity for enveloped phi6 log kf of 6 51 0 54 than nonenveloped virus surrogates log kf of 3 93 0 12 to 5 73 0 17 was observed except for the temperature effects of ph and cations on the adsorption of four virus surrogates to sludge varied by the viral analyte the binding strength of phix174 on sludge was weak with a desorption percentage of 21 87 2 30 while more than 95 of phi6 ms2 and t4 adsorbed to sludge were strongly bound low natural desorption of virus was partially improved by different elution methods indicating that considerable fractions of viruses were not inactivated by association with a solid phase declaration of

16379,sewage sludge as a reservoir of viruses may pose threats to human health understanding how virus particles interact with sludge is the key to controlling virus exposure and transmission in this study we investigated the recovery survivability and sorption of four typical virus surrogates with different structures phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 in sewage sludge the most effective elution method varies by viral analyte while the ultrafiltration method could significantly reduce the recovery loss for all four viruses compared with nonenveloped viruses the poor recoveries of phi6 during elution 15 limited its efficient detection the inactivation kinetics of four viruses in solid containing sludge were significantly faster than those in solid removed samples at 25 c indicating that the solid fraction of sludge played an important role in virus inactivation although enveloped phi6 was more vulnerable in both solid removed and solid containing sludge samples it could remain viable for several hours at 25 c and several days at 4 c which may pose an infection risk during sludge collection transportation and treatment process the adsorption and desorption behavior of viruses in sludge could be affected by virus envelope structure capsid proteins and virus particle size phi6 adsorption to sludge was great with log k f of 6 51 0 53 followed by phix174 ms2 and t4 additionally more than 95 of phi6 ms2 and t4 adsorbed to sludge were strongly bound and a considerable fraction of strongly bound virus was confirmed to retain viability these results shed light on the environmental behavior of viruses in sewage sludge and provide a theoretical basis for the risk assessment for sludge treatment and disposal image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge virus recovery survivability sorption 1 introduction viruses are the most challenging pathogens due to their nano sizes low infective doses and persistence in environments corpuz et al 2020 as the destination of human viruses excreted through the fecal chain wastewater treatment plants wwtps have become an important spot for virus transmission and monitoring medema et al 2020 sewage sludge the by product of wwtps was believed to be a reservoir with high concentrations of human viruses especially for hydrophobic enveloped viruses implying the potential exposure and transmission risk of viruses during sludge treatment and disposal yang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to understand the occurrence and fate of different viruses in sludge which is significant for preventing and controlling environmental risks and public health the efficient extraction and various behavior of viruses in sewage sludge depend on the complex interactions between viruses and sludge differ from the extraction of virus from aquatic environment samples the chemical and or physical elution methods are necessary for virus extraction from sludge because sludge is heterogeneous matrices and viruses tend to be adsorbed or entrapped in sludge flocs at present numerous elution and concentration methods have been developed for nonenveloped enteric viruses in sludge hjelmsø et al 2017 murthi et al 2012 virus infectivity is a key indicator for the public health perspective and ecological risk and it is essential to preserve the viability of the virus during the sampling and extraction processes of sludge samples however a robust extracting approach may lyse the virus s capsid and damage the nucleic acid which limited the accuracy of detection results therefore these existing methods maybe not be suitable for enveloped viruses due to their fragile lipid envelop wigginton et al 2015 besides the binding strength between viruses and sludge could be influenced by the viral structure and a single method is generally not capable of eluting or concentrating all viruses equally in a given sludge sample corpuz et al 2020 indicating that the elution and concentration methods should be optimized for the certain virus viruses can remain infective in the environment for a certain time and heterogeneity among viruses impacts their persistence it was reported that viruses with dna ssdna and dsdna and dsrna have higher resistance than ssrna viruses decrey and kohn 2017 while enveloped viruses are generally presumed to be fragile sassi et al 2018 however not all enveloped viruses rapidly lose their infectivity wigginton et al 2015 and some coronavirus e g sars cov 2 and hku1 even appeared in digested sludge with high occurrence bhattarai et al 2021 bibby and peccia 2013 despite the sars cov 2 genome decreasing during sludge treatment and disposal the variability and persistence of the enveloped virus in sludge were little known in addition the survival and persistence of viruses adsorbed to or entrapped in sludge may be different from that of suspending viruses which need to be systemically studied greater persistence of viruses adsorbed onto clays in natural habitats has been observed syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 while only 14 and 27 of enveloped phi6 aggregated with kaolinite and illite retained viability al et al 2018 different viruses appear to have different attachment patterns to solids various surface phosphor lipids and membrane proteins of viruses would cause different electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effects with solids armanious et al 2016 kitamura et al 2020 in addition virus adsorption and desorption behavior can also be influenced by the properties of sorbent e g sorbent structure ionic strength yin et al 2018 despite the interaction of different viruses with sorbents including soils and clays has been widely studied wong et al 2013 xing et al 2020 the irregular porous structure and complex properties of sludge may lead to different virus sorption behavior which received little attention the interaction between virus particles and sludge solids is a key factor controlling virus exposure and transmission during sludge treatment and disposal process but it is not fully understood given various virus structures and complex sludge components this study aims to investigate the environmental behavior of different viruses in sludge and the interaction between viruses and sludge we selected four typical bacteriophages with different structures phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 as virus surrogates and systematically evaluated the recoveries of infective viruses from sewage sludge by using different elution buffers homogenization approaches and concentration methods the inactivation kinetics of different virus surrogates in the liquid and solid phases of sludge at 4 c and 25 c were compared the adsorption and desorption behavior of different viruses in sludge and the effects of temperature ph and cations on adsorption capacity were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge bacteriophages and culture conditions waste activated sludge samples were obtained from one of the biggest wwtps in shanghai china multimode a2 o process was used in this wwtp with a designed scale of around 2 8 million m3 d 1 all samples were collected and sealed in sterile plastic bottles and immediately transported on ice to the laboratory virus extraction and analysis of sludge parameters were performed within 24 h and the physico chemical characterizations of sludge samples were shown in table s1 we chose to study bacteriophages phi6 because it was a common surrogate for human enveloped viruses while ms2 phix174 and t4 were chosen as model nonenveloped viruses because they have been used as surrogates in many studies the characteristics of these viruses are provided in table 1 bacteriophages phi6 ms2 phix174 t4 and their bacterial host were purchased from different culture collection see si for details four phages were propagated and enumerated based on published methods decrey and kohn 2017 ye et al 2016 briefly the bacterial host of phi6 was grown in luria bertani lb medium containing 5 g l 1 nacl at 26 c while that of ms2 phix174 and t4 were grown in lb medium containing 10 g l 1 nacl at 37 c bacteriophages phi6 ms2 phix174 and t4 were then propagated and assayed in their host based on the double layer technique the obtained stocks were all purified with centrifugation at 4000 g and 4 c for 10 min and filtered through a 0 22 μm pore sized sterile poly ether sulfone pes membrane filter the final stocks were stocked at 4 c 2 2 recovery methods virus recovery methods were evaluated and optimized in waste activated sludge because waste activated sludge had greater adsorption capacity and lower recovery for viruses than anaerobically digested sludge fig s1 four coliphages phi6 ms2 phix174 and t4 were mixed with waste activated sludge for 2 h before the extraction process while the ph of sludge spiked with ms2 t4 and phix174 was adjusted to 3 5 with 5 m hcl to enhance the adsorption the 2 h incubation time was chosen based on that more than 99 of the virus adsorbed in waste activated sludge six elution buffers three homogenization approaches and two concentration methods were selected in this study and the specific operations are as follows fig 1 bibby and peccia 2013 corpuz et al 2020 2 2 1 elution virus recovery was firstly evaluated using different elution buffers following the incubation sludge samples 20 ml were centrifugated at 4000 g and 4 c for 10 min and the supernatants were detected as the unabsorbed virus the pellet was then mixed with 20 ml different elution buffers including 10 beef extract be ph 7 2 10 be ph 9 0 3 be ph 7

g and 4 c for 15 min and filtrated through a 0 22 μm sterile pes membrane the final filtrate was neutralized with pbs ph 7 2 and then tittered for infective viruses with plaque assays following the incubation and centrifugation sludge samples 20 ml with spiked viruses were mixed with the optimal elution buffer for each virus and carried out different homogenization approaches before agitation the optimal elution buffer for phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 was 3 be ph 7 2 3 be ph 9 0 10 be ph 7 2 3 be ph 9 0 respectively three procedures were tested vortex vortex low power ultrasound treatment and vortex extra surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds addition 0 1 w v and the details are shown in fig 1 2 2 2 concentration elution filtrates were prepared by mixing with optimal elution buffer for each virus with 50 ml waste activated sludge before virus concentration and recoveries of two virus concentration methods were then compared for the peg precipitation method the elution filtrate 50 ml was mixed with 8 w v of peg 8000 and kept at 4 c overnight the mixture was then centrifuged at 12 000 g and 4 c for 45 min and the peg pellet was resuspended in 1 ml pbs ph 7 2 for the ultrafiltration method the elution filtrate 50 ml was concentrated with amicon ultra centrifugal filters millipore 10 kda to a final volume of 1 ml following the manufacturer s instructions and then assayed for infective viruses virus recovery was calculated as follows 1 v i r u s r e c o v e r y n u m b e r o f v i r u s i n e l u a n t o r c o n c e n t r a t e n u m b e r o f v i r u s i n s p i k e d s l u d g e s a m p l e 100 2 3 survivability experiments the effect of sludge fractions liquid and solid fraction on the survivability of infective virus surrogates was investigated at 4 c and 25 c the liquid fraction of sludge was obtained via centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min i e solid removed samples while sewage sludge without extra treatment was defined as solid containing samples virus surrogates were spiked into 60 ml of solid removed or solid containing sludge to final concentrations of 3 8 107 pfu ml 1 for phi6 and 2 9 108 pfu ml 1 for ms2 t4 and phix174 the lower phi6 concentrations were due to its lower stock concentrations sludge samples were quickly mixed with spiked virus surrogates and then incubated at 4 c or 25 c the temperature of 4 c and 25 c were selected to mimic the low end and typical sludge temperatures respectively aliquots of solid removed samples were removed at specific incubation times including 0 h filtrated through a 0 22 μm sterile filter to avoid decontamination and assayed infective virus concentrations aliquots of solid containing samples were removed at specific incubation times including 0 h and mixed with equivalent optimal elution buffer after being vortexed for 1 min the mixture was agitated at 200 r min 1 and 4 c for 30 min the solutions were centrifuged at 10 000 g and 4 c for 15 min and filtrated through a 0 22 μm sterile pes membrane the final filtrate was neutralized with pbs ph 7 2 and then assayed for infective viruses the first order kinetics can be described as follows popat et al 2010 2 ln c t c 0 k 1 t 3 ln c t ex c 0 ex k 2 t where ct and c0 are the infective virus concentration pfu ml 1 in solid removed samples at t and 0 h ct ex and c0 ex are the infective virus concentration pfu ml 1 in extraction solutions of solid containing samples at t and 0 h k 1 and k 2 are the first order virus inactivation constant in solid removed and solid containing samples and t is the incubation time h 2 4 sorption experiments to evaluate the sorption kinetics of different viruses in sewage sludge virus stocks were mixed with sludge at total solid ts of 1 5 and agitated at 4 c and 200 r min 1 for specific times ts of 1 5 was chosen to facilitate the observation of virus sorption kinetics in sludge based on pre experiment fig s2 the mixture was centrifugated 4000 g 10 min filtrated 0 22 μm and subsequently assayed effects of ph and cation were also studied by adjusting ph of 5 5 8 5 and adding 0 1 m nacl kcl cacl2 and mgcl2 respectively to compare the rate of virus adsorption to sludge and virus inactivation in the liquid and solid phase of sludge the nondimensional concentration of infective virus in the liquid of sewage sludge ct ss c0 was fitted with a piecewise linear model 4 ln c t ss c 0 ss k 31 t 0 t t p k 32 t t p t where ct ss and c0 ss are the infective virus concentration pfu ml 1 in the liquid phase of solid containing sludge samples at t and 0 h t p is the time when the rate begins to decrease significantly which was believed to reach adsorption saturation k 3 k 31 and k 32 is the value fitted by a piecewise linear model to test sorption isotherm virus stock with a series of desired concentrations was mixed with sludge at ts of 1 5 the sludge virus mixture was maintained at a thermostatic oscillator at 200 r min 1 and 4 c for equilibrium time the equilibrium time for phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 was 5 h 10 h 5 h and 10 h respectively the mixture was centrifugated 4000 g 10 min filtrated 0 22 μm and subsequently assayed the freundlich equation can be described as follows wong et al 2013 5 log c s eq log k f n log c l eq where c s e q and c l e q are the equilibrium concentration of virus in solid pfu g 1 and liquid phase pfu ml 1 log kf is the freundlich sorption coefficient and n is the exponential coefficient desorption experiments were implemented after reaching sorption equilibrium and the supernatant of the mixture was replaced by mill q water yin et al 2018 then the tubes were agitated at 4 c and 200 r min 1 for 12 h or 24 h and the titer in the supernatant was analyzed the percentage of virus desorbed from each sequential extraction was calculated as 6 d e s o r b e d v i r u s v i r u s t i t e r d e s o r b e d a t e a c h s e q u e n t i a l e x t r a c t i o n v i r u s t i t e r s o r b e d t o s l u d g e a f t e r s o r p t i

differences were considered significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of infective virus surrogates recovery from sewage sludge the efficient extraction of viruses including the elution and concentration process is essential for accurate detection and the establishment of a recovery method is the basis for investigating the persistence and sorption mechanism of viruses in sludge the recovery of infective virus surrogates with different genomes and structures from sludge was evaluated and improved by optimizing elution and concentration methods be buffers always had higher recoveries than gb and pbs and recoveries could be further enhanced by optimizing the concentration and ph of be buffer fig 2 phix174 was the easiest virus to be eluted among the four viruses with recoveries of 25 24 0 99 to 60 49 8 54 while low recoveries of phi6 1 73 0 83 to 14 13 3 99 were observed with different elution buffers ms2 and t4 had significant high recoveries of 38 65 7 58 and 31 67 4 16 respectively using 10 be ph 7 2 and phi6 could reach the highest recoveries of 14 13 3 99 using 3 be ph 7 2 the elution of virus from sludge was virus type dependent which may be due to the differences in survivability and sorption among viruses with different structures the sensitivity to environmental factors and high affinity to solid of enveloped phi6 may be the main reason for its low elution from sludge low recoveries of enveloped murine hepatitis virus mhv from wastewater solids have been reported using various solutions including 3 be and 0 05 m gb 1 to 3 7 which was consistent with its faster inactivation in wastewater ye et al 2016 meanwhile the elution of different nonenveloped viruses from sludge also varied greatly and similar results have been reported for bacteriophages and human enteric viruses from membrane filters hamza et al 2009 pisharody et al 2020 implying the different interaction mechanisms between different viruses and sludge thus the eluents should be optimized for certain virus to ensure efficient recovery to further improve virus recovery ultrasonic treatment and surfactants were chosen to remove adhering viruses by disturbing the adsorption between virus and sludge the ultrasonic method can disintegrate sludge particles and disperse biological flocs which may promote the release of viruses entrapped in sludge floc chen et al 2017 significant higher numbers of bacteriophages and human viruses were recovered from various aquatic environments when ultrasonication was applied to membrane filters during the elution step jones et al 2009 mackowiak et al 2018 in this study ultrasonic treatment during the elution process resulted in significantly higher recoveries of phix174 while it did not significantly improve the recoveries of ms2 and t4 compared with the other three viruses phi6 was more susceptible to ultrasound pretreatment with slightly decreased recoveries and the fragility may be attributed to the lipid envelope which requires special elution buffers or methods although surfactants were reported to compete with available sorption sites of phages and decrease the adsorption of sludge to the virus they may adversely affect phage survivability under some conditions which did not significantly improve the elution of the virus and even inhibited recovery chattopadhyay et al 2002 simon et al 2021 surfactants may be more suitable for the extraction of viral genomes rather than viral infectivity it was reported that the extraction of extracellular resistance genes in sludge was improved with the addition of surfactants zou et al 2020 two concentration methods i e peg precipitation and ultrafiltration with different mechanisms were compared for the concentration in eluant the ultrafiltration method can retain larger sized particles like viruses via size exclusion while the peg method precipitates virus particles by changing the dielectric constant of the liquid around the virus particles cashdollar and wymer 2013 nour et al 2021 significantly higher recoveries 50 39 88 89 p 0 05 of the four coliphages were obtained with ultrafiltration than peg precipitation fig 2 similarly high recoveries of both infective enveloped virus and virus rna in wastewater samples concentrating by ultrafiltration have been reported by other studies ahmed et al 2020 laturner et al 2021 ye et al 2016 the precipitation of inhibitor and destruction of envelope structure may cause low recoveries for different viruses with peg deboosere et al 2012 hamza et al 2009 these results suggest that ultrafiltration may be suitable for recovering both infective viruses and virus genes for qpcr detection in addition it was found that the recoveries of virus concentrating by both peg precipitation and ultrafiltration methods were influenced by virus types the recoveries of infective ms2 were always lower than that of the other three viruses which may be due to the structure and molecular mass of their capsid proteins in sum the optimal recoveries of 58 74 8 31 36 52 9 44 20 01 6 52 and 9 72 3 44 for phix174 t4 ms2 and phi6 was obtained by combining the optimal elution approaches and ultrafiltration methods 3 2 survivability of infective virus surrogates in sewage sludge the potential exposure and transmission risk of the infective virus through sludge treatment and disposal is always associated with viral survival and persistence yang et al 2020 we compared the effects of sludge fractions the liquid and solid fraction on the survivability of infective virus surrogates fig 3 table s2 when it comes to the liquid fraction i e solid removed samples there were greater inactivation rates in phi6 ms2 t4 and phix174 with the t90 values i e the calculated time to reach 90 inactivation of 80 h 269 h and not applicable na respectively at the temperature of 4 c similar trends were found at the temperature of 25 c suggesting the differences in the persistence of the various virus we further found that raising temperature was responsible for the increase in the inactivation rates relative to the incubation condition at 4 c the first order kinetics increased by 3 0 folds for phi6 and 2 3 folds for ms2 respectively however the inactivation rates of t4 and phix174 were still not observed at the temperature of 25 c revealing their great persistence in the solid removed fraction of sludge these results showed that nonenveloped viruses were stable in the sludge system and this may be attributed to the structural difference of the virus similar results were found in the urine and wastewater environments and t4 and phix174 thus had been considered as conservative indicators of tolerated enterovirus al et al 2018 decrey and kohn 2017 magri et al 2015 in contrast as enveloped virus the high inactivation rate of phi6 was due to its fragile lipid envelope structure the increased temperature further accelerated the inactivation process by increasing the viral sensitivity to physical or biological influencing factors on the other hand virus genome types may also contribute to the various persistence ssrna viruses were shown to be the most sensitive to ammonia in human excreta compared with dna viruses and dsrna viruses decrey and kohn 2017 which may cause the faster inactivation for ms2 in sludge supernatant than that for t4 and phix174 the inactivation of the virus in the solid containing sludge samples was further investigated by using the optimal elution methods similar to the inactivation in the solid removed sludge samples the inactivation of viruses was also affected by the virus types and temperature in solid containing sludge samples for example the t90 of phi6 t4 phix174 and ms2 at 4 c were 40 1 h 69 10 h 159 70 h and na respectively the t90 of enveloped phi6 in sludge could be shortened to 10 2 h at the temperature of 25 c and that of nonenveloped viruses could be shortened to 26 5 h suggesting that there were significant differences in the sensitivity of virus types to temperature in addition the inactivation of the four viruses was not statistically different in solid removed and solid containing sludge samples at low temperature 4 c while the inactivation kinetics 0 09 0 02 to 0 25 0 05 h 1 of the four viruses in solid containing sludge samples at 25 c were significantly faster than those in solid removed sludge samples na to 0 10 0 01 h 1 table s2 indicating that the solid fraction of sludge played an important role in virus inactivation biosolids often were considered to slow virus inactivation but the faster inactivation of phix174 and ms2 in solid containing samples were also observed in the previous study roberts et al 2016 ye et al 2016 which may be caused by biosolid types a greater reduction in infectivity of phi6 was observed after virus was adsorbed by montmorillonite or kaolinite and the disassembly of the viral envelope was found to be the main reason for infectivity loss al et al 2018 it has been reported that the inactivation rate constant of phi6 on solid surfaces at 4 c was consistent with that in solids removed samples which was similar to the results of this study on the contrary the faster inactivation in solid containing sludge samples at 25 c may be due to the enhanced inactivation on the solid surfaces or irreversible binding to the surface in addition the inactivation rate of phi6 in the liquid fraction of sludge increased by 3 folds with the increase of temperature while that in the solid fraction increased by 6 folds table s2 indicating that the increase of temperature might lead to the increase of the contribution of irreversible adsorption overall viruses including enveloped phi6 in sludge can survive for several hours to days and even weeks under low temperature which significantly increases the exposure and transmission risk of the virus during sludge treatment and disposal using phi6 as a candidate surrogate indicator of enveloped virus in sludge is of great significance but it may underestimate the persistence of human enveloped virus given that phi6 inactivates faster than some other enveloped viruses such as mhv and influenza virus carvalho et al 2017 compared with enveloped viruses nonenveloped viruses such as ms2 t4 and phix174 in sludge can survive longer and some enteroviruses have been reported to persist in the form of vesicle encapsulated virus clusters that can resist environmental stress and uv254 disinfection zhang et al 2021 therefore the prevention and control of infective nonenveloped virus dissemination in sludge should be focused on and strengthened furthermore the exposure and transmission risk of the viruses in the sludge at low temperatures is of great concern and needs to be carefully assessed 3 3 sorption behavior of virus surrogates to sewage sludge 3 3 1 different adsorption behavior of virus surrogates in sludge in addition to the inactivation in the liquid or solid phase of sludge adsorption to and desorption from sludge were some of the most important factors controlling the removal and transport of viruses grant et al 1993 when the viruses were spiked into sludge samples the normalized virus concentration in supernatant firstly decrease rapidly and then slowed to a rate that was equal to or slower than virus inactivation in the solid containing sludge samples fig 4 table s3 the adsorption of viruses onto sludge solid was rapid but not instantaneous and the required time to reach adsorption saturation t p varied 5 h was needed for phi6 and t4 while 10 h was needed for ms2 and phix174 according to the time point when the rate turned meanwhile adsorption isotherms for four viruses on sludge could be fitted by the freundlich isotherms with the determination coefficient r 2 more than 0 94 the adsorption capacity log kf of sludge on enveloped phi6 was higher than nonenveloped viruses and log kf of phi6 phix174 ms2 and t4 were 6 51 0 54 5 73 0 17 5 09 0 69 and 3 93 0 12 respectively fig s3 table s4 the results indicated that the adsorption capacity and rate of sludge for phi6 were greater than that for ms2 t4 and phix174 the higher adsorption capacity and faster aggregation rate of sludge for enveloped phi6 have been confirmed to be governed by the hydrophobic interaction brought by its lipid layer structure al et al 2018 similar results have been observed when studying the heteroaggregation of enveloped viruses with colloidal sediments and wastewater solids al et al 2018 ye et al 2016 the aggregation of enveloped viruses with sediments may cause virus disassembly and infectivity loss but the infectivity of enveloped influenza virus was not compromised despite aggregation and deformation block et al 2016 indicating that the various surface phosphor lipids and membrane proteins may make enveloped viruses in adsorbed status significantly different stabilities therefore more enveloped viruses will need to be tested to evaluate the effects of their unique lipids on sorption and persistence additionally there were differences in adsorption among nonenveloped viruses and phix174 adsorption to sludge was strong with log kf of 5 73 0 17 followed by ms2 and t4 the adsorption between nonenveloped virus and solid surfaces was reported to be governed by long ranged electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction armanious et al 2016 as both the sludge and bacteriophages were negatively charged at natural ph conditions the slightly greater adsorption for phix174 than ms2 may be consistent with its higher isoelectric point value and lower electrostatic repulsion similar results have been observed when investigating the affinity of phix174 and ms2 for ottawa sand jin et al 2000 besides the electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction virus transport was also virus size dependent weisbrod et al 2013 the lower adsorption of t4 may relate to it being bigger x223c80 110 nm head x223c110 20 nm tail than ms2 and phix174 x223c25 nm which would collide rarely with sludge particles due to brownian motion similarly ye et al 2016 also reported the nonsignificant partitioning to wastewater solids for t3 those results indicated that the sorption mechanisms for different viruses to sludge varied greatly on the other hand the adsorption behavior of viruses was also influenced by the structure and characteristics of sorbents it was reported that the log kf values for ms2 and phix174 in nonsterilized red soil were 3 25 and 2 26 hui et al 2010 and that in clay minerals were 2 88 3 64 and 2 24 3 35 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2012 obviously the affinity of both viruses to sludge was greater 5 09 0 69 of ms2 and 5 73 0 17 of phix174 than that to red soil and clay minerals compared with soil and clay minerals sludge has more complex floc structures and compositions viruses can not only be entrapped by the irregular macroporous of sludge but also attach to sludge through hydrogen and chemical bonding cui et al 2011 various extracellular organic contents including proteins and lipids can provide large amounts of binding sites for virus adsorption sheng et al 2010 heavy metals and other pollutants absorbed in sludge may also affect the adsorption capacity for viruses in addition the mechanisms of sorption for viruses to different sorbents also varied greatly greater adsorption for ms2 than phix174 onto quartz sands clays and red soils was reported and hydrophobic effect rather than electrostatic interactions was the main contributor given the higher hydrophobicity of ms2 brought by its hydrophobic protein coat chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2012 hui et al 2010 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 3 3 2 effects of temperature ph and cations on adsorption of virus surrogates to sludge the sorption process of sludge for all viruses increased with increasing temperature fig 4 which may be related to the more stable hydrophobicity at a higher temperature syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 the results were consistent with ms2 and phix174 in kaolinite and bentonite bellou et al 2015 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2010 on contrary the human adenovirus was more tightly adsorbed on kaolinite and bentonite at 4 c than 25 c bellou et al 2015 implying that ms2 and phix174 maybe not suitable surrogates for the sorption behavior of human adenoviruses in addition with increasing temperature the conversion of reversibly adsorbed viruses to irreversibly adsorbed states in sludge system was involved according to the adsorption and inactivation kinetics generally the ph value can influence electrostatic interactions by affecting the virus and sorbent surfaces charges and the electrostatic repulsion between viral and solids increases at higher ph according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory armanious et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 increasing adsorption capacity of sludge for four viruses was obtained in this study when the sludge ph decreased from 8 5 to 6 5 fig 5 a however when sludge ph further decreased to 5 5 the adsorption capacity of sludge for phi6 ms2 and t4 did not increase but decreased indicating that electrostatic interaction was not the dominant sorption mechanism of these three viruses at a lower ph value in addition to changes in sludge surface charge the sludge ph can also affect the floc structure and relative hydrophobicity raynaud et al 2012 the breakage of sludge flocs and degradation of extracellular polymeric substances at acidic or alkaline ph conditions can affect the sorption process directly or indirectly through the varied sludge relative hydrophobicity ou et al 2020 wei et al 2019 therefore it is not easier to study the interaction mechanism between sludge and viruses due to the complexity of sludge composition and structure and more characterization methods are needed for studying the interactions between sludge and viruses however what is certain is that the dominant interaction between phix174 and sludge was different from that of the other three viruses given that the adsorption capacity of phix174 onto sludge increased with decreasing ph value as an inevitable component of domestic wastewater excess concentration of cations was found to lead to the destruction of sludge structure and the deterioration in sludge settleability kara et al 2010 on the other hand it was also found that the presence of cations can enhance the virus adsorption onto the sand by shielding charge and shrinking the electrostatic double layer nasser et al 1993 wong et al 2012 effects of cations on virus adsorption onto sludge were then evaluated by extra addition fig 5 b the adsorption capacity of sludge to phi6 t4 and phix174 increased with the addition of metal cations the multivalent cations showed greater ability to promote adsorption of t4 by sludge which was consistent with the results of adsorption behaviors of human adenovirus onto sand reported by wong et al 2013 however there were no significant effects of cation valence on the adsorption of phi6 and phix174 to sludge effects of cations on virus adsorption were also related to the organic matter in sludge for instance the addition of cations na ca2 and mg2 did not enhance the adsorption for both ms2 and rotavirus onto hematite nanoparticles present with the natural organic matter gutierrez et al 2009 which may explain the different adsorption behavior of ms2 in presence of cations in this study interestingly the adsorption capacity of sludge for viruses was often higher under the typical conditions of room temperature neutral ph and the presence of cations suggesting that untreated sewage sludge could be the reservoir of viruses without additional conditioning fortunately sludge solids could increase the sensitivity of adsorbed viruses to temperature so further increasing temperature may be beneficial to the inactivation of viruses in the sludge system 3 3 3 different desorption from sludge solids the desorption capacity of viruses from waste activated sludge was also virus type dependent fig 6 phix174 was the easiest to be desorbed naturally with the total percentage of 21 87 2 30 for 24 h followed by ms2 t4 and phi6 which was consistent with the recoveries during virus elution process compared with the other three viruses the bound of phix174 to sludge was weak and a considerable fraction of phix174 was able to remain infective during the adsorption or desorption process inevitably a high level of easily desorbed viruses may be released from sludge during rain events during sludge storage and land application which have a high potential to contaminate surface and ground waters more than 95 of phi6 ms2 and t4 adsorbed to sludge could not be desorbed naturally which limited the efficient elution and recovery of the virus xing et al divided the binding strength between ms2 and colloid into weakly bound and strongly bound by the fraction of natural desorption and found more than 90 of ms2 was strongly bound or entrapped on colloid xing et al 2020 in addition virus desorption would be impacted by the types and organic contents of sorbents in this study the fraction of desorbed ms2 and phix174 in sewage sludge were 2 97 0 80 and 21 87 2 30 while that in red soil were reported to be average 4 02 and 1 86 respectively hui et al 2010 the desorption of viruses from sludge solid could be enhanced by mixing with elution buffers including be and gb indicating that a considerable fraction of strongly bound viruses may maintain their structural integrity and infectivity large numbers of phi6 were also reported to remain viable post aggregation with colloidal sediments despite the fragility of the viral envelope al et al 2018 however due to the limited recovery of strongly bound viruses during the elution process it is difficult to accurately evaluate the titer of infectious viruses adsorbed to solids which may underestimate virus concentration and risk in sludge samples 4 conclusion the optimal effective elution method varies by the viral analyte compared with nonenveloped viruses ms2 t4 and phix174 the poor recoveries of enveloped phi6 during elution and vulnerability to homogenization methods such as ultrasound treatment limited the efficient detection which needs to be further optimized for virus concentration the ultrafiltration method reduced the recovery loss for four virus surrogates with higher recoveries 50 39 to 88 89 p 0 05 faster inactivation for viruses in solid containing sludge than that in solid removed samples at 25 c was observed regardless of virus type implying the solid fraction of sludge at high temperature played an important role in virus inactivation although the inactivation kinetics of envelope virus phi6 and ssrna virus ms2 in sludge was faster long survivability needs to be of great concern during sludge collection transportation and treatment process especially at low temperatures the adsorption and desorption behavior of viruses in sludge is virus type dependent and greater adsorption capacity for enveloped phi6 log kf of 6 51 0 54 than nonenveloped virus surrogates log kf of 3 93 0 12 to 5 73 0 17 was observed except for the temperature effects of ph and cations on the adsorption of four virus surrogates to sludge varied by the viral analyte the binding strength of phix174 on sludge was weak with a desorption percentage of 21 87 2 30 while more than 95 of phi6 ms2 and t4 adsorbed to sludge were strongly bound low natural desorption of virus was partially improved by different elution methods indicating that considerable fractions of viruses were not inactivated by association with a solid phase declaration of
