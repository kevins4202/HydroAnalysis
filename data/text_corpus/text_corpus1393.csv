conditions i e climatology are investigated the analysis focuses on the role of major teleconnection indices for the conditions of the driest wettest winters according to the results the arctic oscillation ao index is the best indicator of variability in the driest wettest conditions which are conventionally associated with the north atlantic oscillation nao large scale climate variability over the mediterranean basin is strongly linked with significant changes of the moisture fluxes in the gulf of mexico region and partially in the east coast region of the united states us especially for wet years in the western mediterranean the displacement of the prevailing atmospheric centres of action located over the subtropical mid east atlantic azores high to the northwest atlantic determines the wet conditions over the western and eastern mediterranean basins respectively it is speculated that the relative strengths and positions of these large scale systems control the eastern and western patterns of the mediterranean climate variability keywords atmospheric moisture budget convergence regional and year to year variability teleconnections mediterranean basin standardized precipitation index 1 introduction the greater mediterranean basin is a significant region in terms of the study of the climate hydrological cycle future climate changes and variability due to its large scaled atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections and circulations sahin et al 2015 the mediterranean is a marginal basin having a much higher extent and depth when compared to the other basins lionello et al 2012 and is connected through a very narrow opening into the ocean gibraltar strait the specific characteristics of the mediterranean region reveal various topographical and geographical structures due to the presence of various high mountains and steep rocky cliffs distinct coastlines islands and peninsulas of different sizes sahin et al 2015 türkeş 2010 türkeş and tatlı 2014 mariotti et al 2002 the north atlantic oscillation nao arctic oscillation ao african and asian monsoons are the major climate modes that drive climate variability over the greater mediterranean basin e g brönnimann et al 2007 basharin et al 2003 hurrell et al 2003 mariotti et al 2002 ziv et al 2004 rowell 2003 rodwell and hoskins 2001 on the contrary which of the teleconnection patterns affect the variability during driest wettest conditions and the extent of this impact are open to discussion moreover the greater mediterranean basin may be divided into two sub basins due to its distinct types of climate different teleconnections and large scale pressure systems affecting these sub basins therefore it could be stated that comprehensive studies are required in order to compare and reveal the differences between teleconnections especially during driest wettest conditions since the increase in the temperature of both air and the sea surface is resulted in global warming the probabilities of extreme weather conditions and climate events have been elevating as well ipcc 2012 furthermore the interpretability of teleconnections and the predictability of driest wettest conditions are getting more difficult in lópez moreno et al 2007 a better understanding of the spatial and temporal structure of teleconnections and their climatological role is required in order to see improvements in terms of forecasting unfortunately it could be noted that no standard way of defining the spatial and temporal structure of teleconnection patterns are available according to the literature review it has been seen that there are number of studies regarding the influence of atmospheric teleconnections on the climate of the greater mediterranean basin e g lingis and michaelides 2009 trigo et al 2006 türkeş 1998 türkeş and erlat 2003 2006 2008 ulbrich et al 2012 xoplaki et al 2003 2004 the most common approach is to explain the occurrence of driest wettest conditions with positive negative phases of teleconnections especially with the nao e g hurrell 1995 hurrell and van loon 1997 lópez moreno et al 2007 türkeş and erlat 2005 etc as the result of the study of kotsias and lolis 2017 they have found strong connections between cloud cover and the indices of the nao the north sea caspian pattern ncp the ao the southern oscillation so and the eastern atlantic western russia pattern ea wrp in order to define climate variability over mediterranean on the other hand krichak and alpert 2005 have showed the role of the ea wr teleconnection pattern in identifying the variability of the monthly mean of mediterranean precipitation in the study conducted by kutiel and benaroch 2002 it has been stated that temperature and precipitation anomalies over some parts of eastern mediterranean are related with anomalous circulation due to opposite ncp phases in addition drought occurrences over the northern mediterranean were studied extensively by several authors using different time scales of spi vicente serrano et al 2016 studies in the literature have also suggested that nao is a close relative of the ao ambaum et al 2001 wallace 2000 thompson and wallace 1998 deser 2000 monahan et al 2000 and whether one or the other is more fundamentally representative of the atmosphere s dynamics have been discussed ambaum et al 2001 have argued that the nao can be identified in a more physically meaningful way atmospheric moisture flux convergence amc can be defined as convergence of horizontal transport advection of atmospheric moisture into a given area the amc makes it possible to assess the proportion of the atmospheric moisture flux amf over a region involved in the region s hydrologic cycle the amc is a term describing the conservation of water vapour in an equation it was first calculated in the 1950s e g spar 1953 bradbury 1957 as a vertically integrated quantity and enabled forecasted precipitation related to synoptic scale weather systems and regional orographic lifting mechanisms in the 1970s the amc was incorporated into forecasting convective initiation in the mid latitudes since then it has been increasingly used with surface data owing to the increasing spatial and temporal resolution of surface observations the amc is one of the most significant aspects of the moisture balance over a large moisture source such as the mediterranean sahin et al 2015 the aim of this study is to reveal the atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms that control the variability of the driest and wettest conditions over the mediterranean basin accordingly the greater mediterranean basin was divided into two sub basins eastern and western mediterranean and examined in dry wet conditions using moisture flux climatology in the study we have mainly focused on winter season when dry and wet conditions in the mediterranean basin are dictated by the large scale atmospheric circulation vicente serrano et al 2016 it is well known that extreme ao nao and so phases do not necessarily mean that extreme weather conditions will occur in the greater mediterranean basin unlike the studies seen in the literature we have preferred the driest and wettest winters according to the standardized precipitation index spi rather than the highest lowest teleconnection indices afterwards we have defined the teleconnection patterns conditionally on the driest and wettest winters this approach enabled us to compare teleconnection patterns affecting driest wettest conditions over greater mediterranean basin the novel aspects of this study relative to existing studies are outlined as follows the mediterranean basin was divided into two sub basins in order to evaluate changing atmospheric controls and mechanisms from western to eastern mediterranean dry and wet conditions were examined using the atmospheric moisture budget atmospheric moisture flux and its convergence dry and wet years were selected using spi in contrast to the literature using historical events records or highest lowest teleconnection indices a significance test was applied in a vectoral field using an equation proposed in the study 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the ncep ncar 6 hourly reanalysis datasets at 2 5 2 5 resolution for the 66 year period between 1949 and 2014 kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 were used to calculate the monthly moisture flux climatology of the greater mediterranean basin the reanalysis data can be accessed through the ncep ncar http wesley wwb noaa gov reanalysis html or through the national climatic data center ncdc http www ncdc noaa gov the monthly precipitation totals mm required to calculate the spi index were obtained from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc for the period between 1949 and 2010 the data is composed of monthly totals on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 based on quality controlled data from 67 200 stations world wide that feature record durations of 10 years or more gpcc monthly data archived on 0 5 0 5 grids http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data gpcc html were preferred due to their high resolution schneider et al 2011 the data used in this study were presented in table 1 the monthly averages of atmospheric moisture flux and its convergence were calculated using 6 hourly data the relatively high temporal resolution 6 hourly of the data is required for the computation of the monthly vertically integrated moisture transport mariotti et al 2002 the precision and reliability of the ncep ncar reanalysis data have been thoroughly evaluated basist and chelliah 1996 derber and wu 1998 finger et al 1993 kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 bromwich and wang 2005 the comparisons between reanalysis and observational data have revealed that there were minor differences for most variables kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 the mid season month of january was selected as the winter season the driest and wettest months have been chosen according to the standardized precipitation index spi the 3 month spi reflects short and medium term moisture conditions and provides a seasonal estimation monthly series of nao ao and so indices are available on the web site of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa http www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections the nao index can be calculated using a rotated principal component analysis rpca barnston and livezey 1987 of the sea level pressure field or using the sea level pressure difference between the icelandic low and various southern points lisbon azores gibraltar etc in our study the nao index based on rpca is preferred due to the higher correlations with spi in larger areas moreover some studies have concluded that station based indices do not provide an optimal representation of the nao wallace 2000 folland et al 2009 2 2 methods 2 2 1 standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation means the deviation of precipitation from the mean value normalized by the standard deviation where the mean and standard deviation are determined from the climatological record an additional gamma transformation is applied to make the index distribution close to normal thom 1966 heim 2002 the spi has various advantages over other precipitation indices including its simplicity and temporal flexibility which allow its application for water resources on all timescales türkeş and tatlı 2009 the spi can be computed for time scales ranging from one month to 24 months to capture both short term and long term drought events due to normal distribution the spi is equally appropriate for analysis of wet and dry conditions more information can be obtained through world meteorological organization wmo spi user guide wmo 2012 2 2 2 calculation of the moisture budget in this study we used the atmospheric moisture budget equation proposed by trenberth and guillemot 1995 this mass conservation equation can be written as 1 p e w t 1 g p top p sfc q v d p where e is the rate of evaporation mm s from the surface p is the precipitation rate mm s q is the atmospheric specific humidity kg kg w is precipitable water kg m2 p sfc is the surface air pressure p is atmospheric pressure pa p top is the air pressure at the top of the atmosphere pa v is the horizontal wind velocity m s and g is the gravity constant m s2 as most of the atmospheric specific humidity exists below 300 hpa the atmospheric moisture budget equation is integrated between surface pressure level and 300 hpa the first term on the right hand side of the eq 1 is the time derivative of precipitable water w referred to as the storage term and can be written as 2 w 1 g p top p sfc qdp for a specific study area eq 1 can be expressed as 3 p e w t 1 a p top p sfc q v g d p n d l where the second term of right hand side is the mean moisture flux through the boundary a is the area over which p e is calculated and n is the line normal bromwich et al 2000 cullather et al 2000 the first right hand side term of the eq 3 can be neglected for annual time scales bromwich et al 2000 cullather et al 2000 wang 2004 hence 4 p e 1 a p top p sfc q v g d p n d l the mean moisture flux through the boundary can be decomposed into a mean and eddy component reynolds decomposition as follows 5 qv qv q v where the transient term is defined as 6 q v i 1 k q i q v i v k thus the atmospheric moisture budget equation can be rewritten using the mean and eddy flux terms 7 p e 1 g p top p sfc q d p t 1 g p top p sfc q v d p 1 g p top p sfc q v d p the study area is divided into a grid of points containing the mediterranean basin with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 in order to define an atmospheric column for moisture flux calculations the atmospheric moisture budget equation was calculated for the surface pressure and 300 hpa using centred finite differences on the latitude longitude grid the atmospheric moisture convergence fields were calculated via spherical harmonics using the spherepack 3 0 package adams and swarztrauber 1999 spherepack is a collection of fortran programs and subroutines facilitating computer modelling of geophysical processes 2 2 3 statistical significance the statistical significance of the amc differences between driest wettest months and average conditions was calculated by the kolmogorov smirnov ks test we have preferred ks test since it presents no assumptions regarding the data distribution and is sensitive to differences in terms of both location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the two samples sheskin 2011 the amf had two components zonal and meridional where the ks test cannot be applied simultaneously therefore we have implemented ks test to the magnitude of the amf differences defined as 8 v i u i u m 2 v i v m 2 where ui and vi are monthly zonal and meridional components of amf um and vm are time average of zonal and meridional component of amf the data were transformed by eq 8 and the ks test was applied to the driest wettest months and average conditions provided that the difference between the two amf vectors were calculated directly by subtracting them before separating them into their components the direction of the amf could not be taken into account for instance while the sum of the two vectors having the same length but opposite directions is zero the difference is larger than the magnitude of each vector therefore we were able to identify significant changes that may be associated with important atmospheric processes by using this difference 3 results 3 1 climatology of moisture fluxes we divided the mediterranean basin into western and eastern sub basins geographically in order to evaluate changing atmospheric controls and mechanisms from western to eastern mediterranean the boundary between the western mediterranean and the eastern mediterranean is the 20 east longitude the eastern mediterranean covers the countries to the east of the mediterranean sea for example the european and african parts of greece turkey and egypt are included in eastern mediterranean therefore western and eastern mediterranean were divided by using 20 east longitude tyrlis and lelieveld 2013 vertically integrated moisture flux vectors in kg ms 1 and amc shaded and contours in mm month over the study region in terms of the magnitude and spatial extent were shown in fig 1 a as seen the gulf of mexico is an important moisture source for western europe and the western and the north western regions of the mediterranean basin since local evaporation largely exceeds precipitation in the winter season it is well known that the low pressure system over iceland the icelandic low and the high pressure system over the azores the azores high mostly control the direction and strength of westerly moisture fluxes into europe according to fig 1a the amount of moisture transported to western europe and to the mediterranean basin is highly related to the gulf stream north atlantic drift fig 1b shows the vertically integrated eddy moisture flux vectors in kg m 1 s 1 and eddy moisture flux convergence transient eddy fluxes are defined as the covariance between specific humidity and the wind they are related to anomalous divergence during dry and wet conditions over the atlantic ocean basin large scale eddies recurrently develop and migrate along the storm track especially in the winter these eddies shown in fig 1b are generated under the remote influence of tropical variability or through internal atmospheric dynamics nakamura et al 2015 eddy activities over the mediterranean are stronger during the months of winter due to the stronger and more frequent frontal activities the subtropical westerlies collide with cold air traveling from the poles on the earth s surface at 60 north latitude as the result the frontal uplift and the formation of the sub polar lows and mid latitude cyclones occur therefore strong eddy activities over southern coast of the us are observed fig 1b fig 2 has shown the box plot of 3 month spi values calculated for the western mediterranean the length of each box presents the range where the central 50 of the values fall with the box edges called hinges at the first and third quartiles the whiskers show the range of observed values falling within the inner fences which define outside and far outside values in other words they have revealed the range of values within the range of 1 5 interquartile values beyond the outer fences are called far outside values and plotted with empty circles in fig 2 blue boxes represent the driest conditions whereas red boxes represent the wettest conditions for the studied period the 10 wettest red boxes and ten driest blue boxes winters for the western mediterranean were selected the reason of preferring 10 winters was to achieve a sample size of 30 months the choice of n 30 for a boundary between small and large samples was an approximate value e g hogg et al 2014 the 3 month mean spi values were calculated for the period between 1949 and 2010 and all grid points that belong to western mediterranean the box plots in fig 2 and fig 3 indicated the spread of the data by spacing between the different parts of the box mean values and skewness in the data and revealed outliers the wettest and driest years were selected accordingly the mean spi values for the western mediterranean for winter were shown in fig 3 the 10 driest and 10 wettest winters were selected according to the box plot of the 3 month spi values calculated for the western mediterranean the boundaries of the western mediterranean were shown in fig 4 in fig 4 a d 4of the 10 wettest and in fig 4 e h 4 of the 10 driest winters calculated for western mediterranean were demonstrated fig 4 and fig 5 a d referred to the wettest and e h referred to the driest winters the 3 month spi higher lower than zero indicated wet dry conditions as the dry or wet conditions became more severe the index was found to be more negative or positive as seen in fig 4 the wettest and the driest winters were separated very clearly according to the distribution of spi values and wet dry conditions were observed in the vast majority of western mediterranean the boundaries of the eastern mediterranean were shown in fig 5 in fig 6 the differences between anomalies for driest and normal amf conditions were presented for a western and b eastern mediterranean respectively in terms of representing moisture flux climatology january was a well representative month of winter season and highly reflects winter season conditions fig 6 confirmed that selecting the wettest conditions according to the 3 month spi was a reasonable approach as seen in fig 6 wet conditions prevailed over both western and eastern mediterranean yellow red circles indicated the areas where amc amf differences were statistically significant according to the ks test the displacements of prevailing atmospheric centres of action located over the subtropical mid east atlantic i e azores high and the north east atlantic i e sub polar or iceland low to the north generally determined wet winter conditions over the mediterranean it could be noted that this is the common feature of both the western and eastern mediterranean basins high pressure center located over azores provides wet conditions over western mediterranean as seen in fig 6a the displacement of azores high to the northwest atlantic determines wet conditions over the eastern mediterranean basins fig 6b it was considered that the relative strengths and positions of these large scale systems control the eastern and western patterns of the mediterranean climate variability the eastern atlantic amf that originates from gulf of mexico region fig 6a affects the amount of moisture available for the western mediterranean large scale precipitation changes over the mediterranean region are related to the major changes of the moisture fluxes in the gulf of mexico region and partially in the us east coast as seen in fig 6a moisture fluxes along the east coast of us and the gulf stream region drive warm and moist air over north west mediterranean and western europe atmospheric transport of moisture fluxes along the east coast of us and the gulf stream region particularly during winter are suggested as a likely cause of the wet conditions occurring for western europe and the mediterranean the ks test results of amc were not found statistically significant for driest conditions over greater mediterranean basin this leads to the conclusion that the large scale atmospheric conditions during the normal and dry conditions are similar which is expected as both western and eastern mediterranean are prone to dry conditions 3 2 atmospheric teleconnection patterns related to driest wettest conditions in fig 7 the amf anomalies of the driest and normal conditions of amf for western and eastern mediterranean were presented respectively red circles in fig 7 indicated the areas that amf differences were found statistically significant according to ks test no amc differences were found to be significant according to ks test as seen in fig 7a dry conditions were observed over the western mediterranean for the selected 10 years according to the 3 month spi moreover according to the ks test significant changes in amf took place over pacific eastern side of caspian sea and south eastern anatolia region of turkey it has been recommended that amf changes being statistically significant according to the ks test are not related to dry conditions over the western mediterranean considering their potential to affect climate variability over the study region according to fig 7a displacement of high pressure center over azores to the southern france was the reason for dry conditions over the mediterranean basin as seen in fig 7b dry conditions were observed over the eastern mediterranean this situation justifies the selection of dry years according to spi for the eastern mediterranean the existence of a high pressure center over the northern parts of the eastern mediterranean can be clearly observed it may block or reduce the size of low pressure cells and generate dry weather through the majority of asian landscapes according to this study the extension of relatively high pressure areas related to the siberian high pressure system is one of the reasons for dry conditions over eastern mediterranean and eastern europe the centre of action over the atlantic was thought to be the positive phase of nao we concluded that the dry conditions over eastern mediterranean were related to positive phase of nao and anticyclonic circulation and stability conditions associated with the siberian high pressure in fig 8 a and b spatial distributions of correlation coefficients between 3 month spi and teleconnection indices of ao and nao for winter months were presented respectively only the results with the pearson correlation are shown due to the fact that it leads to higher correlations in larger areas than the spearman coefficient in other words it means the relations are close to linear correlation information for all conditions such as normal moderate and wet dry were given in fig 8 in the future analysis the teleconnection influence on the wettest and the driest conditions over the western and eastern mediterranean basins will be examined according to the fig 8a and b the spatial structure of the ao corresponds closely to the nao in terms of correlation with the spi the correlations with the ao index were stronger over larger areas of the mediterranean basin than the correlation with the nao index ao and nao were certainly closely related whereas they were not identical these results have suggested that the ao index is a better indicator for the driest wettest conditions conventionally associated with the nao in fig 9 1 month spi was used to calculate the correlation between the spi and the ao for the wettest driest months of winter therefore the number of samples increases from 10 to 30 the same process was applied for the results demonstrated in figs 10 and 11 we studied on the possible serial correlations using the rank ljung box test widely applied in time series analysis ljung and box 1978 following the recommendation that the maximum number of lags be smaller than the quarter of the sample size lag n 4 we selected the maximum number of lags as 6 the highest autocorrelation was found in the time series that belong to dry years in the eastern mediterranean with 25 8 and the lowest autocorrelation was found in the correlation time series of dry years calculated for western mediterranean with 17 8 therefore we implemented the block bootstrap method considering serial correlations in order to determine the significantly correlated points the main problem was the selection of the bootstrap blocks length which was a form of smoothing parameter block length of 3 was selected representing consecutive winter months in this study the bootstrapped estimates were generated using 999 iterations and a significance level of 0 05 was used only the statistically significant points grids were shown in fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 in all plots in fig 9 the spatial pattern of the correlations resembled the wintertime ao thompson and wallace 1998 the winter ao pattern was characterized by a pressure dipole with centers of action over the atlantic basin the east of greenland and off the coast of spain as seen in fig 9a and fig 9c ao had not much impact on the driest wettest conditions over the western mediterranean on the other hand significant correlations were only seen in the atlantic side of spain and portugal the influence of the ao was much more on the eastern mediterranean the same situation was observed in fig 10 showing the impact of nao on the driest wettest conditions in the same region fig 6 presented the explanation accordingly the displacement of the high pressure center over the azores in fig 6a to the northwest atlantic in fig 6b identified the wettest conditions over western and eastern mediterranean due to the high pressure center over the azores high amount of moisture was migrated from the west coasts of great britain shown with yellow circle and france these severe moisture fluxes provide wet conditions over the western mediterranean as shown in fig 6b when the high pressure center moved to the northwest atlantic the direction of the moisture fluxes over the west coasts of great britain and france changed from west to north due to the direction of the moisture fluxes the atlantic cannot provide moisture to the western mediterranean and thus normal conditions were observed as seen in fig 6b the mediterranean sea provides moisture to the eastern mediterranean where wet conditions are observed over large areas this phenomenon underlies the existence of eastern and western patterns of mediterranean climate according to fig 10 it was seen that nao had no impact on dry conditions over eastern mediterranean in contrast to nao spi values were correlated with ao over northern part of eastern mediterranean as shown in fig 9d northern part of greece and italy and northwest of turkey had statistically significant correlations with ao this was the most substantial difference between the nao and ao when compared with fig 9 and fig 10 relatively weak strong moisture fluxes were observed during the driest wettest conditions in both eastern and western mediterranean that has revealed the role of mediterranean sea for dry and wet conditions over greater mediterranean basin moreover positive ao and nao index values were found in 8 of the 10 driest januaries for the eastern mediterranean higher pressure at mid latitudes due to positive ao phase was associated with drier conditions over eastern mediterranean during the positive ao phase the 500 hpa level was anomalously high over the northeast atlantic and europe including turkey whereas it was anomalously low over the region of the icelandic low this pattern has led to the intrusions of cold polar air southward into the balkans turkey and the eastern mediterranean türkeş and erlat 2008 no relation was found between nao ao as well and the driest wettest conditions over the western mediterranean we believe that this is caused by highly dynamic and non linear structure of nao during the driest wettest years over the western mediterranean fig 11 showed the spatial distribution of correlation coefficients between 1 month spi and soi for the eastern mediterranean the distributions of correlation coefficients were substantial only over eastern mediterranean as expected during wet conditions over eastern mediterranean the atlantic storm track was shifted to more southern latitudes and precipitation increased in some parts of the eastern mediterranean the el niño southern oscillation eñso cycles which were studied by several authors e g fraedrich 1994 brönnimann et al 2006 were found to have very similar patterns i e very low temperatures in north east part of europe a negative nao and increased decreased precipitation in the northern mediterranean region and norway according to this study increased precipitation amounts wetter conditions due to eñso were significant only in the eastern part of the mediterranean the non linear variability of eñso accompanied by somewhat different circulation anomalies over the mediterranean basin was quite large the location of this spatial variation may change during el nino winters as reported by brönnimann 2007 the effects of eñso for drier conditions over the greater mediterranean were very limited therefore there was no influence seen for drier conditions over the greater mediterranean basin 4 conclusions the study have shown that the mediterranean sea is the moisture source during wet conditions over the eastern mediterranean basin the atmospheric moisture flux amf convergence is statistically significant during wet conditions over the western mediterranean the results have suggested that moisture fluxes originating from the gulf of mexico are the predominant moisture source during wet conditions over the western mediterranean the atlantic thermohaline circulation is a wind driven large scale current potentially affecting the direction and the strength of the moisture fluxes therefore we recommend that the climatological role of the gulf stream for extreme climate conditions over the mediterranean basin should be further investigated the correlation of ao is seen quite better than nao with the spi anomalies both in the western and the eastern mediterranean sub basins it has been noted that the ao index is a better indicator of driest wettest conditions variability over the greater mediterranean basin positive ao phases are associated with a westward extension of the siberian anticyclone which is responsible for the driest conditions over the eastern mediterranean moreover a displacement of the high pressure centre over azores to the south of france causes dry conditions over the western mediterranean in both cases dry conditions over eastern western mediterranean the direction of the moisture fluxes is from the land to the sea preventing moisture transport to the entire mediterranean basin center of high pressure over the azores and a negative nao phase are observed during wet years over the western mediterranean furthermore the center of high pressure over the azores moves to the north west and a negative nao phase becomes dominant during wet years over the eastern mediterranean however no impact on the driest wettest conditions over the western mediterranean is found of any of ao or nao in climatology an index is defined as a statistical tool summarizing a measurement of the magnitude of one of the several aspects of large scale atmospheric circulation patterns summarizing large scale atmospheric circulation patterns such as ao and nao with index values may not sufficiently represent the non linear component of the phenomenon the moisture fluxes during wet conditions over the mediterranean basin are substantially different compared to the long term moisture fluxes this may be due to the fact that the occurrence of wet conditions in the mediterranean basin needs additional moisture and precipitation driven conditions that should contribute to the cyclogenesis mechanisms on the other hand moisture fluxes show similarity during dry and normal conditions over the mediterranean basin in terms of direction and magnitude indicating that the western and eastern mediterranean basins are generally prone to dry conditions according to the results of the study a large amount of amf transferred from the gulf of mexico and the east coast of us in winter substantially affect the atmospheric conditions over the western mediterranean and the western europe these moisture fluxes along the east coast of us and the gulf stream regions draw warm and moist air masses currently a global network of floating ocean sensors called argo has been working on near real time maps of temperature and salinity the number of the sensors is more than 3000 and they operate down to 2000 m thus the influence of the atlantic thermohaline circulation over the mediterranean basin should become clearer in the future the significant findings of the study in accordance with the relevant studies were highlighted below the arctic oscillation index is the best indicator of variability in the dry wet conditions over the mediterranean moisture fluxes originating from the gulf of mexico are the predominant moisture source during wet conditions over the western mediterranean moreover the mediterranean sea is the moisture source during wet conditions over the eastern mediterranean basin displacement of high pressure center over azores to the southern france is resulted in dry conditions over the entire mediterranean basin the center of high pressure located over azores provides wet conditions over the western mediterranean the displacement of azores high to the northwest atlantic determines wet conditions over the eastern mediterranean basins the relative strengths and positions of azores high control the eastern and western patterns of the mediterranean climate variability the extension of relatively high pressure areas related to the siberian high pressure system is one of the reasons for dry conditions over the eastern mediterranean acknowledgments we would like to thank both the noaa oar esrl psd boulder colorado usa for

affect the variability during driest wettest conditions and the extent of this impact are open to discussion moreover the greater mediterranean basin may be divided into two sub basins due to its distinct types of climate different teleconnections and large scale pressure systems affecting these sub basins therefore it could be stated that comprehensive studies are required in order to compare and reveal the differences between teleconnections especially during driest wettest conditions since the increase in the temperature of both air and the sea surface is resulted in global warming the probabilities of extreme weather conditions and climate events have been elevating as well ipcc 2012 furthermore the interpretability of teleconnections and the predictability of driest wettest conditions are getting more difficult in lópez moreno et al 2007 a better understanding of the spatial and temporal structure of teleconnections and their climatological role is required in order to see improvements in terms of forecasting unfortunately it could be noted that no standard way of defining the spatial and temporal structure of teleconnection patterns are available according to the literature review it has been seen that there are number of studies regarding the influence of atmospheric teleconnections on the climate of the greater mediterranean basin e g lingis and michaelides 2009 trigo et al 2006 türkeş 1998 türkeş and erlat 2003 2006 2008 ulbrich et al 2012 xoplaki et al 2003 2004 the most common approach is to explain the occurrence of driest wettest conditions with positive negative phases of teleconnections especially with the nao e g hurrell 1995 hurrell and van loon 1997 lópez moreno et al 2007 türkeş and erlat 2005 etc as the result of the study of kotsias and lolis 2017 they have found strong connections between cloud cover and the indices of the nao the north sea caspian pattern ncp the ao the southern oscillation so and the eastern atlantic western russia pattern ea wrp in order to define climate variability over mediterranean on the other hand krichak and alpert 2005 have showed the role of the ea wr teleconnection pattern in identifying the variability of the monthly mean of mediterranean precipitation in the study conducted by kutiel and benaroch 2002 it has been stated that temperature and precipitation anomalies over some parts of eastern mediterranean are related with anomalous circulation due to opposite ncp phases in addition drought occurrences over the northern mediterranean were studied extensively by several authors using different time scales of spi vicente serrano et al 2016 studies in the literature have also suggested that nao is a close relative of the ao ambaum et al 2001 wallace 2000 thompson and wallace 1998 deser 2000 monahan et al 2000 and whether one or the other is more fundamentally representative of the atmosphere s dynamics have been discussed ambaum et al 2001 have argued that the nao can be identified in a more physically meaningful way atmospheric moisture flux convergence amc can be defined as convergence of horizontal transport advection of atmospheric moisture into a given area the amc makes it possible to assess the proportion of the atmospheric moisture flux amf over a region involved in the region s hydrologic cycle the amc is a term describing the conservation of water vapour in an equation it was first calculated in the 1950s e g spar 1953 bradbury 1957 as a vertically integrated quantity and enabled forecasted precipitation related to synoptic scale weather systems and regional orographic lifting mechanisms in the 1970s the amc was incorporated into forecasting convective initiation in the mid latitudes since then it has been increasingly used with surface data owing to the increasing spatial and temporal resolution of surface observations the amc is one of the most significant aspects of the moisture balance over a large moisture source such as the mediterranean sahin et al 2015 the aim of this study is to reveal the atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms that control the variability of the driest and wettest conditions over the mediterranean basin accordingly the greater mediterranean basin was divided into two sub basins eastern and western mediterranean and examined in dry wet conditions using moisture flux climatology in the study we have mainly focused on winter season when dry and wet conditions in the mediterranean basin are dictated by the large scale atmospheric circulation vicente serrano et al 2016 it is well known that extreme ao nao and so phases do not necessarily mean that extreme weather conditions will occur in the greater mediterranean basin unlike the studies seen in the literature we have preferred the driest and wettest winters according to the standardized precipitation index spi rather than the highest lowest teleconnection indices afterwards we have defined the teleconnection patterns conditionally on the driest and wettest winters this approach enabled us to compare teleconnection patterns affecting driest wettest conditions over greater mediterranean basin the novel aspects of this study relative to existing studies are outlined as follows the mediterranean basin was divided into two sub basins in order to evaluate changing atmospheric controls and mechanisms from western to eastern mediterranean dry and wet conditions were examined using the atmospheric moisture budget atmospheric moisture flux and its convergence dry and wet years were selected using spi in contrast to the literature using historical events records or highest lowest teleconnection indices a significance test was applied in a vectoral field using an equation proposed in the study 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the ncep ncar 6 hourly reanalysis datasets at 2 5 2 5 resolution for the 66 year period between 1949 and 2014 kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 were used to calculate the monthly moisture flux climatology of the greater mediterranean basin the reanalysis data can be accessed through the ncep ncar http wesley wwb noaa gov reanalysis html or through the national climatic data center ncdc http www ncdc noaa gov the monthly precipitation totals mm required to calculate the spi index were obtained from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc for the period between 1949 and 2010 the data is composed of monthly totals on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 based on quality controlled data from 67 200 stations world wide that feature record durations of 10 years or more gpcc monthly data archived on 0 5 0 5 grids http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data gpcc html were preferred due to their high resolution schneider et al 2011 the data used in this study were presented in table 1 the monthly averages of atmospheric moisture flux and its convergence were calculated using 6 hourly data the relatively high temporal resolution 6 hourly of the data is required for the computation of the monthly vertically integrated moisture transport mariotti et al 2002 the precision and reliability of the ncep ncar reanalysis data have been thoroughly evaluated basist and chelliah 1996 derber and wu 1998 finger et al 1993 kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 bromwich and wang 2005 the comparisons between reanalysis and observational data have revealed that there were minor differences for most variables kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 the mid season month of january was selected as the winter season the driest and wettest months have been chosen according to the standardized precipitation index spi the 3 month spi reflects short and medium term moisture conditions and provides a seasonal estimation monthly series of nao ao and so indices are available on the web site of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa http www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections the nao index can be calculated using a rotated principal component analysis rpca barnston and livezey 1987 of the sea level pressure field or using the sea level pressure difference between the icelandic low and various southern points lisbon azores gibraltar etc in our study the nao index based on rpca is preferred due to the higher correlations with spi in larger areas moreover some studies have concluded that station based indices do not provide an optimal representation of the nao wallace 2000 folland et al 2009 2 2 methods 2 2 1 standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation means the deviation of precipitation from the mean value normalized by the standard deviation where the mean and standard deviation are determined from the climatological record an additional gamma transformation is applied to make the index distribution close to normal thom 1966 heim 2002 the spi has various advantages over other precipitation indices including its simplicity and temporal flexibility which allow its application for water resources on all timescales türkeş and tatlı 2009 the spi can be computed for time scales ranging from one month to 24 months to capture both short term and long term drought events due to normal distribution the spi is equally appropriate for analysis of wet and dry conditions more information can be obtained through world meteorological organization wmo spi user guide wmo 2012 2 2 2 calculation of the moisture budget in this study we used the atmospheric moisture budget equation proposed by trenberth and guillemot 1995 this mass conservation equation can be written as 1 p e w t 1 g p top p sfc q v d p where e is the rate of evaporation mm s from the surface p is the precipitation rate mm s q is the atmospheric specific humidity kg kg w is precipitable water kg m2 p sfc is the surface air pressure p is atmospheric pressure pa p top is the air pressure at the top of the atmosphere pa v is the horizontal wind velocity m s and g is the gravity constant m s2 as most of the atmospheric specific humidity exists below 300 hpa the atmospheric moisture budget equation is integrated between surface pressure level and 300 hpa the first term on the right hand side of the eq 1 is the time derivative of precipitable water w referred to as the storage term and can be written as 2 w 1 g p top p sfc qdp for a specific study area eq 1 can be expressed as 3 p e w t 1 a p top p sfc q v g d p n d l where the second term of right hand side is the mean moisture flux through the boundary a is the area over which p e is calculated and n is the line normal bromwich et al 2000 cullather et al 2000 the first right hand side term of the eq 3 can be neglected for annual time scales bromwich et al 2000 cullather et al 2000 wang 2004 hence 4 p e 1 a p top p sfc q v g d p n d l the mean moisture flux through the boundary can be decomposed into a mean and eddy component reynolds decomposition as follows 5 qv qv q v where the transient term is defined as 6 q v i 1 k q i q v i v k thus the atmospheric moisture budget equation can be rewritten using the mean and eddy flux terms 7 p e 1 g p top p sfc q d p t 1 g p top p sfc q v d p 1 g p top p sfc q v d p the study area is divided into a grid of points containing the mediterranean basin with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 in order to define an atmospheric column for moisture flux calculations the atmospheric moisture budget equation was calculated for the surface pressure and 300 hpa using centred finite differences on the latitude longitude grid the atmospheric moisture convergence fields were calculated via spherical harmonics using the spherepack 3 0 package adams and swarztrauber 1999 spherepack is a collection of fortran programs and subroutines facilitating computer modelling of geophysical processes 2 2 3 statistical significance the statistical significance of the amc differences between driest wettest months and average conditions was calculated by the kolmogorov smirnov ks test we have preferred ks test since it presents no assumptions regarding the data distribution and is sensitive to differences in terms of both location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the two samples sheskin 2011 the amf had two components zonal and meridional where the ks test cannot be applied simultaneously therefore we have implemented ks test to the magnitude of the amf differences defined as 8 v i u i u m 2 v i v m 2 where ui and vi are monthly zonal and meridional components of amf um and vm are time average of zonal and meridional component of amf the data were transformed by eq 8 and the ks test was applied to the driest wettest months and average conditions provided that the difference between the two amf vectors were calculated directly by subtracting them before separating them into their components the direction of the amf could not be taken into account for instance while the sum of the two vectors having the same length but opposite directions is zero the difference is larger than the magnitude of each vector therefore we were able to identify significant changes that may be associated with important atmospheric processes by using this difference 3 results 3 1 climatology of moisture fluxes we divided the mediterranean basin into western and eastern sub basins geographically in order to evaluate changing atmospheric controls and mechanisms from western to eastern mediterranean the boundary between the western mediterranean and the eastern mediterranean is the 20 east longitude the eastern mediterranean covers the countries to the east of the mediterranean sea for example the european and african parts of greece turkey and egypt are included in eastern mediterranean therefore western and eastern mediterranean were divided by using 20 east longitude tyrlis and lelieveld 2013 vertically integrated moisture flux vectors in kg ms 1 and amc shaded and contours in mm month over the study region in terms of the magnitude and spatial extent were shown in fig 1 a as seen the gulf of mexico is an important moisture source for western europe and the western and the north western regions of the mediterranean basin since local evaporation largely exceeds precipitation in the winter season it is well known that the low pressure system over iceland the icelandic low and the high pressure system over the azores the azores high mostly control the direction and strength of westerly moisture fluxes into europe according to fig 1a the amount of moisture transported to western europe and to the mediterranean basin is highly related to the gulf stream north atlantic drift fig 1b shows the vertically integrated eddy moisture flux vectors in kg m 1 s 1 and eddy moisture flux convergence transient eddy fluxes are defined as the covariance between specific humidity and the wind they are related to anomalous divergence during dry and wet conditions over the atlantic ocean basin large scale eddies recurrently develop and migrate along the storm track especially in the winter these eddies shown in fig 1b are generated under the remote influence of tropical variability or through internal atmospheric dynamics nakamura et al 2015 eddy activities over the mediterranean are stronger during the months of winter due to the stronger and more frequent frontal activities the subtropical westerlies collide with cold air traveling from the poles on the earth s surface at 60 north latitude as the result the frontal uplift and the formation of the sub polar lows and mid latitude cyclones occur therefore strong eddy activities over southern coast of the us are observed fig 1b fig 2 has shown the box plot of 3 month spi values calculated for the western mediterranean the length of each box presents the range where the central 50 of the values fall with the box edges called hinges at the first and third quartiles the whiskers show the range of observed values falling within the inner fences which define outside and far outside values in other words they have revealed the range of values within the range of 1 5 interquartile values beyond the outer fences are called far outside values and plotted with empty circles in fig 2 blue boxes represent the driest conditions whereas red boxes represent the wettest conditions for the studied period the 10 wettest red boxes and ten driest blue boxes winters for the western mediterranean were selected the reason of preferring 10 winters was to achieve a sample size of 30 months the choice of n 30 for a boundary between small and large samples was an approximate value e g hogg et al 2014 the 3 month mean spi values were calculated for the period between 1949 and 2010 and all grid points that belong to western mediterranean the box plots in fig 2 and fig 3 indicated the spread of the data by spacing between the different parts of the box mean values and skewness in the data and revealed outliers the wettest and driest years were selected accordingly the mean spi values for the western mediterranean for winter were shown in fig 3 the 10 driest and 10 wettest winters were selected according to the box plot of the 3 month spi values calculated for the western mediterranean the boundaries of the western mediterranean were shown in fig 4 in fig 4 a d 4of the 10 wettest and in fig 4 e h 4 of the 10 driest winters calculated for western mediterranean were demonstrated fig 4 and fig 5 a d referred to the wettest and e h referred to the driest winters the 3 month spi higher lower than zero indicated wet dry conditions as the dry or wet conditions became more severe the index was found to be more negative or positive as seen in fig 4 the wettest and the driest winters were separated very clearly according to the distribution of spi values and wet dry conditions were observed in the vast majority of western mediterranean the boundaries of the eastern mediterranean were shown in fig 5 in fig 6 the differences between anomalies for driest and normal amf conditions were presented for a western and b eastern mediterranean respectively in terms of representing moisture flux climatology january was a well representative month of winter season and highly reflects winter season conditions fig 6 confirmed that selecting the wettest conditions according to the 3 month spi was a reasonable approach as seen in fig 6 wet conditions prevailed over both western and eastern mediterranean yellow red circles indicated the areas where amc amf differences were statistically significant according to the ks test the displacements of prevailing atmospheric centres of action located over the subtropical mid east atlantic i e azores high and the north east atlantic i e sub polar or iceland low to the north generally determined wet winter conditions over the mediterranean it could be noted that this is the common feature of both the western and eastern mediterranean basins high pressure center located over azores provides wet conditions over western mediterranean as seen in fig 6a the displacement of azores high to the northwest atlantic determines wet conditions over the eastern mediterranean basins fig 6b it was considered that the relative strengths and positions of these large scale systems control the eastern and western patterns of the mediterranean climate variability the eastern atlantic amf that originates from gulf of mexico region fig 6a affects the amount of moisture available for the western mediterranean large scale precipitation changes over the mediterranean region are related to the major changes of the moisture fluxes in the gulf of mexico region and partially in the us east coast as seen in fig 6a moisture fluxes along the east coast of us and the gulf stream region drive warm and moist air over north west mediterranean and western europe atmospheric transport of moisture fluxes along the east coast of us and the gulf stream region particularly during winter are suggested as a likely cause of the wet conditions occurring for western europe and the mediterranean the ks test results of amc were not found statistically significant for driest conditions over greater mediterranean basin this leads to the conclusion that the large scale atmospheric conditions during the normal and dry conditions are similar which is expected as both western and eastern mediterranean are prone to dry conditions 3 2 atmospheric teleconnection patterns related to driest wettest conditions in fig 7 the amf anomalies of the driest and normal conditions of amf for western and eastern mediterranean were presented respectively red circles in fig 7 indicated the areas that amf differences were found statistically significant according to ks test no amc differences were found to be significant according to ks test as seen in fig 7a dry conditions were observed over the western mediterranean for the selected 10 years according to the 3 month spi moreover according to the ks test significant changes in amf took place over pacific eastern side of caspian sea and south eastern anatolia region of turkey it has been recommended that amf changes being statistically significant according to the ks test are not related to dry conditions over the western mediterranean considering their potential to affect climate variability over the study region according to fig 7a displacement of high pressure center over azores to the southern france was the reason for dry conditions over the mediterranean basin as seen in fig 7b dry conditions were observed over the eastern mediterranean this situation justifies the selection of dry years according to spi for the eastern mediterranean the existence of a high pressure center over the northern parts of the eastern mediterranean can be clearly observed it may block or reduce the size of low pressure cells and generate dry weather through the majority of asian landscapes according to this study the extension of relatively high pressure areas related to the siberian high pressure system is one of the reasons for dry conditions over eastern mediterranean and eastern europe the centre of action over the atlantic was thought to be the positive phase of nao we concluded that the dry conditions over eastern mediterranean were related to positive phase of nao and anticyclonic circulation and stability conditions associated with the siberian high pressure in fig 8 a and b spatial distributions of correlation coefficients between 3 month spi and teleconnection indices of ao and nao for winter months were presented respectively only the results with the pearson correlation are shown due to the fact that it leads to higher correlations in larger areas than the spearman coefficient in other words it means the relations are close to linear correlation information for all conditions such as normal moderate and wet dry were given in fig 8 in the future analysis the teleconnection influence on the wettest and the driest conditions over the western and eastern mediterranean basins will be examined according to the fig 8a and b the spatial structure of the ao corresponds closely to the nao in terms of correlation with the spi the correlations with the ao index were stronger over larger areas of the mediterranean basin than the correlation with the nao index ao and nao were certainly closely related whereas they were not identical these results have suggested that the ao index is a better indicator for the driest wettest conditions conventionally associated with the nao in fig 9 1 month spi was used to calculate the correlation between the spi and the ao for the wettest driest months of winter therefore the number of samples increases from 10 to 30 the same process was applied for the results demonstrated in figs 10 and 11 we studied on the possible serial correlations using the rank ljung box test widely applied in time series analysis ljung and box 1978 following the recommendation that the maximum number of lags be smaller than the quarter of the sample size lag n 4 we selected the maximum number of lags as 6 the highest autocorrelation was found in the time series that belong to dry years in the eastern mediterranean with 25 8 and the lowest autocorrelation was found in the correlation time series of dry years calculated for western mediterranean with 17 8 therefore we implemented the block bootstrap method considering serial correlations in order to determine the significantly correlated points the main problem was the selection of the bootstrap blocks length which was a form of smoothing parameter block length of 3 was selected representing consecutive winter months in this study the bootstrapped estimates were generated using 999 iterations and a significance level of 0 05 was used only the statistically significant points grids were shown in fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 in all plots in fig 9 the spatial pattern of the correlations resembled the wintertime ao thompson and wallace 1998 the winter ao pattern was characterized by a pressure dipole with centers of action over the atlantic basin the east of greenland and off the coast of spain as seen in fig 9a and fig 9c ao had not much impact on the driest wettest conditions over the western mediterranean on the other hand significant correlations were only seen in the atlantic side of spain and portugal the influence of the ao was much more on the eastern mediterranean the same situation was observed in fig 10 showing the impact of nao on the driest wettest conditions in the same region fig 6 presented the explanation accordingly the displacement of the high pressure center over the azores in fig 6a to the northwest atlantic in fig 6b identified the wettest conditions over western and eastern mediterranean due to the high pressure center over the azores high amount of moisture was migrated from the west coasts of great britain shown with yellow circle and france these severe moisture fluxes provide wet conditions over the western mediterranean as shown in fig 6b when the high pressure center moved to the northwest atlantic the direction of the moisture fluxes over the west coasts of great britain and france changed from west to north due to the direction of the moisture fluxes the atlantic cannot provide moisture to the western mediterranean and thus normal conditions were observed as seen in fig 6b the mediterranean sea provides moisture to the eastern mediterranean where wet conditions are observed over large areas this phenomenon underlies the existence of eastern and western patterns of mediterranean climate according to fig 10 it was seen that nao had no impact on dry conditions over eastern mediterranean in contrast to nao spi values were correlated with ao over northern part of eastern mediterranean as shown in fig 9d northern part of greece and italy and northwest of turkey had statistically significant correlations with ao this was the most substantial difference between the nao and ao when compared with fig 9 and fig 10 relatively weak strong moisture fluxes were observed during the driest wettest conditions in both eastern and western mediterranean that has revealed the role of mediterranean sea for dry and wet conditions over greater mediterranean basin moreover positive ao and nao index values were found in 8 of the 10 driest januaries for the eastern mediterranean higher pressure at mid latitudes due to positive ao phase was associated with drier conditions over eastern mediterranean during the positive ao phase the 500 hpa level was anomalously high over the northeast atlantic and europe including turkey whereas it was anomalously low over the region of the icelandic low this pattern has led to the intrusions of cold polar air southward into the balkans turkey and the eastern mediterranean türkeş and erlat 2008 no relation was found between nao ao as well and the driest wettest conditions over the western mediterranean we believe that this is caused by highly dynamic and non linear structure of nao during the driest wettest years over the western mediterranean fig 11 showed the spatial distribution of correlation coefficients between 1 month spi and soi for the eastern mediterranean the distributions of correlation coefficients were substantial only over eastern mediterranean as expected during wet conditions over eastern mediterranean the atlantic storm track was shifted to more southern latitudes and precipitation increased in some parts of the eastern mediterranean the el niño southern oscillation eñso cycles which were studied by several authors e g fraedrich 1994 brönnimann et al 2006 were found to have very similar patterns i e very low temperatures in north east part of europe a negative nao and increased decreased precipitation in the northern mediterranean region and norway according to this study increased precipitation amounts wetter conditions due to eñso were significant only in the eastern part of the mediterranean the non linear variability of eñso accompanied by somewhat different circulation anomalies over the mediterranean basin was quite large the location of this spatial variation may change during el nino winters as reported by brönnimann 2007 the effects of eñso for drier conditions over the greater mediterranean were very limited therefore there was no influence seen for drier conditions over the greater mediterranean basin 4 conclusions the study have shown that the mediterranean sea is the moisture source during wet conditions over the eastern mediterranean basin the atmospheric moisture flux amf convergence is statistically significant during wet conditions over the western mediterranean the results have suggested that moisture fluxes originating from the gulf of mexico are the predominant moisture source during wet conditions over the western mediterranean the atlantic thermohaline circulation is a wind driven large scale current potentially affecting the direction and the strength of the moisture fluxes therefore we recommend that the climatological role of the gulf stream for extreme climate conditions over the mediterranean basin should be further investigated the correlation of ao is seen quite better than nao with the spi anomalies both in the western and the eastern mediterranean sub basins it has been noted that the ao index is a better indicator of driest wettest conditions variability over the greater mediterranean basin positive ao phases are associated with a westward extension of the siberian anticyclone which is responsible for the driest conditions over the eastern mediterranean moreover a displacement of the high pressure centre over azores to the south of france causes dry conditions over the western mediterranean in both cases dry conditions over eastern western mediterranean the direction of the moisture fluxes is from the land to the sea preventing moisture transport to the entire mediterranean basin center of high pressure over the azores and a negative nao phase are observed during wet years over the western mediterranean furthermore the center of high pressure over the azores moves to the north west and a negative nao phase becomes dominant during wet years over the eastern mediterranean however no impact on the driest wettest conditions over the western mediterranean is found of any of ao or nao in climatology an index is defined as a statistical tool summarizing a measurement of the magnitude of one of the several aspects of large scale atmospheric circulation patterns summarizing large scale atmospheric circulation patterns such as ao and nao with index values may not sufficiently represent the non linear component of the phenomenon the moisture fluxes during wet conditions over the mediterranean basin are substantially different compared to the long term moisture fluxes this may be due to the fact that the occurrence of wet conditions in the mediterranean basin needs additional moisture and precipitation driven conditions that should contribute to the cyclogenesis mechanisms on the other hand moisture fluxes show similarity during dry and normal conditions over the mediterranean basin in terms of direction and magnitude indicating that the western and eastern mediterranean basins are generally prone to dry conditions according to the results of the study a large amount of amf transferred from the gulf of mexico and the east coast of us in winter substantially affect the atmospheric conditions over the western mediterranean and the western europe these moisture fluxes along the east coast of us and the gulf stream regions draw warm and moist air masses currently a global network of floating ocean sensors called argo has been working on near real time maps of temperature and salinity the number of the sensors is more than 3000 and they operate down to 2000 m thus the influence of the atlantic thermohaline circulation over the mediterranean basin should become clearer in the future the significant findings of the study in accordance with the relevant studies were highlighted below the arctic oscillation index is the best indicator of variability in the dry wet conditions over the mediterranean moisture fluxes originating from the gulf of mexico are the predominant moisture source during wet conditions over the western mediterranean moreover the mediterranean sea is the moisture source during wet conditions over the eastern mediterranean basin displacement of high pressure center over azores to the southern france is resulted in dry conditions over the entire mediterranean basin the center of high pressure located over azores provides wet conditions over the western mediterranean the displacement of azores high to the northwest atlantic determines wet conditions over the eastern mediterranean basins the relative strengths and positions of azores high control the eastern and western patterns of the mediterranean climate variability the extension of relatively high pressure areas related to the siberian high pressure system is one of the reasons for dry conditions over the eastern mediterranean acknowledgments we would like to thank both the noaa oar esrl psd boulder colorado usa for

parallel engineers are expected to develop new tools and methods that augment human capabilities through extracting useful knowledge from such huge amount of data in water related engineering fields there are increasing efforts to apply supervised machine learning methods as a sort of data driven techniques to discover knowledge from wide range of data in order to solve different kinds of problems in the multi disciplinary water resources engineering wre and management activities the supervised machine learning method provides learning algorithms mostly for the computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed the process of machine learning consists of searching in a data set to recognize a possible embedded pattern i e the process that generated the data once recognized it may be used to estimate values in future cases in other words the machine learning is the procedure by which computers map feature data inputs to labels outputs during the learning process data typically is divided into two sets of training and testing while the former is used to distill knowledge from the data the latter also called validation set is used to validate the generalization ability of the knowledge genetic programming gp is a supervised machine learning technique that uses evolutionary computing to solve wide spectrum of scientific problems it has recently received great attention in the wre community because of its unique feature of introducing explicit models for a given process according to the color based classification of environmental models gp is more than a common black box data driven technique it is a grey box technique that allows the modeler to control model structure to avoid the typical overfitting problem of traditional black box models and provides better physical interpretation of the process under consideration giustolisi et al 2007 despite increasing gp interests in a number of wre diverse problems no effort has been made to provide a comprehensive review on the theory and applications of gp variants used in wre community in recent years there has been some attempts but they either had low quantity in reviews or focused only some parts of wre rezapour et al 2010 concentrated on the applications of gp for suspended sediment estimation a total of 17 reviewed papers including applicants in sediment transport and some other fields in the wre londhe and dixit 2012 published a brief review on the applications of gp in ocean engineering and hydrology a total of 29 reviewed papers oyebode and adeyemo 2014 reviewed 21 papers which applied gp for hydrological forecasts particularly rainfall runoff modelling and streamflow predictions fallah mehdipour and haddad 2015 reviewed gp applications in hydrology particularly in rainfall runoff and ground water modelling there remains a lack of comprehensive survey of gp applications in wre to fill this gap our review considers all common applications of gp variants in various wre branches with emphasis on more recent applications in other words this review paper documents the concept of gp from the theory to implementation in the wide range of wre problems and presents some new ideas for the future studies reviewing more than 150 relevant papers mostly included by the web of science abstract and citation database www webofknowledge com we tried to review almost all the potential applications of gp in the multi disciplinary wre studies in this paper in terms of implementations we classified our diverse set of selected papers into three main categories i hydrology ii hydraulics and iii hydroclimatology the hydrologic studies cover extensive uses of gp in streamflow runoff forecasting rainfall runoff modeling water quality modeling prediction of surface subsurface water level fluctuations and soil properties modeling the hydraulic studies address topics in sediment transport and soil erosion relevant to water soil interaction in channels dam break and reservoirs operation flow in conduits pipe line flow open channel hydraulics coastal and ocean hydraulics wave height finally hydroclimatological studies include the applications of gp and its variants in modelling forecasting atmospheric phenomena variables such as drought precipitation temperature evaporation evapotranspiration solar radiation and so on in addition we emphasized some applications of gp in climate change studies in this exciting journey of gradual evaluation of gp and its variants as a favorite solution for the modern wre problems we will enjoy a large spectrum of challenges in physical problems and methodological approaches throughout the paper with respect to the type of features and labels used at each paper the wre research issues are considered into the following three groups i time series forecasting i e autoregressive models ii regression curve fitting and iii classification problems a brief summary of the reviewed papers together with authors and publication year implemented gp variant problem category input output variables and time scale of labels are presented within the respective groups in tables 1 3 2 fundamentals of genetic programming gp as a supervised machine learning technique gp is one of the most recent data driven techniques widely used in the wre it is inspired by biological evolution where each individual i e chromosome in the population takes the role of a possible solution for a given problem individuals in the population are breeding by exchanging their genetic materials to create better types known as offspring each individual has own fitness value which plays an essential role in the process of selection and producing new population the offspring and germane parents are the members of the new population which is created on the basis of the natural principle of survival of the fittest a selection method compares the quality fitness score of each individual and decides whether a certain one is worthy to be survived into the new population different selection methods treat individuals in a distinctive way once the new population is created the individuals are assessed to figure out how they solve the problem at hand the best individuals in the new population moves to another population and the breeding process that tends to create better individuals is repeated until an individual satisfies a given termination criterion individuals solutions in gp are computer programs whose explicit structure is of the main reasons to make gp popular and widely preferred in the wre community there are several ways to represent a computer program in gp for such representation examples aka gp variants monolithic gp classic gp multigene gp mggp gene expression programming gep and linear gp lgp all these variants have been used in the wre studies among these the monolithic gp with tree structure of an individual is the original and the most popular gp representation which was devised and promoted by cramer 1985 and koza 1990 respectively a brief overview of the theory of each variant is presented in the following sub sections 2 1 monolithic gp the idea behind the monolithic gp hereafter called gp is based on the tree representation of a computer program fig 1 which can be structured in different size shape and contents the gp trees are defined as chromosomes over which genetic operations such as crossover mutation and reproduction are performed fig 2 illustrates at the same time building blocks of a three level chromosome i e a computer program this is a simple program represented by eq 1 using a root node shown in light gray four inner nodes shown in white and four outer nodes or leaves shown in dark gray fig 1 1 x 2 cos x 1 3 0 sin x 1 the building blocks of the chromosome comprise of the functions sin c o s and the terminals x 1 x 2 3 0 the inner nodes includes the members of the function set and the outer nodes of the gp structure are composed of the members of the terminal set gp can adopt any function to create a computer program while the function set contains those defined by the modeler or automatically defined the terminal set contains only input variables and optionally random numbers the modeler has a flexibility to assign desirable weights for each function in order to increase or decrease its selection probability to solve any problem using a gp algorithm the modeler is advised to start with creating the initial population of tree shaped chromosomes koza 1990 at this stage three methods namely grow full and ramped half and half are available koza 1990 in all the method each chromosome begins with a root not by random selection of a member exclusively from the specified function set once the root node is defined the algorithm creates the required branches and first level inner nodes the number of branches that will be created in this step depends on the arity of the selected root function in grow method the other non root nodes are generated randomly from terminal or function sets in this case a function is selected for the next node the node becomes the inner node and branches are created with respect to the functionality of the node once a terminal node is created it is considered as the outer node and the generation process is deterred for the corresponding branch the procedure is continued for all other inner nodes until the specified tree level is reached the full approach generates each individual so that roots and all inner nodes are solely generated from the function set when the specified tree level is reached outer nodes are generated using the members only from the terminal set the ramped half and half is the mixed approach incorporating full and grow methods in this method the half of the initial population is first shaped by the full method and the remaining half is then handled by the grow method it is worth mentioning that in the classification problems the root node is constrained by specific functions which are defined as gp parameters danandeh mehr et al 2017 besides the fitness value of each chromosome the selection method used in gp algorithm has a vital role in surviving a chromosome to pass the next generation the broadly used selection techniques are fitness proportionate selection and tournament selection the former also called roulette wheel selection involves selection process based upon fitness value of the given chromosome in the population in the selection process each chromosome occupies an area on the roulette wheel proportional to its fitness the more fitness the larger associated area hence the method tries to assign higher probability to the more fitted chromosomes the tournament method is defined by randomly selecting k chromosomes in the population and among these the one having the higher fitness value will win tournament selection does not require population to be sorted in turn leading to better performance in comparison to previous selection methods tournaments often happen between two chromosomes although it can be performed on any k chromosomes in the population hrnjica and danandeh mehr 2019 the evolution process in gp includes three genetic operators reproduction crossover and mutation reproduction is asexual operation by which only one chromosome is involved in the operation it produces one offspring which is a pure copy of its parent typically the best chromosome of the population crossover is a procedure by which two parent chromosomes produce two offspring that have genetic material of the parents the crossover operation for two computer programs was illustrated in fig 2 at the outset the parents are selected by a selection method then crossover point at each parent is defined eventually the subtrees below the point are exchanged between the parents in order to create two new offspring mutation is another asexual operation whereby an offspring is created from one parent see fig 3 the operation initiates with random selection of a mutation node then subtree below the node is replaced with a new subtree which is generated randomly but controlled by the maximum operation level parameter 2 2 multigene genetic programming mggp mggp hinchliffe et al 1998 also called multi branches gp is the advancement of gp that linearly combines low depth gp blocks to improve the fitness of solutions evolved by monolithic gp owing to the use of smaller trees mggp is also expected to provide simpler models than those of monolithic gp searson 2015 in mggp the output variable is computed by the summation of weighted outputs of two or more gp trees in a multigene program plus a stochastic term referred to bias for example the pseudo linear mggp model shown in fig 4 represents the output variable y as a combination of three genes each represented by a function of the given input variables x 1 and x 2 eq 2 shows the mathematical expression of the mggp model shown in fig 4 2 y d 0 d 1 x 1 sin x 2 x 2 cos x 1 d 2 x 1 x 2 cos x 2 d 3 c 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 where d 0 is bias term noise and d 1 d 2 and d 3 are the gene weights i e regression coefficients the weights are used for scaling the output of each tree and typically determined by the symbolic regression algorithm therefore mggp employs the power of classical linear regression method to capture nonlinear behavior of physical systems here the term pseudo linear herein refers to the application of linear regression model to obtain optimum combination of the genes this is the original version of mggp however one can apply nonlinear regression techniques to optimize gene weights apart from linear or nonlinear combinations of genes if the modeler can integrate any data pre processing technique to mggp danandeh mehr and kahya 2017 or apply an external technique to optimize the gene weights the resultant model comes out to be a hybrid mggp model readers are referred to searson 2015 for details about evolution process in mggp 2 3 gene expression programming gep gep ferreira 2001 is a kind of multi branch gp that permits the modeler to create chromosomes expression trees ets containing one or multiple genes called sub expression trees sub ets each chromosome has fixed length string encoding to solve a given problem in gep the output variable is computed by linking the appropriate sub ets using algebraic or boolean functions and or not for instance a gep model specified in eq 3 represents the output variable y as the combination of three sub ets sub et 1 sub et 2 and sub et 3 linked together with addition function graphically expression tree of the equation and relevant sub ets are exhibited in fig 5 where the grey nodes denote the linking function position 3 y x 1 sin x 2 x 2 cos x 1 x 1 x 2 cos x 2 c 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1 and x 2 are the input variables and the addition sign between the parenthesis i e sub ets is called linking functions linking functions are used to transfer information from a sub et gene into an et and typically are addition or multiplication for algebraic sub ets and or or if for boolean sub ets ferreira 2006 depending on the problem of interest each sub et or a combination of sub ets can be selected as the best solution for the problem according to their respective fitness hrnjica and danandeh mehr 2019 although each sub et is a separate solution it is a part of a more complex solution in all complex systems the entire et might provide more accurate results than its sub ets as mentioned each et in gep contains one or more sub ets each with a head h and tail t having different length and functionalities depending on the nature of problem at hand the modeler can specify the value of h at first and then use the algebraic relationship between t and h eq 4 to determine the value of t ferreira 2006 4 t h n m a x 1 1 where n max is the number of arguments of the function having the most arguments i e maximum arity an example of a typical gep chromosome with a single gene was shown in fig 6 readers are referred to ferreira 2006 for details about evolution process in gep 2 4 linear gp lgp lgp is a different from of gp structure in which programs are linear sequences of instructions fig 7 it is an imperative programming method that genetic operators act on a linear genome nordin 1994 in other words the program is expressed in a one dimensional row of functions terminals and optionally constants it is worthwhile to mention that the term linear gp refers to the linear structure of genomes therefore the lgp method not necessarily provides linear models for nonlinear systems and even is typically being used to evolve highly non linear models depending on the instructions whether or not are directly executable by the central processing unit of a computer two types of lgp system are defined i machine code lgp and ii interpreted lgp in the former instructions can be directly executed without passing an interpreter compiler thus runtime can be significantly reduced by means of machine code lgp compared to the latter type in which each instruction is being executed through some higher level virtual machine written in a proficient language the authors review is limited to the machine code lgp hereafter lgp often applied in wre problems in lgp each instruction includes a function that contains a minimum number of constants or memory variables called registers which are the central computation units in any lgp program in most lgp variants each register is initially assigned to zero as default but its value may change consecutively at each instruction and at the end the result is assigned to the same register or another register the output of lgp program is equal to the register value obtained in the last instruction in a simple example of it in c language consisting of four instructions i e l0 l3 one register r 0 and three input variables i k and a can be set as follows the program represents the output variable y as a linear sequence of four instructions acting on the registers l0 r 0 0 0 l1 r 0 i l2 r 0 k l3 r 0 a the program output may be mathematically expressed as equation 5 that shows the well known darcy s law representing discharge q through porous media 5 q k i a where i is pressure gradient k is hydraulic conductivity and a denotes the area of porous media the ability of lgp to find an optimal solution strongly depends on the instructions type the number of registers as well as the range of constants that are specified by the modeler for the details of the evolution process in lgp readers are referred to hrnjica and danandeh mehr 2019 2 5 grammar based gp ggp grammars are core representation structures in gp that are used to restrict general domains of potential solutions and induce limited expressions the idea of ggp at first formed by koza 1990 but their role has expanded to the point where various grammar based algorithms such as context free grammar cfg whigham 1995 dimensionally aware gp dagp grammatical evolution ge perl gp maccallum 2003 are now one of the most widely applied gp method in different fields of engineering in ggp also called grammar guided gp the problem space is specified by a grammar and the solution is usually a derivation tree generated by a language whose terms are expressions corresponding to those used in monolithic gp for example fig 8 illustrates a ggp parse tree together with the fragment of english grammar for the sentence the rainfall is below the average returning to literature dagp keijzer and babovic 1999 and ge o neill and ryan 2001 are from ggp family frequently used in the wre in order for this paper to be self contained this section briefly reminds these variants for detailed background in the ggp and a survey of publications up to 2008 we refer the readers to mckay et al 2010 dagp keijzer and babovic 1999 is a distinct extension of ggp which exploits the knowledge hidden in the units of physical measurements it was found arguably more useful in the process of knowledge discovery enhancing both search efficiency and interpretability of gp induced formulations the approach showed significant improvements over traditional gp the incorporation of such knowledge into the search process of gp is done through the i definition of respective units of terminals i e variables and constants ii augmentation of common functions and introducing additional ones so that they can transfer units of measurement and capable of repairing dimensionally incorrect trees iii definition of additional measure of fitness namely goodness of dimension which acts as a metric of distance from desired dimension and ultimately iv definition of dimension based generic operators like unit informed crossover for the details of dagp and some applications readers are referred to keijzer and babovic 1999 2000 2002 as well as babovic 2009 the ge is a linear string representation of ggp which is capable of evolving variable length gp programs in any language fixed length instances have also been adopted similar to linear representations in non grammar based gp world linearizing the representation of programs in ge permit the application of both theory and practice from the much wider fields of evolutionary computation such as genetic algorithms and evolution strategies the core concept of ge is mapping process of genotypic strings with no knowledge of their phenotype corresponded objects in the context of the genotype phenotype mapping process ge allows search operators to perform on genotypes e g integer or binary chromosomes unlike traditional gp which operates exclusively on solution tree ge provides a system where type of information can be encoded in order to overcome the property of closure which limits the traditional representation adopted by gp to a single type for the details of ge readers are referred to o neill and ryan 2001 3 applications in wre 3 1 applications in the field of hydrology water resource researchers have found hydrological modeling as a challenging task due to the randomness of natural processes applications of gp in hydrology initiated in the early 2000s after publication of a seminal book by babovic 1996 and pioneer research papers e g babovic and abbot 1997a 1997b savic et al 1999 keijzer and babovic 1999 babovic and keijzer 2000 khu et al 2001 since then many researchers have used gp to estimate or forecast hydrological variables in their works to achieve more accuracy and reliability the hydrological issues reviewed here include i streamflow forecasting ii rainfall runoff modeling iii water quality modeling iv surface and subsurface water level prediction and v estimation of soil properties some different applications other than these headings but not included here are of course available in the literature e g prediction error correction zechman and ranjithan 2007 water demand prediction nasseri et al 2011 solute transport processes in aquifer hill et al 2007 yadav et al 2018 baseflow and quick flow modeling meshgi et al 2014 2015 rainfall recharge to groundwater system hong et al 2005 runoff temperature sabouri et al 2013 2016 and so on however their applications were not frequently considered in the relevant literature 3 1 1 rainfall runoff modelling the pioneer studies that applied gp for rainfall runoff modeling were carried out by babovic and abbot 1997a b and savic et al 1999 these studies opened a new door for water engineers to explore capability of evolutionary paradigm to solve various problems in the wre babovic and abbot 1997a introduced the evolution of gp based equations from hydraulic data and outlined its theory and they later provided four representative applications of gp in the wre babovic and abbott 1997b using synthetic rainstorms and runoff values the authors developed different gp models for a hypothetical catchment in which the relationship between storage and outflow was assumed to have i typical nonlinear ii extreme linear and iii extremely nonlinear behaviors babovic and abbott 1997b the input data consisted of dimensionless values of concurrent rainfall depth as well as a limited number of antecedent rainfall and flow values the prediction performance of the gp induced models was validated using corresponding ann models and their semantic content was elaborately interpreted from emergent phenomena and purely fortuitous perspectives the knowledge discovered in the study is toward the superposition of purely advection processes such as lag times khu et al 2001 used gp model as a function in the phase of error updating to complement rainfall runoff conceptual model and their targeted time scale was on the base of hours up to nine hours in runoff forecasting with multiple intervals they compared modeling performance with a referenced research by world metrological organization 1992 and concluded that more accurate runoff predictions are possible through a robust error updating scheme babovic and keijzer 2002 used gp in rainfall runoff modeling and compared the study results with conceptual forecasting approach and stated that gp is a powerful tool in the context of the runoff forecast combination of data in the form of gp model and knowledge in the form of conceptual model was suggested as the best approach for short term rainfall runoff modelling dorado et al 2003 and rabuñal et al 2007 developed the first hybrid gp ann rainfall runoff model for real time forecast of sewer discharge in the old part of the city of vitoria spain the authors compared the efficiency of their model to that of traditional scs unit hydrograpf method and the gp based siso narmax model developed by rodriguez vazquez 2001 the results showed that ann can be effectvely used to reduce the errors induced by the equations developed by gp drunpob et al 2005 used gp to develop a microclimatological runoff prediction model for nueces river basin texas and showed that gp was capable of extracting the relationship between climatological and physical information of the catchment and runoff process makkeasorn et al 2008 compared the prediction accuracy of gp and ann models in streamflow modeling using multiple metrological and climatological data at a semi arid catchment in south texas their findings highlighted the importance of external information in runoff modeling however this is not applicable for all kinds of watersheds due to less availability of hydrological data furthermore they showed that gp derived models can even perform well up to a 30 day ahead forecast in a similar study gp was satisfactorily used by maity and kashid 2009 to predict monthly river flow using large scale atmospheric circulation information since 2008 gep as a new variant of gp was introduced in rainfall runoff modelling literature the anticipated predictive gep model was applied for daily hydrological information for juniata river usa aytek and alp 2008 the gep model was evaluated in regard to the traditional ann model and found to be a good alternative in capturing the internal mechanism between rainfall and runoff variables in the same context kisi et al 2013 adopted gep in modeling rainfall runoff process and in comparing with ann and anfis models their findings evidenced the capability of the gep over the in modeling rainfall runoff process at kurukavak basin turkey ni et al 2010 developed a gp model and tested its predictability skills with various regression models such as grey model mlr and ann at annual time scale in their case study located in the northeastern part of china they attempted to model the relationship between discharge and climate influences by the use of gp which was constructed using rainfall and evaporation as a result they showed the superiority of gp to model annual discharge in the study region in the last decade there was an attempt that gp was combined with the importance analysis method to provide an accurate intelligent methodology identifying the global climate inputs and local meteorological variables required for modeling seasonal runoff time series kashid et al 2010 and maity and kashid 2011 demonstrated such applications in modelling weekly runoff time series for mahanadi river in india using the following data i the large scale el niño southern oscillation enso and equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo indices ii the local meteorological variables including outgoing longwave radiation total perceptible water temperature anomaly and pressure anomaly and iii streamflow from previous time steps the rainfall information was not used in the study in order to check the possibility of the proposed model to apply on the catchments with no rainfall measurements they indicated that the outgoing longwave radiation and pressure anomaly were outstanding over the other variables on the other hand enso index was relatively significant in the lead of fifth and seventh weeks equinoo index performed differently with important leads on the third and sixth weeks in general gp modeled weekly runoff time series with acceptable accuracy under aforementioned circumstances a new approaching trend in modeling rainfall runoff process came out by nourani et al 2012 who linked ann technique to the integrated wavelet gp this proposed hybrid wavelet gp ann model was successfully used to detect seasonality patterns in the both rainfall and runoff time series and to improve the predictive performance of ann technique they investigated two different time scales short term daily and long term monthly the proposed model was compared with standalone ann and gp models the modeling results emphasized the feasibility of the proposed model in solving nonlinearity of the short and long term runoff patterns it is worthwhile to note that input matrix attributes were reduced over the standalone ann model due to the professionalism of the gp model in approximating regression problems nourani et al 2013 employed watershed geomorphological features as spatial information to model runoff process and demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed geomorphology based gp approach owing to inclusion of geomorphological information shoaib et al 2015 integrated gep model with the discrete wavelet transform as preprocessing approach to predict runoff process using rainfall data the motivation of the authors stemmed from applying a novel wavelet gep model over four watersheds provided that the purpose of sophisticated wavelet transform procedure is to extract both temporal and spectral information embedded in the time series under consideration the authors used the sequential time series approach to determine the input vector matrix that built the predictive model the proposed wavelet gep model outperformed the individual gep model in addition the new model exhibited more accurate results with the wavelet function for all the four catchments during the both training and testing phases barge and sharif 2016 developed new hybrid rainfall runoff model based on integrating the ensemble empirical mode decomposition and self organizing map with lgp this proposed hybrid model run using daily time scale hydrological information of rainfall and runoff and also designed to make predictions with multiple time steps ahead the advantage of using ensemble empirical mode decomposition derived input space was to cluster the data using self organizing map they confirmed the effectiveness of ensemble empirical mode decomposition and self organizing map in conjunction with lgp predictive model similar to the case in ann modeling it was recently shown that gp could get trapped in local optima when strong autocorrelation exists between predictand and its antecedent values danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 therefore prediction results would suffer from timing error to overcome this drawback of gp they developed a hybrid model by integrating the moving average filter with mggp in which pareto front concept was used to ensure simplicity of the solution at the end of comparing the proposed hybrid model with standalone gp mggp and mlp models the outcomes revealed a substantial improvement at the level of the prediction accuracies this developed methodology thus showed promising results that can be used in practice sattar et al 2017b adopted gep in assessing a storm water management system in terms of temperature sensitivity using 3 year temperature records at four catchment sites in canada and predicted the inlet and outlet storm water temperature of pond as a function of climate and watershed features the merit of the research was due to the significance of predicting the storm events as a unique flow weighted thermal runoff as a result the proposed model demonstrated excellent performance with less uncertainty most recently an outstanding investigation concerning assessments of hydrological models i e gp model was undertaken by heřmanovský et al 2017 in simulating runoff process at ungagged catchments using regionalization aspect they used 176 catchments obtained from model parameter estimation experiments in the usa the efficiency of the gp model was justified through three conceptual models namely sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma btopmc and gr4j the proposed gp model efficiency showed relatively excellent performance compared to the first two models but with slightly lower efficiency against the final model in the second phase of their modeling the gp model efficiency with the catchment descriptors was of interest and thus mean catchment elevation and aridity index were found to be the most influenced parameters on the gp performance among thirteen catchment descriptor variables in general their results approved the applicability of gp model in simulating ungagged catchments 3 1 2 streamflow forecasting streamflow is characterized by time varying spatially distributed highly non linear and stochastic nature due to the various interconnected and diverse factors that makes it difficult to be estimated babovic 2005 these factors include storm and climatic characteristics influencing meteorological drivers the catchment s initial state as well as catchment geomorphological characteristics as a result the applications of evolutionary computing models become first priority in solving this complicated problem researches on streamflow modeling have been directed to validate several artificial intelligence ai models with each other in this manner a number of scholars conducted many studies on univariate streamflow forecasting and routing e g wang et al 2009 khatibi et al 2011 toro et al 2013 danandeh mehr et al 2013 yadav et al 2016 hadi and tombul 2018 majority of these studies pointed out the promising role of gp variants in streamflow forecasting among invaluable research works involving gp lgp and ann interactions in streamflow forecasting business we might here focus on some efforts since 2007 sivapragasam et al 2007 used gp and artificial neural network ann to forecast fortnightly flow and found that there is no significant difference in the prediction accuracy of the methods but gp has an advantage of identifying optimum inputs sivapragasam et al 2008 also proposed gp to model the relationship between the storage and runoff in river systems as an alternative for the muskingum approach one of the earliest research that used lgp in univariate streamflow modeling was conducted by guven 2009 who built a predictive model using daily river flow his model showed very promising outcomes in comparison with classical ann model after a while a successive station forecasting strategy using lgp model was for the first time suggested by danandeh mehr et al 2014a the merit of this study stemmed from forming a predictive model which can be applied between upstream and downstream gauging stations to substitute the station having data gap s in addition to decrease the lag prediction drawback commonly encountered single station prediction models their results indicated that an explicit lgp based expression evolved by arithmetic functions outperformed three ann algorithms including feedforward back propagation generalized regression and radial basis function neural networks ravansalar et al 2017 applied a hybrid wavelet lgp model in univariate streamflow forecasting with a month ahead and compared it with ann and multiple linear regression mlr as the base line models discrete wavelet transform was used to decompose streamflow time series generally the wavelet lgp model came out to be superior to ann and mlr in particular at the predictions of peaks and cumulative river flow amounts when it comes to mention research works involving gep related recent applications in streamflow forecasting business we might start with karimi et al 2016 who forecasted river flow for both short and long term time scales using integrated gep with wavelet data preprocessing approach at the mediterranean region on the filyos river in turkey they developed two types of regression models including traditional linear regression model i e auto regressive moving average arma and ai models i e ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference anfis for the comparison purpose their findings showed that gep derived streamflow forecasting models generally favored to forecasting over ann and anfis in a semi arid region streamflow forecasting model based on a stepwise gep at monthly time scale was proposed by al juboori and guven 2016 the conceptual knowledge presented in this study is to determine the coefficient value of the antecedent records i e input matrix vectors using a stepwise procedure in gep they showed that stepwise gep forecasts were more accurate than those of autoregressive integrated moving average arima danandeh mehr and kahya 2017 developed a hybrid daily streamflow forecasting model through integrating moving average filter with mggp the authors used pareto front concept in order to select a parsimony model it is important to note that the framework of their methodology relies on three main features including data pre processing system identification and system simplification the proposed hybrid model compared with the individual gp mggp and mlr models since their outcomes revealed a substantial improvement in the level of the forecasting accuracy their proposed methodology can be considered as a promising tool that can be practiced in real wre applications another interesting gep attempt was made by atieh et al 2017 in a distinct study aim that was to predict flow duration curve at ungauged basin using the potential of the gep and ann based models the models applied on the historical meteorological information across north america including 171 unregulated and 89 regulated basins the relationship between the predictors and predictand was developed based on climatic topographic and land use information the results of the gep and ann models demonstrated similar level of accuracies using the best fit of goodness and absolute error indicators however the models presented noticeable sensitivity to the topographical information followed by the climatic information 3 1 3 water quality modeling surface water quality modeling through the deterministic or stochastic approaches have received a massive attention by hydro environmental scholars due to the importance of water quality to the public health sivapragasam et al 2010 on the other hand surface water quality parameters have high dynamicity in nature particularly in rivers and wetlands and their concentrations are influenced by various hydrological and morphological elements and climate change the primary study dealing with water quality prediction was accomplished by babovic and abbott 1997b in which gp was applied to model longitudinal distribution of salinity in estuaries the inputs were measurable parameters see table 1 and the output was salt intrusion length that is to say the distance from the estuary mouth to the point where the salinity level reaches the ambient river salinity level at high water slake they compared gp results with those of ann and a distributed model over 45 steady state measurements from 15 estuaries worldwide from the applicability point of view their gp resulted in an explicit formulation which is generally sufficient for use in all circumstances however its accuracy was found low against its counterparts a multi objective management of saltwater intrusion of coastal aquifers using the application of gp model and modular neural network is another example in this category in this context sreekanth and datta 2010 developed two surrogate models to derive an optimum pumping stratagems for costal aquifer the models were built to predict salinity concentration in response to groundwater extraction the surrogate models trained using two stage training process i using uniformly input pattern variables and ii using the relative important variables to predict salinity concentration in general the performance of the gp in identifying the impacts of input variables was efficiently established compared with modular neural network model in addition gp model showed less uncertainty in the selection of the input space variables modeling water quality variables with gp or its variants is also recent common practice in the wre one of striking examples in this research trend was introduced by orouji et al 2013 who studied the capability of gp in modeling water quality variables including sodium potassium magnesium sulphate chloride ph electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids monthly experimental records at astane station on sefidrood river iran were used to initiate the predictive model they developed an anfis model in parallel with gp as the benchmark model and showed the superiority of gp to anfis in the phase of identifying the best input output relationship and combinations of input data sets our review put forward that the direction of most recent studies is toward the exploration of capability of hybrid gp models following this work mahmoudi et al 2016 validated the coupled shuffled frog leaping algorithm with support vector regression svr model against gp model in predicting eight water quality variables in consistence with the earlier research carried out by orouji et al 2013 their proposed model was found to be efficient in order to identify a nonlinear relationship however such a coupled model consumes much time due to the tuning optimization process our final touch on this matter concerns a combination of gp and least squares svr techniques to model and monitor eight water quality parameters in the sefidrood river iran by bozorg haddad et al 2017 whose inputs were determined by principal component analysis they used gp to improve the least squares svr predictions and showed that both the gp and hybrid genetic algorithm least squares svr are accurately capable of modeling water quality parameters meanwhile gp has also appeared as the benchmark model to compare with other ai techniques e g mahmoudi et al 2016 bozorg haddad et al 2017 for instance the hybrid wavelet lgp model was developed by ravansalar et al 2016 to predict monthly sodium discharge using a 23 year runoff record for model validation the performance of wavelet lgp model was compared with ad hoc lgp ann and wavelet ann models their results approved the superiority of wavelet lgp over the other models in soil aquifer related water quality problems researchers have recently started preferring the use gp or its variants in order to form predictive models one of good examples of this type of research trend could be the work conducted by sattar 2016 developed a new simple predictive model based on the application of gep to module the organic micro pollutants removal in soil aquifer treatment system the motivation of this study was due to the importance of organic micro pollutants in groundwater and soil health in the nile basin egypt the author used a wide range of organic micro pollutants and aquifers information along with numerous real operation aspects of soil aquifer treatment sat system the aquifer physical information include hydraulic loading rate ratio of dry to wet pond bed and the influence of spatial heterogeneity on the hydraulic conductivity the proposed gep model in determining organic micro pollutants released satisfactory outcomes in term of accuracy level furthermore monte carlo simulation was used for uncertainty propagation in the sat variables at the stage of developing stochastic input attributes for the gep model as a result biodegradation rate was the predominant variable affecting in the removal of organic micro pollutants in the soil aquifer treatment system 3 1 4 surface subsurface water level prediction water level prediction in surface rivers lakes reservoirs etc and subsurface aquifer water systems is crucial for various wre applications such as irrigation navigation floodplain management potable water usages primary examples of studies concerning modeling water level fluctuations using gp see table 1 include among others laucelli et al 2007 ghorbani et al 2010 kisi et al 2012 2015 kurniawan et al 2014 and zaji and bonakdari 2018 in a preliminary study laucelli et al 2007 applied gp as a model induction engine to predict groundwater fluctuations in the brindisi aquifer italy in regard to contribution of bias and variance to the total error their study showed that ensemble modeling provides more accurate alternative in comparison to traditional single gp model a prominent application of gp over anfis used in modeling ground water table was introduced by shiri and kişi 2011 who compared the efficiency of the gp model with the most predominate anfis predictive model the modeling practice aimed to predict short term time scales such as one two and three days ahead the motivation of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the gp model as a simple explicit mathematical formulation to module water table depth fluctuations their study exhibited clearly the superiority of the proposed model over anfis model such superiority has been recently reported by fallah mehdipour et al 2013b 2014 who used the models to extract governing groundwater flow equations in ghaen and karaj aquifers iran when it comes to modeling lake water levels the works by kisi and his colleagues can be considered one of pioneering studies kisi et al 2012 estimated lake water level at multiple step ahead 1 2 and 3 day ahead using three ai models namely gep anfis and ann the outcome of the modeling exhibited more alike results except an outstanding outperformance in comparison with arima model later kisi et al 2015 studied prediction of urmia lake water level using gp as the benchmark to validate the svr firefly model despite the robustness of the proposed model gp model was compatible in term of accuracy at the lake water level 3 1 5 soil properties modeling another significant hydrologic component is the soil properties which is indeed very essential to be studied in terms of soil moisture content hydraulic conductivity soil temperature land sliding stability and so on understanding of all the mentioned soil characteristics is very difficult as it is very complicated in nature due to the extensive spatial and temporal variability as well as influences of multiple hydroclimatological forcing factors applications of gp in the field of soil properties is relatively new as initial investigations started with the studies of saturated hydraulic conductivity by parasuraman et al 2007b and soil moisture prediction by elshorbagy and el baroudy 2009 the latter adopted lgp and evolutionary polynomial regression giustolisi and savic 2006 techniques to predict soil moisture content at three depths based on different input variables table 1 the goals of this study were to identify dominant variables affecting the soil moisture dynamics as well as gaining insights into the impacts of evolutionary techniques on the prediction results to this end the models were setup so that the soil moisture content was predicted as a response to i time lag inputs i e all input variables and their time lags up to 20 preceding days and ii cumulative inputs i e the summation of the previous 20 15 10 and 5 days of each input variable their results showed that lgp demonstrates better performance than evolutionary polynomial regression in both prediction scenarios the summed input models also appeared to be superior to time lag models this result was attributed to the moisture holding capacity of the soil layer the issue of landslide susceptibility was considered for the first time in a recent study by nourani et al 2014 using gp the authors evaluated the susceptibility of the occurrence of landslides in zonouz plain north west of iran they built predictive model using field survey information and validated modelling result against frequency ratio logistic regression and ann models in geographic information system forecasting the validation process showed the superiority of the gp model over the benchmark models in predicting landslide susceptibility maps recently there has appeared another gp application associated with soil properties by kisi and his colleagues to predict soil temperature at different depths 0 01 0 5 and 1 m for mersin and adana stations in turkey using gp ann and anfis models kisi et al 2017 the modelling conducted based on two scenarios at the first traditional single station prediction models at the stations was developed and the influence of periodic information was investigated on the prediction accuracy and at the second cross station modelling was carried at mersin station using climate information at adana station in the first scenario gp outperformed other two predictive models whereas the ann prediction model attained slightly better results in the second scenario once the implementation of gp in soil temperature was generally successful it is plausible to appreciate the effectiveness of gp in such studies involving soil properties this review efforts have shown that gp might be used as a promising modelling strategy to discover usable relations in measured or experimental data studies have demonstrated the ability of gp variants to approximate nonlinear hydrological phenomena through explicit algebraic expressions which however can not necessarily provide a deeper insight into the physics of the process being formulated generally the majority of studies using gp as symbolic regression tool to develop multivariate regression models in which several input variables are linked to predict the target variable although gp often results in high degree of accuracy the induced formulae are often extremely complex i e nonlinear combinations of variables and constants and very sensitive to the choice of inputs moreover the solutions are commonly found dimensionally incorrect when the raw data are used as inputs to gp to secure dimensionally consistent models this review encourages the application of dagp which may also provide more meaningful models the research results justify that the hybrid gp models highly improves the predictability of standalone gp for example superior performance of wavelet based gp over gp was reported in some recent hydrological studies such improvement can be explained by the decomposition of input vector to main and minor signals and gp thus can discover dominant input signals influencing target variable 3 2 applications in the field of hydraulics in the last two decades a number of studies has been existed in the literature that introduced gp variants in data mining in the field of hydraulics engineering e g keijzer and babovic 2000 harris et al 2003 type of studies reviewed in this section include five headings i sediment transport and erosion ii dam hydraulics and operation of reservoirs iii pipeline flow iv open channel flow and v sea and ocean waves 3 2 1 sediment transport and erosion in a study of sediment transport gp models were evolved by babovic and abbott 1997b and compared with a conventional experimental model in this study the authors ignored dimensional consistency of gp solutions and provided a new mode of interpretation in which the numerical coefficients in a solution are not regarded as constants of nature in contrast they are regarded as notions of physics of the process from the perspective of precision the best gp induced model was quite satisfactory however the formulation was dimensionally inconsistent this point might be perceived as a sign for rethink the problem babovic and abbot demonstrated that formulation can only become true when its numerical coefficients are associated with dimensions and justified that gp was also capable of finding a solution with the same semantic content as the human derived benchmark model an early example exploiting the dagp modelled concentration of suspended sediment near bed was conducted by keijzer and babovic 2000 using experimental flume data the authors tested the performance of gp within the framework of scientific knowledge discovery to this end a standard gp model was first evolved to comprehend all corresponding parameters based on both directly observed and derived dimensionless quantities and dagp then was run to formulate dimensionally correct solutions their results showed that dagp introduced an improvement over the gp and human proposed experimental equation with having advantage of being more easily interpreted in the similar context aytek and kişi 2008 used gp to analyze suspended sediment load in natural streams using daily flow and suspended sediment concentration obtained from two stations on tongue river in montana each having a record spanning from 1977 to 1981 with obvious variation in the temporal seasons october to september input variables were streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations they used streamflow in previous day as a single predictor to predict suspended sediment discharge of the previous day despite having single predictor the gp performed well and produced better results in comparison with regression technique however their improved performance was not much noticeable as expected gp analysis also showed that using only current discharge is not enough to make accurate prediction of suspended sediment discharge gp model had another advantage of producing only positive outputs which is not the case for a regression model guven and kişi 2011a b studied the same problem of estimating the river suspended sediment yield using the same data but utilized lgp and gep to prediction models for the river of tongue in the us in this study and monitored the performance of their developed models versus error indicators for lgp they used two point string crossover and macro mutation which deletes or inserts entire chromosome and reported improved performance for lgp compared to its two counterparts this is true with respect to overestimation errors for all ranges of suspended sediment concentrations which were less than 5 as to 10 of ann errors in this stream of developing a gp based prediction model for daily river suspended sediment concentrations at this time kisi and shiri 2012 adopted gep and employed river hydraulic data together with meteorological precipitation in gep model development they used parsimony pressure as a penalizing tool with mutation rate of 0 044 their study showed that gep model had unique advantage of being simple and easy to use and may be subject to physical interpretations however from the perspective of performance in various error indicators it is not the best model for accurate representation of suspended sediment concentrations in addition to these a ann gep coupled model was recently presented by thompson et al 2016 to achieve prediction of total suspended sediment particle size distribution they adopted gep which functioned to complement an ann model to accurately predict suspended sediment data was collected for a two year period and complied with laboratory scale experiments the suspended sediment distribution was fitted to a log normal distribution and afterward a gep model was constructed to estimate the scale and location parameters of the distribution at end their ann gep model yielded a great number of positive results and showed error estimates within low percentage of 3 5 as we face to river bed platform studies some gp based applications have been also encountered with practical engineering implementations among others an interesting case addressed by ab ghani and azamathulla 2011 in the investigation of bed load transport in storm sewers with different bed roughness using basic arithmetic operators and root function together with 75 of 220 input target pairs of experimental data the authors trained a gep model and demonstrated its successful implementation in bed load prediction of storm sewers in a similar circumstance elhakeem and sattar 2015 contributed a research work involving the movement of bed forms in river beds as a result of flow interaction with channel sediment they utilized gep to develop a new relation for the prediction of the entrainment rate of non uniform sediment data used in the model development phase were obtained from experimental studies on non uniform sediment beds the model incorporated four parameters on its formulation namely the shields stress and critical shields stress to describe the hydraulic and sediment conditions of the flow the kramer coefficient of uniformity to describe the grain size distribution of a particular sediment mixture and the relative position of a particular grain size fraction to the geometric mean to describe the entrainment rate of that fraction within the sediment mixture consequently they reported satisfactorily predictions with a deviation from experimental not more than 25 between the measured and predicted values in the assessment of gp variants in eroding and scouring types of wre problems sattar and his colleagues took a pioneering role for example sattar 2013b studied the erosion of cohesive soils which are widely spread at the beds of rivers and streams in egypt before the construction of the high dam he studied the erosion potential of this complex type of soil by developing a gep model that relates the soil critical shear stress to the clay content of the soil and the particle size distribution the study results showed an excellent potentiality of gep for pattern recognition among complex parameters influencing on soil erosion following this sattar et al 2018 concentrated on the scour in mountain streams downstream grade control structures these structures are extremely important for protection of fish habitat and cause an unfavorable impact on streams by leading to scour in the downstream side they used gep to develop a model for prediction of scour hole depth formed downstream the grade control structure they presented three gep models using small population of chromosomes for simple models the data used for model development were based on large scale experimental data together with field measurements on real grade control structures in polish streams the score depth model was presented as a function of stream hydraulics in addition to structure geometry they reported simple models readily to interpret physical relationship between variables and model outperformed available empirical relations finally safari and danandeh mehr 2018 suggested a new pareto optimal model developed by mggp technique to estimate particle froude number in large sewers with deposited bed condition similar to the study of ebtehaj and bonakdari 2017 they used four datasets including wide ranges of sediment size and concentration deposited bed thickness and pipe size on the basis of different statistical performance indices the efficiency of the pareto optimal mggp model was compared to those of the best mggp model developed by the authors earlier as well as common conventional regression models his results indicated higher efficiency of the mggp based models for the particle froude number estimation in non deposition with deposited bed condition inasmuch the pareto optimal mggp model requires lower number of input parameters to yield higher performance than those of conventional regression models he prompted its use as a parsimonious model for self cleansing design of large sewers in practice 3 2 2 dams and reservoirs under this heading possible research contributions that one encounters in the pertinent literature seem to be limited to mainly reservoir operation aquifer dam system irrigation systems and dam breach investigations our review has started first looking at a study by jothiprakash and magar 2012 who focused on the management of available water resources behind the reservoir situated on konya river in india they developed an lgp model to make prediction of hourly inflow to the reservoir using observed daily and hourly rainfall and streamflow data developed from lumped and distributed input model the model depended on daily rainfall for 47 years and hourly rainfall for four years as the predictors a high population search space of 500 was used during lgp runs as the model processes the large and complex data sets using error estimates the lumped combined lgp models produced excellent results for 1 day ahead and acceptable results for 2 day ahead and reasonably accurate results for 3 day ahead predictions and performed well compared to ann and anfis techniques response of lgp models for flow fluctuations was reported to be well within actual trends in dam breach analysis hakimzadeh et al 2013 utilized gp to form a model which functions to bearing an outflow hydrograph from such phenomena model data were extracted from a series of experimental studies over homogeneous cohesive and non cohesive earthen dams data used in this study consisted of dam and breach geometric parameters and dam soil characteristics they considered only data of breach cases due to overtopping flow recorded from 40 experiments and iterations in their gp model development in order to spot over fitting they noted that their models revealed much positive results than some of the available regression based methods nevertheless these gp models can be only used in preliminary analysis since sediment parameters such as mean grain diameter was not known in many training cases this was also pointed out by hakimzadeh and his colleagues in such a way that the number of data samples inputted in the model development phase needs to be increased for more efficient gp models in the same context sattar 2014 explored dam failure applying gep to predict dam breach outflow parameters after constructing a breach outflow hydrograph and routing it downstream wise he proposed three gep models in the prediction of peak breach outflow time to maximum outflow and breach width single genic gep models were built using a comprehensive database of real 140 dam failure cases model predictors were soil erodibility type of dam failure type and breach geometry as a result of comparison of the gep models with traditional empirical models with respect to error and uncertainty estimates the gep models were found more capable of representing real physical process than others with higher accuracy in the last decade some applications of gp have appeared in different fields such as developing optimal operation rules in reservoirs e g fallah mehdipour et al 2013a aquifer dam system e g fallah mehdipour et al 2012 and irrigation systems e g ashofteh et al 2014 taking a close look to the last reference ashofteh et al 2015 developed a new multi objective gp algorithm that optimizes operating rules of aidoghmoush dam for both the reference period 1987 2000 and the future period 2026 2039 under climate change scenarios the gp based rules were described based on river inflows to the dam storage volume and downstream irrigation requirement two objective functions used in their study were set to minimize vulnerability and maximize reliability indices they came up with a important conclusion that a multi objective gp is effective methodology in determining optimal rule curves for reservoirs 3 2 3 pipeline flow in this heading the works of sattar and his colleagues in the last five years come out to be prominent examples he contributed such investigations as determining how pipe flow hydraulics is related to the longitudinal dispersion coefficient sattar 2013a gep was his tool to develop empirical relations between the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and various control variables including reynolds number average velocity pipe friction coefficient and pipe diameter in the model development he used 220 experimental measurements covering a wide range of flow reynolds number from transitional to turbulent pipe flow the use of single genic chromosomes with lower initial population allowed the formation of simple gep models yet their performance was better than available analytical and empirical models having with half the error in a continuation of this study najafzadeh and sattar 2015 developed gep models for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in a wider range of pipeline flow regime the authors compared gep model with a model developed based on the group method data handling the models in this study used the same dataset of sattar 2013a and the following predictors pipe average velocity friction coefficient and the pipeline diameter analysis of error and sensitivity results showed similar performance for both the group method handling models and gep models however the latter has simple form in favor of providing more insight into the physical phenomenon in the latest efforts of sattar and his colleagues on this matter the hydraulics of potable water pipe networks and related the pipe conditions with possibility of failure were the study purpose sattar et al 2016 2017a they utilized once again gep to develop a prediction model for potential failure of a pipeline with its existing specific hydraulic conditions their gep models required pipeline flow diameter length and previous number of breaks as predictors and processed more than 9500 pipe failure cases collected for a period of 50 year single genic chromosomes were utilized to produce a simple model and an initial population of 80 was used to model the complex nonlinear relation between the predictors they compared the gep models with models produced by extreme learning machine developed on the same dataset and reported satisfying model performance in the case of sediment deposition in storm sewer pipes ebtehaj et al 2016 presented a good work by searching an answer to how it increases the roughness of pipe and reduces flow cross section to avoid deposition of sediment and at the same time avoiding loss of sewer pipe capacity they preferred gp and svr to develop a relation for the mean pipe flow velocity at the onset of sediment deposition the svr was coupled with firefly algorithm in order to optimize svr parameters and increase model efficiency similar performance was found between gp and svr however the approach of svr coupled with firefly algorithm showed improved performance on various error indicators used 3 2 4 open channel flow in an early work of babovic and abbott 1997b gp was satisfactorily used to estimate additional resistance to flow introduced by flexible vegetation in a steady flow condition the training data table 3 were generated using a conventional numerical model further preprocessing was done to create dimensionless ratios and gp was allowed to choose the best combination from the ratios three years later the study was extended by keijzer and babovic 2000 in which gp and dagp were setup to comprehend all measured dimensional data but not corresponding dimensionless ratios applying standard gp on raw observations a satisfactory goodness of fit might be obtained but semantics of the generated formulations cannot be warranted however the dagp in dimensionally consistent but not correct and statistically meaning rich formulation appeared to be superior to other formulations resulted from the different techniques in another preliminary study dealing with open channel flow gp was used by harris et al 2003 to discover mathematics models for velocity prediction in a compound channel the standard gp was applied to purely experimental data sets table 2 complied from a symmetrical laboratory model consisted of a recirculating flume with steady flows over a deep channel with relatively shallow vegetated floodplains on either side both dimensional and dimensionless values of data were used for gp runs the former mainly to find suitable inputs for symbolic regression and the latter in order to avoid potential conflict with incorrect dimensionality of the produced formulations the results showed two distinct clusters of datasets indicating the main channel with higher and floodplain with lower clusters of velocities therefore the authors developed two separate models for each zone and found that the arrangement of vegetation and location in the channel are important this study also highlighted the importance of information in the units of data sets and showed the dagp models keijzer and babovic 1999 using relevant physical properties are dimensionally consistent continuing to review channel velocity related cases zaji and bonakdari 2015 presented an example for describing the continuous spatial description of velocity in open channel junctions in which gp is the tool to produce required formulations this work was performed using discrete laboratory measurements with emphasis on irrigation and drainage channels and sewer systems the inputs to gp were chosen as three velocity components in addition to the discharge ratio between the main and secondary channel at the junction a simple fitness function of absolute error summation was used in gp model development they compared results of the gp model with those calculated by ann model which surpassed the developed gp model in terms of accuracy and error results as a result gp has the limitation of not being able to model spatial velocity field with only a small training dataset in order to estimate chezy resistance coefficient for full circular corrugated channels with different slopes giustolisi 2004 explored the utility of gp the gp models to express functions of hydraulic radius of flow slope of the channel height of the wall roughness elements and longitudinal spacing of the wall roughness elements the efficiency results of parsimonious gp formulae approved its superiority to conventional monomial formulae furthermore the author applied physical post refinement on two gp models and stated that one may better explain the role of the roughness in chezy coefficient by excreting human insight to the gp solutions as happened in this case the structure of gp solutions can be manipulated by human physical insights gp approach can be considered as a grey box technique in similar direction vegetation related resistance to flow via gp applications is also available and one of first such works carried out by baptist et al 2007 who aimed to attain relation between vegetation characteristics bed resistance water depth and equivalent resistance coefficient and to verify theoretical models similar to harris et al 2003 the study applied dimensionally aware gp keijzer and babovic 1999 in which the goodness of dimension was measured by calculating the number of constants with appropriate units required to render a dimensionally correct equation to this end 990 results of the one dimensional vertical model for submerged vegetation which represent a wide variety of vegetation properties and water depths were used as model inputs see table 2 the results showed that the formulae based on the gp are in better agreement with the synthetic dataset than the manually obtained formulations in developing an explicit relation for river discharge calculation azamathulla and zahiri 2012 who utilized lgp using a wide range of data including experimental and field stage discharge data this research was driven by the lack of flow resistance equations that can be applied to compound channels during floodplain inundation and change in their geometry due to erosion monitoring performance of their lgp models a good accuracy of lgp compared to one published empirical formula was reported following such flow estimation business uyumaz et al 2014 took the case of discharge coefficient of side weirs in circular channels into consideration applying lgp to develop new model for the sharp edged rectangular weirs they noted accurate calculation of water levels above weirs and thus calculation of lateral outflow rates not only two subsets of lgp containing conditional based lgp and mathematical based lgp but also a large number of 1686 laboratory experimental observations covering full range of hydraulic flow regimes in channels were used in this study lpg models constituted less error than some of common regression models they further applied a genetic based sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential parameters in both studies by sattar and gharabaghi 2015 and gharabaghi and sattar 2017 gep was the analysis method to develop empirical relations between longitudinal dispersion coefficient of natural streams and various geometric and hydraulic characteristics prediction accuracy of gep models were tested with those of known regression models and more accurate results were in favor of gep models a plausible reason behind higher accuracy of the gep models could be the exponents of the key variables aspect ratio and bed material roughness which are not constants but a function of the froude number 3 2 5 sea and ocean waves studies involving with gp models under this heading mostly comprised of wave height predictions some of typical research works are kalra and deo 2007 and roy et al 2016 in the first reference gp was selected as analysis tool to develop a model that is capable of restoring missing wave heights caused by damage or malfunction of instruments such as floating wave rider buoys in model development they used a time series of wave height collected at three hour interval during four years at six buoy locations along west coast of india the developed gp models were used to fill up the gaps in the time series of wave height at one buoy location using wave heights from other locations indeed gp models were used for spatial correlation between neighboring buoys important results were obtained from the gp model in all cases except those were too far from target buoys they were able to enhance model predictions by inclusion of more input buoys and reported marginal increase of performance for the gp models over the ann models on the same problem as a research practice in wave height prediction roy et al 2016 contributed gp applications to data recorded from a single buoy station during one year along the coast of east of hyannis in the usa they used some hydraulic components of waves as well as climatologic variables table 2 in forming gp models climatologic data were measured in one hour interval for wind speed direction air temperature and sea water temperature on the basis of error indicators gp models performed well and produced similar results to those of ann which are consistent with buoy recordings 3 3 applications in the field of hydroclimatology promising results of gp implementations in various hydroclimatological specialization areas including statistical downscaling of general circulation model gcm outputs drought forecasting and prediction of atmospheric variables precipitation evaporation evapotranspiration solar radiation air temperature are reviewed in this section 3 3 1 statistical downscaling of gcms the first application of gp in spatial downscaling of climate variables by considering large scale atmospheric variables was due to coulibaly 2004 who successfully used gp to evolve appropriate models for daily extreme min and max temperature estimates at the chute du diable weather station in northeastern canada the large scale predictor variables 12 variables for the study area were derived from the national center for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis dataset at the closest grid point the performance of gp models was compared with a commonly used statistical down scaling model sdsm as the benchmark the paper demonstrated the applicability of gp technique as a simple and effective downscaling method it was found that gp simulations of daily minimum temperature and daily maximum temperature are more accurate than those generated by the sdsm another study within the gp downscaling concept for the purpose of updating intensity durationfrequency curves of saskatoon city in canada was presented by hassanzadeh et al 2014 who applied gp to downscale precipitation quantiles directly from daily extreme rainfall quantiles at the gcm scale to quantify the frequency of annual maximum precipitation at both gcm and local scales a stationary generalized extreme value distribution was fitted to the data in this study gp happened to be a promising tool for extracting mathematical mappings between extreme rainfall quantiles at the gcm and local scales provided that a strong relationship between the gcm scale annual maximum precipitation quantiles and the corresponding daily and sub daily local values the downscaling of extreme precipitation quantiles directly from the corresponding large scale estimates was found to be an efficient approach when estimating the design precipitation values under climate change later the gp based downscaling models developed by hassanzadeh et al 2014 were implemented by shahabul alam and elshorbagy 2015 to construct a new set of intensity durationfrequency curves for the same city likewise our review include one more striking example of application of gp variants in canada under this heading that is to say research work by joshi et al 2015 who proposed two hybrid frameworks which combine mggp as predictor processing method with sparse bayesian learning and mlr as statistical models for precipitation downscaling considering both precipitation amount and number of wet and dry days they identified optimal weights using mlr and sparse bayesian learning by regressing the mggp evolved genes a maximum of four genes against the output data and called these evolved models mlrgp and sblgp respectively the proposed hybrid models were trained and tested using ncep reanalysis variables as much as 20 variables as predictors and daily precipitation observations at three meteorological stations located in eastern canada as the predictand for each meteorological station each ncep variable was interpolated using bilinear interpolation of the data corresponding to the four nearest ncep grid points then the selection of effective predictors was made using mggp consequently the sblgp framework offered better classification and regression results in comparison to the other methods such as standalone mlr stand alone sparse bayesian learning and hybrid mlrgp after a quite a while and moving to the eastern north hemisphere hashmi et al 2011 applied gep to compare with sdsm which downscaled daily precipitation time series in the clutha watershed new zealand considering 40 years of large scale climate variables at which the first 30 year 1961 1990 part was used to calibrate gep while the remaining 10 year 1991 2000 part was used to validate the model the gep model was constructed within a large data set including 26 variables from ncep reanalysis dataset as model inputs it is interesting to emphasize downscaling results that the best evolved gep model needed only 7 predictors as dependent variables as compared to 10 in case of the sdsm calibrated model comparison regarding model efficiency statistics between the two models revealed that gep outperformed sdsm in the both calibration and validation periods staying in eastern hemisphere but a new approach in use and location like east coast of peninsular malaysia hadi pour et al 2014 used a lgp based logistic regression method for downscaling rainfall extremes number of heavy rainy days days with equal or more than 90 percentile of rainfall consecutive dry days and consecutive wet days were considered as extreme rainfall indices in this study similar to the previous studies ncep reanalysis dataset at the grid points surrounding the study area 42 grid points each of which having 26 variables were used for the selection of the most proper inputs for lgp which was calibrated so that each program predicts whether an extreme rainfall event occurs or not the authors compared the performance of lgp based downscaling models with that of ann and sdsm models and found that lgp is superior to its counterparts in terms of all the performance indices tofiq and guven 2014 explored the capability of lgp to express a quantitative relationship between large scale climate variables including ncep re analysis data and coupled global climate model cgcm3 1 outputs and local scale discharge flowing to darbandikhan dam iraq as a predictand variable in the statistical downscaling their study demonstrated that transforming the discharge data through natural logarithm improves the lgp performance and ncep predictors have better correlation with the dam inflow data than those of cgcm3 1 more recently zerenner et al 2016 developed a multi objective gp model for downscaling of atmospheric field unlike the previous studies mesoscale atmospheric model outputs having 2 8 km grid resolution were considered to downscale the high resolution near surface temperature required for driving land surface and hydrological models an important conclusion was noted in this study in such a way that gp did not produce reasonable downscaling rules if one aims purely to the optimization of root mean square error in contrast the multi objective gp that generated a set of pareto optimal solutions leads to significant improvements compared to the conditional linear regression in the light of assessments of the research works reviewed in this sub section gp could be evaluated as a simple and effective technique to find a relationship between large scale outputs predictors and point scale observations predictand using such mapping relationships the future projections can be obtained from gcms to estimate the future local variable values assuming that the mapping between climate variables at the large scale and local scale is stationary in time the advantages of using gp can be summarized as handling of complex time varying and nonlinear functional relationships which are often important when mapping from global to local climate is concerned liu et al 2007 the downscaling rules set by gp variants take the form of equations programs which can be checked for physical consistency gp based downscaling method has been appeared as new benchmark for the most recent downscaling techniques e g sachindra and perera 2016 whereas sdsm was commonly used in earlier studies in the evaluation of gp and sdsm the former not only performed better but also required less predictor variables 3 3 2 drought the potential of gp applications in the case of prediction of meteorological droughts were concern in some recent studies for example danandeh mehr et al 2014b and maity and chanda 2015 took such a subject into consideration using observations in texas state and india respectively the former study comprised of enso indicator nino 3 4 index together with palmer s modified drought index pmdi as predictors and future pmdi value as predictand whereas the latter required global climate pattern related observations including anomalies of sea surface temperature and standardized anomalies of surface pressure air temperature wind speed and total precipitable water as predictors and standardized precipitation anomaly index spai as predictand both the studies used lgp to predict the time series of drought index and reported that standalone lgp is not capable of predicting drought indices precisely to cope with this problem danandeh mehr et al 2014b decomposed their input variables via continuous wavelet transform in order to detect and optimize the number of significant spectral bands of predictors the authors compared the results of the hybrid gene wavelet model with those of standalone lgp neuro wavelet and fuzzy wavelet models and showed the superiority of the gene wavelet model to its counterparts it is worth mentioning that the spai values are further classified into three categories dry wet and normal events in the study of maity and chanda 2015 and the prediction performance was also evaluated in terms of true prediction of each event despite the medium range accuracy they concluded that lgp is a promising tool in capturing the inherent dependence structure between global climate pattern and drought events 3 3 3 precipitation in this significant component of hydrologic cycle that is known to have highly noisy field our review surprisingly showed that a few researchers have used gp for the purpose of precipitation forecasting in a preliminary study by bakhshaii and stull 2009 gep was used to build deterministic ensemble forecast models with bias corrected short range 24 hour accumulated precipitation at 24 weather stations in southwestern canada outputs of 11 limited area ensemble members from three different numerical weather prediction models at four horizontal grids were used as gep inputs the authors demonstrated that the optimum gep functioned as combining raw numerical weather prediction precipitation forecasts at the same time removing bias in addition the gep forecasts were superior to those obtained by simple ensemble means for about half of the weather test stations gep can be sometimes coupled with wavelet model to establish a hybrid form to reach higher prediction performance level in this way kisi and shiri 2011 proved the effectiveness of such approach by developing gep and hybrid wavelet gep conjunction models to forecast daily precipitation series at two rain gauge stations located in the aegean region of turkey the gep based precipitation forecasting model having three genes per chromosomes was developed using antecedent daily precipitation data up to four days as model inputs and addition operator as linking function their results showed that standalone gep produced weaker forecasts in the study region on the other hand the wavelet gep model aggregated by best standalone gep model and wavelet as decomposer of sub series converting to model inputs significantly improves efficiency of standalone gep results in this study the wavelet gep model was pointed out to be superior to wavelet neuro fuzzy conjunction model our final review on the hybrid gp application in the business of precipitation prediction contains quite recent example conducted by mehdizadeh et al 2018 who suggested a hybrid gep autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model for monthly rainfall forecasting at five stations with various climatic conditions in iran their study results clearly indicated that the developed hybrid method significantly improves prediction accuracy of standalone gep model at the intersection of hydroclimatology and precipitation sub sections kashid and maity 2012 carried out an investigation based on large scale atmospheric circulation indices enso and those from equinoo to predict monthly indian summer monsoon rainfall using lgp the analysis model was trained and tested using historical average of monthly values of rainfall and enso and equinoo indices extending back to previous few months the sensitiveness of input variables was evaluated in terms of input impact factors obtained by evolutionary search algorithm in lgp their results exhibited that enso and equinoo indices of time steps t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the most effective inputs for satisfactory prediction of precipitation in the case of ensemble forecast problem gp variants have been recently value to as methodological remedy as well seen in the work of dufek et al 2017 who proposed grammar gp ggp model to form more accurate short range 24 h 72 h deterministic ensemble forecast models of 24 h accumulated precipitation at 317 weather stations in brazil during rainy period from october to february of 2008 2013 differing from the earlier work of bakhshaii and stull 2009 the authors included other predictors such as major weather patterns over brazil in addition to numerical weather prediction models according to their results ggp is more versatile technique outperformed two traditional statistical techniques at the end of this heading how an interesting formation of gp model can be adopted to a problem associated with precipitation pattern will be exemplified in a more recent study by danandeh mehr et al 2017 they introduced development and application of a three phase gp model that enhanced the ability of gp to solve both binary classification and regression problems the proposed binary gp model integrates certain types of data pre processing including detrending normalization and binarization and post processing including logistic transformation approaches with gp engine the analysis model was trained and tested for teleconnection studies between sst series of black sea mediterranean sea and red sea and monthly rainfall events at two rain gauge stations in northwestern iran the authors compared skill of the binary gp model with that of decision tree association rule model and showed superiority of the former model 3 3 4 evaporation evapotranspiration as being common to see gp and its variants applications in other areas of wre a number of research studies involving such application have also become available in evaporation evapotranspiration modelling after mid 2000 following widespread tendency of gp usage at that time the researchers of earlier studies attempted to prove its superiority to empirical or other ai techniques e g terzi and keskin 2005 guven et al 2008 traore and guven 2012 guven and kisi 2013 ghorbani et al 2012 but the investigators of most recent studies have started following a new tendency of gp usage as benchmark e g deo and samui 2017 eray et al 2017 because of inherent complexity of evaporation evapotranspiration processes the contents of germane research works involving gp applications have wide spectrum that will be summarized hereinafter in a preliminary study parasuraman et al 2007a explored the utility of gp to model the eddy covariance measured latent heat at two weather stations in canada the gp models were constructed as functions of net radiation ground and air temperature wind speed and relative humidity and then the efficiency results were compared with those of ann and the traditional penman monteith method they asserted that the both gp and ann resulted in much positive outcomes than the penman monteith method while their individual performances were noted to be close to each other nevertheless the gp evolved equations were parsimonious as it can identify the most significant parameters influencing evapotranspiration and it thus was well suited tool to model dynamics of evapotranspiration process in the extension of this study parasuraman and elshorbagy 2008 aimed to explore the issue of model structure uncertainty in hydrological modeling they were concerned with combination of bootstrap method and self organizing ability of gp to generate ensemble of gp solutions for quantifying the model structure uncertainty in characterizing the actual evapotranspiration flux for a reconstructed watershed in canada of similar nature for the purpose of estimating hourly eddy covariance measured actual evapotranspiration izadifar and elshorbagy 2010 proved the success of gp application over alternative commonly used models in the study area of a reconstructed landscape located in northern alberta canada to this end the latent heat measured by the eddy covariance method was modelled as a function of five climatic variables namely net radiation ground and air temperature relative humidity and wind speed the performance of gp model was compared with those of ann models statistical regression models and physically based hydrus 1d model which is supported by the conventional penman monteith model for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration their results indicated that the gp and mlr models had better generalization ability than the ann model as regards to estimate evaporation and seepages losses i e reservoir losses through the application of lgp sivapragasam et al 2009 presented such a study that contains a single mathematical model at each periyar and kovilar reservoirs india using historical meteorological data as predictands and real time changes in the reservoir water level as predictor the lgp based evaporation seepage estimations were compared with those of penman combination model in addition the predictions obtained from gp and penman combination models were integrated with the reservoirs water balance equation to derive the optimum reservoir scheduling the authors concluded that the lgp and the penman combination models performed well in estimating evaporation losses during the period august december however the former appeared to be superior to estimate seepage losses during the period march july when seepage loss was a major component in the reservoir adopting the same developed models of this study de la paix mupenzi et al 2012 attempted to estimate monthly evaporation and seepage losses in arid region located at northwestern china although the original models were developed and calibrated at fortnightly scales for two reservoirs in india and the scatterplot of observed vs predicted evaporation seepage losses showed significant deviation around 1 1 line the authors stated that the combination of gp penman monteith and the penman combination models performed well than each individual model in modeling the evapotranspiration and evaporation seepage process in the arid zone under this heading gp and its variants have often been a favorable analysis tool to make assessments on reference evapotranspiration and alike variables among others the first study that will be examined on this matter is the one by shiri et al 2012 who employed gep with different sets of instructions and linking functions to create daily reference evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration from a hypothesized reference crop prediction models at four weather stations in basque country spain the gep model was trained and tested using three different input combinations at each station air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity were used in the first combination whereas considering an analogy with the empirical priestley taylor hargreaves samani method the second third combination includes air temperature and solar radiation only air temperature as input variables the results of gep models were compared with those of anfis and the empirical methods and the former was identified to surpass its counterparts in another study within a similar frame of research analysis by shiri et al 2014b the generalization ability of gep to estimate reference evapotranspiration along caspian sea and persian gulf coastlines was of concern using data from eight weather stations and spatial and temporal k fold test procedure the authors indicated that the locally trained gep models outperformed the externally trained models due to higher similarity between training and testing patterns and only under specific conditions the latter might be a valid alternative moreover arunkumar and jothiprakash 2013 compared ability of lgp with ann and model tree methods for time series of daily evaporation at koyna reservoir india and indicated that lgp predicts reservoir evaporation slightly better than the ann and mt models more recently yassin et al 2016 used gep to develop new models for daily reference evapotranspiration prediction at the kingdom of saudi arabia the gep models were trained and tested using climatic variables from 13 meteorological stations in order to compare with those of four locally calibrated empirical equations hargreaves samani irmak jensen haise and kimberly penman their results revealed that the gep models are superior to all the locally calibrated equations the gep models which were trained based on temperature max min and average and crop height indices were found to be inferior to the ones which were trained based on temperature crop height humidity solar radiation and wind speed it can be readily speculated that the solar radiation wind speed has the least greatest effect on reference evapotranspiration under the hyper arid conditions pan evaporation related studies involving gp and its variants have also been successfully contributed to the germane literature for example guven and kişi 2011a investigated the ability of lgp and gep for daily pan evaporation modeling at fresno los angeles and san diego weather stations a data set of inputs having air temperature solar radiation wind speed pressure and humidity time series at each station were implemented to the lgp and gep engines to estimate pan evaporation the gp based estimations were then compared with those of three different ann models as well as the empirical stephens stewart model based on different performance measures the authors reported promising role of lgp technique in modeling evaporation process in a comprehensive study by arunkumar et al 2017 ability of the three data driven techniques i e lgp ann and model tree were assessed for i one day ahead forecasting of daily pan evaporation and ii cause effect mapping between daily pan evaporation and some concurrent meteorological variables including air temperature min max dew point relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours the authors indicated that the lgp model using four time lags t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 provides most accurate evaporation forecasts whereas ann was found as the best estimation tool in the case of cause effect mapping more recently eray et al 2017 investigated the ability of mggp with maximum eight allowed genes to enhance the prediction accuracy of monthly pan evaporation in antakya and antalya stations turkey the mggp models were trained and verified using observed air temperature min and max solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed as the predictors and pan evaporation as the predictand variable their models were compared with gp dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system and calibrated hargreaves samani methods in terms of root mean square error mean absolute error nash sutcliffe efficiency determination coefficient akaike information criterion and combined accuracy overall results of this study emphasized that gp is superior to its counterparts at antakya station however the neural fuzzy model provided better performance than others in antalya station 3 3 5 solar radiation in the absence of meteorological sensors in the detection of solar radiation the application of diverse ai methods along with some climatic observations has been suggested in the recent literature e g sharifi et al 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2016 however only a few studies have thus far used any gp variants for this purpose looking at earlier preliminary studies under this heading the work of landeras et al 2012 is one of noticeable researches which implemented gep in estimating daily incoming solar radiation at four weather stations in the basque region northern spain a comprehensive comparison was also made between gep and ai models of ann and anfis as well as optimized versions of empirical equations of hargreaves samani and mahmood hubbard two versions all the models equations were trained and tested using different combinations of daily values of extraterrestrial radiation air temperature max and mini day of year and corrected clear sky solar irradiation to predict daily incoming global solar radiation at each station the results showed superiority of ann to the other models equations in terms of prediction accuracy nevertheless landeras et al 2012 suggested gep for practical use inasmuch as it could produce simple explicit equation for the phenomenon which can be used by anyone not necessarily being familiar with gep another gep application to predict daily solar radiation mousavi et al 2015 presented a good example at a nominal city mashhad in iran having assigned as predictors daily climatic variables such as air and earth temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed were inserted into a comparative analysis between gep and mlr that was aimed to exhibit the ability of gep to predict daily solar radiation in the city as a result the gep based sensitivity analysis disclosed the mean air temperature relative humidity being the most least effective predictor using a different kind of gp variants shavandi and ramyani 2013 utilized lgp to predict monthly global solar radiation at two nominal cities tehran and kerman in iran six years of monthly climatic data including air temperature min max humidity precipitation and total of sunshine were used to derive solar radiation prediction models to get an idea about the predictive power of the lgp model at each city their performance was compared with that of the conventional angstrom model in addition the contribution of the input variables affecting the solar radiation as evaluated through the evolutionary sensitivity analysis their results indicated that the lgp models significantly outperform traditional angstrom s model and air temperature min max is the most effective variable in modeling solar radiation at last demirhan and atilgan 2015 proposed a new global solar radiation estimation model that integrates robust coplot to the gp techniques in their model first dimensionality of model spaces i e the number of potential predictors were optimized via coplot technique and then mean monthly and mean annual two separate global solar radiation estimation models were built using gp in the proposed coplot gp model a data set of relative humidity soil temperature air temperature latitude longitude altitude precipitation monthly average daily extra terrestrial horizontal global solar radiation maximum possible sunshine duration and day length was taken into account as the potential predictors to predict monthly and yearly global solar radiation at 65 meteorological stations across turkey a total of randomly selected 50 stations was used as model calibration points while the remaining 15 stations was processed for the validation aim their analysis put forward an interesting result so that gp technique could be affected by violations of outliers and multicollinearity having the advantage of using the robust coplot precise monthly and yearly mean daily global solar radiation estimations could be possible by means of the coplot gp model 3 3 6 temperature being a measure of the internal energy of the system a body of knowledge concerning the temperature variable in any respect is highly significant to offer realistic solutions to the most of challenging wre problems for this reason researchers have been recently solicitous about estimation of temperature related variables through the use of gp variants for example stanislawska et al 2012 implemented the tree based gp to the task of global mean temperature modeling with one month in advance that binds the mean global temperature to several climate factors a set of independent variables climate factors in their study included the number of sun spots atlantic multi decadal oscillation index i e mean sst of north atlantic north atlantic oscillation index volcanic explosivity index enso index and concentration of greenhouse gases for the period 1900 2009 they successfully demonstrated that gp is capable of distilling unbiased models from complex climate data that simulate the aggregate behavior of global temperature changes without resorting to historical temperature itself their experiment however showed that the best models suffer from the bloat problem the models reach the size of 200 250 tree nodes rendering their direct interpretation difficult in another study in this case ramesh et al 2015 developed gp based one to seven days ahead minimum and maximum surface air temperature forecasting models using the weather parameters observed at chennai station india and compared its efficiency with that of ann models the environmental predictors used in this study included temperature min max average mean dew point sea level pressure mean visibility wind speed average max and precipitation the analysis outcomes showed that the accuracy of ann models were slightly better than those of gp approach for all lead times in the need of estimating daily dew point temperature shiri et al 2014a compared the capability of gep with two ann models for at two weather stations seoul and incheon in south korea eight years of observed climatic variables namely atmospheric pressure relative humidity air temperature wind speed and incoming solar radiation were used to estimate dew point temperature at the stations moreover cross station models constructed by gep using the effective variables of the nearby station their results revealed that the gep models outperformed the anns at two stations another investigation regarding the estimation of daily dew point temperature was recently presented by mehdizadeh et al 2017 who adopted gep to estimate at two stations tabriz and urmia in iran considering the applied input variables three types of gep models including temperature multivariate and periodicity based models were developed in this study following to the study of shiri et al 2014a the cross station gep based models were set up using meteorological data of nearby station their results showed a promising role of gep in the efforts of dew point prediction minimum air temperature and actual vapor pressure were found as the most effective variables in the temperature and multivariate based gep models respectively the idea that meteorological data from nearby station can be used as predictors for dew point prediction in gep modelling is proven to be valid in this study in continuation of gep applications under this heading there exist more documents having interesting topics some of which will be briefly mentioned hereinafter starting with a study conducted by kisi and sanikhani 2015 who investigated the ability of gep and four other ai methods including anns anfis with grid partition and anfis with subtractive clustering and svr a successful practice was added to the pertinent literature in predicting long term monthly temperatures using data from 50 stations in iran the periodicity component month of the year and geographical characteristics latitude longitude and altitude of the stations were used as inputs to predict long term monthly temperatures their results indicated that long term monthly temperatures of all stations can be successfully estimated by the applied methods however the overall accuracy of the svr model was found to be better than other models more recently xiong et al 2017 applied gep to find the best regression function in the quality control of the surface hourly temperature and identify potential outliers the gep results were compared with those of the spatial regression test and inverse distance weighting methods their results indicate that gep is by far the best model and could yield smallest estimated error 4 selection of gp components parameters optimum determination of gp components is often based on complexity of the problem under consideration as well as the interaction between the gp parameters having appropriate choice of the components gp algorithm can significantly reduce execution time and obtain improved results fig 9 illustrates the five major components namely evolutionary parameters fitness measure terminal set function set and termination criterion necessary for a successful gp run as previously mentioned evolutionary parameters include population size maximum number of the generations initial and maximum tree depth operation level maximum number of genes expressions probability of genetic operators and so on among these population size has been often proved as one of most important parameters in successful applications it is important to remember that the gp algorithm could converge very fast to quite poor solutions in the case of small population size in contrast large population sizes could guide the gp algorithm to performance penalties meaning that gp should spend more computation time to find out the best solution the optimal population size is mostly determined by the complexity of the problem for simple problems the magnitude of population sizes could be set between 50 and 200 most of the papers reviewed here had a population size of 100 to 1000 in the most cases the population size needs to be treated in context of other gp parameters mostly with maximum initial and operation levels because the both large population size and tree structure cause memory overflow of the gp computer program in surveyed articles in this review work either mse or rmse has been used as the fitness measure of the gp algorithm in the majority of the articles indeed it is possible to minimize any error measure or maximize any efficiency criteria such as the coefficient of determination or nash sutcliff efficiency because measures based on variance are sensitive to both outliers and multicollinearity structures mse or rmse becomes more popular choice to represent a fitness function implementation of multiple fitness measures such as an error measure together with parsimony pressure has been also recommended in more recent studies e g hashmi et al 2011 zerenner et al 2016 to make gp robust against classification problems special attention must be given to the selection of fitness function no matter which gp variant is used the quality of classifiers depends on the adopted fitness function quality is usually measured by means of the ratio of the number of correctly classified examples to the total number of examples frequency distribution of samples at each class must be also carefully considered before the selection of fitness function for example application of heidke skill score was suggested in the case of class samples having an uneven distribution danandeh mehr et al 2017 ideally the terminal set must consist of all the input variables that are influential in the phenomenon of interest however a number of problems in the wre typically relies on physical measurements input variables which are often incomplete the indications of the surveyed papers clearly suggest that a robust gp model could be achieved by choosing a range of specific variables together with random constants which is often challenging moreover units of terminals must be carefully taken into account to avoid potential conflict with incorrect dimensionality of gp induced models there are different ways to select the most influential variables needed for data driven techniques and readers are referred to tran et al 2015 for further details this task was frequently addressed by heuristic search algorithm of gp in the reviewed papers in initial attempts it is plausible to use original dimensional form of data harris et al 2003 an additional sensitivity analysis among most effective input variables i e the variables frequently appeared in the best 30 50 solutions was also advisable practice to select the most influential variables for the sake of a parsimony model uyumaz et al 2014 regarding the choice of functions the temptation was to use complex functions mainly because the phenomena of interest were often nonlinear in their dynamics and affected by non gaussian background noise from a physical point of view it is highly difficult to interpret the models even based on accurate and explicit functions in many studies identification of a sufficient set of functions could be done by the trial and error method starting with use of basic arithmetic operations and continuing with use of transcendental functions log sin exp etc or boolean functions and or not if uyumaz et al 2014 demonstrated that if researcher interests lie in the domain of interpretable modeling results a function set consisting only of the basic arithmetic operations might be the best choice finally setting an appropriate stopping termination criterion for gp algorithm is the last but not least important step to achieve a precise gp model the present review revealed that gp algorithm can be terminated when one or a combination of the following conditions is met a fixed number of generations known as maximum generation a fixed amount of time known as maximum run time a fixed number of generations without improvement in fitness a desired performance criterion e g rmse becomes adequately close to zero a quantitative amount for an implemented termination condition was not explicitly provided by many papers reviewed here however it is possible to assert that the optimal termination criterion mostly depends upon experience of the modeler and of course the desired accuracy level application of combined run termination criteria is strongly suggested in order to avoid waste of computational efforts 5 scope of future works the enthusiasm behind this review paper was to have a comprehensive vision over the applications of gp variants in the wre practices this is for the intention of recognizing typical tendency in the body of research in the subject and bring potential in the open for future studies all the surveyed articles showed that the distinct variants of gp have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in the wre owing to its flexibility high efficiency and capability to provide explicit models in this section some research directions are described and discussed for further exploration in general the majority of applications adopted single objective gp to solve regression or time series forecasting problems in which an explicit formula is developed to describe the underlying relationships between inputs and output although classification is an active research topic in data mining and considerable number of papers have been published on this issue the present review revealed that the applications of gp concerning classification problems in the wre have so far received far less attention with only few works reported the reason behind this confusing fact might originate from the type of available gp software programs that mostly supports only symbolic regression problems thus an extra attempt is needed to write new subroutines and include them in the main program to address classified variables if it is open source for example danandeh mehr et al 2017 therefore from the standpoint of software development future studies may involve to write new gp programs incorporating specific performance metrics into the training algorithm of gp in regard to handle both binary and multi class classification problems in almost all the reviewed papers the capability of providing explicit models i e the hidden relationship between inputs and output has been highlighted as the main advantage of gp over some other ai techniques since the presented results are usually too complicated their interpretation if possible becomes a very difficult task thus such results unfortunately do not provide new insights into understanding the physics of the phenomena no matter which of gp variant is used an additional problem related to the complexity of solutions is the evolution of sub programs confering little or no performance benefit i e the phenomenon of bloat in terms of model development while the former problem may relate to the complexity of the phenomenon the latter is related to the occurrence of overfitting although the models of mggp gep and strongly typed gp were developed to overcome these problems the present review showed that there is still room to additional research to explore effective mechanisms to reduce the complexity of solutions in such a way that they could be physically interpretable one potential solution is to use dagp keijzer and babovic 1999 in which variables and constants are accompanied with their respective units of measurement and it is arguably more useful in the process of scientific discovery babovic 2009 from the perspective of complexity the multi objective optimization techniques which can treat the solution complexity through trade offs between the accuracy and the complexity has been recently receiving much attentions by the modelers danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 eray et al 2017 however the results may not be useful for the purpose of knowledge induction to cope with this drawback a goodness of dimension can be defined as the alternative objective keijzer and babovic 1999 another important indication of this review is that standalone gp and its variants could not precisely identify the underlying relationships of highly complicated systems for example standalone gp and mggp suffer from the lagged prediction effect when they are used for single station streamflow prediction danandeh mehr and kahya 2017 anemic performance of the standalone gep and lgp techniques was also reported when they were applied to predict precipitation kisi and shiri 2011 danandeh mehr 2018 and long term drought danandeh mehr et al 2014 as a remedy recent studies promote the use of hybrid gp models that can significantly improve the performance of the standalone models to this end it is strongly advisable to include data pre processing post processing power in the gp algorithm for example one might decompose input variables via wavelet transform which is thought to be useful practice in modeling hydrological processes characterized by a noisy field on the other hand one might prefer a simple moving average filter to smooth terminals when the gp results suffer from lagged prediction error danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 it is also evident that coupling gp algorithm with other ai techniques or even physically based or lumped models certainly helps increase the quality of expected results the hybrid gp models may even include optimizing gene weights or bias term i e model parameters through modern optimization methods such as genetic algorithm particle swarm firefly and so on this unexplored direction to search whether an external optimization method can significantly modify gp solutions is believed to be critical for the progress of the gp evaluation in conclusion the type of comparative analysis of different ai techniques or their variants in terms of various performance criteria is an attractive research area in the field of hydroinformatics however a few studies somehow focused on the pros and cons of gp variants in the wre problems according to this review paper out of various gp advancements the current literature only includes monolithic gp dagp gep and lgp together with a few applications of mggp and ggp numerous research efforts are obviously needed to figure out the potential benefits of other gp variants e g cartesian gp graph based gp stack based gp and others in the

6966,the state of the art genetic programming gp method is an evolutionary algorithm for automatic generation of computer programs in recent decades gp has been frequently applied on various kind of engineering problems and undergone speedy advancements a number of studies have demonstrated the advantage of gp to solve many practical problems associated with water resources engineering wre gp has a unique feature of introducing explicit models for nonlinear processes in the wre which can provide new insight into the understanding of the process considering continuous growth of gp and its importance to both water industry and academia this paper presents a comprehensive review on the recent progress and applications of gp in the wre fields our review commences with brief explanations on the fundamentals of classic gp and its advanced variants including multigene gp linear gp gene expression programming and grammar based gp which have been proven to be useful and frequently used in the wre the representative papers having wide range of applications are clustered in three domains of hydrological hydraulic and hydroclimatological studies and outlined or discussed at each domain

temperature spai standardized precipitation anomaly index 1 introduction in the 21st century data are more valuable than ever and thus its tremendous amount has been produced nonstop every second in parallel engineers are expected to develop new tools and methods that augment human capabilities through extracting useful knowledge from such huge amount of data in water related engineering fields there are increasing efforts to apply supervised machine learning methods as a sort of data driven techniques to discover knowledge from wide range of data in order to solve different kinds of problems in the multi disciplinary water resources engineering wre and management activities the supervised machine learning method provides learning algorithms mostly for the computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed the process of machine learning consists of searching in a data set to recognize a possible embedded pattern i e the process that generated the data once recognized it may be used to estimate values in future cases in other words the machine learning is the procedure by which computers map feature data inputs to labels outputs during the learning process data typically is divided into two sets of training and testing while the former is used to distill knowledge from the data the latter also called validation set is used to validate the generalization ability of the knowledge genetic programming gp is a supervised machine learning technique that uses evolutionary computing to solve wide spectrum of scientific problems it has recently received great attention in the wre community because of its unique feature of introducing explicit models for a given process according to the color based classification of environmental models gp is more than a common black box data driven technique it is a grey box technique that allows the modeler to control model structure to avoid the typical overfitting problem of traditional black box models and provides better physical interpretation of the process under consideration giustolisi et al 2007 despite increasing gp interests in a number of wre diverse problems no effort has been made to provide a comprehensive review on the theory and applications of gp variants used in wre community in recent years there has been some attempts but they either had low quantity in reviews or focused only some parts of wre rezapour et al 2010 concentrated on the applications of gp for suspended sediment estimation a total of 17 reviewed papers including applicants in sediment transport and some other fields in the wre londhe and dixit 2012 published a brief review on the applications of gp in ocean engineering and hydrology a total of 29 reviewed papers oyebode and adeyemo 2014 reviewed 21 papers which applied gp for hydrological forecasts particularly rainfall runoff modelling and streamflow predictions fallah mehdipour and haddad 2015 reviewed gp applications in hydrology particularly in rainfall runoff and ground water modelling there remains a lack of comprehensive survey of gp applications in wre to fill this gap our review considers all common applications of gp variants in various wre branches with emphasis on more recent applications in other words this review paper documents the concept of gp from the theory to implementation in the wide range of wre problems and presents some new ideas for the future studies reviewing more than 150 relevant papers mostly included by the web of science abstract and citation database www webofknowledge com we tried to review almost all the potential applications of gp in the multi disciplinary wre studies in this paper in terms of implementations we classified our diverse set of selected papers into three main categories i hydrology ii hydraulics and iii hydroclimatology the hydrologic studies cover extensive uses of gp in streamflow runoff forecasting rainfall runoff modeling water quality modeling prediction of surface subsurface water level fluctuations and soil properties modeling the hydraulic studies address topics in sediment transport and soil erosion relevant to water soil interaction in channels dam break and reservoirs operation flow in conduits pipe line flow open channel hydraulics coastal and ocean hydraulics wave height finally hydroclimatological studies include the applications of gp and its variants in modelling forecasting atmospheric phenomena variables such as drought precipitation temperature evaporation evapotranspiration solar radiation and so on in addition we emphasized some applications of gp in climate change studies in this exciting journey of gradual evaluation of gp and its variants as a favorite solution for the modern wre problems we will enjoy a large spectrum of challenges in physical problems and methodological approaches throughout the paper with respect to the type of features and labels used at each paper the wre research issues are considered into the following three groups i time series forecasting i e autoregressive models ii regression curve fitting and iii classification problems a brief summary of the reviewed papers together with authors and publication year implemented gp variant problem category input output variables and time scale of labels are presented within the respective groups in tables 1 3 2 fundamentals of genetic programming gp as a supervised machine learning technique gp is one of the most recent data driven techniques widely used in the wre it is inspired by biological evolution where each individual i e chromosome in the population takes the role of a possible solution for a given problem individuals in the population are breeding by exchanging their genetic materials to create better types known as offspring each individual has own fitness value which plays an essential role in the process of selection and producing new population the offspring and germane parents are the members of the new population which is created on the basis of the natural principle of survival of the fittest a selection method compares the quality fitness score of each individual and decides whether a certain one is worthy to be survived into the new population different selection methods treat individuals in a distinctive way once the new population is created the individuals are assessed to figure out how they solve the problem at hand the best individuals in the new population moves to another population and the breeding process that tends to create better individuals is repeated until an individual satisfies a given termination criterion individuals solutions in gp are computer programs whose explicit structure is of the main reasons to make gp popular and widely preferred in the wre community there are several ways to represent a computer program in gp for such representation examples aka gp variants monolithic gp classic gp multigene gp mggp gene expression programming gep and linear gp lgp all these variants have been used in the wre studies among these the monolithic gp with tree structure of an individual is the original and the most popular gp representation which was devised and promoted by cramer 1985 and koza 1990 respectively a brief overview of the theory of each variant is presented in the following sub sections 2 1 monolithic gp the idea behind the monolithic gp hereafter called gp is based on the tree representation of a computer program fig 1 which can be structured in different size shape and contents the gp trees are defined as chromosomes over which genetic operations such as crossover mutation and reproduction are performed fig 2 illustrates at the same time building blocks of a three level chromosome i e a computer program this is a simple program represented by eq 1 using a root node shown in light gray four inner nodes shown in white and four outer nodes or leaves shown in dark gray fig 1 1 x 2 cos x 1 3 0 sin x 1 the building blocks of the chromosome comprise of the functions sin c o s and the terminals x 1 x 2 3 0 the inner nodes includes the members of the function set and the outer nodes of the gp structure are composed of the members of the terminal set gp can adopt any function to create a computer program while the function set contains those defined by the modeler or automatically defined the terminal set contains only input variables and optionally random numbers the modeler has a flexibility to assign desirable weights for each function in order to increase or decrease its selection probability to solve any problem using a gp algorithm the modeler is advised to start with creating the initial population of tree shaped chromosomes koza 1990 at this stage three methods namely grow full and ramped half and half are available koza 1990 in all the method each chromosome begins with a root not by random selection of a member exclusively from the specified function set once the root node is defined the algorithm creates the required branches and first level inner nodes the number of branches that will be created in this step depends on the arity of the selected root function in grow method the other non root nodes are generated randomly from terminal or function sets in this case a function is selected for the next node the node becomes the inner node and branches are created with respect to the functionality of the node once a terminal node is created it is considered as the outer node and the generation process is deterred for the corresponding branch the procedure is continued for all other inner nodes until the specified tree level is reached the full approach generates each individual so that roots and all inner nodes are solely generated from the function set when the specified tree level is reached outer nodes are generated using the members only from the terminal set the ramped half and half is the mixed approach incorporating full and grow methods in this method the half of the initial population is first shaped by the full method and the remaining half is then handled by the grow method it is worth mentioning that in the classification problems the root node is constrained by specific functions which are defined as gp parameters danandeh mehr et al 2017 besides the fitness value of each chromosome the selection method used in gp algorithm has a vital role in surviving a chromosome to pass the next generation the broadly used selection techniques are fitness proportionate selection and tournament selection the former also called roulette wheel selection involves selection process based upon fitness value of the given chromosome in the population in the selection process each chromosome occupies an area on the roulette wheel proportional to its fitness the more fitness the larger associated area hence the method tries to assign higher probability to the more fitted chromosomes the tournament method is defined by randomly selecting k chromosomes in the population and among these the one having the higher fitness value will win tournament selection does not require population to be sorted in turn leading to better performance in comparison to previous selection methods tournaments often happen between two chromosomes although it can be performed on any k chromosomes in the population hrnjica and danandeh mehr 2019 the evolution process in gp includes three genetic operators reproduction crossover and mutation reproduction is asexual operation by which only one chromosome is involved in the operation it produces one offspring which is a pure copy of its parent typically the best chromosome of the population crossover is a procedure by which two parent chromosomes produce two offspring that have genetic material of the parents the crossover operation for two computer programs was illustrated in fig 2 at the outset the parents are selected by a selection method then crossover point at each parent is defined eventually the subtrees below the point are exchanged between the parents in order to create two new offspring mutation is another asexual operation whereby an offspring is created from one parent see fig 3 the operation initiates with random selection of a mutation node then subtree below the node is replaced with a new subtree which is generated randomly but controlled by the maximum operation level parameter 2 2 multigene genetic programming mggp mggp hinchliffe et al 1998 also called multi branches gp is the advancement of gp that linearly combines low depth gp blocks to improve the fitness of solutions evolved by monolithic gp owing to the use of smaller trees mggp is also expected to provide simpler models than those of monolithic gp searson 2015 in mggp the output variable is computed by the summation of weighted outputs of two or more gp trees in a multigene program plus a stochastic term referred to bias for example the pseudo linear mggp model shown in fig 4 represents the output variable y as a combination of three genes each represented by a function of the given input variables x 1 and x 2 eq 2 shows the mathematical expression of the mggp model shown in fig 4 2 y d 0 d 1 x 1 sin x 2 x 2 cos x 1 d 2 x 1 x 2 cos x 2 d 3 c 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 where d 0 is bias term noise and d 1 d 2 and d 3 are the gene weights i e regression coefficients the weights are used for scaling the output of each tree and typically determined by the symbolic regression algorithm therefore mggp employs the power of classical linear regression method to capture nonlinear behavior of physical systems here the term pseudo linear herein refers to the application of linear regression model to obtain optimum combination of the genes this is the original version of mggp however one can apply nonlinear regression techniques to optimize gene weights apart from linear or nonlinear combinations of genes if the modeler can integrate any data pre processing technique to mggp danandeh mehr and kahya 2017 or apply an external technique to optimize the gene weights the resultant model comes out to be a hybrid mggp model readers are referred to searson 2015 for details about evolution process in mggp 2 3 gene expression programming gep gep ferreira 2001 is a kind of multi branch gp that permits the modeler to create chromosomes expression trees ets containing one or multiple genes called sub expression trees sub ets each chromosome has fixed length string encoding to solve a given problem in gep the output variable is computed by linking the appropriate sub ets using algebraic or boolean functions and or not for instance a gep model specified in eq 3 represents the output variable y as the combination of three sub ets sub et 1 sub et 2 and sub et 3 linked together with addition function graphically expression tree of the equation and relevant sub ets are exhibited in fig 5 where the grey nodes denote the linking function position 3 y x 1 sin x 2 x 2 cos x 1 x 1 x 2 cos x 2 c 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1 and x 2 are the input variables and the addition sign between the parenthesis i e sub ets is called linking functions linking functions are used to transfer information from a sub et gene into an et and typically are addition or multiplication for algebraic sub ets and or or if for boolean sub ets ferreira 2006 depending on the problem of interest each sub et or a combination of sub ets can be selected as the best solution for the problem according to their respective fitness hrnjica and danandeh mehr 2019 although each sub et is a separate solution it is a part of a more complex solution in all complex systems the entire et might provide more accurate results than its sub ets as mentioned each et in gep contains one or more sub ets each with a head h and tail t having different length and functionalities depending on the nature of problem at hand the modeler can specify the value of h at first and then use the algebraic relationship between t and h eq 4 to determine the value of t ferreira 2006 4 t h n m a x 1 1 where n max is the number of arguments of the function having the most arguments i e maximum arity an example of a typical gep chromosome with a single gene was shown in fig 6 readers are referred to ferreira 2006 for details about evolution process in gep 2 4 linear gp lgp lgp is a different from of gp structure in which programs are linear sequences of instructions fig 7 it is an imperative programming method that genetic operators act on a linear genome nordin 1994 in other words the program is expressed in a one dimensional row of functions terminals and optionally constants it is worthwhile to mention that the term linear gp refers to the linear structure of genomes therefore the lgp method not necessarily provides linear models for nonlinear systems and even is typically being used to evolve highly non linear models depending on the instructions whether or not are directly executable by the central processing unit of a computer two types of lgp system are defined i machine code lgp and ii interpreted lgp in the former instructions can be directly executed without passing an interpreter compiler thus runtime can be significantly reduced by means of machine code lgp compared to the latter type in which each instruction is being executed through some higher level virtual machine written in a proficient language the authors review is limited to the machine code lgp hereafter lgp often applied in wre problems in lgp each instruction includes a function that contains a minimum number of constants or memory variables called registers which are the central computation units in any lgp program in most lgp variants each register is initially assigned to zero as default but its value may change consecutively at each instruction and at the end the result is assigned to the same register or another register the output of lgp program is equal to the register value obtained in the last instruction in a simple example of it in c language consisting of four instructions i e l0 l3 one register r 0 and three input variables i k and a can be set as follows the program represents the output variable y as a linear sequence of four instructions acting on the registers l0 r 0 0 0 l1 r 0 i l2 r 0 k l3 r 0 a the program output may be mathematically expressed as equation 5 that shows the well known darcy s law representing discharge q through porous media 5 q k i a where i is pressure gradient k is hydraulic conductivity and a denotes the area of porous media the ability of lgp to find an optimal solution strongly depends on the instructions type the number of registers as well as the range of constants that are specified by the modeler for the details of the evolution process in lgp readers are referred to hrnjica and danandeh mehr 2019 2 5 grammar based gp ggp grammars are core representation structures in gp that are used to restrict general domains of potential solutions and induce limited expressions the idea of ggp at first formed by koza 1990 but their role has expanded to the point where various grammar based algorithms such as context free grammar cfg whigham 1995 dimensionally aware gp dagp grammatical evolution ge perl gp maccallum 2003 are now one of the most widely applied gp method in different fields of engineering in ggp also called grammar guided gp the problem space is specified by a grammar and the solution is usually a derivation tree generated by a language whose terms are expressions corresponding to those used in monolithic gp for example fig 8 illustrates a ggp parse tree together with the fragment of english grammar for the sentence the rainfall is below the average returning to literature dagp keijzer and babovic 1999 and ge o neill and ryan 2001 are from ggp family frequently used in the wre in order for this paper to be self contained this section briefly reminds these variants for detailed background in the ggp and a survey of publications up to 2008 we refer the readers to mckay et al 2010 dagp keijzer and babovic 1999 is a distinct extension of ggp which exploits the knowledge hidden in the units of physical measurements it was found arguably more useful in the process of knowledge discovery enhancing both search efficiency and interpretability of gp induced formulations the approach showed significant improvements over traditional gp the incorporation of such knowledge into the search process of gp is done through the i definition of respective units of terminals i e variables and constants ii augmentation of common functions and introducing additional ones so that they can transfer units of measurement and capable of repairing dimensionally incorrect trees iii definition of additional measure of fitness namely goodness of dimension which acts as a metric of distance from desired dimension and ultimately iv definition of dimension based generic operators like unit informed crossover for the details of dagp and some applications readers are referred to keijzer and babovic 1999 2000 2002 as well as babovic 2009 the ge is a linear string representation of ggp which is capable of evolving variable length gp programs in any language fixed length instances have also been adopted similar to linear representations in non grammar based gp world linearizing the representation of programs in ge permit the application of both theory and practice from the much wider fields of evolutionary computation such as genetic algorithms and evolution strategies the core concept of ge is mapping process of genotypic strings with no knowledge of their phenotype corresponded objects in the context of the genotype phenotype mapping process ge allows search operators to perform on genotypes e g integer or binary chromosomes unlike traditional gp which operates exclusively on solution tree ge provides a system where type of information can be encoded in order to overcome the property of closure which limits the traditional representation adopted by gp to a single type for the details of ge readers are referred to o neill and ryan 2001 3 applications in wre 3 1 applications in the field of hydrology water resource researchers have found hydrological modeling as a challenging task due to the randomness of natural processes applications of gp in hydrology initiated in the early 2000s after publication of a seminal book by babovic 1996 and pioneer research papers e g babovic and abbot 1997a 1997b savic et al 1999 keijzer and babovic 1999 babovic and keijzer 2000 khu et al 2001 since then many researchers have used gp to estimate or forecast hydrological variables in their works to achieve more accuracy and reliability the hydrological issues reviewed here include i streamflow forecasting ii rainfall runoff modeling iii water quality modeling iv surface and subsurface water level prediction and v estimation of soil properties some different applications other than these headings but not included here are of course available in the literature e g prediction error correction zechman and ranjithan 2007 water demand prediction nasseri et al 2011 solute transport processes in aquifer hill et al 2007 yadav et al 2018 baseflow and quick flow modeling meshgi et al 2014 2015 rainfall recharge to groundwater system hong et al 2005 runoff temperature sabouri et al 2013 2016 and so on however their applications were not frequently considered in the relevant literature 3 1 1 rainfall runoff modelling the pioneer studies that applied gp for rainfall runoff modeling were carried out by babovic and abbot 1997a b and savic et al 1999 these studies opened a new door for water engineers to explore capability of evolutionary paradigm to solve various problems in the wre babovic and abbot 1997a introduced the evolution of gp based equations from hydraulic data and outlined its theory and they later provided four representative applications of gp in the wre babovic and abbott 1997b using synthetic rainstorms and runoff values the authors developed different gp models for a hypothetical catchment in which the relationship between storage and outflow was assumed to have i typical nonlinear ii extreme linear and iii extremely nonlinear behaviors babovic and abbott 1997b the input data consisted of dimensionless values of concurrent rainfall depth as well as a limited number of antecedent rainfall and flow values the prediction performance of the gp induced models was validated using corresponding ann models and their semantic content was elaborately interpreted from emergent phenomena and purely fortuitous perspectives the knowledge discovered in the study is toward the superposition of purely advection processes such as lag times khu et al 2001 used gp model as a function in the phase of error updating to complement rainfall runoff conceptual model and their targeted time scale was on the base of hours up to nine hours in runoff forecasting with multiple intervals they compared modeling performance with a referenced research by world metrological organization 1992 and concluded that more accurate runoff predictions are possible through a robust error updating scheme babovic and keijzer 2002 used gp in rainfall runoff modeling and compared the study results with conceptual forecasting approach and stated that gp is a powerful tool in the context of the runoff forecast combination of data in the form of gp model and knowledge in the form of conceptual model was suggested as the best approach for short term rainfall runoff modelling dorado et al 2003 and rabuñal et al 2007 developed the first hybrid gp ann rainfall runoff model for real time forecast of sewer discharge in the old part of the city of vitoria spain the authors compared the efficiency of their model to that of traditional scs unit hydrograpf method and the gp based siso narmax model developed by rodriguez vazquez 2001 the results showed that ann can be effectvely used to reduce the errors induced by the equations developed by gp drunpob et al 2005 used gp to develop a microclimatological runoff prediction model for nueces river basin texas and showed that gp was capable of extracting the relationship between climatological and physical information of the catchment and runoff process makkeasorn et al 2008 compared the prediction accuracy of gp and ann models in streamflow modeling using multiple metrological and climatological data at a semi arid catchment in south texas their findings highlighted the importance of external information in runoff modeling however this is not applicable for all kinds of watersheds due to less availability of hydrological data furthermore they showed that gp derived models can even perform well up to a 30 day ahead forecast in a similar study gp was satisfactorily used by maity and kashid 2009 to predict monthly river flow using large scale atmospheric circulation information since 2008 gep as a new variant of gp was introduced in rainfall runoff modelling literature the anticipated predictive gep model was applied for daily hydrological information for juniata river usa aytek and alp 2008 the gep model was evaluated in regard to the traditional ann model and found to be a good alternative in capturing the internal mechanism between rainfall and runoff variables in the same context kisi et al 2013 adopted gep in modeling rainfall runoff process and in comparing with ann and anfis models their findings evidenced the capability of the gep over the in modeling rainfall runoff process at kurukavak basin turkey ni et al 2010 developed a gp model and tested its predictability skills with various regression models such as grey model mlr and ann at annual time scale in their case study located in the northeastern part of china they attempted to model the relationship between discharge and climate influences by the use of gp which was constructed using rainfall and evaporation as a result they showed the superiority of gp to model annual discharge in the study region in the last decade there was an attempt that gp was combined with the importance analysis method to provide an accurate intelligent methodology identifying the global climate inputs and local meteorological variables required for modeling seasonal runoff time series kashid et al 2010 and maity and kashid 2011 demonstrated such applications in modelling weekly runoff time series for mahanadi river in india using the following data i the large scale el niño southern oscillation enso and equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo indices ii the local meteorological variables including outgoing longwave radiation total perceptible water temperature anomaly and pressure anomaly and iii streamflow from previous time steps the rainfall information was not used in the study in order to check the possibility of the proposed model to apply on the catchments with no rainfall measurements they indicated that the outgoing longwave radiation and pressure anomaly were outstanding over the other variables on the other hand enso index was relatively significant in the lead of fifth and seventh weeks equinoo index performed differently with important leads on the third and sixth weeks in general gp modeled weekly runoff time series with acceptable accuracy under aforementioned circumstances a new approaching trend in modeling rainfall runoff process came out by nourani et al 2012 who linked ann technique to the integrated wavelet gp this proposed hybrid wavelet gp ann model was successfully used to detect seasonality patterns in the both rainfall and runoff time series and to improve the predictive performance of ann technique they investigated two different time scales short term daily and long term monthly the proposed model was compared with standalone ann and gp models the modeling results emphasized the feasibility of the proposed model in solving nonlinearity of the short and long term runoff patterns it is worthwhile to note that input matrix attributes were reduced over the standalone ann model due to the professionalism of the gp model in approximating regression problems nourani et al 2013 employed watershed geomorphological features as spatial information to model runoff process and demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed geomorphology based gp approach owing to inclusion of geomorphological information shoaib et al 2015 integrated gep model with the discrete wavelet transform as preprocessing approach to predict runoff process using rainfall data the motivation of the authors stemmed from applying a novel wavelet gep model over four watersheds provided that the purpose of sophisticated wavelet transform procedure is to extract both temporal and spectral information embedded in the time series under consideration the authors used the sequential time series approach to determine the input vector matrix that built the predictive model the proposed wavelet gep model outperformed the individual gep model in addition the new model exhibited more accurate results with the wavelet function for all the four catchments during the both training and testing phases barge and sharif 2016 developed new hybrid rainfall runoff model based on integrating the ensemble empirical mode decomposition and self organizing map with lgp this proposed hybrid model run using daily time scale hydrological information of rainfall and runoff and also designed to make predictions with multiple time steps ahead the advantage of using ensemble empirical mode decomposition derived input space was to cluster the data using self organizing map they confirmed the effectiveness of ensemble empirical mode decomposition and self organizing map in conjunction with lgp predictive model similar to the case in ann modeling it was recently shown that gp could get trapped in local optima when strong autocorrelation exists between predictand and its antecedent values danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 therefore prediction results would suffer from timing error to overcome this drawback of gp they developed a hybrid model by integrating the moving average filter with mggp in which pareto front concept was used to ensure simplicity of the solution at the end of comparing the proposed hybrid model with standalone gp mggp and mlp models the outcomes revealed a substantial improvement at the level of the prediction accuracies this developed methodology thus showed promising results that can be used in practice sattar et al 2017b adopted gep in assessing a storm water management system in terms of temperature sensitivity using 3 year temperature records at four catchment sites in canada and predicted the inlet and outlet storm water temperature of pond as a function of climate and watershed features the merit of the research was due to the significance of predicting the storm events as a unique flow weighted thermal runoff as a result the proposed model demonstrated excellent performance with less uncertainty most recently an outstanding investigation concerning assessments of hydrological models i e gp model was undertaken by heřmanovský et al 2017 in simulating runoff process at ungagged catchments using regionalization aspect they used 176 catchments obtained from model parameter estimation experiments in the usa the efficiency of the gp model was justified through three conceptual models namely sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma btopmc and gr4j the proposed gp model efficiency showed relatively excellent performance compared to the first two models but with slightly lower efficiency against the final model in the second phase of their modeling the gp model efficiency with the catchment descriptors was of interest and thus mean catchment elevation and aridity index were found to be the most influenced parameters on the gp performance among thirteen catchment descriptor variables in general their results approved the applicability of gp model in simulating ungagged catchments 3 1 2 streamflow forecasting streamflow is characterized by time varying spatially distributed highly non linear and stochastic nature due to the various interconnected and diverse factors that makes it difficult to be estimated babovic 2005 these factors include storm and climatic characteristics influencing meteorological drivers the catchment s initial state as well as catchment geomorphological characteristics as a result the applications of evolutionary computing models become first priority in solving this complicated problem researches on streamflow modeling have been directed to validate several artificial intelligence ai models with each other in this manner a number of scholars conducted many studies on univariate streamflow forecasting and routing e g wang et al 2009 khatibi et al 2011 toro et al 2013 danandeh mehr et al 2013 yadav et al 2016 hadi and tombul 2018 majority of these studies pointed out the promising role of gp variants in streamflow forecasting among invaluable research works involving gp lgp and ann interactions in streamflow forecasting business we might here focus on some efforts since 2007 sivapragasam et al 2007 used gp and artificial neural network ann to forecast fortnightly flow and found that there is no significant difference in the prediction accuracy of the methods but gp has an advantage of identifying optimum inputs sivapragasam et al 2008 also proposed gp to model the relationship between the storage and runoff in river systems as an alternative for the muskingum approach one of the earliest research that used lgp in univariate streamflow modeling was conducted by guven 2009 who built a predictive model using daily river flow his model showed very promising outcomes in comparison with classical ann model after a while a successive station forecasting strategy using lgp model was for the first time suggested by danandeh mehr et al 2014a the merit of this study stemmed from forming a predictive model which can be applied between upstream and downstream gauging stations to substitute the station having data gap s in addition to decrease the lag prediction drawback commonly encountered single station prediction models their results indicated that an explicit lgp based expression evolved by arithmetic functions outperformed three ann algorithms including feedforward back propagation generalized regression and radial basis function neural networks ravansalar et al 2017 applied a hybrid wavelet lgp model in univariate streamflow forecasting with a month ahead and compared it with ann and multiple linear regression mlr as the base line models discrete wavelet transform was used to decompose streamflow time series generally the wavelet lgp model came out to be superior to ann and mlr in particular at the predictions of peaks and cumulative river flow amounts when it comes to mention research works involving gep related recent applications in streamflow forecasting business we might start with karimi et al 2016 who forecasted river flow for both short and long term time scales using integrated gep with wavelet data preprocessing approach at the mediterranean region on the filyos river in turkey they developed two types of regression models including traditional linear regression model i e auto regressive moving average arma and ai models i e ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference anfis for the comparison purpose their findings showed that gep derived streamflow forecasting models generally favored to forecasting over ann and anfis in a semi arid region streamflow forecasting model based on a stepwise gep at monthly time scale was proposed by al juboori and guven 2016 the conceptual knowledge presented in this study is to determine the coefficient value of the antecedent records i e input matrix vectors using a stepwise procedure in gep they showed that stepwise gep forecasts were more accurate than those of autoregressive integrated moving average arima danandeh mehr and kahya 2017 developed a hybrid daily streamflow forecasting model through integrating moving average filter with mggp the authors used pareto front concept in order to select a parsimony model it is important to note that the framework of their methodology relies on three main features including data pre processing system identification and system simplification the proposed hybrid model compared with the individual gp mggp and mlr models since their outcomes revealed a substantial improvement in the level of the forecasting accuracy their proposed methodology can be considered as a promising tool that can be practiced in real wre applications another interesting gep attempt was made by atieh et al 2017 in a distinct study aim that was to predict flow duration curve at ungauged basin using the potential of the gep and ann based models the models applied on the historical meteorological information across north america including 171 unregulated and 89 regulated basins the relationship between the predictors and predictand was developed based on climatic topographic and land use information the results of the gep and ann models demonstrated similar level of accuracies using the best fit of goodness and absolute error indicators however the models presented noticeable sensitivity to the topographical information followed by the climatic information 3 1 3 water quality modeling surface water quality modeling through the deterministic or stochastic approaches have received a massive attention by hydro environmental scholars due to the importance of water quality to the public health sivapragasam et al 2010 on the other hand surface water quality parameters have high dynamicity in nature particularly in rivers and wetlands and their concentrations are influenced by various hydrological and morphological elements and climate change the primary study dealing with water quality prediction was accomplished by babovic and abbott 1997b in which gp was applied to model longitudinal distribution of salinity in estuaries the inputs were measurable parameters see table 1 and the output was salt intrusion length that is to say the distance from the estuary mouth to the point where the salinity level reaches the ambient river salinity level at high water slake they compared gp results with those of ann and a distributed model over 45 steady state measurements from 15 estuaries worldwide from the applicability point of view their gp resulted in an explicit formulation which is generally sufficient for use in all circumstances however its accuracy was found low against its counterparts a multi objective management of saltwater intrusion of coastal aquifers using the application of gp model and modular neural network is another example in this category in this context sreekanth and datta 2010 developed two surrogate models to derive an optimum pumping stratagems for costal aquifer the models were built to predict salinity concentration in response to groundwater extraction the surrogate models trained using two stage training process i using uniformly input pattern variables and ii using the relative important variables to predict salinity concentration in general the performance of the gp in identifying the impacts of input variables was efficiently established compared with modular neural network model in addition gp model showed less uncertainty in the selection of the input space variables modeling water quality variables with gp or its variants is also recent common practice in the wre one of striking examples in this research trend was introduced by orouji et al 2013 who studied the capability of gp in modeling water quality variables including sodium potassium magnesium sulphate chloride ph electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids monthly experimental records at astane station on sefidrood river iran were used to initiate the predictive model they developed an anfis model in parallel with gp as the benchmark model and showed the superiority of gp to anfis in the phase of identifying the best input output relationship and combinations of input data sets our review put forward that the direction of most recent studies is toward the exploration of capability of hybrid gp models following this work mahmoudi et al 2016 validated the coupled shuffled frog leaping algorithm with support vector regression svr model against gp model in predicting eight water quality variables in consistence with the earlier research carried out by orouji et al 2013 their proposed model was found to be efficient in order to identify a nonlinear relationship however such a coupled model consumes much time due to the tuning optimization process our final touch on this matter concerns a combination of gp and least squares svr techniques to model and monitor eight water quality parameters in the sefidrood river iran by bozorg haddad et al 2017 whose inputs were determined by principal component analysis they used gp to improve the least squares svr predictions and showed that both the gp and hybrid genetic algorithm least squares svr are accurately capable of modeling water quality parameters meanwhile gp has also appeared as the benchmark model to compare with other ai techniques e g mahmoudi et al 2016 bozorg haddad et al 2017 for instance the hybrid wavelet lgp model was developed by ravansalar et al 2016 to predict monthly sodium discharge using a 23 year runoff record for model validation the performance of wavelet lgp model was compared with ad hoc lgp ann and wavelet ann models their results approved the superiority of wavelet lgp over the other models in soil aquifer related water quality problems researchers have recently started preferring the use gp or its variants in order to form predictive models one of good examples of this type of research trend could be the work conducted by sattar 2016 developed a new simple predictive model based on the application of gep to module the organic micro pollutants removal in soil aquifer treatment system the motivation of this study was due to the importance of organic micro pollutants in groundwater and soil health in the nile basin egypt the author used a wide range of organic micro pollutants and aquifers information along with numerous real operation aspects of soil aquifer treatment sat system the aquifer physical information include hydraulic loading rate ratio of dry to wet pond bed and the influence of spatial heterogeneity on the hydraulic conductivity the proposed gep model in determining organic micro pollutants released satisfactory outcomes in term of accuracy level furthermore monte carlo simulation was used for uncertainty propagation in the sat variables at the stage of developing stochastic input attributes for the gep model as a result biodegradation rate was the predominant variable affecting in the removal of organic micro pollutants in the soil aquifer treatment system 3 1 4 surface subsurface water level prediction water level prediction in surface rivers lakes reservoirs etc and subsurface aquifer water systems is crucial for various wre applications such as irrigation navigation floodplain management potable water usages primary examples of studies concerning modeling water level fluctuations using gp see table 1 include among others laucelli et al 2007 ghorbani et al 2010 kisi et al 2012 2015 kurniawan et al 2014 and zaji and bonakdari 2018 in a preliminary study laucelli et al 2007 applied gp as a model induction engine to predict groundwater fluctuations in the brindisi aquifer italy in regard to contribution of bias and variance to the total error their study showed that ensemble modeling provides more accurate alternative in comparison to traditional single gp model a prominent application of gp over anfis used in modeling ground water table was introduced by shiri and kişi 2011 who compared the efficiency of the gp model with the most predominate anfis predictive model the modeling practice aimed to predict short term time scales such as one two and three days ahead the motivation of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the gp model as a simple explicit mathematical formulation to module water table depth fluctuations their study exhibited clearly the superiority of the proposed model over anfis model such superiority has been recently reported by fallah mehdipour et al 2013b 2014 who used the models to extract governing groundwater flow equations in ghaen and karaj aquifers iran when it comes to modeling lake water levels the works by kisi and his colleagues can be considered one of pioneering studies kisi et al 2012 estimated lake water level at multiple step ahead 1 2 and 3 day ahead using three ai models namely gep anfis and ann the outcome of the modeling exhibited more alike results except an outstanding outperformance in comparison with arima model later kisi et al 2015 studied prediction of urmia lake water level using gp as the benchmark to validate the svr firefly model despite the robustness of the proposed model gp model was compatible in term of accuracy at the lake water level 3 1 5 soil properties modeling another significant hydrologic component is the soil properties which is indeed very essential to be studied in terms of soil moisture content hydraulic conductivity soil temperature land sliding stability and so on understanding of all the mentioned soil characteristics is very difficult as it is very complicated in nature due to the extensive spatial and temporal variability as well as influences of multiple hydroclimatological forcing factors applications of gp in the field of soil properties is relatively new as initial investigations started with the studies of saturated hydraulic conductivity by parasuraman et al 2007b and soil moisture prediction by elshorbagy and el baroudy 2009 the latter adopted lgp and evolutionary polynomial regression giustolisi and savic 2006 techniques to predict soil moisture content at three depths based on different input variables table 1 the goals of this study were to identify dominant variables affecting the soil moisture dynamics as well as gaining insights into the impacts of evolutionary techniques on the prediction results to this end the models were setup so that the soil moisture content was predicted as a response to i time lag inputs i e all input variables and their time lags up to 20 preceding days and ii cumulative inputs i e the summation of the previous 20 15 10 and 5 days of each input variable their results showed that lgp demonstrates better performance than evolutionary polynomial regression in both prediction scenarios the summed input models also appeared to be superior to time lag models this result was attributed to the moisture holding capacity of the soil layer the issue of landslide susceptibility was considered for the first time in a recent study by nourani et al 2014 using gp the authors evaluated the susceptibility of the occurrence of landslides in zonouz plain north west of iran they built predictive model using field survey information and validated modelling result against frequency ratio logistic regression and ann models in geographic information system forecasting the validation process showed the superiority of the gp model over the benchmark models in predicting landslide susceptibility maps recently there has appeared another gp application associated with soil properties by kisi and his colleagues to predict soil temperature at different depths 0 01 0 5 and 1 m for mersin and adana stations in turkey using gp ann and anfis models kisi et al 2017 the modelling conducted based on two scenarios at the first traditional single station prediction models at the stations was developed and the influence of periodic information was investigated on the prediction accuracy and at the second cross station modelling was carried at mersin station using climate information at adana station in the first scenario gp outperformed other two predictive models whereas the ann prediction model attained slightly better results in the second scenario once the implementation of gp in soil temperature was generally successful it is plausible to appreciate the effectiveness of gp in such studies involving soil properties this review efforts have shown that gp might be used as a promising modelling strategy to discover usable relations in measured or experimental data studies have demonstrated the ability of gp variants to approximate nonlinear hydrological phenomena through explicit algebraic expressions which however can not necessarily provide a deeper insight into the physics of the process being formulated generally the majority of studies using gp as symbolic regression tool to develop multivariate regression models in which several input variables are linked to predict the target variable although gp often results in high degree of accuracy the induced formulae are often extremely complex i e nonlinear combinations of variables and constants and very sensitive to the choice of inputs moreover the solutions are commonly found dimensionally incorrect when the raw data are used as inputs to gp to secure dimensionally consistent models this review encourages the application of dagp which may also provide more meaningful models the research results justify that the hybrid gp models highly improves the predictability of standalone gp for example superior performance of wavelet based gp over gp was reported in some recent hydrological studies such improvement can be explained by the decomposition of input vector to main and minor signals and gp thus can discover dominant input signals influencing target variable 3 2 applications in the field of hydraulics in the last two decades a number of studies has been existed in the literature that introduced gp variants in data mining in the field of hydraulics engineering e g keijzer and babovic 2000 harris et al 2003 type of studies reviewed in this section include five headings i sediment transport and erosion ii dam hydraulics and operation of reservoirs iii pipeline flow iv open channel flow and v sea and ocean waves 3 2 1 sediment transport and erosion in a study of sediment transport gp models were evolved by babovic and abbott 1997b and compared with a conventional experimental model in this study the authors ignored dimensional consistency of gp solutions and provided a new mode of interpretation in which the numerical coefficients in a solution are not regarded as constants of nature in contrast they are regarded as notions of physics of the process from the perspective of precision the best gp induced model was quite satisfactory however the formulation was dimensionally inconsistent this point might be perceived as a sign for rethink the problem babovic and abbot demonstrated that formulation can only become true when its numerical coefficients are associated with dimensions and justified that gp was also capable of finding a solution with the same semantic content as the human derived benchmark model an early example exploiting the dagp modelled concentration of suspended sediment near bed was conducted by keijzer and babovic 2000 using experimental flume data the authors tested the performance of gp within the framework of scientific knowledge discovery to this end a standard gp model was first evolved to comprehend all corresponding parameters based on both directly observed and derived dimensionless quantities and dagp then was run to formulate dimensionally correct solutions their results showed that dagp introduced an improvement over the gp and human proposed experimental equation with having advantage of being more easily interpreted in the similar context aytek and kişi 2008 used gp to analyze suspended sediment load in natural streams using daily flow and suspended sediment concentration obtained from two stations on tongue river in montana each having a record spanning from 1977 to 1981 with obvious variation in the temporal seasons october to september input variables were streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations they used streamflow in previous day as a single predictor to predict suspended sediment discharge of the previous day despite having single predictor the gp performed well and produced better results in comparison with regression technique however their improved performance was not much noticeable as expected gp analysis also showed that using only current discharge is not enough to make accurate prediction of suspended sediment discharge gp model had another advantage of producing only positive outputs which is not the case for a regression model guven and kişi 2011a b studied the same problem of estimating the river suspended sediment yield using the same data but utilized lgp and gep to prediction models for the river of tongue in the us in this study and monitored the performance of their developed models versus error indicators for lgp they used two point string crossover and macro mutation which deletes or inserts entire chromosome and reported improved performance for lgp compared to its two counterparts this is true with respect to overestimation errors for all ranges of suspended sediment concentrations which were less than 5 as to 10 of ann errors in this stream of developing a gp based prediction model for daily river suspended sediment concentrations at this time kisi and shiri 2012 adopted gep and employed river hydraulic data together with meteorological precipitation in gep model development they used parsimony pressure as a penalizing tool with mutation rate of 0 044 their study showed that gep model had unique advantage of being simple and easy to use and may be subject to physical interpretations however from the perspective of performance in various error indicators it is not the best model for accurate representation of suspended sediment concentrations in addition to these a ann gep coupled model was recently presented by thompson et al 2016 to achieve prediction of total suspended sediment particle size distribution they adopted gep which functioned to complement an ann model to accurately predict suspended sediment data was collected for a two year period and complied with laboratory scale experiments the suspended sediment distribution was fitted to a log normal distribution and afterward a gep model was constructed to estimate the scale and location parameters of the distribution at end their ann gep model yielded a great number of positive results and showed error estimates within low percentage of 3 5 as we face to river bed platform studies some gp based applications have been also encountered with practical engineering implementations among others an interesting case addressed by ab ghani and azamathulla 2011 in the investigation of bed load transport in storm sewers with different bed roughness using basic arithmetic operators and root function together with 75 of 220 input target pairs of experimental data the authors trained a gep model and demonstrated its successful implementation in bed load prediction of storm sewers in a similar circumstance elhakeem and sattar 2015 contributed a research work involving the movement of bed forms in river beds as a result of flow interaction with channel sediment they utilized gep to develop a new relation for the prediction of the entrainment rate of non uniform sediment data used in the model development phase were obtained from experimental studies on non uniform sediment beds the model incorporated four parameters on its formulation namely the shields stress and critical shields stress to describe the hydraulic and sediment conditions of the flow the kramer coefficient of uniformity to describe the grain size distribution of a particular sediment mixture and the relative position of a particular grain size fraction to the geometric mean to describe the entrainment rate of that fraction within the sediment mixture consequently they reported satisfactorily predictions with a deviation from experimental not more than 25 between the measured and predicted values in the assessment of gp variants in eroding and scouring types of wre problems sattar and his colleagues took a pioneering role for example sattar 2013b studied the erosion of cohesive soils which are widely spread at the beds of rivers and streams in egypt before the construction of the high dam he studied the erosion potential of this complex type of soil by developing a gep model that relates the soil critical shear stress to the clay content of the soil and the particle size distribution the study results showed an excellent potentiality of gep for pattern recognition among complex parameters influencing on soil erosion following this sattar et al 2018 concentrated on the scour in mountain streams downstream grade control structures these structures are extremely important for protection of fish habitat and cause an unfavorable impact on streams by leading to scour in the downstream side they used gep to develop a model for prediction of scour hole depth formed downstream the grade control structure they presented three gep models using small population of chromosomes for simple models the data used for model development were based on large scale experimental data together with field measurements on real grade control structures in polish streams the score depth model was presented as a function of stream hydraulics in addition to structure geometry they reported simple models readily to interpret physical relationship between variables and model outperformed available empirical relations finally safari and danandeh mehr 2018 suggested a new pareto optimal model developed by mggp technique to estimate particle froude number in large sewers with deposited bed condition similar to the study of ebtehaj and bonakdari 2017 they used four datasets including wide ranges of sediment size and concentration deposited bed thickness and pipe size on the basis of different statistical performance indices the efficiency of the pareto optimal mggp model was compared to those of the best mggp model developed by the authors earlier as well as common conventional regression models his results indicated higher efficiency of the mggp based models for the particle froude number estimation in non deposition with deposited bed condition inasmuch the pareto optimal mggp model requires lower number of input parameters to yield higher performance than those of conventional regression models he prompted its use as a parsimonious model for self cleansing design of large sewers in practice 3 2 2 dams and reservoirs under this heading possible research contributions that one encounters in the pertinent literature seem to be limited to mainly reservoir operation aquifer dam system irrigation systems and dam breach investigations our review has started first looking at a study by jothiprakash and magar 2012 who focused on the management of available water resources behind the reservoir situated on konya river in india they developed an lgp model to make prediction of hourly inflow to the reservoir using observed daily and hourly rainfall and streamflow data developed from lumped and distributed input model the model depended on daily rainfall for 47 years and hourly rainfall for four years as the predictors a high population search space of 500 was used during lgp runs as the model processes the large and complex data sets using error estimates the lumped combined lgp models produced excellent results for 1 day ahead and acceptable results for 2 day ahead and reasonably accurate results for 3 day ahead predictions and performed well compared to ann and anfis techniques response of lgp models for flow fluctuations was reported to be well within actual trends in dam breach analysis hakimzadeh et al 2013 utilized gp to form a model which functions to bearing an outflow hydrograph from such phenomena model data were extracted from a series of experimental studies over homogeneous cohesive and non cohesive earthen dams data used in this study consisted of dam and breach geometric parameters and dam soil characteristics they considered only data of breach cases due to overtopping flow recorded from 40 experiments and iterations in their gp model development in order to spot over fitting they noted that their models revealed much positive results than some of the available regression based methods nevertheless these gp models can be only used in preliminary analysis since sediment parameters such as mean grain diameter was not known in many training cases this was also pointed out by hakimzadeh and his colleagues in such a way that the number of data samples inputted in the model development phase needs to be increased for more efficient gp models in the same context sattar 2014 explored dam failure applying gep to predict dam breach outflow parameters after constructing a breach outflow hydrograph and routing it downstream wise he proposed three gep models in the prediction of peak breach outflow time to maximum outflow and breach width single genic gep models were built using a comprehensive database of real 140 dam failure cases model predictors were soil erodibility type of dam failure type and breach geometry as a result of comparison of the gep models with traditional empirical models with respect to error and uncertainty estimates the gep models were found more capable of representing real physical process than others with higher accuracy in the last decade some applications of gp have appeared in different fields such as developing optimal operation rules in reservoirs e g fallah mehdipour et al 2013a aquifer dam system e g fallah mehdipour et al 2012 and irrigation systems e g ashofteh et al 2014 taking a close look to the last reference ashofteh et al 2015 developed a new multi objective gp algorithm that optimizes operating rules of aidoghmoush dam for both the reference period 1987 2000 and the future period 2026 2039 under climate change scenarios the gp based rules were described based on river inflows to the dam storage volume and downstream irrigation requirement two objective functions used in their study were set to minimize vulnerability and maximize reliability indices they came up with a important conclusion that a multi objective gp is effective methodology in determining optimal rule curves for reservoirs 3 2 3 pipeline flow in this heading the works of sattar and his colleagues in the last five years come out to be prominent examples he contributed such investigations as determining how pipe flow hydraulics is related to the longitudinal dispersion coefficient sattar 2013a gep was his tool to develop empirical relations between the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and various control variables including reynolds number average velocity pipe friction coefficient and pipe diameter in the model development he used 220 experimental measurements covering a wide range of flow reynolds number from transitional to turbulent pipe flow the use of single genic chromosomes with lower initial population allowed the formation of simple gep models yet their performance was better than available analytical and empirical models having with half the error in a continuation of this study najafzadeh and sattar 2015 developed gep models for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in a wider range of pipeline flow regime the authors compared gep model with a model developed based on the group method data handling the models in this study used the same dataset of sattar 2013a and the following predictors pipe average velocity friction coefficient and the pipeline diameter analysis of error and sensitivity results showed similar performance for both the group method handling models and gep models however the latter has simple form in favor of providing more insight into the physical phenomenon in the latest efforts of sattar and his colleagues on this matter the hydraulics of potable water pipe networks and related the pipe conditions with possibility of failure were the study purpose sattar et al 2016 2017a they utilized once again gep to develop a prediction model for potential failure of a pipeline with its existing specific hydraulic conditions their gep models required pipeline flow diameter length and previous number of breaks as predictors and processed more than 9500 pipe failure cases collected for a period of 50 year single genic chromosomes were utilized to produce a simple model and an initial population of 80 was used to model the complex nonlinear relation between the predictors they compared the gep models with models produced by extreme learning machine developed on the same dataset and reported satisfying model performance in the case of sediment deposition in storm sewer pipes ebtehaj et al 2016 presented a good work by searching an answer to how it increases the roughness of pipe and reduces flow cross section to avoid deposition of sediment and at the same time avoiding loss of sewer pipe capacity they preferred gp and svr to develop a relation for the mean pipe flow velocity at the onset of sediment deposition the svr was coupled with firefly algorithm in order to optimize svr parameters and increase model efficiency similar performance was found between gp and svr however the approach of svr coupled with firefly algorithm showed improved performance on various error indicators used 3 2 4 open channel flow in an early work of babovic and abbott 1997b gp was satisfactorily used to estimate additional resistance to flow introduced by flexible vegetation in a steady flow condition the training data table 3 were generated using a conventional numerical model further preprocessing was done to create dimensionless ratios and gp was allowed to choose the best combination from the ratios three years later the study was extended by keijzer and babovic 2000 in which gp and dagp were setup to comprehend all measured dimensional data but not corresponding dimensionless ratios applying standard gp on raw observations a satisfactory goodness of fit might be obtained but semantics of the generated formulations cannot be warranted however the dagp in dimensionally consistent but not correct and statistically meaning rich formulation appeared to be superior to other formulations resulted from the different techniques in another preliminary study dealing with open channel flow gp was used by harris et al 2003 to discover mathematics models for velocity prediction in a compound channel the standard gp was applied to purely experimental data sets table 2 complied from a symmetrical laboratory model consisted of a recirculating flume with steady flows over a deep channel with relatively shallow vegetated floodplains on either side both dimensional and dimensionless values of data were used for gp runs the former mainly to find suitable inputs for symbolic regression and the latter in order to avoid potential conflict with incorrect dimensionality of the produced formulations the results showed two distinct clusters of datasets indicating the main channel with higher and floodplain with lower clusters of velocities therefore the authors developed two separate models for each zone and found that the arrangement of vegetation and location in the channel are important this study also highlighted the importance of information in the units of data sets and showed the dagp models keijzer and babovic 1999 using relevant physical properties are dimensionally consistent continuing to review channel velocity related cases zaji and bonakdari 2015 presented an example for describing the continuous spatial description of velocity in open channel junctions in which gp is the tool to produce required formulations this work was performed using discrete laboratory measurements with emphasis on irrigation and drainage channels and sewer systems the inputs to gp were chosen as three velocity components in addition to the discharge ratio between the main and secondary channel at the junction a simple fitness function of absolute error summation was used in gp model development they compared results of the gp model with those calculated by ann model which surpassed the developed gp model in terms of accuracy and error results as a result gp has the limitation of not being able to model spatial velocity field with only a small training dataset in order to estimate chezy resistance coefficient for full circular corrugated channels with different slopes giustolisi 2004 explored the utility of gp the gp models to express functions of hydraulic radius of flow slope of the channel height of the wall roughness elements and longitudinal spacing of the wall roughness elements the efficiency results of parsimonious gp formulae approved its superiority to conventional monomial formulae furthermore the author applied physical post refinement on two gp models and stated that one may better explain the role of the roughness in chezy coefficient by excreting human insight to the gp solutions as happened in this case the structure of gp solutions can be manipulated by human physical insights gp approach can be considered as a grey box technique in similar direction vegetation related resistance to flow via gp applications is also available and one of first such works carried out by baptist et al 2007 who aimed to attain relation between vegetation characteristics bed resistance water depth and equivalent resistance coefficient and to verify theoretical models similar to harris et al 2003 the study applied dimensionally aware gp keijzer and babovic 1999 in which the goodness of dimension was measured by calculating the number of constants with appropriate units required to render a dimensionally correct equation to this end 990 results of the one dimensional vertical model for submerged vegetation which represent a wide variety of vegetation properties and water depths were used as model inputs see table 2 the results showed that the formulae based on the gp are in better agreement with the synthetic dataset than the manually obtained formulations in developing an explicit relation for river discharge calculation azamathulla and zahiri 2012 who utilized lgp using a wide range of data including experimental and field stage discharge data this research was driven by the lack of flow resistance equations that can be applied to compound channels during floodplain inundation and change in their geometry due to erosion monitoring performance of their lgp models a good accuracy of lgp compared to one published empirical formula was reported following such flow estimation business uyumaz et al 2014 took the case of discharge coefficient of side weirs in circular channels into consideration applying lgp to develop new model for the sharp edged rectangular weirs they noted accurate calculation of water levels above weirs and thus calculation of lateral outflow rates not only two subsets of lgp containing conditional based lgp and mathematical based lgp but also a large number of 1686 laboratory experimental observations covering full range of hydraulic flow regimes in channels were used in this study lpg models constituted less error than some of common regression models they further applied a genetic based sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential parameters in both studies by sattar and gharabaghi 2015 and gharabaghi and sattar 2017 gep was the analysis method to develop empirical relations between longitudinal dispersion coefficient of natural streams and various geometric and hydraulic characteristics prediction accuracy of gep models were tested with those of known regression models and more accurate results were in favor of gep models a plausible reason behind higher accuracy of the gep models could be the exponents of the key variables aspect ratio and bed material roughness which are not constants but a function of the froude number 3 2 5 sea and ocean waves studies involving with gp models under this heading mostly comprised of wave height predictions some of typical research works are kalra and deo 2007 and roy et al 2016 in the first reference gp was selected as analysis tool to develop a model that is capable of restoring missing wave heights caused by damage or malfunction of instruments such as floating wave rider buoys in model development they used a time series of wave height collected at three hour interval during four years at six buoy locations along west coast of india the developed gp models were used to fill up the gaps in the time series of wave height at one buoy location using wave heights from other locations indeed gp models were used for spatial correlation between neighboring buoys important results were obtained from the gp model in all cases except those were too far from target buoys they were able to enhance model predictions by inclusion of more input buoys and reported marginal increase of performance for the gp models over the ann models on the same problem as a research practice in wave height prediction roy et al 2016 contributed gp applications to data recorded from a single buoy station during one year along the coast of east of hyannis in the usa they used some hydraulic components of waves as well as climatologic variables table 2 in forming gp models climatologic data were measured in one hour interval for wind speed direction air temperature and sea water temperature on the basis of error indicators gp models performed well and produced similar results to those of ann which are consistent with buoy recordings 3 3 applications in the field of hydroclimatology promising results of gp implementations in various hydroclimatological specialization areas including statistical downscaling of general circulation model gcm outputs drought forecasting and prediction of atmospheric variables precipitation evaporation evapotranspiration solar radiation air temperature are reviewed in this section 3 3 1 statistical downscaling of gcms the first application of gp in spatial downscaling of climate variables by considering large scale atmospheric variables was due to coulibaly 2004 who successfully used gp to evolve appropriate models for daily extreme min and max temperature estimates at the chute du diable weather station in northeastern canada the large scale predictor variables 12 variables for the study area were derived from the national center for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis dataset at the closest grid point the performance of gp models was compared with a commonly used statistical down scaling model sdsm as the benchmark the paper demonstrated the applicability of gp technique as a simple and effective downscaling method it was found that gp simulations of daily minimum temperature and daily maximum temperature are more accurate than those generated by the sdsm another study within the gp downscaling concept for the purpose of updating intensity durationfrequency curves of saskatoon city in canada was presented by hassanzadeh et al 2014 who applied gp to downscale precipitation quantiles directly from daily extreme rainfall quantiles at the gcm scale to quantify the frequency of annual maximum precipitation at both gcm and local scales a stationary generalized extreme value distribution was fitted to the data in this study gp happened to be a promising tool for extracting mathematical mappings between extreme rainfall quantiles at the gcm and local scales provided that a strong relationship between the gcm scale annual maximum precipitation quantiles and the corresponding daily and sub daily local values the downscaling of extreme precipitation quantiles directly from the corresponding large scale estimates was found to be an efficient approach when estimating the design precipitation values under climate change later the gp based downscaling models developed by hassanzadeh et al 2014 were implemented by shahabul alam and elshorbagy 2015 to construct a new set of intensity durationfrequency curves for the same city likewise our review include one more striking example of application of gp variants in canada under this heading that is to say research work by joshi et al 2015 who proposed two hybrid frameworks which combine mggp as predictor processing method with sparse bayesian learning and mlr as statistical models for precipitation downscaling considering both precipitation amount and number of wet and dry days they identified optimal weights using mlr and sparse bayesian learning by regressing the mggp evolved genes a maximum of four genes against the output data and called these evolved models mlrgp and sblgp respectively the proposed hybrid models were trained and tested using ncep reanalysis variables as much as 20 variables as predictors and daily precipitation observations at three meteorological stations located in eastern canada as the predictand for each meteorological station each ncep variable was interpolated using bilinear interpolation of the data corresponding to the four nearest ncep grid points then the selection of effective predictors was made using mggp consequently the sblgp framework offered better classification and regression results in comparison to the other methods such as standalone mlr stand alone sparse bayesian learning and hybrid mlrgp after a quite a while and moving to the eastern north hemisphere hashmi et al 2011 applied gep to compare with sdsm which downscaled daily precipitation time series in the clutha watershed new zealand considering 40 years of large scale climate variables at which the first 30 year 1961 1990 part was used to calibrate gep while the remaining 10 year 1991 2000 part was used to validate the model the gep model was constructed within a large data set including 26 variables from ncep reanalysis dataset as model inputs it is interesting to emphasize downscaling results that the best evolved gep model needed only 7 predictors as dependent variables as compared to 10 in case of the sdsm calibrated model comparison regarding model efficiency statistics between the two models revealed that gep outperformed sdsm in the both calibration and validation periods staying in eastern hemisphere but a new approach in use and location like east coast of peninsular malaysia hadi pour et al 2014 used a lgp based logistic regression method for downscaling rainfall extremes number of heavy rainy days days with equal or more than 90 percentile of rainfall consecutive dry days and consecutive wet days were considered as extreme rainfall indices in this study similar to the previous studies ncep reanalysis dataset at the grid points surrounding the study area 42 grid points each of which having 26 variables were used for the selection of the most proper inputs for lgp which was calibrated so that each program predicts whether an extreme rainfall event occurs or not the authors compared the performance of lgp based downscaling models with that of ann and sdsm models and found that lgp is superior to its counterparts in terms of all the performance indices tofiq and guven 2014 explored the capability of lgp to express a quantitative relationship between large scale climate variables including ncep re analysis data and coupled global climate model cgcm3 1 outputs and local scale discharge flowing to darbandikhan dam iraq as a predictand variable in the statistical downscaling their study demonstrated that transforming the discharge data through natural logarithm improves the lgp performance and ncep predictors have better correlation with the dam inflow data than those of cgcm3 1 more recently zerenner et al 2016 developed a multi objective gp model for downscaling of atmospheric field unlike the previous studies mesoscale atmospheric model outputs having 2 8 km grid resolution were considered to downscale the high resolution near surface temperature required for driving land surface and hydrological models an important conclusion was noted in this study in such a way that gp did not produce reasonable downscaling rules if one aims purely to the optimization of root mean square error in contrast the multi objective gp that generated a set of pareto optimal solutions leads to significant improvements compared to the conditional linear regression in the light of assessments of the research works reviewed in this sub section gp could be evaluated as a simple and effective technique to find a relationship between large scale outputs predictors and point scale observations predictand using such mapping relationships the future projections can be obtained from gcms to estimate the future local variable values assuming that the mapping between climate variables at the large scale and local scale is stationary in time the advantages of using gp can be summarized as handling of complex time varying and nonlinear functional relationships which are often important when mapping from global to local climate is concerned liu et al 2007 the downscaling rules set by gp variants take the form of equations programs which can be checked for physical consistency gp based downscaling method has been appeared as new benchmark for the most recent downscaling techniques e g sachindra and perera 2016 whereas sdsm was commonly used in earlier studies in the evaluation of gp and sdsm the former not only performed better but also required less predictor variables 3 3 2 drought the potential of gp applications in the case of prediction of meteorological droughts were concern in some recent studies for example danandeh mehr et al 2014b and maity and chanda 2015 took such a subject into consideration using observations in texas state and india respectively the former study comprised of enso indicator nino 3 4 index together with palmer s modified drought index pmdi as predictors and future pmdi value as predictand whereas the latter required global climate pattern related observations including anomalies of sea surface temperature and standardized anomalies of surface pressure air temperature wind speed and total precipitable water as predictors and standardized precipitation anomaly index spai as predictand both the studies used lgp to predict the time series of drought index and reported that standalone lgp is not capable of predicting drought indices precisely to cope with this problem danandeh mehr et al 2014b decomposed their input variables via continuous wavelet transform in order to detect and optimize the number of significant spectral bands of predictors the authors compared the results of the hybrid gene wavelet model with those of standalone lgp neuro wavelet and fuzzy wavelet models and showed the superiority of the gene wavelet model to its counterparts it is worth mentioning that the spai values are further classified into three categories dry wet and normal events in the study of maity and chanda 2015 and the prediction performance was also evaluated in terms of true prediction of each event despite the medium range accuracy they concluded that lgp is a promising tool in capturing the inherent dependence structure between global climate pattern and drought events 3 3 3 precipitation in this significant component of hydrologic cycle that is known to have highly noisy field our review surprisingly showed that a few researchers have used gp for the purpose of precipitation forecasting in a preliminary study by bakhshaii and stull 2009 gep was used to build deterministic ensemble forecast models with bias corrected short range 24 hour accumulated precipitation at 24 weather stations in southwestern canada outputs of 11 limited area ensemble members from three different numerical weather prediction models at four horizontal grids were used as gep inputs the authors demonstrated that the optimum gep functioned as combining raw numerical weather prediction precipitation forecasts at the same time removing bias in addition the gep forecasts were superior to those obtained by simple ensemble means for about half of the weather test stations gep can be sometimes coupled with wavelet model to establish a hybrid form to reach higher prediction performance level in this way kisi and shiri 2011 proved the effectiveness of such approach by developing gep and hybrid wavelet gep conjunction models to forecast daily precipitation series at two rain gauge stations located in the aegean region of turkey the gep based precipitation forecasting model having three genes per chromosomes was developed using antecedent daily precipitation data up to four days as model inputs and addition operator as linking function their results showed that standalone gep produced weaker forecasts in the study region on the other hand the wavelet gep model aggregated by best standalone gep model and wavelet as decomposer of sub series converting to model inputs significantly improves efficiency of standalone gep results in this study the wavelet gep model was pointed out to be superior to wavelet neuro fuzzy conjunction model our final review on the hybrid gp application in the business of precipitation prediction contains quite recent example conducted by mehdizadeh et al 2018 who suggested a hybrid gep autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model for monthly rainfall forecasting at five stations with various climatic conditions in iran their study results clearly indicated that the developed hybrid method significantly improves prediction accuracy of standalone gep model at the intersection of hydroclimatology and precipitation sub sections kashid and maity 2012 carried out an investigation based on large scale atmospheric circulation indices enso and those from equinoo to predict monthly indian summer monsoon rainfall using lgp the analysis model was trained and tested using historical average of monthly values of rainfall and enso and equinoo indices extending back to previous few months the sensitiveness of input variables was evaluated in terms of input impact factors obtained by evolutionary search algorithm in lgp their results exhibited that enso and equinoo indices of time steps t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the most effective inputs for satisfactory prediction of precipitation in the case of ensemble forecast problem gp variants have been recently value to as methodological remedy as well seen in the work of dufek et al 2017 who proposed grammar gp ggp model to form more accurate short range 24 h 72 h deterministic ensemble forecast models of 24 h accumulated precipitation at 317 weather stations in brazil during rainy period from october to february of 2008 2013 differing from the earlier work of bakhshaii and stull 2009 the authors included other predictors such as major weather patterns over brazil in addition to numerical weather prediction models according to their results ggp is more versatile technique outperformed two traditional statistical techniques at the end of this heading how an interesting formation of gp model can be adopted to a problem associated with precipitation pattern will be exemplified in a more recent study by danandeh mehr et al 2017 they introduced development and application of a three phase gp model that enhanced the ability of gp to solve both binary classification and regression problems the proposed binary gp model integrates certain types of data pre processing including detrending normalization and binarization and post processing including logistic transformation approaches with gp engine the analysis model was trained and tested for teleconnection studies between sst series of black sea mediterranean sea and red sea and monthly rainfall events at two rain gauge stations in northwestern iran the authors compared skill of the binary gp model with that of decision tree association rule model and showed superiority of the former model 3 3 4 evaporation evapotranspiration as being common to see gp and its variants applications in other areas of wre a number of research studies involving such application have also become available in evaporation evapotranspiration modelling after mid 2000 following widespread tendency of gp usage at that time the researchers of earlier studies attempted to prove its superiority to empirical or other ai techniques e g terzi and keskin 2005 guven et al 2008 traore and guven 2012 guven and kisi 2013 ghorbani et al 2012 but the investigators of most recent studies have started following a new tendency of gp usage as benchmark e g deo and samui 2017 eray et al 2017 because of inherent complexity of evaporation evapotranspiration processes the contents of germane research works involving gp applications have wide spectrum that will be summarized hereinafter in a preliminary study parasuraman et al 2007a explored the utility of gp to model the eddy covariance measured latent heat at two weather stations in canada the gp models were constructed as functions of net radiation ground and air temperature wind speed and relative humidity and then the efficiency results were compared with those of ann and the traditional penman monteith method they asserted that the both gp and ann resulted in much positive outcomes than the penman monteith method while their individual performances were noted to be close to each other nevertheless the gp evolved equations were parsimonious as it can identify the most significant parameters influencing evapotranspiration and it thus was well suited tool to model dynamics of evapotranspiration process in the extension of this study parasuraman and elshorbagy 2008 aimed to explore the issue of model structure uncertainty in hydrological modeling they were concerned with combination of bootstrap method and self organizing ability of gp to generate ensemble of gp solutions for quantifying the model structure uncertainty in characterizing the actual evapotranspiration flux for a reconstructed watershed in canada of similar nature for the purpose of estimating hourly eddy covariance measured actual evapotranspiration izadifar and elshorbagy 2010 proved the success of gp application over alternative commonly used models in the study area of a reconstructed landscape located in northern alberta canada to this end the latent heat measured by the eddy covariance method was modelled as a function of five climatic variables namely net radiation ground and air temperature relative humidity and wind speed the performance of gp model was compared with those of ann models statistical regression models and physically based hydrus 1d model which is supported by the conventional penman monteith model for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration their results indicated that the gp and mlr models had better generalization ability than the ann model as regards to estimate evaporation and seepages losses i e reservoir losses through the application of lgp sivapragasam et al 2009 presented such a study that contains a single mathematical model at each periyar and kovilar reservoirs india using historical meteorological data as predictands and real time changes in the reservoir water level as predictor the lgp based evaporation seepage estimations were compared with those of penman combination model in addition the predictions obtained from gp and penman combination models were integrated with the reservoirs water balance equation to derive the optimum reservoir scheduling the authors concluded that the lgp and the penman combination models performed well in estimating evaporation losses during the period august december however the former appeared to be superior to estimate seepage losses during the period march july when seepage loss was a major component in the reservoir adopting the same developed models of this study de la paix mupenzi et al 2012 attempted to estimate monthly evaporation and seepage losses in arid region located at northwestern china although the original models were developed and calibrated at fortnightly scales for two reservoirs in india and the scatterplot of observed vs predicted evaporation seepage losses showed significant deviation around 1 1 line the authors stated that the combination of gp penman monteith and the penman combination models performed well than each individual model in modeling the evapotranspiration and evaporation seepage process in the arid zone under this heading gp and its variants have often been a favorable analysis tool to make assessments on reference evapotranspiration and alike variables among others the first study that will be examined on this matter is the one by shiri et al 2012 who employed gep with different sets of instructions and linking functions to create daily reference evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration from a hypothesized reference crop prediction models at four weather stations in basque country spain the gep model was trained and tested using three different input combinations at each station air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity were used in the first combination whereas considering an analogy with the empirical priestley taylor hargreaves samani method the second third combination includes air temperature and solar radiation only air temperature as input variables the results of gep models were compared with those of anfis and the empirical methods and the former was identified to surpass its counterparts in another study within a similar frame of research analysis by shiri et al 2014b the generalization ability of gep to estimate reference evapotranspiration along caspian sea and persian gulf coastlines was of concern using data from eight weather stations and spatial and temporal k fold test procedure the authors indicated that the locally trained gep models outperformed the externally trained models due to higher similarity between training and testing patterns and only under specific conditions the latter might be a valid alternative moreover arunkumar and jothiprakash 2013 compared ability of lgp with ann and model tree methods for time series of daily evaporation at koyna reservoir india and indicated that lgp predicts reservoir evaporation slightly better than the ann and mt models more recently yassin et al 2016 used gep to develop new models for daily reference evapotranspiration prediction at the kingdom of saudi arabia the gep models were trained and tested using climatic variables from 13 meteorological stations in order to compare with those of four locally calibrated empirical equations hargreaves samani irmak jensen haise and kimberly penman their results revealed that the gep models are superior to all the locally calibrated equations the gep models which were trained based on temperature max min and average and crop height indices were found to be inferior to the ones which were trained based on temperature crop height humidity solar radiation and wind speed it can be readily speculated that the solar radiation wind speed has the least greatest effect on reference evapotranspiration under the hyper arid conditions pan evaporation related studies involving gp and its variants have also been successfully contributed to the germane literature for example guven and kişi 2011a investigated the ability of lgp and gep for daily pan evaporation modeling at fresno los angeles and san diego weather stations a data set of inputs having air temperature solar radiation wind speed pressure and humidity time series at each station were implemented to the lgp and gep engines to estimate pan evaporation the gp based estimations were then compared with those of three different ann models as well as the empirical stephens stewart model based on different performance measures the authors reported promising role of lgp technique in modeling evaporation process in a comprehensive study by arunkumar et al 2017 ability of the three data driven techniques i e lgp ann and model tree were assessed for i one day ahead forecasting of daily pan evaporation and ii cause effect mapping between daily pan evaporation and some concurrent meteorological variables including air temperature min max dew point relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours the authors indicated that the lgp model using four time lags t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 provides most accurate evaporation forecasts whereas ann was found as the best estimation tool in the case of cause effect mapping more recently eray et al 2017 investigated the ability of mggp with maximum eight allowed genes to enhance the prediction accuracy of monthly pan evaporation in antakya and antalya stations turkey the mggp models were trained and verified using observed air temperature min and max solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed as the predictors and pan evaporation as the predictand variable their models were compared with gp dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system and calibrated hargreaves samani methods in terms of root mean square error mean absolute error nash sutcliffe efficiency determination coefficient akaike information criterion and combined accuracy overall results of this study emphasized that gp is superior to its counterparts at antakya station however the neural fuzzy model provided better performance than others in antalya station 3 3 5 solar radiation in the absence of meteorological sensors in the detection of solar radiation the application of diverse ai methods along with some climatic observations has been suggested in the recent literature e g sharifi et al 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2016 however only a few studies have thus far used any gp variants for this purpose looking at earlier preliminary studies under this heading the work of landeras et al 2012 is one of noticeable researches which implemented gep in estimating daily incoming solar radiation at four weather stations in the basque region northern spain a comprehensive comparison was also made between gep and ai models of ann and anfis as well as optimized versions of empirical equations of hargreaves samani and mahmood hubbard two versions all the models equations were trained and tested using different combinations of daily values of extraterrestrial radiation air temperature max and mini day of year and corrected clear sky solar irradiation to predict daily incoming global solar radiation at each station the results showed superiority of ann to the other models equations in terms of prediction accuracy nevertheless landeras et al 2012 suggested gep for practical use inasmuch as it could produce simple explicit equation for the phenomenon which can be used by anyone not necessarily being familiar with gep another gep application to predict daily solar radiation mousavi et al 2015 presented a good example at a nominal city mashhad in iran having assigned as predictors daily climatic variables such as air and earth temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed were inserted into a comparative analysis between gep and mlr that was aimed to exhibit the ability of gep to predict daily solar radiation in the city as a result the gep based sensitivity analysis disclosed the mean air temperature relative humidity being the most least effective predictor using a different kind of gp variants shavandi and ramyani 2013 utilized lgp to predict monthly global solar radiation at two nominal cities tehran and kerman in iran six years of monthly climatic data including air temperature min max humidity precipitation and total of sunshine were used to derive solar radiation prediction models to get an idea about the predictive power of the lgp model at each city their performance was compared with that of the conventional angstrom model in addition the contribution of the input variables affecting the solar radiation as evaluated through the evolutionary sensitivity analysis their results indicated that the lgp models significantly outperform traditional angstrom s model and air temperature min max is the most effective variable in modeling solar radiation at last demirhan and atilgan 2015 proposed a new global solar radiation estimation model that integrates robust coplot to the gp techniques in their model first dimensionality of model spaces i e the number of potential predictors were optimized via coplot technique and then mean monthly and mean annual two separate global solar radiation estimation models were built using gp in the proposed coplot gp model a data set of relative humidity soil temperature air temperature latitude longitude altitude precipitation monthly average daily extra terrestrial horizontal global solar radiation maximum possible sunshine duration and day length was taken into account as the potential predictors to predict monthly and yearly global solar radiation at 65 meteorological stations across turkey a total of randomly selected 50 stations was used as model calibration points while the remaining 15 stations was processed for the validation aim their analysis put forward an interesting result so that gp technique could be affected by violations of outliers and multicollinearity having the advantage of using the robust coplot precise monthly and yearly mean daily global solar radiation estimations could be possible by means of the coplot gp model 3 3 6 temperature being a measure of the internal energy of the system a body of knowledge concerning the temperature variable in any respect is highly significant to offer realistic solutions to the most of challenging wre problems for this reason researchers have been recently solicitous about estimation of temperature related variables through the use of gp variants for example stanislawska et al 2012 implemented the tree based gp to the task of global mean temperature modeling with one month in advance that binds the mean global temperature to several climate factors a set of independent variables climate factors in their study included the number of sun spots atlantic multi decadal oscillation index i e mean sst of north atlantic north atlantic oscillation index volcanic explosivity index enso index and concentration of greenhouse gases for the period 1900 2009 they successfully demonstrated that gp is capable of distilling unbiased models from complex climate data that simulate the aggregate behavior of global temperature changes without resorting to historical temperature itself their experiment however showed that the best models suffer from the bloat problem the models reach the size of 200 250 tree nodes rendering their direct interpretation difficult in another study in this case ramesh et al 2015 developed gp based one to seven days ahead minimum and maximum surface air temperature forecasting models using the weather parameters observed at chennai station india and compared its efficiency with that of ann models the environmental predictors used in this study included temperature min max average mean dew point sea level pressure mean visibility wind speed average max and precipitation the analysis outcomes showed that the accuracy of ann models were slightly better than those of gp approach for all lead times in the need of estimating daily dew point temperature shiri et al 2014a compared the capability of gep with two ann models for at two weather stations seoul and incheon in south korea eight years of observed climatic variables namely atmospheric pressure relative humidity air temperature wind speed and incoming solar radiation were used to estimate dew point temperature at the stations moreover cross station models constructed by gep using the effective variables of the nearby station their results revealed that the gep models outperformed the anns at two stations another investigation regarding the estimation of daily dew point temperature was recently presented by mehdizadeh et al 2017 who adopted gep to estimate at two stations tabriz and urmia in iran considering the applied input variables three types of gep models including temperature multivariate and periodicity based models were developed in this study following to the study of shiri et al 2014a the cross station gep based models were set up using meteorological data of nearby station their results showed a promising role of gep in the efforts of dew point prediction minimum air temperature and actual vapor pressure were found as the most effective variables in the temperature and multivariate based gep models respectively the idea that meteorological data from nearby station can be used as predictors for dew point prediction in gep modelling is proven to be valid in this study in continuation of gep applications under this heading there exist more documents having interesting topics some of which will be briefly mentioned hereinafter starting with a study conducted by kisi and sanikhani 2015 who investigated the ability of gep and four other ai methods including anns anfis with grid partition and anfis with subtractive clustering and svr a successful practice was added to the pertinent literature in predicting long term monthly temperatures using data from 50 stations in iran the periodicity component month of the year and geographical characteristics latitude longitude and altitude of the stations were used as inputs to predict long term monthly temperatures their results indicated that long term monthly temperatures of all stations can be successfully estimated by the applied methods however the overall accuracy of the svr model was found to be better than other models more recently xiong et al 2017 applied gep to find the best regression function in the quality control of the surface hourly temperature and identify potential outliers the gep results were compared with those of the spatial regression test and inverse distance weighting methods their results indicate that gep is by far the best model and could yield smallest estimated error 4 selection of gp components parameters optimum determination of gp components is often based on complexity of the problem under consideration as well as the interaction between the gp parameters having appropriate choice of the components gp algorithm can significantly reduce execution time and obtain improved results fig 9 illustrates the five major components namely evolutionary parameters fitness measure terminal set function set and termination criterion necessary for a successful gp run as previously mentioned evolutionary parameters include population size maximum number of the generations initial and maximum tree depth operation level maximum number of genes expressions probability of genetic operators and so on among these population size has been often proved as one of most important parameters in successful applications it is important to remember that the gp algorithm could converge very fast to quite poor solutions in the case of small population size in contrast large population sizes could guide the gp algorithm to performance penalties meaning that gp should spend more computation time to find out the best solution the optimal population size is mostly determined by the complexity of the problem for simple problems the magnitude of population sizes could be set between 50 and 200 most of the papers reviewed here had a population size of 100 to 1000 in the most cases the population size needs to be treated in context of other gp parameters mostly with maximum initial and operation levels because the both large population size and tree structure cause memory overflow of the gp computer program in surveyed articles in this review work either mse or rmse has been used as the fitness measure of the gp algorithm in the majority of the articles indeed it is possible to minimize any error measure or maximize any efficiency criteria such as the coefficient of determination or nash sutcliff efficiency because measures based on variance are sensitive to both outliers and multicollinearity structures mse or rmse becomes more popular choice to represent a fitness function implementation of multiple fitness measures such as an error measure together with parsimony pressure has been also recommended in more recent studies e g hashmi et al 2011 zerenner et al 2016 to make gp robust against classification problems special attention must be given to the selection of fitness function no matter which gp variant is used the quality of classifiers depends on the adopted fitness function quality is usually measured by means of the ratio of the number of correctly classified examples to the total number of examples frequency distribution of samples at each class must be also carefully considered before the selection of fitness function for example application of heidke skill score was suggested in the case of class samples having an uneven distribution danandeh mehr et al 2017 ideally the terminal set must consist of all the input variables that are influential in the phenomenon of interest however a number of problems in the wre typically relies on physical measurements input variables which are often incomplete the indications of the surveyed papers clearly suggest that a robust gp model could be achieved by choosing a range of specific variables together with random constants which is often challenging moreover units of terminals must be carefully taken into account to avoid potential conflict with incorrect dimensionality of gp induced models there are different ways to select the most influential variables needed for data driven techniques and readers are referred to tran et al 2015 for further details this task was frequently addressed by heuristic search algorithm of gp in the reviewed papers in initial attempts it is plausible to use original dimensional form of data harris et al 2003 an additional sensitivity analysis among most effective input variables i e the variables frequently appeared in the best 30 50 solutions was also advisable practice to select the most influential variables for the sake of a parsimony model uyumaz et al 2014 regarding the choice of functions the temptation was to use complex functions mainly because the phenomena of interest were often nonlinear in their dynamics and affected by non gaussian background noise from a physical point of view it is highly difficult to interpret the models even based on accurate and explicit functions in many studies identification of a sufficient set of functions could be done by the trial and error method starting with use of basic arithmetic operations and continuing with use of transcendental functions log sin exp etc or boolean functions and or not if uyumaz et al 2014 demonstrated that if researcher interests lie in the domain of interpretable modeling results a function set consisting only of the basic arithmetic operations might be the best choice finally setting an appropriate stopping termination criterion for gp algorithm is the last but not least important step to achieve a precise gp model the present review revealed that gp algorithm can be terminated when one or a combination of the following conditions is met a fixed number of generations known as maximum generation a fixed amount of time known as maximum run time a fixed number of generations without improvement in fitness a desired performance criterion e g rmse becomes adequately close to zero a quantitative amount for an implemented termination condition was not explicitly provided by many papers reviewed here however it is possible to assert that the optimal termination criterion mostly depends upon experience of the modeler and of course the desired accuracy level application of combined run termination criteria is strongly suggested in order to avoid waste of computational efforts 5 scope of future works the enthusiasm behind this review paper was to have a comprehensive vision over the applications of gp variants in the wre practices this is for the intention of recognizing typical tendency in the body of research in the subject and bring potential in the open for future studies all the surveyed articles showed that the distinct variants of gp have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in the wre owing to its flexibility high efficiency and capability to provide explicit models in this section some research directions are described and discussed for further exploration in general the majority of applications adopted single objective gp to solve regression or time series forecasting problems in which an explicit formula is developed to describe the underlying relationships between inputs and output although classification is an active research topic in data mining and considerable number of papers have been published on this issue the present review revealed that the applications of gp concerning classification problems in the wre have so far received far less attention with only few works reported the reason behind this confusing fact might originate from the type of available gp software programs that mostly supports only symbolic regression problems thus an extra attempt is needed to write new subroutines and include them in the main program to address classified variables if it is open source for example danandeh mehr et al 2017 therefore from the standpoint of software development future studies may involve to write new gp programs incorporating specific performance metrics into the training algorithm of gp in regard to handle both binary and multi class classification problems in almost all the reviewed papers the capability of providing explicit models i e the hidden relationship between inputs and output has been highlighted as the main advantage of gp over some other ai techniques since the presented results are usually too complicated their interpretation if possible becomes a very difficult task thus such results unfortunately do not provide new insights into understanding the physics of the phenomena no matter which of gp variant is used an additional problem related to the complexity of solutions is the evolution of sub programs confering little or no performance benefit i e the phenomenon of bloat in terms of model development while the former problem may relate to the complexity of the phenomenon the latter is related to the occurrence of overfitting although the models of mggp gep and strongly typed gp were developed to overcome these problems the present review showed that there is still room to additional research to explore effective mechanisms to reduce the complexity of solutions in such a way that they could be physically interpretable one potential solution is to use dagp keijzer and babovic 1999 in which variables and constants are accompanied with their respective units of measurement and it is arguably more useful in the process of scientific discovery babovic 2009 from the perspective of complexity the multi objective optimization techniques which can treat the solution complexity through trade offs between the accuracy and the complexity has been recently receiving much attentions by the modelers danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 eray et al 2017 however the results may not be useful for the purpose of knowledge induction to cope with this drawback a goodness of dimension can be defined as the alternative objective keijzer and babovic 1999 another important indication of this review is that standalone gp and its variants could not precisely identify the underlying relationships of highly complicated systems for example standalone gp and mggp suffer from the lagged prediction effect when they are used for single station streamflow prediction danandeh mehr and kahya 2017 anemic performance of the standalone gep and lgp techniques was also reported when they were applied to predict precipitation kisi and shiri 2011 danandeh mehr 2018 and long term drought danandeh mehr et al 2014 as a remedy recent studies promote the use of hybrid gp models that can significantly improve the performance of the standalone models to this end it is strongly advisable to include data pre processing post processing power in the gp algorithm for example one might decompose input variables via wavelet transform which is thought to be useful practice in modeling hydrological processes characterized by a noisy field on the other hand one might prefer a simple moving average filter to smooth terminals when the gp results suffer from lagged prediction error danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 it is also evident that coupling gp algorithm with other ai techniques or even physically based or lumped models certainly helps increase the quality of expected results the hybrid gp models may even include optimizing gene weights or bias term i e model parameters through modern optimization methods such as genetic algorithm particle swarm firefly and so on this unexplored direction to search whether an external optimization method can significantly modify gp solutions is believed to be critical for the progress of the gp evaluation in conclusion the type of comparative analysis of different ai techniques or their variants in terms of various performance criteria is an attractive research area in the field of hydroinformatics however a few studies somehow focused on the pros and cons of gp variants in the wre problems according to this review paper out of various gp advancements the current literature only includes monolithic gp dagp gep and lgp together with a few applications of mggp and ggp numerous research efforts are obviously needed to figure out the potential benefits of other gp variants e g cartesian gp graph based gp stack based gp and others in the

6967,accurate estimation of pan evaporation ep is required for many applications e g water resources management irrigation system design and hydrological modeling however the estimation of ep for a target station can be difficult as a result of partial or complete lack of local meteorological data under many conditions in this study daily ep was estimated from local target station and cross station data in the poyang lake watershed of china using four empirical models and three tree based machine learning models including m5 model tree m5tree random forests rfs and gradient boosting decision tree gbdt daily meteorological data during 2001 2010 from 16 weather stations were used to train the models while the data from 2011 to 2015 were used for testing two cross station applications were considered between each of the 16 stations and the other 15 stations the results showed that the radiation based priestley taylor model on average rmse 1 13 mm d 1 nse 0 53 r2 0 57 mbe 0 21 mm d 1 gave the most accurate daily ep estimates among the four empirical models during testing while the mass transfer based trabert model on average rmse 1 38 mm d 1 nse 0 25 r2 0 46 mbe 0 65 mm d 1 performed worst the gbdt model outperformed the rfs model m5tree model and the empirical models under the same input combinations in terms of prediction accuracy on average rmse 0 86 mm d 1 nse 0 68 r2 0 73 mbe 0 07 mm d 1 and model stability average percentage increase in testing rmse 16 3 the rmse values generally increased with the increase in the distance of two cross stations a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is highly recommended for cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy median percentage increase in rmse 5 for cross station application 1 and 20 for application 2 in the poyang lake watershed of china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates keywords cross station m5 model tree random forests gradient boosting decision tree poyang lake watershed 1 introduction evaporation is a significant component of the hydrological cycle and estimating evaporation loss is primarily essential for water resources management evaluation of irrigation schedule as well as agricultural modeling shiri 2011 gundalia and dholakia 2013 fan et al 2016 feng et al 2018 the amount of evaporation from a saturated soil surface is generally similar to that from a nearby water surface linsley et al 1975 therefore the free water evaporation is often used to estimate potential evaporation xu and singh 2000 xu and singh 2001 winter et al 2010 evaporation is influenced by the supply of heat energy and the vapor pressure gradient which largely depend on the meteorological data such as solar radiation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and atmospheric pressure morton 1968 vicente serrano et al 2018 fan et al 2018a b these factors are also closely related to other factors e g geographical location season time of day and climate type etc therefore the process of evaporation is highly non linear and complicated in nature eddy correlation system and class a pan evaporimeter techniques are considered as the standard methods for direct measurements of evaporation but their applications are largely restricted by the high costs and maintenance particularly for developing countries ding et al 2011 the pans with diameter of 20 cm e20 and 60 cm e601 are most commonly used for evaporation measurements at meteorological stations in china which can be further converted to class a pan evaporation fu et al 2004 when direct measurements of pan evaporation ep are not readily available it can be indirectly estimated from other meteorological variables like maximum minimum air temperatures wind speed relative humidity and global solar radiation kisi 2015 over the past few decades many empirical models have been reported for the estimation of pan evaporation singh and xu 1997 xu and singh 1998a b singh and xu 2015 have compared various mass transfer based evaporation models and evaluated their dependence on different meteorological inputs and on various time scales temperature based xu and singh 2000 and solar radiation based xu and singh 2001 evaporation models have also been developed and evaluated in different regions around the world donohue et al 2010 compared five potential evaporation formulations for estimating pan evaporation in austria they found that the four variable penman formulation produced the best performance than the other formulations for the estimation of potential evaporation dynamics gundalia and dholakia 2013 evaluated the performances of six empirical models based on the air temperature and solar radiation in daily ep prediction they found that the radiation based jensen model was the most suitable method for ep estimation in junagadh of india feng et al 2018 have recently evaluated the performances of two radiation based models i e the penpan model and stephens and stewart ss model for ep estimation across different climatic zones of china they recommended that the ss model can be preferred when only global solar radiation and air temperature data were available in the mountain plateau and temperate continental zones the calculation of ep is a complicated and highly non linear regression process depending on many input meteorological variables it is thus hard to develop accurate empirical models to represent all these complex processes therefore researchers have put forward to the machine learning algorithms for ep estimation because they require no knowledge of internal variables and offer simple solutions for non linear multi variable functions kisi 2015 wang et al 2017a b therefore a large number of machine learning models have been developed to predict ep e g artificial neural networks ann bruton et al 2000 kisi 2013 keskin 2006 khoob 2008 goyal et al 2014 dalkili et al 2014 support vector machines svm

learning machine elm deo et al 2016 feng et al 2018 etc the prediction accuracy of ep in data scarce regions was significantly improved by these machine learning models owing to their outstanding capability of dealing with non linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables kisi 2009 compared the mlp radial basis neural networks rbnn and grnn models to estimate daily ep in california of u s a and suggested that the mlp and rbnn models could be applied to predict daily ep from the limited meteorological variables kim et al 2014 assessed the performance of the mlp model and the cascade correlation neural networks ccnn for daily ep estimation in republic of korea they found that the ccnn model performed better than the mlp model in the testing stage for homogeneous and heterogeneous meteorological stations lin et al 2013 evaluated the svm and mlp models for predicting ep in taiwan of china and indicated that the svm model outperformed the mlp model for estimating pan evaporation due to its higher accuracy model robustness and computational efficiency malik and kumar 2015 compared the ann co active adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system canfis and mlr models to predict daily ep in pantnagar of india they found that the ann model was in general better than the canfis and mlr models wang et al 2017a b compared six machine learning algorithm mlp grnn fg mars anfis gp lssvm as well as two empirical models for monthly ep prediction in various climatic zones of china during 1961 2000 they found that the mlp model performed better at most studied stations when using local input data while the grnn model performed superior to the other models in tibetan plateau malik et al 2017 employed the mlp canfis rbfnn and self organizing map neural network to predict monthly ep in pantnagar and ranichauri of india the results indicated that the canfis and mlp models having six input meteorological variables performed better than the other models for monthly ep estimation feng et al 2018 have recently evaluated the performances of three data driven models including elm artificial neural networks optimized by particle swarm optimization pso ann and genetic algorithm ga ann models for ep estimation across different climatic zones of china the elm model was recommended as the best model for ep estimation when complete climatic data were available while the pso ann model was recommended in mountain plateau and subtropical monsoon zones and the ga ann model was recommended in the temperate continental and monsoon zones when only air temperature data were accessible most of the above machine learning models however are complicated and require high computation costs during training fan et al 2018c tree based machine learning methods e g m5 model tree m5tree and random forests rfs have become increasingly popular for evaporation estimation e g pan evaporation and potential evapotranspiration because they are relatively simple but still powerful models for pattern recognition and trend detection alipour et al 2014 hassan et al 2017 feng et al 2017b with higher computational efficiency for large data size compared to other machine learning models hassan et al 2017 fan et al 2018d kisi 2015 compared the m5 model tree m5tree least square support vector machine lssvm and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars for modeling monthly ep at two coastal cities of turkey they found that the lssvm model could be successfully employed for ep estimation with local meteorological data while the mars model was superior to the lssvm and m5tree models when lack of local input data wang et al 2017a b evaluated the accuracy of the m5tree fp and anfis gp models for estimating monthly ep from meteorological variables in the yangtze river basin of china they found that the fg model generally outperformed the anfis gp and m5tree models in terms of the statistical indicators in addition kisi and kilic 2016 explored the generalization performance of the m5tree model for estimating potential evapotranspiration et0 in two different areas of u s a and compared it with the ann model they found that the m5tree model was a better choice than ann for et0 prediction when lack of local input and output data feng et al 2017a have recently applied the rfs model for daily et0 estimation in southwest china and compared it with the grnn model the results showed that both rfs and grnn models performed satisfactorily to predict daily et0 and the rfs model performed slightly better than the grnn model recently the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt model an improved versions of gradient boosting with higher computational efficiency and better capability for tackling over fitting problems has been widely used in many other fields xie and coggeshall 2010 tian et al 2016 wang et al 2016a b yang et al 2018 however to the best of the authors knowledge this model has not yet been applied in evaporation studies however the estimation of ep for a target station can be difficult as a result of the partial or complete lack of local meteorological data in many situations in this case input and or output data from cross stations have to been employed to predict local ep wang et al 2017a b evaluated the performances of fuzzy genetic model fg anfis model with grid partition anfis gp and m5tree model for estimating ep at six weather stations in the yangtze river basin of china under two cross station applications i e estimating ep without local input or output data and developing generalized machine learning models for the studied stations the results demonstrated that the fg model can be successfully employed to predict ep without local inputs and outputs in addition the developed generalized fg model could be applied at different weather stations karimi et al 2017 also assessed the capability of gene expression programming gep and svm models for modelling reference evapotranspiration et0 in humid regions of south korea under two cross station scenarios i e modelling et0 using data from cross stations and developing generalized models the results revealed that the gep and svm models successfully predicted et0 in both cross station scenarios and the gep model outperformed the svm model in cross station scenario it is obvious from the above reviews that the application of the relatively simple tree based rfs and gbdt models in modeling ep has not been evaluated in addition their comparison with the previously used m5tree model with a single decision tree has not been performed yet particularly their applicability for estimating daily ep with limited meteorological data under cross station application conditions therefore the aims of the present study were thus to evaluated and compare the performances of three tree based machine learning models i e m5tree rfs and gbdt models for 1 locally modeling of daily ep at 16 weather stations in the poyang lake watershed of china using limited meteorological data and compare their performances with four empirical models 2 predicting daily ep from local target station input data using developed models with both input and output data from the other 15 cross stations and 3 estimating daily ep with input data from a cross station using developed models with both input and output data from the other 15 cross stations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is a tributary of the yangtze river fig 1 and directly exchanges and interacts with it both

temperature varies between 16 3 c and 19 5 c nearly 50 million people live in this watershed and consume about 26 billion m3 y 1 of water resources where the agricultural water consumption represents more than 60 there is a seasonal water shortage of more than 2 billion m3 y 1 due to the uneven distribution of precipitation throughout the year 2 2 data collection and analysis continuous and long time series of observed sunshine duration n maximum minimum air temperature tmax tmin relative humidity rh wind speed sw and pan evaporation ep measured by the e60 pan during 2001 2015 were collected from 16 weather stations in the poyang lake watershed of china fig 1 the meteorological data were provided and the data quality was examined by the national meteorological information center nmic of china meteorological administration cma these daily data were excluded if any of the above meteorological data was missing global solar radiation rs was calculated by the sunshine duration based p4 model as proposed by fan et al 2018b using daily actual sunshine duration n maximum possible sunshine duration n and extraterrestrial solar radiation ra the parameters of n ra net radiation rn and vapor pressure deficit es ea were calculated based on allen 1998 the measured meteorological data between 2001 and 2015 were partitioned into two data sets the first data set 2001 2010 were used to calibrate the four empirical models and train the three machine learning models while the second data set 2011 2015 were used to test the empirical and machine learning models fig 2 error statistics of the meteorological data and pan evaporation for each of the 16 studied weather stations during training 2001 2010 and testing 2011 2015 are presented in fig 3 2 3 selection of empirical models for daily pan evaporation estimation table 1 presents the four empirical models used in this study the models were chosen based on the number of required meteorological inputs and their wide applicability to various climates and areas the mass transfer based model utilizes the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere it is essentially based on the dalton s gas law and the trabert 1896 model is one of the commonly used model forms 1 e a s w e s e a where a is the fitted coefficient griffiths 1966 suggested that the variations in evaporation could be largely related to the changes of mean air temperature and wind speed based on this assumption the model can be represented as 2 e a b t a c s w where a b and c are the fitted coefficients ta is the mean air temperature defined as ta tmax tmin 2 stephens and stewart 1963 developed a radiation based model for the prediction of pan evaporation 3 e r s a b t a where a and b are the fitted coefficients ta is the mean air temperature defined as ta tmax tmin 2 the priestley and taylor 1972 model for evaporation estimation when considering minimal advection and ignoring heat flux into ground is as follows 4 e a δ δ γ r n where a is the fitted coefficient rn is the net radiation γ is the psychrometric constant δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve 2 4 m5 model tree m5tree the m5tree model was initially proposed by quinlan 1992 and then the idea was reconstructed and improved by wang and witten 1997 the m5tree model has linear regression functions at the terminal nodes which establishes a correlation between the input and output parameters the m5tree model generally requires two different stages firstly the raw data are divided into subsets to create a decision tree based on treating the standard deviation of the class values and calculating the expected reduction in this error the m5tree model chooses the one that maximizes the expected error reduction after scanning all the possible splits the over grown tree is pruned and these sub trees are replaced with linear regression functions in the second stage fig 4 further details of the m5tree model can be obtained from quinlan and others 1992 and wang and witten 1997 2 5 random forests rfs the rfs model was proposed by breiman 2001 and used breiman s bagging idea to ensemble a collection of decision trees with controlled variance the rfs model has been widely applied for regression and forecasting problems the rfs model deals with random binary trees which employ a subset of the observations through the bootstrapping technique where a random subset of the training dataset is sampled from the raw dataset and used to develop the model the data set that not included in model development are referred to out of bag oob and applied to evaluate the general problems fig 5 more details about the rfs model can be found in breiman 2001 2 6 gradient boosting decision tree gbdt the gbdt model is a widely used method for classification or regression problems proposed by friedman 2002 which used decision stumps or regression tress as weak classifiers in the gbdt model the weak learners measure the error observed in each node and split the node using a test function fig 6 the gbdt model is a similar method to the rfs model in that it combines a set of weak learners boosting but the major difference between the gbdt and rf models is that the tree in the gbdt model is fit on the residual of the former trees so that the gbdt model can reduce the biases while the rfs model reduces the variances the rfs model can be trained in parallel whereas the gbdt cannot thus the rfs model is faster than the gbdt model the detailed information and computation procedure of the gbdt model can be found in friedman 2002 2 7 model scenarios and parameter optimization three scenarios were considered in this study 1 local application both input and output data from the target station were used for model training and the local target station data were used for testing 2 cross application 1 both input and output data from the cross station were used for model training but the local data were used for testing by considering no historical meteorological data were available at the target station 3 cross application 2 both input and output data from the cross station were used for model training and the data from the cross station were also used for testing by considering meteorological data were not available at all at the target station for comparison purpose input parameters to the machine learning models m5tree rfs and gbdt were selected on the basis of the required meteorological variables in different types of empirical models therefore a total of 10 input combinations were considered using various combinations of tmax tmin ra rs rh and sw table 2 the coefficients of the empirical models were obtained by the least squares method while the key parameters of the machine learning models were optimized by using a grid search technique for the m5tree models the model parameters of minimum leaf size mls and minimum parents size mps were optimized in which the mls were optimized by using a grid search method with mls ranging from 5 to 50 at 5 intervals in the meantime mps was set by 2 times of mls wang witten 1997 for the rfs models the number of trees nt and maximum depth of the tree mdt were optimized by using a grid search method with nt ranging from 100 to 1000 at 100 intervals while the mtd ranged from 3 to 15 at 3 intervals for the gbdt models the number of rounds nr and mdt were optimized by using a grid search method with nr ranging from 1000 to 10 000 at 1000 intervals while mdt ranged from 3 to 15 at 3 intervals basically all the pairs of parameters were tried and the one with the best accuracy was selected program codes were written in the r software version 3 2 3 r project for statistical computing to develop the selected machine learning models 2 8 comparison of models and statistical error analysis the accuracy and performance of the studied models for estimating daily pan evaporation were evaluated using four commonly used statistical indicators despotovic et al 2015 i e root mean square error rmse eq 5 coefficient of determination r2 eq 6 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse eq 7 and mean bias error mbe eq 8 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i e y i m 2 6 r 2 i 1 n y i e y i e y i m y i m 2 i 1 n y i e y i e 2 i 1 n y i m y i m 2 7 nse 1 i 1 n y i m y i e 2 i 1 n y i m y i m 2 8 mbe 1 n i 1 n y i e y i m where yi m yi e y i m y i e and n are the measured pan evaporation the estimated pan evaporation the mean of measured pan evaporation the mean of estimated pan evaporation and the number of observations respectively rmse represents the differences between values estimated by the model and measured values r2 indicates how well the observed values are replicated by a model nse is used to quantify how well a model can predict the outcome variable positive values of mbe indicate the overestimation of measured values by a model while the negative values indicate an underestimation a model with lower rmse and absolute mbe values along with higher values of r2 and nse is considered to perform well for daily ep estimation at a particular weather station 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of daily pan evaporation using four empirical models from local data as mentioned earlier four empirical models were considered to predict daily ep including the mass transfer based radiation based and temperature based models table 3 presents the values of rmse nse r2 and mbe of the four empirical models during calibration and validation for the provincial city of jiangxi province 58606 as an example in general the radiation based models ss and pt had better prediction accuracy than the other two empirical models as indicated by the statistical values in table 3 particularly the pt model had the least rmse values of 1 19 mm d 1 and 1 14 mm d 1 during calibration and validation respectively also the largest values of nse 0 59 during calibration and 0 60 during validation and r2 0 66 during calibration and 0 67 during validation were obtained by the pt model the prediction accuracy of the ss model was slightly worse than the that of the pt model both the pt and ss models slightly overestimated daily ep during calibration and validation with mean mbe values of 0 24 mm d 1 and 0 33 mm d 1 respectively compared with the pt model the rmse of the temperature based model griffith was increased by about 5 during calibration and validation while the corresponding nse and r2 were decreased by about 9 and 21 respectively however the mbe values were 0 mm d 1 during calibration and validation which indicates that the griffith model had no under or overestimation of the measured daily ep due to lack of solar radiation and wind speed data the mass transfer based model trabert exhibited the worst performance rmse 1 35 mm d 1 nse 0 39 r2 0 46 during calibration rmse 1 31 mm d 1 nse 0 41 r2 0 46 during validation and the highest overestimation mbe 0 49 mm d 1 during calibration mbe 0 53 mm d 1 during validation these obtained statistical values by different empirical modes were generally in agreement with those obtained by the corresponding models in the same regions in previous studied wang et al 2017a b feng et al 2017a b predicted values of daily ep by the four empirical models during calibration and validation are also plotted against the measured values for station 58606 in fig 7 the superiority of the pt and ss models over the other two empirical models was evident from the lower level of overall scatter and a better fit of the predicted data with the observed values in terms of the 1 1 line similar performances of the four empirical models were also obtained for the other 15 weather stations as indicated by the average statistical values for the 16 weather stations in the poyang lake watershed of china in table 4 3 2 estimation of daily pan evaporation using three tree based machine learning models from local data the statistical results of the three tree based machine learning models for predicting daily ep under 10 input combinations of meteorological variables for station 58606 are given in table 5 the best statistical indicators among each machine learning models are highlighted in bold as seen in table 5 the prediction accuracy of daily ep differed significantly depending on the model type and input combination according to the statistical values of the three machine learning models under different input combinations the rfs model on average rmse 0 51 mm d 1 nse 0 90 r2 0 90 performed much better than the gbdt model on average rmse 0 87 mm d 1 nse 0 73 r2 0 73 and m5tree model on average rmse 0 89 mm d 1 nse 0 59 r2 0 72 during training however the gbdt model on average rmse 0 97 mm d 1 nse 0 68 r2 0 68 performed slightly better than the rfs model on average rmse 1 01 mm d 1 nse 0 66 r2 0 66 and m5tree model on average rmse 1 05 mm d 1 nse 0 45 r2 0 64 during testing in general the rfs model gave better prediction accuracy than the m5tree model compared with the m5tree and gbdt models the rfs model showed much lower statistical values in the training stage while it only exhibited moderate performance in the testing stage this suggested that there was a certain extent of over fitting in the rfs model which has also been identified by fan et al 2018d for reference evaporation estimation however the mbe values in all the machine learning models during training and testing were close to zero indicating there was little over or underestimation of the measured daily ep by these models the differences in performances of the machine learning models during training and testing can be attributed to the temporal variability in the observation data between the two stages predicted values of daily ep by the three machine learning models during training and testing are also plotted against the measured values for station 58606 in fig 8 the superiority of the rfs model during training and the gbdt model during testing over the other two models were evident from the lower level of overall scatter and a better fit of the predicted data with the observed values in terms of the 1 1 line as seen from table 5 the models employing complete meteorological dataset tmax tmin rs rh sw had the best prediction accuracy for station 58606 as compared with the other incomplete data input combinations this confirmed that more input parameters generally improve the model prediction accuracy which was consistent with the previous studies wang et al 2017a b feng et al 2018 however the statistical values of machine learning models in the input combination of tmax tmin ra rh and sw on average rmse 0 83 mm d 1 nse 0 76 r2 0 78 mbe 0 01 mm d 1 were close to those with complete meteorological inputs on average rmse 0 81 mm d 1 nse 0 77 r2 0 79 mbe 0 01 mm d 1 in the testing stage the results indicated that daily ep values estimated by the tree based machine learning models were in good agreement with the measured daily ep values when lack of measured global solar radiation data in the meanwhile four input parameters when only lack of sw or rh were also enough for daily ep estimation with satisfactory accuracy during testing with the average rmse values of 0 92 mm d 1 and 1 00 mm d 1 nse values of 0 70 and 0 63 r2 values of 0 73 and 0 67 mbe values of 0 mm d 1 and 0 01 mm d 1 respectively it is notable that relative humidity was more important than wind speed besides air temperature and solar radiation for daily ep estimation in the studied region which is generally in accordance with wang et al 2016a b however this disagreed with the finding by feng et al 2018 who argued that air temperature was the most influential parameter to machine learning models across china followed by sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity average temperature has been a commonly used input to predict ep when using machine learning models kisi 2015 when only average temperature data was available the prediction accuracy of machine learning models was not good enough during testing even for the tree based m5tree model rmse 0 1 23 mm d 1 nse 0 01 r2 0 51 mbe 0 03 mm d 1 rfs model rmse 1 33 mm d 1 nse 0 43 r2 0 44 mbe 0 03 mm d 1 and gbdt model rmse 1 23 mm d 1 nse 0 51 r2 0 51 mbe 0 03 mm d 1 this indicated that more decision trees may not improve the prediction accuracy of the tree based machine learning models when the meteorological inputs are very limited when both maximum and minimum temperatures data were available the prediction accuracy was slightly better than that of that with only average temperature as input extraterrestrial solar radiation ra is the data only relevant to the geographical location and day of year incorporation of ra in temperature based machine learning models on average rmse 1 18 mm d 1 nse 0 46 r2 0 55 mbe 0 01 mm d 1 was found to further improve the prediction accuracy of daily ep during testing compared with the models with only maximum and minimum temperatures as inputs on average rmse 1 22 mm d 1 nse 0 40 r2 0 52 mbe 0 01 mm d 1 similar performances of the three tree based machine learning models were also obtained for the other 15 weather stations as indicated by the average statistical values for the 16 weather stations in table 6 3 3 comparison of empirical and tree based machine learning models from local data the performances of the four empirical models for predicting daily ep are further compared with their corresponding tree based machine learning models with the same input combinations for station 58606 in table 7 under the input combination of tmax tmin ra rh and sw the mass transfer based trabert model provided the lowest prediction accuracy rmse 1 35 mm d 1 nse 0 39 r2 0 46 mbe 0 49 mm d 1 during calibration rmse 1 31 mm d 1 nse 0 41 r2 0 48 mbe 0 53 mm d 1 during validation on the other hand the gbdt6 model rmse 0 76 mm d 1 nse 0 80 r2 0 80 mbe 0 02 mm d 1 outperformed the other two models in the testing stage under the input combinations of tmax tmin ra sw and tmax tmin rs the empirical models also had less accuracy than the corresponding machine learning models the gbdt model was predominant for daily ep estimation among all the studied empirical and machine learning models during testing fig 8 shows the scatter plots of measured versus estimated daily ep at station 58606 by the four empirical models and their corresponding machine learning models with the same input combinations the performances of machine learning models with the complete meteorological inputs were also exhibited in fig 9 for comparison purpose it is obvious from the lower level of overall scatter and higher r2 values of the fitted lines that the estimated daily ep values from the complete input combination of gbdt10 and rf10 models were much closer to the measured daily ep than those obtained under the other input combinations the lower accuracy of trabert model compared with the machine learning models can be due to the fact that there was much overestimation when the measured ep was larger than 6 mm d 1 mbe 0 53 mm d 1 especially the gbdt model had comparable good performance in estimating daily ep with the rfs model the performance of all the models followed the same trend under different input combinations it is easy to underestimate the measured ep when daily ep is less than 3 mm d 1 and overestimate when larger than 6 mm d 1 however the gbdt and rfs models exhibited the opposite trends in under and overestimation of measured ep similar performances of the empirical and tree based machine learning models were also obtained for the other 15 weather stations as indicated by the average statistical values for the 16 weather stations in table 8 generally the gbdt and rfs models showed great potential for predicting daily ep 3 4 estimation of daily pan evaporation using local input data and models trained with cross station data estimation of ep using neighboring station s meteorological data is common when local meteorological data are unrecorded or missing for many developing countries like china in this situation the meteorological data of neighboring stations can be used to estimate the local evaporation values kisi 2015 wang et al 2017a b in this study all the weather stations have subtropical humid climate and the terrain are mainly alluvial plain with some hilly regions taking the complete input combination as an example the input data from the other 15 weather stations were used in the machine leaning models to estimate daily ep by supposing station 58606 lack of historical observational data the statistical results rmse nse r2 and mbe of the m5tree rfs and gbdt models during testing are given in table 9 from table 9 the gbdt model on average rmse 0 90 mm d 1 nse 0 79 r2 0 78 mbe 0 28 mm d 1 performed slightly better than the rfs model on average rmse 0 91 mm d 1 nse 0 73 r2 0 77 mbe 0 26 mm d 1 and much better than the m5tree model on average rmse 1 01 mm d 1 nse 0 60 r2 0 71 mbe 0 22 mm d 1 with 3 6 33 3 0 increase in rmse 12 9 33 9 decrease in nse and 8 7 2 9 decrease in r2 compared with those in the local applications respectively all the five stations in the northeast 58519 58527 58626 58634 and 58637 and the four stations in the southwest 57598 58608 57793 and 57799 had rmse values less than 1 0 mm d 1 on the other hand weather stations in the south and south east exhibited larger prediction errors with rmse values of about 1 1 mm d 1 all these stations were found to be located in the hilly regions the statistical values of station 58626 were the smallest among the cross stations during testing for the m5tree model rmse 0 89 mm d 1 nse 0 70 r2 0 75 mbe 0 14 mm d 1 rfs model rmse 0 81 mm d 1 nse 0 79 r2 0 80 mbe 0 15 mm d 1 and gbdt model rmse 0 80 mm d 1 nse 0 79 r2 0 81 mbe 0 19 mm d 1 therefore station 58626 was the most suitable replacement station for station 58606 although it is not the nearest station this indicates that the reasonable selection of alternative station s data is of great important to guarantee the prediction accuracy of the proposed models the cross station applications were further considered between each of the 16 target stations and the other 15 cross stations the obtained rmse values of the gbdt models for estimating daily ep at each of the 16 target stations using local input data and models trained with cross station data application 1 in the testing stage are presented in table 10 as shown in table 10 about 75 of the obtained rmse values were increased in the cross station application 1 while the rest were decreased the changes in rmse ranged from 37 2 to 38 5 averaged at 7 7 all the 16 target stations except for stations 57598 58606 and 58813 achieved lower rmse values in cross station application 1 which indicated that models trained with local meteorological data can not necessarily produce higher prediction accuracy of daily ep due to the less reliable data quality compared with the cross station application 1 taking station 58626 as an example only the model trained with meteorological data from station 59102 produced about 5 higher rmse compared with the local application this can be likely due to the variations in meteorological data between the training and testing stages e g a 50 increase in wind speed in the testing stage 2 1 m s 1 compared with that in the training stage 1 4 m s 1 as shown in fig 2 3 5 estimation of daily pan evaporation using input data from cross station and models trained with cross station data in this scenario the machine learning models used meteorological and pan evaporation data from the other 15 weather stations except station 58606 in the training and testing stages only measured daily ep data in the testing stage were used to evaluate the performances of the models table 11 shows the statistical results of the m5tree rfs and gbdt models with complete meteorological inputs for estimating daily ep at station 58606 during testing using input data from the cross station and models trained with input and output data from the other 15 weather stations it is clear that the m5tree model performed worse than the rfs and gbdt models during testing at all 15 stations with respect to rmse on average 1 26 mm d 1 nse on average 0 26 r2 on average 0 53 mm d 1 and mbe on average 0 02 mm d 1 the prediction accuracy of the gbdt model on average rmse 1 19 mm d 1 nse 0 453 r2 0 58 mbe 0 03 mm d 1 was slightly better than that of the rfs model on average rmse 1 20 mm d 1 nse 0 53 r2 0 57 mbe 0 02 mm d 1 a comparison of tables 6 and 11 indicates that the performances of the machine learning models was significantly decreased when the local meteorological data were not used for model training and testing which was similar to the previous studies kisi 2015 karimi et al 2017 wang et al 2017a b the average statistical values of the m5tree rfs and gbdt models were close to those obtained by the machine leaning models with only local ta data as model inputs it seems that this scenario was not desirable since higher statistical errors were obtained however when meteorological data were carefully selected in weather stations such as station 58519 smaller statistical values can be also obtained by the machine learning models on average rmse 0 95 mm d 1 nse 0 68 r2 0 71 mbe 0 02 mm d 1 the cross station applications were also considered between each of the 16 target stations and the other 15 cross stations the obtained rmse values of the gbdt models with complete meteorological inputs for estimating daily ep at each of the 16 target stations using cross station input data and models trained with data from the other 15 cross stations in the testing stage are presented in table 12 as shown in table 12 the changes in rmse ranged from 0 to 56 9 averaged at 29 8 generally cross stations nearby the target station produced lower rmse values compared with further cross stations since the studied 16 weather stations were located within a watershed with similar topography and climate a relationship between distance of two stations and the increase percentage in rmse was established for the two cross station applications in figs 10 and 11 it is apparent from the figures that the increase percentage in rmse generally increased with the increase in distance of two cross stations as shown in fig 10 the median line of the increase percentage in rmse for distance less than 100 km stood at 4 6 while the median line for distance of 100 150 km was 7 6 however the median lines of the increase percentage in rmse for distances greater than 150 km were generally larger than 8 2 except for distance of 200 250 km as for cross application 2 in fig 11 the median line of the increase percentage in rmse for distance less than 100 km stood at 19 6 while the median line for distance of 100 150 km was 24 2 however the median lines of the increase percentage in rmse for distances greater than 150 km was generally larger than 30 9 except for distance of 150 200 km these results indicated that a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is highly recommended for cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy median increase percentage in rmse 5 for cross station application 1 and 20 for application 2 there is a large uncertainty in predicting daily pan evaporation for cross station distances more than 300 km which is too far for accurately modeling daily ep in the poyang lake watershed of china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates in all cases the studied four empirical models gave the inferior results compared to the three tree based machine learning models which was in good agreement with previous studies kisi 2015 wang et al 2017a b feng et al 2018 among the machine learning models the gbdt model had the best prediction accuracy in the testing stage followed by the rfs model with a slightly worse estimation however as shown in tables 5 and 6 the rfs model exhibited much larger average percentage increase in testing rmse 119 4 than the m5tree 21 9 and gbdt 16 3 models this indicated that the rfs model showed the least instability as it produced significant decrease in prediction accuracy when new meteorological data were applied the m5tree model was much worse than the above two models the linear structure of m5tree model with only one decision tree prevents it from accurately modeling the highly nonlinear ep process kisi 2015 since the rfs and gbdt models have more decision trees it can better explain the nonlinear process in different situations the better performance of the gbdt model compared with the rfs model can be due to a wiser strategy for calculating pan evaporation the rfs model estimated daily ep based on the mean value of different decision trees while the gbdt was based on the weight averaged value of different decision trees where a smaller weight was assigned to the decision tree with a larger residual considering the complexity level of the discussed models their accuracy and stability the gbdt model is highly recommended for predicting daily ep by showing the best combination of prediction accuracy and model stability a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is recommended for the two cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy in the studied region and elsewhere with similar climates but the acceptable cross station distance may vary in different climates and this needs to be further investigated in the future 4 conclusions in this study the daily ep was estimated in the poyang lake watershed of china using four empirical models along with three tree based ensemble models including m5 model tree m5tree random forests rfs and gradient boosting decision tree gbdt the results showed that the radiation based priestley taylor exhibited the best performance for daily ep estimation among the four empirical models while the mass transfer based trabert model performed worst take extraterrestrial solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures as inputs had better performance than only temperature as input in the first part of the study local applications the gbdt models were found to be better than the rfs and m5tree models in estimating daily ep of the 16 stations in terms of rmse nse r2 and mbe in addition the gbdt model exhibited the best model stability with the smallest average percentage increase in testing rmse 16 3 compared with that of the m5tree 21 9 and rfs 119 4 models the results revealed that the gbdt could be successfully used in estimating daily ep in all three different situations with the best combination of accuracy and stability a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is highly recommended for cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy median increase percentage in rmse 5 for cross application 1 and 20 for application 2 in the poyang lake watershed of china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates acknowledgement this study was jointly supported by the sci tech program by

6967,accurate estimation of pan evaporation ep is required for many applications e g water resources management irrigation system design and hydrological modeling however the estimation of ep for a target station can be difficult as a result of partial or complete lack of local meteorological data under many conditions in this study daily ep was estimated from local target station and cross station data in the poyang lake watershed of china using four empirical models and three tree based machine learning models including m5 model tree m5tree random forests rfs and gradient boosting decision tree gbdt daily meteorological data during 2001 2010 from 16 weather stations were used to train the models while the data from 2011 to 2015 were used for testing two cross station applications were considered between each of the 16 stations and the other 15 stations the results showed that the radiation based priestley taylor model on average rmse 1 13 mm d 1 nse 0 53 r2 0 57 mbe 0 21 mm d 1 gave the most accurate daily ep estimates among the four empirical models during testing while the mass transfer based trabert model on average rmse 1 38 mm d 1 nse 0 25 r2 0 46 mbe 0 65 mm d 1 performed worst the gbdt model outperformed the rfs model m5tree model and the empirical models under the same input combinations in terms of prediction accuracy on average rmse 0 86 mm d 1

management evaluation of irrigation schedule as well as agricultural modeling shiri 2011 gundalia and dholakia 2013 fan et al 2016 feng et al 2018 the amount of evaporation from a saturated soil surface is generally similar to that from a nearby water surface linsley et al 1975 therefore the free water evaporation is often used to estimate potential evaporation xu and singh 2000 xu and singh 2001 winter et al 2010 evaporation is influenced by the supply of heat energy and the vapor pressure gradient which largely depend on the meteorological data such as solar radiation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and atmospheric pressure morton 1968 vicente serrano et al 2018 fan et al 2018a b these factors are also closely related to other factors e g geographical location season time of day and climate type etc therefore the process of evaporation is highly non linear and complicated in nature eddy correlation system and class a pan evaporimeter techniques are considered as the standard methods for direct measurements of evaporation but their applications are largely restricted by the high costs and maintenance particularly for developing countries ding et al 2011 the pans with diameter of 20 cm e20 and 60 cm e601 are most commonly used for evaporation measurements at meteorological stations in china which can be further converted to class a pan evaporation fu et al 2004 when direct measurements of pan evaporation ep are not readily available it can be indirectly estimated from other meteorological variables like maximum minimum air temperatures wind speed relative humidity and global solar radiation kisi 2015 over the past few decades many empirical models have been reported for the estimation of pan evaporation singh and xu 1997 xu and singh 1998a b singh and xu 2015 have compared various mass transfer based evaporation models and evaluated their dependence on different meteorological inputs and on various time scales temperature based xu and singh 2000 and solar radiation based xu and singh 2001 evaporation models have also been developed and evaluated in different regions around the world donohue et al 2010 compared five potential evaporation formulations for estimating pan evaporation in austria they found that the four variable penman formulation produced the best performance than the other formulations for the estimation of potential evaporation dynamics gundalia and dholakia 2013 evaluated the performances of six empirical models based on the air temperature and solar radiation in daily ep prediction they found that the radiation based jensen model was the most suitable method for ep estimation in junagadh of india feng et al 2018 have recently evaluated the performances of two radiation based models i e the penpan model and stephens and stewart ss model for ep estimation across different climatic zones of china they recommended that the ss model can be preferred when only global solar radiation and air temperature data were available in the mountain plateau and temperate continental zones the calculation of ep is a complicated and highly non linear regression process depending on many input meteorological variables it is thus hard to develop accurate empirical models to represent all these complex processes therefore researchers have put forward to the machine learning algorithms for ep estimation because they require no knowledge of internal variables and offer simple solutions for non linear multi variable functions kisi 2015 wang et al 2017a b therefore a large number of machine learning models have been developed to predict ep e g artificial neural networks ann bruton et al 2000 kisi 2013 keskin 2006 khoob 2008 goyal et al 2014 dalkili et al 2014 support vector machines svm

learning machine elm deo et al 2016 feng et al 2018 etc the prediction accuracy of ep in data scarce regions was significantly improved by these machine learning models owing to their outstanding capability of dealing with non linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables kisi 2009 compared the mlp radial basis neural networks rbnn and grnn models to estimate daily ep in california of u s a and suggested that the mlp and rbnn models could be applied to predict daily ep from the limited meteorological variables kim et al 2014 assessed the performance of the mlp model and the cascade correlation neural networks ccnn for daily ep estimation in republic of korea they found that the ccnn model performed better than the mlp model in the testing stage for homogeneous and heterogeneous meteorological stations lin et al 2013 evaluated the svm and mlp models for predicting ep in taiwan of china and indicated that the svm model outperformed the mlp model for estimating pan evaporation due to its higher accuracy model robustness and computational efficiency malik and kumar 2015 compared the ann co active adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system canfis and mlr models to predict daily ep in pantnagar of india they found that the ann model was in general better than the canfis and mlr models wang et al 2017a b compared six machine learning algorithm mlp grnn fg mars anfis gp lssvm as well as two empirical models for monthly ep prediction in various climatic zones of china during 1961 2000 they found that the mlp model performed better at most studied stations when using local input data while the grnn model performed superior to the other models in tibetan plateau malik et al 2017 employed the mlp canfis rbfnn and self organizing map neural network to predict monthly ep in pantnagar and ranichauri of india the results indicated that the canfis and mlp models having six input meteorological variables performed better than the other models for monthly ep estimation feng et al 2018 have recently evaluated the performances of three data driven models including elm artificial neural networks optimized by particle swarm optimization pso ann and genetic algorithm ga ann models for ep estimation across different climatic zones of china the elm model was recommended as the best model for ep estimation when complete climatic data were available while the pso ann model was recommended in mountain plateau and subtropical monsoon zones and the ga ann model was recommended in the temperate continental and monsoon zones when only air temperature data were accessible most of the above machine learning models however are complicated and require high computation costs during training fan et al 2018c tree based machine learning

for modeling monthly ep at two coastal cities of turkey they found that the lssvm model could be successfully employed for ep estimation with local meteorological data while the mars model was superior to the lssvm and m5tree models when lack of local input data wang et al 2017a b evaluated the accuracy of the m5tree fp and anfis gp models for estimating monthly ep from meteorological variables in the yangtze river basin of china they found that the fg model generally outperformed the anfis gp and m5tree models in terms of the statistical indicators in addition kisi and kilic 2016 explored the generalization performance of the m5tree model for estimating potential evapotranspiration et0 in two different areas of u s a and compared it with the ann model they found that the m5tree model was a better choice than ann for et0 prediction when lack of local input and output data feng et al 2017a have recently applied the rfs model for daily et0 estimation in southwest china and compared it with the grnn model the results showed that both rfs and grnn models performed satisfactorily to predict daily et0 and the rfs model performed slightly better than the grnn model recently the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt model an improved versions of gradient boosting with higher computational efficiency and better capability for tackling over fitting problems has been widely used in many other fields xie and coggeshall 2010 tian et al 2016 wang et al 2016a b yang et al 2018 however to the best of the authors knowledge this model has not yet been applied in evaporation studies however the estimation of ep for a target station can be difficult as a result of the partial or complete lack of local meteorological data in many situations in this case input and or output data from cross stations have to been employed to predict local ep wang et al 2017a b evaluated the performances of fuzzy genetic model fg anfis model with grid partition anfis gp and m5tree model for estimating ep at six weather stations in the yangtze river basin of china under two cross station applications i e estimating ep without local input or output data and developing generalized machine learning models for the studied stations the results demonstrated that the fg model can be successfully employed to predict ep without local inputs and outputs in addition the developed generalized fg model could be applied at different weather stations karimi et al 2017 also assessed the capability of gene expression programming gep and svm models for modelling reference evapotranspiration et0 in humid regions of south korea under two cross station scenarios i e modelling et0 using data from cross stations and developing generalized models the results revealed that the gep and svm models successfully predicted et0 in both cross station scenarios and the gep model outperformed the svm model in cross station scenario it is obvious from the above reviews that the application of the relatively simple tree based rfs and gbdt models in modeling ep has not been evaluated in addition their comparison with the previously used m5tree model with a single decision tree has not been performed yet particularly their applicability for estimating daily ep with limited meteorological data under cross station application conditions therefore the aims of the present study were thus to evaluated and compare the performances of three tree based machine learning models i e m5tree rfs and gbdt models for 1 locally modeling of daily ep at 16 weather stations in the poyang lake watershed of china using limited meteorological data and compare their performances with four empirical models 2 predicting daily ep from local target station input data using developed models

cross stations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is a tributary of the yangtze river fig 1 and directly exchanges and interacts with it both droughts and floods have occurred frequently in the poyang lake watershed over the past few decades the watershed covers an area of 1 62 105 km2 which accounts for 97 of the area of jiangxi province of china paddy rice is the most popular crop in this watershed and it occupies a cultivation area of 3 4 million ha with a yield of 20 4 billion kg y 1 this region experiences a subtropical humid climate and it is significantly influenced by the east asian monsoon the average annual precipitation ranges from 1341 mm to 1943 mm with more precipitation on the east and south the average annual temperature varies between 16 3 c and 19 5 c nearly 50 million people live in this watershed and consume about 26 billion m3 y 1 of water resources where the agricultural water consumption represents more than 60 there is a seasonal water shortage of more than 2 billion m3 y 1 due to the uneven distribution of precipitation throughout the year 2 2 data collection and analysis continuous and long time series of observed sunshine duration n maximum minimum air temperature tmax tmin relative humidity rh wind speed sw and pan evaporation ep measured by the e60 pan during 2001 2015 were collected from 16 weather stations in the poyang lake watershed of china fig 1 the meteorological data were provided and the data quality was examined by the national meteorological information center nmic of china meteorological administration cma these daily data were excluded if any of the above meteorological data was missing global solar radiation rs was calculated by the sunshine duration based p4 model as proposed by fan et al 2018b using daily actual sunshine duration n maximum possible sunshine duration n and extraterrestrial solar radiation ra the parameters of n ra net radiation rn and vapor pressure deficit es ea were calculated based on allen 1998 the measured meteorological data between 2001 and 2015 were partitioned into two data sets the first data set 2001 2010 were used to calibrate the four empirical models and train the three machine learning models while the second data set 2011 2015 were used to test the empirical and machine learning models fig 2 error statistics of the meteorological data and pan evaporation for each of the 16 studied weather stations during training 2001 2010 and testing 2011 2015 are presented in fig 3 2 3 selection of empirical models for daily pan evaporation estimation table 1 presents the four empirical models used in this study the models were chosen based on the number of required meteorological inputs and their wide applicability to various climates and areas the mass transfer based model utilizes the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere it is essentially based on the dalton s gas law and the trabert 1896 model is one of the commonly used model forms 1 e a s w e s e a where a is the fitted coefficient griffiths 1966 suggested that the variations in evaporation could be largely related to the changes of mean air temperature and wind speed based on this assumption the model can be represented as 2 e a b t a c s w where a b and c are the fitted coefficients ta is the mean air temperature defined as ta tmax tmin 2 stephens and stewart 1963 developed a radiation based model for the prediction of pan evaporation 3 e r s a b t a where a and b are the fitted coefficients ta is the mean air temperature defined as ta tmax tmin 2 the priestley and taylor 1972 model for evaporation estimation when considering minimal advection and ignoring heat flux into ground is as follows 4 e a δ δ γ r n where a is the fitted coefficient rn is the net radiation γ is the psychrometric constant δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve 2 4 m5 model tree m5tree the m5tree model was initially proposed by quinlan 1992 and then the idea was reconstructed and improved by wang and witten 1997 the m5tree model has linear regression functions at the terminal nodes which establishes a correlation between the input and output parameters the m5tree model generally requires two different stages firstly the raw data are divided into subsets to create a decision tree based on treating the standard deviation of the class values and calculating the expected reduction in this error the m5tree model chooses the one that maximizes the expected error reduction after scanning all the possible splits the over grown tree is pruned and these sub trees are replaced with linear regression functions in the second stage fig 4 further details of the m5tree model can be obtained from quinlan and others 1992 and wang and witten 1997 2 5 random forests rfs the rfs model was proposed by breiman 2001 and used breiman s bagging idea to ensemble a collection of decision trees with controlled variance the rfs model has been widely applied for regression and forecasting problems the rfs model deals with random binary trees which employ a subset of the observations through the bootstrapping technique where a random subset of the training dataset is sampled from the raw dataset and used to develop the model the data set that not included in model development are referred to out of bag oob and applied to evaluate the general problems fig 5 more details about the rfs model can be found in breiman 2001 2 6 gradient boosting decision tree gbdt the gbdt model is a widely used method for classification or regression problems proposed by friedman 2002 which used decision stumps or regression tress as weak classifiers in the gbdt model the weak learners measure the error observed in each node and split the node using a test function fig 6 the gbdt model is a similar method to the rfs model in that it combines a set of weak learners boosting but the major difference between the gbdt and rf models is that the tree in the gbdt model is fit on the residual of the former trees so that the gbdt model can reduce the biases while the rfs model reduces the variances the rfs model can be trained in parallel whereas the gbdt cannot thus the rfs model is faster than the gbdt model the detailed information and computation procedure of the gbdt model can be found in friedman 2002 2 7 model scenarios and parameter optimization three scenarios were considered in this study 1 local application both input and output data from the target station were used for model training and the local target station data were used for testing 2 cross application 1 both input and output data from the cross station were used for model training but the local data were used for testing by considering no historical meteorological data were available at the target station 3 cross application 2 both input and output data from the cross station were used for model training and the data from the cross station were also used for testing by considering meteorological data were not available at all at the target station for comparison purpose input parameters to the machine learning models m5tree rfs and gbdt were selected on the basis of the required meteorological variables in different types of empirical models therefore a total of 10 input combinations were considered using various combinations of tmax tmin ra rs rh and sw table 2 the coefficients of the empirical models were obtained by the least squares method while the key parameters of the machine learning models were optimized by using a grid search technique for the m5tree models the model parameters of minimum leaf size mls and minimum parents size mps were optimized in which the mls were optimized by using a grid search method with mls ranging from 5 to 50 at 5 intervals in the meantime mps was set by 2 times of mls wang witten 1997 for the rfs models the number of trees nt and maximum depth of the tree mdt were optimized by using a grid search method with nt ranging from 100 to 1000 at 100 intervals while the mtd ranged from 3 to 15 at 3 intervals for the gbdt models the number of rounds nr and mdt were optimized by using a grid search method with nr ranging from 1000 to 10 000 at 1000 intervals while mdt ranged from 3 to 15 at 3 intervals basically all the pairs of parameters were tried and the one with the best accuracy was selected program codes were written in the r software version 3 2 3 r project for statistical computing to develop the selected machine learning models 2 8 comparison of models and statistical error analysis the accuracy and performance of the studied models for estimating daily pan evaporation were evaluated using four commonly used statistical indicators despotovic et al 2015 i e root mean square error rmse eq 5 coefficient of determination r2 eq 6 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse eq 7 and mean bias error mbe eq 8 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i e y i m 2 6 r 2 i 1 n y i e y i e y i m y i m 2 i 1 n y i e y i e 2 i 1 n y i m y i m 2 7 nse 1 i 1 n y i m y i e 2 i 1 n y i m y i m 2 8 mbe 1 n i 1 n y i e y i m where yi m yi e y i m y i e and n are the measured pan evaporation the estimated pan evaporation the mean of measured pan evaporation the mean of estimated pan evaporation and the number of observations respectively rmse represents the differences between values estimated by the model and measured values r2 indicates how well the observed values are replicated by a model nse is used to quantify how well a model can predict the outcome variable positive values of mbe indicate the overestimation of measured values by a model while the negative values indicate an underestimation a model with lower rmse and absolute mbe values along with higher values of r2 and nse is considered to perform well for daily ep estimation at a particular weather station 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of daily pan evaporation using four empirical models from local data as mentioned earlier four empirical models were considered to predict daily ep including the mass transfer based radiation based and temperature based models table 3 presents the values of rmse nse r2 and mbe of the four empirical models during calibration and validation for the provincial city of jiangxi province 58606 as an example in general the radiation based models ss and pt had better prediction accuracy than the other two empirical models as indicated by the statistical values in table 3 particularly the pt model had the least rmse values of 1 19 mm d 1 and 1 14 mm d 1 during calibration and validation respectively also the largest values of nse 0 59 during calibration and 0 60 during validation and r2 0 66 during calibration and 0 67 during validation were obtained by the pt model the prediction accuracy of the ss model was slightly worse than the that of the pt model both the pt and ss models slightly overestimated daily ep during calibration and validation with mean mbe values of 0 24 mm d 1 and 0 33 mm d 1 respectively compared with the pt model the rmse of the temperature based model griffith was increased by about 5 during calibration and validation while the corresponding nse and r2 were decreased by about 9 and 21 respectively however the mbe values were 0 mm d 1 during calibration and validation which indicates that the griffith model had no under or overestimation of the measured daily ep due to lack of solar radiation and wind speed data the mass transfer based model trabert exhibited the worst performance rmse 1 35 mm d 1 nse 0 39 r2 0 46 during calibration rmse 1 31 mm d 1 nse 0 41 r2 0 46 during validation and the highest overestimation mbe 0 49 mm d 1 during calibration mbe 0 53 mm d 1 during validation these obtained statistical values by different empirical modes were generally in agreement with those obtained by the corresponding models in the same regions in previous studied wang et al 2017a b feng et al 2017a b predicted values of daily ep by the four empirical models during calibration and validation are also plotted against the measured values for station 58606 in fig 7 the superiority of the pt and ss models over the other two empirical models was evident from the lower level of overall scatter and a better fit of the predicted data with the observed values in terms of the 1 1 line similar performances of the four empirical models were also obtained for the other 15 weather stations as indicated by the average statistical values for the 16 weather stations in the poyang lake watershed of china in table 4 3 2 estimation of daily pan evaporation using three tree based machine learning models from local data the statistical results of the three tree based machine learning models for predicting daily ep under 10 input combinations of meteorological variables for station 58606 are given in table 5 the best statistical indicators among each machine learning models are highlighted in bold as seen in table 5 the prediction accuracy of daily ep differed significantly depending on the model type and input combination according to the statistical values of the three machine learning models under different input combinations the rfs model on average rmse 0 51 mm d 1 nse 0 90 r2 0 90 performed much better than the gbdt model on average rmse 0 87 mm d 1 nse 0 73 r2 0 73 and m5tree model on average rmse 0 89 mm d 1 nse 0 59 r2 0 72 during training however the gbdt model on average rmse 0 97 mm d 1 nse 0 68 r2 0 68 performed slightly better than the rfs model on average rmse 1 01 mm d 1 nse 0 66 r2 0 66 and m5tree model on average rmse 1 05 mm d 1 nse 0 45 r2 0 64 during testing in general the rfs model gave better prediction accuracy than the m5tree model compared with the m5tree and gbdt models the rfs model showed much lower statistical values in the training stage while it only exhibited moderate performance in the testing stage this suggested that there was a certain extent of over fitting in the rfs model which has also been identified by fan et al 2018d for reference evaporation estimation however the mbe values in all the machine learning models during training and testing were close to zero indicating there was little over or underestimation of the measured daily ep by these models the differences in performances of the machine learning models during training and testing can be attributed to the temporal variability in the observation data between the two stages predicted values of daily ep by the three machine learning models during training and testing are also plotted against the measured values for station 58606 in fig 8 the superiority of the rfs model during training and the gbdt model during testing over the other two models were evident from the lower level of overall scatter and a better fit of the predicted data with the observed values in terms of the 1 1 line as seen from table 5 the models employing complete meteorological dataset tmax tmin rs rh sw had the best prediction accuracy for station 58606 as compared with the other incomplete data input combinations this confirmed that more input parameters generally improve the model prediction accuracy which was consistent with the previous studies wang et al 2017a b feng et al 2018 however the statistical values of machine learning models in the input combination of tmax tmin ra rh and sw on average rmse 0 83 mm d 1 nse 0 76 r2 0 78 mbe 0 01 mm d 1 were close to those with complete meteorological inputs on average rmse 0 81 mm d 1 nse 0 77 r2 0 79 mbe 0 01 mm d 1 in the testing stage the results indicated that daily ep values estimated by the tree based machine learning models were in good agreement with the measured daily ep values when lack of measured global solar radiation data in the meanwhile four input parameters when only lack of sw or rh were also enough for daily ep estimation with satisfactory accuracy during testing with the average rmse values of 0 92 mm d 1 and 1 00 mm d 1 nse values of 0 70 and 0 63 r2 values of 0 73 and 0 67 mbe values of 0 mm d 1 and 0 01 mm d 1 respectively it is notable that relative humidity was more important than wind speed besides air temperature and solar radiation for daily ep estimation in the studied region which is generally in accordance with wang et al 2016a b however this disagreed with the finding by feng et al 2018 who argued that air temperature was the most influential parameter to machine learning models across china followed by sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity average temperature has been a commonly used input to predict ep when using machine learning models kisi 2015 when only average temperature data was available the prediction accuracy of machine learning models was not good enough during testing even for the tree based m5tree model rmse 0 1 23 mm d 1 nse 0 01 r2 0 51 mbe 0 03 mm d 1 rfs model rmse 1 33 mm d 1 nse 0 43 r2 0 44 mbe 0 03 mm d 1 and gbdt model rmse 1 23 mm d 1 nse 0 51 r2 0 51 mbe 0 03 mm d 1 this indicated that more decision trees may not improve the prediction accuracy of the tree based machine learning models when the meteorological inputs are very limited when both maximum and minimum temperatures data were available the prediction accuracy was slightly better than that of that with only average temperature as input extraterrestrial solar radiation ra is the data only relevant to the geographical location and day of year incorporation of ra in temperature based machine learning models on average rmse 1 18 mm d 1 nse 0 46 r2 0 55 mbe 0 01 mm d 1 was found to further improve the prediction accuracy of daily ep during testing compared with the models with only maximum and minimum temperatures as inputs on average rmse 1 22 mm d 1 nse 0 40 r2 0 52 mbe 0 01 mm d 1 similar performances of the three tree based machine learning models were also obtained for the other 15 weather stations as indicated by the average statistical values for the 16 weather stations in table 6 3 3 comparison of empirical and tree based machine learning models from local data the performances of the four empirical models for predicting daily ep are further compared with their corresponding tree based machine learning models with the same input combinations for station 58606 in table 7 under the input combination of tmax tmin ra rh and sw the mass transfer based trabert model provided the lowest prediction accuracy rmse 1 35 mm d 1 nse 0 39 r2 0 46 mbe 0 49 mm d 1 during calibration rmse 1 31 mm d 1 nse 0 41 r2 0 48 mbe 0 53 mm d 1 during validation on the other hand the gbdt6 model rmse 0 76 mm d 1 nse 0 80 r2 0 80 mbe 0 02 mm d 1 outperformed the other two models in the testing stage under the input combinations of tmax tmin ra sw and tmax tmin rs the empirical models also had less accuracy than the corresponding machine learning models the gbdt model was predominant for daily ep estimation among all the studied empirical and machine learning models during testing fig 8 shows the scatter plots of measured versus estimated daily ep at station 58606 by the four empirical models and their corresponding machine learning models with the same input combinations the performances of machine learning models with the complete meteorological inputs were also exhibited in fig 9 for comparison purpose it is obvious from the lower level of overall scatter and higher r2 values of the fitted lines that the estimated daily ep values from the complete input combination of gbdt10 and rf10 models were much closer to the measured daily ep than those obtained under the other input combinations the lower accuracy of trabert model compared with the machine learning models can be due to the fact that there was much overestimation when the measured ep was larger than 6 mm d 1 mbe 0 53 mm d 1 especially the gbdt model had comparable good performance in estimating daily ep with the rfs model the performance of all the models followed the same trend under different input combinations it is easy to underestimate the measured ep when daily ep is less than 3 mm d 1 and overestimate when larger than 6 mm d 1 however the gbdt and rfs models exhibited the opposite trends in under and overestimation of measured ep similar performances of the empirical and tree based machine learning models were also obtained for the other 15 weather stations as indicated by the average statistical values for the 16 weather stations in table 8 generally the gbdt and rfs models showed great potential for predicting daily ep 3 4 estimation of daily pan evaporation using local input data and models trained with cross station data estimation of ep using neighboring station s meteorological data is common when local meteorological data are unrecorded or missing for many developing countries like china in this situation the meteorological data of neighboring stations can be used to estimate the local evaporation values kisi 2015 wang et al 2017a b in this study all the weather stations have subtropical humid climate and the terrain are mainly alluvial plain with some hilly regions taking the complete input combination as an example the input data from the other 15 weather stations were used in the machine leaning models to estimate daily ep by supposing station 58606 lack of historical observational data the statistical results rmse nse r2 and mbe of the m5tree rfs and gbdt models during testing are given in table 9 from table 9 the gbdt model on average rmse 0 90 mm d 1 nse 0 79 r2 0 78 mbe 0 28 mm d 1 performed slightly better than the rfs model on average rmse 0 91 mm d 1 nse 0 73 r2 0 77 mbe 0 26 mm d 1 and much better than the m5tree model on average rmse 1 01 mm d 1 nse 0 60 r2 0 71 mbe 0 22 mm d 1 with 3 6 33 3 0 increase in rmse 12 9 33 9 decrease in nse and 8 7 2 9 decrease in r2 compared with those in the local applications respectively all the five stations in the northeast 58519 58527 58626 58634 and 58637 and the four stations in the southwest 57598 58608 57793 and 57799 had rmse values less than 1 0 mm d 1 on the other hand weather stations in the south and south east exhibited larger prediction errors with rmse values of about 1 1 mm d 1 all these stations were found to be located in the hilly regions the statistical values of station 58626 were the smallest among the cross stations during testing for the m5tree model rmse 0 89 mm d 1 nse 0 70 r2 0 75 mbe 0 14 mm d 1 rfs model rmse 0 81 mm d 1 nse 0 79 r2 0 80 mbe 0 15 mm d 1 and gbdt model rmse 0 80 mm d 1 nse 0 79 r2 0 81 mbe 0 19 mm d 1 therefore station 58626 was the most suitable replacement station for station 58606 although it is not the nearest station this indicates that the reasonable selection of alternative station s data is of great important to guarantee the prediction accuracy of the proposed models the cross station applications were further considered between each of the 16 target stations and the other 15 cross stations the obtained rmse values of the gbdt models for estimating daily ep at each of the 16 target stations using local input data and models trained with cross station data application 1 in the testing stage are presented in table 10 as shown in table 10 about 75 of the obtained rmse values were increased in the cross station application 1 while the rest were decreased the changes in rmse ranged from 37 2 to 38 5 averaged at 7 7 all the 16 target stations except for stations 57598 58606 and 58813 achieved lower rmse values in cross station application 1 which indicated that models trained with local meteorological data can not necessarily produce higher prediction accuracy of daily ep due to the less reliable data quality compared with the cross station application 1 taking station 58626 as an example only the model trained with meteorological data from station 59102 produced about 5 higher rmse compared with the local application this can be likely due to the variations in meteorological data between the training and testing stages e g a 50 increase in wind speed in the testing stage 2 1 m s 1 compared with that in the training stage 1 4 m s 1 as shown in fig 2 3 5 estimation of daily pan evaporation using input data from cross station and models trained with cross station data in this scenario the machine learning models used meteorological and pan evaporation data from the other 15 weather stations except station 58606 in the training and testing stages only measured daily ep data in the testing stage were used to evaluate the performances of the models table 11 shows the statistical results of the m5tree rfs and gbdt models with complete meteorological inputs for estimating daily ep at station 58606 during testing using input data from the cross station and models trained with input and output data from the other 15 weather stations it is clear that the m5tree model performed worse than the rfs and gbdt models during testing at all 15 stations with respect to rmse on average 1 26 mm d 1 nse on average 0 26 r2 on average 0 53 mm d 1 and mbe on average 0 02 mm d 1 the prediction accuracy of the gbdt model on average rmse 1 19 mm d 1 nse 0 453 r2 0 58 mbe 0 03 mm d 1 was slightly better than that of the rfs model on average rmse 1 20 mm d 1 nse 0 53 r2 0 57 mbe 0 02 mm d 1 a comparison of tables 6 and 11 indicates that the performances of the machine learning models was significantly decreased when the local meteorological data were not used for model training and testing which was similar to the previous studies kisi 2015 karimi et al 2017 wang et al 2017a b the average statistical values of the m5tree rfs and gbdt models were close to those obtained by the machine leaning models with only local ta data as model inputs it seems that this scenario was not desirable since higher statistical errors were obtained however when meteorological data were carefully selected in weather stations such as station 58519 smaller statistical values can be also obtained by the machine learning models on average rmse 0 95 mm d 1 nse 0 68 r2 0 71 mbe 0 02 mm d 1 the cross station applications were also considered between each of the 16 target stations and the other 15 cross stations the obtained rmse values of the gbdt models with complete meteorological inputs for estimating daily ep at each of the 16 target stations using cross station input data and models trained with data from the other 15 cross stations in the testing stage are presented in table 12 as shown in table 12 the changes in rmse ranged from 0 to 56 9 averaged at 29 8 generally cross stations nearby the target station produced lower rmse values compared with further cross stations since the studied 16 weather stations were located within a watershed with similar topography and climate a relationship between distance of two stations and the increase percentage in rmse was established for the two cross station applications in figs 10 and 11 it is apparent from the figures that the increase percentage in rmse generally increased with the increase in distance of two cross stations as shown in fig 10 the median line of the increase percentage in rmse for distance less than 100 km stood at 4 6 while the median line for distance of 100 150 km was 7 6 however the median lines of the increase percentage in rmse for distances greater than 150 km were generally larger than 8 2 except for distance of 200 250 km as for cross application 2 in fig 11 the median line of the increase percentage in rmse for distance less than 100 km stood at 19 6 while the median line for distance of 100 150 km was 24 2 however the median lines of the increase percentage in rmse for distances greater than 150 km was generally larger than 30 9 except for distance of 150 200 km these results indicated that a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is highly recommended for cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy median increase percentage in rmse 5 for cross station application 1 and 20 for application 2 there is a large uncertainty in predicting daily pan evaporation for cross station distances more than 300 km which is too far for accurately modeling daily ep in the poyang lake watershed of china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates in all cases the studied four empirical models gave the inferior results compared to the three tree based machine learning models which was in good agreement with previous studies kisi 2015 wang et al 2017a b feng et al 2018 among the machine learning models the gbdt model had the best prediction accuracy in the testing stage followed by the rfs model with a slightly worse estimation however as shown in tables 5 and 6 the rfs model exhibited much larger average percentage increase in testing rmse 119 4 than the m5tree 21 9 and gbdt 16 3 models this indicated that the rfs model showed the least instability as it produced significant decrease in prediction accuracy when new meteorological data were applied the m5tree model was much worse than the above two models the linear structure of m5tree model with only one decision tree prevents it from accurately modeling the highly nonlinear ep process kisi 2015 since the rfs and gbdt models have more decision trees it can better explain the nonlinear process in different situations the better performance of the gbdt model compared with the rfs model can be due to a wiser strategy for calculating pan evaporation the rfs model estimated daily ep based on the mean value of different decision trees while the gbdt was based on the weight averaged value of different decision trees where a smaller weight was assigned to the decision tree with a larger residual considering the complexity level of the discussed models their accuracy and stability the gbdt model is highly recommended for predicting daily ep by showing the best combination of prediction accuracy and model stability a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is recommended for the two cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy in the studied region and elsewhere with similar climates but the acceptable cross station distance may vary in different climates and this needs to be further investigated in the future 4 conclusions in this study the daily ep was estimated in the poyang lake watershed of china using four empirical models along with three tree based ensemble models including m5 model tree m5tree random forests rfs and gradient boosting decision tree gbdt the results showed that the radiation based priestley taylor exhibited the best performance for daily ep estimation among the four empirical models while the mass transfer based trabert model performed worst take extraterrestrial solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures as inputs had better performance than only temperature as input in the first part of the study local applications the gbdt models were found to be better than the rfs and m5tree models in estimating daily ep of the 16 stations in terms of rmse nse r2 and mbe in addition the gbdt model exhibited the best model stability with the smallest average percentage increase in testing rmse 16 3 compared with that of the m5tree 21 9 and rfs 119 4 models the results revealed that the gbdt could be successfully used in estimating daily ep in all three different situations with the best combination of accuracy and stability a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is highly recommended for cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy median increase percentage in rmse 5 for cross application 1 and 20 for application 2 in the poyang lake watershed of china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates acknowledgement this study was jointly supported by the sci tech program by

6968,the climate change is an important event that affects hydrological agricultural and water resources planning variables and therefore the hydrologists and meteorologists frequently try to identify

to detect and illustrate stability of trends through alternatively suggested versions as double ita d ita and triple ita t ita of the ita and also partial mk test in annual rainfall data for many stations in turkey this alternatives help to decide about the stability of trend components for this purpose trends in 72 year and 80 year time series are illustrated with ita and then the stability of trends are shown by means of d ita and t ita methods in addition the trend detection parameters obtained by classical and partial mk test are given in a table for comparison purposes 2 methodology trend definition in hydrologic meteorological water quality air quality and etc time series has received considerable attention since two three decades mk sen s slope and linear regression trend tests are commonly implemented for trend identifications in meteorological hydrological and in any time series recently şen s ita attached with visual attention became widely used in different parts of the world in this study trend determination is presented according to mk mann 1945 kendall 1975 ita şen 2012 2014 and additionally partial mk test d ita and t ita approaches generally trend tests are made by the well known mk method it is a statistical procedure for trend possibility identifications in this approach the differences between each sequential value are calculated so as to depict increasing 1 decreasing 1 and neutral 0 signs sgn which is defined as follows 1 sgn x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 0 if x j x k 0 1 if x j x k 0 where xj and xk are time series values at jth and kth time instances in n observations additionally the kendall sum statistic s is given below 2 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k it is clear that depending on s value as s 0 s 0 decreasing increasing a monotonic trend is identified in the time series another statistical parameter for the mk trend test is the standard z value given as 3 z s 1 v s for s 0 0 for s 0 s 1 v s for s 0 in this expression v s is variance and in case of tied ranks it is given as 4 v s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where m is the number of tied groups and ti is the number of observations in the ith group if there is no dependence then v s can be obtained via 5 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 the trend is considered insignificant if z is less than the confidence levels α 5 but significant if z zα 2 1 96 on the other hand hypothesis h0 for the significant trend rejection is valid whereas acceptance is considered for no trend case the partial mk trend test procedure is suggested in this study and used with classical full type together if any full time series are called 6t mk approach can be applied fully or the first 4t and the last 4t or the first 3t the middle 3t and the last 3t parts fig 1 later the stability of average trend condition for full time series can be explained as stable or instable any trend component is stable if full and partial time series have the same trend type otherwise instability appears stability or instability feature is valid for simple and multiple ita procedures as for the ita any given time series are divided into two parts as the previous the first and the next the second halves which are ranked in ascending or descending order subsequently the scatter diagram between the ordered values of the two series is obtained on equal scale sizes on both vertical and horizontal axes and finally 1 1 straight line which is the main structure of the ita if all of the scatter points fall on the 1 1 straight line or with insignificantly random deviations from the line then no significant trend decision can be made for the time series otherwise there is a significant trend so in the case of the scatter points above below the line there is a significant increasing decreasing trend all the trend possibilities are shown in fig 2 using random data as a result there are five possible different trend conditions as trendless time series monotonic positive trend monotonic negative trend non monotonic positive trend and non monotonic negative trend ita gives exceptionally good information about trend for time series data and it shows the trend in time series on the average hence in order to have information about trends on partial bases ita can be employed straight forwardly in this paper two different graphical methods are used and their steps are as follows similar to the ita first any time series data are temporally divided into three 1 3 or four 1 4 sub series later each part is ranked into ascending or descending order in case of three parts the d ita method is used in this approach two scattering are plotted on a single diagram where the first part versus the second and the second part versus the third finally trend conditions from the first to the second part and from the second to the third part are displayed separately the scatter diagram is obtained by considering the first part data on the horizontal axis and the second on the vertical axis for the first scattering case the second part data are placed on the horizontal axis and the third part data on the vertical axis on the same diagram as a result any time series even with monotonically increasing trend on ita diagram but the same trend can be stable or instable according to d ita approach fig 3 the same conditions are valid for other trend types as for t ita method for accurate stability analysis of trend three scattering groups are plotted on the same diagram as the first quarter versus the second part the second quarter versus the third part and so on and finally trend conditions are displayed separately as a result any time series with monotonically increasing trend on ita diagram can be stable or instable through t ita fig 4 the same conditions are valid for other trend types if d ita and t ita are applied with şen s method ita all trend analyses can be interpreted in a better way first the average trend is determined with ita for time series and then d ita or t ita is used to determine the stability of trend d ita and t ita show trend conditions part by part especially in cases of unstable trend additionally if partial mk test as proposed in this study is used with full mk trend test then the trend is determined on the average and the stability of trend or trendless case can be determined 3 study area and data sources turkey is one of the countries that have various types of climate and four seasons during one year four climate types prevail in the country because it is located between the sub tropical and temperate zone first mediterranean climate is dominant in the mediterranean and aegean regions the most prominent feature of this climate type is that it is dry hot in summers and rainy warm in winter second all seasons along the black sea coast are rainy and sea effects are strongly felt because of the black sea climate throughout the year the region is under the influence of the moist air mass third the coastal areas surrounding the marmara sea which connects the aegean sea and the black sea have a transitional climate between mediterranean and black sea types with warm to hot moderately dry summers and cool to cold wet winters finally continental climate type is seen in central anatolia eastern anatolia and a large part of southeast anatolia summer seasons are dry hot but winter seasons are snowy cold the data used in the paper are taken from turkish meteorological service mgm for full and partial mk ita d ita and t ita applications tables 1 and 2 and fig 5 the measurements are selected from 24 meteorological stations from different regions of turkey and the applications are achieved for the annual rainfall data among all the stations 16 have 72 year 1939 2010 rainfall data table 1 for d ita and two part mk and 8 stations of 80 year 1931 2010 rainfall data table 2 are for t ita and three part mk in fig 5 blue symbols are put to specify 72 year data stations and green symbols are for the other stations data for d ita are divided into three parts including 24 year measurements and t ita s data have four quarters each with 20 year measurements 4 results ita versus full mk 6t d ita versus two part mk 4t 4t and t ita versus three part mk 3t 3t 3t are compared with each other first full and two part mk trend test are applied to 72 year data table 3 presents minimum maximum mean standard deviation mk test statistic s calculated z values and trend conditions obtained for 72 year records mk test according to critical z value 1 96 α 5 it is obvious that rize is the wettest city while konya falls into arid region on the other hand mk test assessment does not show any significant trend excluding kastamonu station with an increasing trend however two part mk test for the first 48 year 1939 1986 of 72 year 1939 2010 data shows only one decreasing trend at rize station table 4 along the second 48 year 1963 2010 data giresun station has an increasing trend only table 5 detected trend on kastamonu rize and giresun stations data can be defined as monotonic type but ita d ita and t ita can detect trend not only monotonic but also non monotonic type additionally some trend conditions which could not be revealed by mk test may be shown by ita methods hereafter ita and d ita are implemented to 72 year data each figure includes ita diagram on left hand side and d ita diagram on right hand side fig 6 is for florya istanbul meteorological station total rainfall data it is clearly seen that non monotonic positive trend case appears according to ita if the same data is analyzed with d ita the current trend is stable for antalya s data stability is observed at high values generally but there is unstable condition at low values fig 7 fig 8 has emphasized conspicuously the importance of d ita because the result according to ita is generally in the form of non monotonic negative trend but d ita shows dominantly negative trend from the first to the second term and positive trend from the second to the third term as for the situation in izmir station it is seen that stable trendless condition appears based on both methods fig 9 it is possible to mention a general stability at low and moderate values of şanlıurfa data although negative trends in high values according to ita d ita determines a positive trend for blue points and a negative trend for orange points so there is no stability fig 10 instability is completely dominant at for konya station fig 11 in fig 12 it is seen that stable non monotonic negative trend condition arises based on ita and d ita approach in figs 13 and 14 all time series have trend from the first to the second part and the second to the third part reversely especially time series for rize station analyzed by ita method has non monotonic negative trend but the improved method shows the opposite trends for both parts after all it is understood trough ita and d ita applications for time series that there can be some instability in trend additionally the remaining 7 stations from figs 15 21 emphasize importance of using ita and d ita method together the following results are found as unstable many times in a manner similar to the above analyses because d ita generally shows dominant instabilities in most of the time series also ita methods detected some important information hidden by mk method as the length of time series increases three part mk test methodology may be a better logical option for accurate stability test fully mk test assessment does not show any significant trend table 6 likely three part mk test for the first 40 year 1931 1970 of 80 year 1931 2010 data and the middle 40 year 1951 1990 data do not show any trend again tables 7 and 8 however on the last 40 year 1971 2010 data tekirdağ kırşehir and karaman have no trend with the stability table 9 excluding malatya station s data sinop samsun afyon and kars stations data include increasing trend also t ita methodology may be a better logical option for accurate stability test like three mk test as the length of time series increases in the current phase the applications with t ita and ita using 80 year data 1931 2010 are represented and superiority of t ita is displayed with comparative analyses hereafter each figure includes ita diagram on left hand side and t ita diagram on right hand side middle and high values have trendless condition while low values have negative decreasing trend according to ita in fig 22 however t ita s partial results show some instability in the average trend by ita from the first to the second quarter the scatter points are similar to ita s but there are negative trends from the second to the third quarter part and a positive increasing trend from the third to the fourth quarter part by t ita except for fig 28 with stable trendless time series all of the following figures figs 23 27 and 29 show clearly unstable trend conditions as a result average trends are obtained by ita method and stability of trends are described by d ita or t ita partially 5 discussion and conclusion mk test method mann 1945 kendall 1975 detects monotonic average trend only but it is important that partial mk tests proposed in this paper reveal some hidden trends in long time series according to the average trend via full mk test hence stability of trends is described by two or three part mk trend test also ita method şen 2012 is very useful to determine and visualize average trend in order to get more information about the trend can be obtained by means of ita itself partially the important steps have been taken by öztopal and şen 2017 şen 2017b and mohorji et al 2017 for this solution they have mached the first part with the others dividing the time series into different parts also tabari et al 2017 have divided the time series into decades according to the quantile perturbation method and compared each part with following part all of the researchers have presented their studies without comparison with classical full mk new partial mk trend tests and simple ita additionally they have not mentioned stability or instability of the trends in this study the time series are divided into three or four parts for detailed analysis maching each part with following one and stability of trends are shown by d ita or t ita it is obvious that comparing with simple ita shows stabilities or instabilities in trends clearly kastamonu rize and giresun stations precipitation data have instabilities in trend conditions but the others have no trend and stable according to full and two part mk tests ita and d ita are implemented to 72 year data together florya istanbul station data has stable non monotonic positive trend but antalya s data is observed with unstable condition at low values the trend for giresun station in the form of unstable non monotonic negative trend and izmir station s measurements have stable trendless condition şanlıurfa and konya station values appear with unstable trend conditions however stable non monotonic negative trend is evident for erzurum data lastly d ita identify instabilities although there are different trend forms in the remaining stations niğde rize edirne muğla antep kastamonu çanakkale van and adana tekirdağ kırşehir and karaman stations precipitation data have stability on trendless condition but the others have unstable trend according to fully and three part mk tests ita and t ita are applied to 80 year data together like fully and three part mk tests and all of the stations measurements have unstable trend conditions except for kırşehir data with stable trendless time series ita method determines the trends in more detail such as monotonic or non monotonic according to fully mk trend test the same is true for that d ita and t ita methods versus partial mk methods the conclusion to be drawn from this work is that ita and mk methods can be used to obtain average trend of time series d ita and two part mk test are useful for stability test of the same time series but it is real that t ita and three part mk test are the most appropriate method for more accurate stability analysis

observations additionally the kendall sum statistic s is given below 2 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k it is clear that depending on s value as s 0 s 0 decreasing increasing a monotonic trend is identified in the time series another statistical parameter for the mk trend test is the standard z value given as 3 z s 1 v s for s 0 0 for s 0 s 1 v s for s 0 in this expression v s is variance and in case of tied ranks it is given as 4 v s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where m is the number of tied groups and ti is the number of observations in the ith group if there is no dependence then v s can be obtained via 5 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 the trend is considered insignificant if z is less than the confidence levels α 5 but significant if z zα 2 1 96 on the other hand hypothesis h0 for the significant trend rejection is valid whereas acceptance is considered for no trend case the partial mk trend test procedure is suggested in this study and used with classical full type together if any full time series are called 6t mk approach can be applied fully or the first 4t and the last 4t or the first 3t the middle 3t and the last 3t parts fig 1 later the stability of average trend condition for full time series can be explained as stable or instable any trend component is stable if full and partial time series have the same trend type otherwise instability appears stability or instability feature is valid for simple and multiple ita procedures as for the ita any given time series are divided into two parts as the previous the first and the next the second halves which are ranked in ascending or descending order subsequently the scatter diagram between the ordered values of the two series is obtained on equal scale sizes on both vertical and horizontal axes and finally 1 1 straight line which is the main structure of the ita if all of the scatter points fall on the 1 1 straight line or with insignificantly random deviations from the line then no significant trend decision can be made for the time series otherwise there is a significant trend so in the case of the scatter points above below the line there is a significant increasing decreasing trend all the trend possibilities are shown in fig 2 using random data as a result there are five possible different trend conditions as trendless time series monotonic positive trend monotonic negative trend non monotonic positive trend and non monotonic negative trend ita gives exceptionally good information about trend for time series data and it shows the trend in time series on the average hence in order to have information about trends on partial bases ita can be employed straight forwardly in this paper two different graphical methods are used and their steps are as follows similar to the ita first any time series data are temporally divided into three 1 3 or four 1 4 sub series later each part is ranked into ascending or descending order in case of three parts the d ita method is used in this approach two scattering are plotted on a single diagram where the first part versus the second and the second part versus the third finally trend conditions from the first to the second part and from the second to the third part are displayed separately the scatter diagram is obtained by considering the first part data on the horizontal axis and the second on the vertical axis for the first scattering case the second part data are placed on the horizontal axis and the third part data on the vertical axis on the same diagram as a result any time series even with monotonically increasing trend on ita diagram but the same trend can be stable or instable according to d ita approach fig 3 the same conditions are valid for other trend types as for t ita method for accurate stability analysis of trend three scattering groups are plotted on the same diagram as the first quarter versus the second part the second quarter versus the third part and so on and finally trend conditions are displayed separately as a result any time series with monotonically increasing trend on ita diagram can be stable or instable through t ita fig 4 the same conditions are valid for other trend types if d ita and t ita are applied with şen s method ita all trend analyses can be interpreted in a better way first the average trend is determined with ita for time series and then d ita or t ita is used to determine the stability of trend d ita and t ita show trend conditions part by part especially in cases of unstable trend additionally if partial mk test as proposed in this study is used with full mk trend test then the trend is determined on the average and the stability of trend or trendless case can be determined 3 study area and data sources turkey is one of the countries that have various types of climate and four seasons during one year four climate types prevail in the country because it is located between the sub tropical and temperate zone first mediterranean climate is dominant in the mediterranean and aegean regions the most prominent feature of this climate type is that it is dry hot in summers and rainy warm in winter second all seasons along the black sea coast are rainy and sea effects are strongly felt because of the black sea climate throughout the year the region is under the influence of the moist air mass third the coastal areas surrounding the marmara sea which connects the aegean sea and the black sea have a transitional climate between mediterranean and black sea types with warm to hot moderately dry summers and cool to cold wet winters finally continental climate type is seen in central anatolia eastern anatolia and a large part of southeast anatolia summer seasons are dry hot but winter seasons are snowy cold the data used in the paper are taken from turkish meteorological service mgm for full and partial mk ita d ita and t ita applications tables 1 and 2 and fig 5 the measurements are selected from 24 meteorological stations from different regions of turkey and the applications are achieved for the annual rainfall data among all the stations 16 have 72 year 1939 2010 rainfall data table 1 for d ita and two part mk and 8 stations of 80 year 1931 2010 rainfall data table 2 are for t ita and three part mk in fig 5 blue symbols are put to specify 72 year data stations and green symbols are for the other stations data for d ita are divided into three parts including 24 year measurements and t ita s data have four quarters each with 20 year measurements 4 results ita versus full mk 6t d ita versus two part mk 4t 4t and t ita versus three part mk 3t 3t 3t are compared with each other first full and two part mk trend test are applied to 72 year data table 3 presents minimum maximum mean standard deviation mk test statistic s calculated z values and trend conditions obtained for 72 year records mk test according to critical z value 1 96 α 5 it is obvious that rize is the wettest city while konya falls into arid region on the other hand mk test assessment does not show any significant trend excluding kastamonu station with an increasing trend however two part mk test for the first 48 year 1939 1986 of 72 year 1939 2010 data shows only one decreasing trend at rize station table 4 along the second 48 year 1963 2010 data giresun station has an increasing trend only table 5 detected trend on kastamonu rize and giresun stations data can be defined as monotonic type but ita d ita and t ita can detect trend not only monotonic but also non monotonic type additionally some trend conditions which could not be revealed by mk test may be shown by ita methods hereafter ita and d ita are implemented to 72 year data each figure includes ita diagram on left hand side and d ita diagram on right hand side fig 6 is for florya istanbul meteorological station total rainfall data it is clearly seen that non monotonic positive trend case appears according to ita if the same data is analyzed with d ita the current trend is stable for antalya s data stability is observed at high values generally but there is unstable condition at low values fig 7 fig 8 has emphasized conspicuously the importance of d ita because the result according to ita is generally in the form of non monotonic negative trend but d ita shows dominantly negative trend from the first to the second term and positive trend from the second to the third term as for the situation in izmir station it is seen that stable trendless condition appears based on both methods fig 9 it is possible to mention a general stability at low and moderate values of şanlıurfa data although negative trends in high values according to ita d ita determines a positive trend for blue points and a negative trend for orange points so there is no stability fig 10 instability is completely dominant at for konya station fig 11 in fig 12 it is seen that stable non monotonic negative trend condition arises based on ita and d ita approach in figs 13 and 14 all time series have trend from the first to the second part and the second to the third part reversely especially time series for rize station analyzed by ita method has non monotonic negative trend but the improved method shows the opposite trends for both parts after all it is understood trough ita and d ita applications for time series that there can be some instability in trend additionally the remaining 7 stations from figs 15 21 emphasize importance of using ita and d ita method together the following results are found as unstable many times in a manner similar to the above analyses because d ita generally shows dominant instabilities in most of the time series also ita methods detected some important information hidden by mk method as the length of time series increases three part mk test methodology may be a better logical option for accurate stability test fully mk test assessment does not show any significant trend table 6 likely three part mk test for the first 40 year 1931 1970 of 80 year 1931 2010 data and the middle 40 year 1951 1990 data do not show any trend again tables 7 and 8 however on the last 40 year 1971 2010 data tekirdağ kırşehir and karaman have no trend with the stability table 9 excluding malatya station s data sinop samsun afyon and kars stations data include increasing trend also t ita methodology may be a better logical option for accurate stability test like three mk test as the length of time series increases in the current phase the applications with t ita and ita using 80 year data 1931 2010 are represented and superiority of t ita is displayed with comparative analyses hereafter each figure includes ita diagram on left hand side and t ita diagram on right hand side middle and high values have trendless condition while low values have negative decreasing trend according to ita in fig 22 however t ita s partial results show some instability in the average trend by ita from the first to the second quarter the scatter points are similar to ita s but there are negative trends from the second to the third quarter part and a positive increasing trend from the third to the fourth quarter part by t ita except for fig 28 with stable trendless time series all of the following figures figs 23 27 and 29 show clearly unstable trend conditions as a result average trends are obtained by ita method and stability of trends are described by d ita or t ita partially 5 discussion and conclusion mk test method mann 1945 kendall 1975 detects monotonic average trend only but it is important that partial mk tests proposed in this paper reveal some hidden trends in long time series according to the average trend via full mk test hence stability of trends is described by two or three part mk trend test also ita method şen 2012 is very useful to determine and visualize average trend in order to get more information about the trend can be obtained by means of ita itself partially the important steps have been taken by öztopal and şen 2017 şen 2017b and mohorji et al 2017 for this solution they have mached the first part with the others dividing the time series into different parts also tabari et al 2017 have divided the time series into decades according to the quantile perturbation method and compared each part with following part all of the researchers have presented their studies without comparison with classical full mk new partial mk trend tests and simple ita additionally they have not mentioned stability or instability of the trends in this study the time series are divided into three or four parts for detailed analysis maching each part with following one and stability of trends are shown by d ita or t ita it is obvious that comparing with simple ita shows stabilities or instabilities in trends clearly kastamonu rize and giresun stations precipitation data have instabilities in trend conditions but the others have no trend and stable according to full and two part mk tests ita and d ita are implemented to 72 year data together florya istanbul station data has stable non monotonic positive trend but antalya s data is observed with unstable condition at low values the trend for giresun station in the form of unstable non monotonic negative trend and izmir station s measurements have stable trendless condition şanlıurfa and konya station values appear with unstable trend conditions however stable non monotonic negative trend is evident for erzurum data lastly d ita identify instabilities although there are different trend forms in the remaining stations niğde rize edirne muğla antep kastamonu çanakkale van and adana tekirdağ kırşehir and karaman stations precipitation data have stability on trendless condition but the others have unstable trend according to fully and three part mk tests ita and t ita are applied to 80 year data together like fully and three part mk tests and all of the stations measurements have unstable trend conditions except for kırşehir data with stable trendless time series ita method determines the trends in more detail such as monotonic or non monotonic according to fully mk trend test the same is true for that d ita and t ita methods versus partial mk methods the conclusion to be drawn from this work is that ita and mk methods can be used to obtain average trend of time series d ita and two part mk test are useful for stability test of the same time series but it is real that t ita and three part mk test are the most appropriate method for more accurate stability analysis 
6969,this study was conducted to evaluate the performance of temperature based models i e temperature based penman monteith fao 56 fed with average wind speed u value tpmu and default u quantity tpm2 hargreaves samani hs and fao blaney criddle fbc against penman monteith fao 56 pm using data recorded in 1993 2015 at 146 sites over iran two statistics i e normalized root mean square nrmse and relative mean bias error rmbe were calculated to analyze the absolute error and bias magnitude of the temperature based et0 estimation respectively except for the december january february djf the models gave reliable seasonal estimates i e nrmse of 30 for the majority of studied areas at monthly scale fbc gave poor estimates of et0 in djf for more than 60 of semi arid and sub humid humid sites et0 in december and january was not also modeled reliably by tpm2 for 61 and 52 of the semi arid and sub humid humid sites respectively hence application of fbc and tpm2 appears not to be recommendable in cold areas and months over iran overall tpmu and hs are better suited at all temporal scales under data limitation over the studied areas in the case of data availability calculation of tpm with local average u instead of default quantity of 2 m s 1 is highly likely to improve the estimation accuracy seasonal and monthly et0 were mostly underestimated over the hyper arid arid sites during the march april may mam and june july august jja however tpm2 and hs overestimated et0 for the majority of semi arid and sub humid humid areas the u anomalies were identified as the primary contributing factor to the error in temperature based et0 estimation for most cases tpm2 hs and fbc provided more accurate estimates for the u range of 1 5 2 5 m s 1 these findings are of significant practical importance for agricultural hydrological and climatic studies and applications under data sparse condition keywords crop water demand irrigation scheduling temperature based et0

designing and managing irrigation schemes irmak et al 2006 jensen and allen 2016 shiri 2018 furthermore et0 estimates are of a great importance for determining watershed scale evapotranspiration and preparing inputs of hydrological models gong et al 2006 not varying with soil physical characteristics and water availability et0 is only function of climatic variables and represents atmosphere s evaporative demand allen et al 1998 therefore investigating long term et0 variability and dynamics discloses invaluable information and understanding of past and future climate change nouri et al 2018 wang et al 2013 in order to avoid ambiguity and complexity allen et al 1998 defined et0 as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop which has an assumed height of 12 cm a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 greatly resembling evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass with uniform height actively growing well watered and completely shading the ground based on the assumptions considered for the reference surface allen et al 1998 proposed a robust model namely the penman monteith fao 56 pm based on the original penman monteith equation although pm has been successfully employed to calculate et0 worldwide allen et al 2006 milly and dunne 2016 pereira et al 2015 todorovic et al 2013 it needs substantial sets of data including solar radiation sr wind speed u minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax and relative humidity rh such comprehensive datasets may however be unavailable or of poor quality jensen et al 1997 trajkovic 2005 solar radiation or sunshine hour data are not always available or of acceptable quality jensen et al 1997 for instance the sunshine duration data are commonly missing in the period of 1979 1982 in iran further measuring rh by electronic sensors is a demanding task and prone to inherent error arising from hysteresis nonlinearity and calibration allen 1996 moreover rh data acquired over non reference sites including most weather stations in water limited regions are plagued by bias allen 1996 jensen et al 1997 recording u may be also site specific and unreliable in particular under extreme conditions allen 1996 jensen et al 1997 additionally et0 estimates are required in irrigated farms in which the rh u and sr data are mostly lacking particularly for developing countries allen and pruitt 1986 maeda et al 2011 temperature based equations have been therefore developed to model et0 based merely on available temperature data abtew and melesse 2013 trajkovic 2005 some studies have been also carried out to assess the accuracy of temperature based et0 equations against pm or lysimeter measurements in different climates geographic conditions and scales aguilar

precipitation alizadeh and keshavarz 2005 around 92 of agricultural outputs are produced in irrigated lands which clearly illustrates the vital role of irrigation in maintenance of food security in iran ministry of agriculture 2016 although agriculture sector accounts for approximately 92 of water consumption in iran the average irrigation efficiency is pretty low around 35 and only around 5 of cultivated areas are currently under pressurized irrigation madani 2014 thus increasing water productivity through promoting efficient irrigation systems is highly desired besides the issue of efficiency there is an urgent need to take real water saving and evaporation control measures over the country which is experiencing climate change and growing population madani 2014 nouri et al 2017a these actions and strategies require a robust estimation of et0 hargreaves and allen 2003 maeda et al 2011 in practice et0 may not however be modeled and mapped with a reliable scale based on pm due to sparse distribution of stations recording the needed inputs over iran in addition missing or poor quality data particularly for sr are obstacle for calculating pm with an acceptable level of accuracy for some regions hence there is a need for a comprehensive assessment of temperature based et0 estimation over iran there are some studies conducted to evaluate the accuracy of temperature based et0 models in iran farzanpour et al 2018 fooladmand 2011 kiafar et al 2016 raziei and pereira 2013 tabari et al 2011 valipour 2014 in addition improvement in accuracy of temperature based et0 estimates in iran has been attempted by several investigators e g raziei and pereira 2013 shiri et al 2014 shiri et al 2015 tabari and talaee 2011 most of these analyses have been performed at a regional scale one or two province s e g farzanpour et al 2018 fooladmand 2011 tabari and talaee 2011 or considered limited number of sites over iran raziei and pereira 2013 valipour 2014 also addressed the performance of some temperature based methods against pm using data for 181 locations across iran although this work seems to consider adequate stations it lacks the monthly and seasonal and contribution analyses it is noteworthy that clearer and more informative results can be obtained by studying monthly and seasonal temperature based et0 estimation aguilar and polo 2011 in addition the performance of temperature based penman monteith fao 56 tpm against pm has not been assessed by valipour 2014 therefore the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of four temperature based et0 models i e the hargreaves samani hs fao blaney criddle fbc and two variants of tpm with relative to pm over 146 sites in iran moreover the contribution of mean temperature tmean u rh and rs to the residuals the differences between et0 values estimated by pm and temperature based methods was also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area and data iran is a country lying in the southwest asia and has a high climate diversity chiefly owing to the existence of two mountain ranges i e the alborz in the north and the zagros in the west humid and sub humid climates mainly dominate along the southern coast of the caspian sea fig 1 the climate of western half and northeast of iran is mostly semi arid however a hyper arid arid climate prevails in the central southeastern southern and eastern iran fig 1 the geographic properties and numbers names of 146 stations investigated are given in fig 1 and table 1 it should be noted that the aridity index ai used for climate classification was determined based on unep 1997 i e the ratio of precipitation to the pm calculated et0 if ai value equals to 0 05 0 05 0 20 0 20 0 50 0 50 0 65 0 65 1 00 and 1 00

interpolation method monthly meteorological data recorded at 146 stations including precipitation tmin tmax u rh and rs were obtained from the iran meteorological organization irimo in 1993 2015 to

can be approximated on the basis of assumption of tmin tdew dew point temperature allen et al 1998 3 e a 0 611 exp 17 27 t min t min 237 3 the assumption of tmin tdew may not however be valid for arid and semi arid environments wherein the atmosphere might not be fully saturated when air temperature is minimum and a correction for the relationship seems thus to be necessary in hyper arid arid semi arid and dry sub humid regions the following relationships were respectively employed tdew tmin 4 tdew tmin 2 tdew tmin 1 and tdew tmin 1 tdew was considered to be equal to tmin at moist sub humid and humid areas allen et al 1998 in the case of absence of u data the value of 2 m s 1 average of u for 2000 stations on the globe can be used allen et al 1998 furthermore application of local long term average u value instead of default value of 2 m s 1 was recommended in the hydrology literature djaman et al 2017 raziei and pereira 2013 rojas and sheffield 2013 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 using eqs 2 and 3 and magnitude of 2 m s 1 or local average for u eq 1 can estimate et0 with only temperature data in the current study temperature based penman monteith fao 56 fed with local average u and the value of 2 m s 1 were hereafter referred to as tpmu and tpm2 respectively the hs equation is as follows hargreaves and samani 1985 4 e t 0 0 0135 k rs r a t max t min 0 5 t m e a n 17 8 doorenbos

and allen 2016 2 3 quantitative evaluation the performance of the temperature based models relative to pm was assessed using normalized root mean square error nrmse and relative means bias error rmbe the mathematical expressions of these statistics are 6 nrmse 100 o i 1 n s i o i 2 n 7 rmbe 100 o 1 n i 1 n s i o i where si denotes et0 calculated using the temperature based methods oi is the pm estimated et0 value si oi is the residual in temperature based estimation o represents the average pm estimated et0 and n is the number of comparisons the nrmse is frequently utilized to quantify the absolute error of estimation nouri et al 2016 babaeian et al 2015 the model performance is considered perfect when nrmse is 10 good if nrmse is between 10 and 20 fair if nrmse ranges between 20 and 30 and poor unreliable if nrmse exceeds 30 dettori et al 2011 ku et al 2018 the rmbe is an index quantifying the model bias and systematic error and its negative positive values show the model s tendency to underestimate overestimate nouri et al 2017b if the estimations are equivalent to the observations si oi the model performance is excellent and the magnitude of rmbe and nrmse statistics are equal to 0 0 in order to carry out the contribution analysis the correlation coefficient between the residual values si oi and the rh rs u and tmean anomalies x i x was determined the anomalies in the most contributing factor to the absolute error of the temperature based et0 estimation correlate more strongly with the residuals 3 results and discussion during the december january february djf season the performance of tpm2 tpmu hs and fbc was poor i e nrmse of 30 for 30 12 10 and 27 of the hyper arid arid and 48 15 15 and 64 of the semi arid and sub humid humid areas respectively fig 2 1 to 2 4 tpm2 estimated et0 inaccurately in january and december for about 43 and 53 of sites respectively fig 5 a and 5 b furthermore the nrmse of fbc estimates in january february and december was greater than 30 at 60 40 and 65 of investigated areas respectively thus monthly et0 seems not to be modeled robustly based on fbc and tpm2 in djf the sites in which the nrmse of fbc and tpm2 was greater than 30 were majorly located in the western half center and northeast of the country figs 2 1 and 2 4 and figs 1 1 1 4 1 5 1 8 1 45 and 1 48 in supplementary material hs and tpmu however surpassed the other two models at most cases particularly those located in cold semi arid areas figs 2 2 and 2 3 figs 1 2 1 3 1 6 1 7 1 46 and 1 47 in supplementary material using tpmu decreased the nrmse value to less than 30 for approximately 73 65 94 and 44 of sites in which tpm2 estimated et0 unreliably i e nrmse of 30 in djf season january february and december respectively it can be thus concluded that considering local average of winter u instead of default value of 2 m s 1 noticeably improved the performance of tpm in wintertime particularly for the semi arid regions however when long term u data are lacking hs seems to be better suited to model et0 based on temperature data in djf season and months under non ideal circumstances growth of autumn sown crops in particular rainfed cereals predominantly cultivated in semi arid drylands and wintertime hydrological processes seem hence to be simulated with greater accuracy by using hs and tpmu for most sites tpm2 and tpmu had an overall tendency of overestimation while fbc tended to underestimate seasonal and monthly et0 over djf figs 3 1 3 2 3 4 5 c and 5 d tpm2 and tpmu significantly overestimated i e rmbe of 15 the djf et0 over the studied semi arid environments and arid northeastern regions and fbc considerably underestimated i e rmbe of 15 in these areas an overall tendency to over or underestimate seasonal and monthly et0 was however not found for hs during winter figs 3 3 5 a and 5 d a stronger correlation existed between the residuals of tpms and hs and the u anomalies over djf season december january and february in more than 85 76 76 and 58 of stations figs 4 1 to 4 3 5 e and 5 f tpm2 poorly estimated winter et0 over the northeastern northwestern and western semi arid and northern sub humid humid areas with winter u of 1 3 m s 1 however the residual of fbc had a closer association with the tmean anomalies in 79 77 86 and 68 of the semi arid and sub humid humid regions over djf season december january and february figs 4 4 and 5 f therefore the tmean variations appear to be the most significant cause of error in estimation of seasonal and monthly et0 by fbc over the semi arid and sub humid humid areas in wintertime fbc showed a weak performance in estimating wintertime et0 for almost all sites with winter tmean of 3 co mainly located in the western northwestern and northeastern iran seasonal et0 was estimated weakly i e nrmse of 30 by the temperature based models at 5 of the hyper arid arid and 10 of the semi arid and sub humid humid sites fig 2 5 to 2 8 over the march april may mam on the monthly scale the performance of temperature based models was reliable i e nrmse of 30 for more than 82 of stations fig 5 a nad 5 b overall tpms and hs seem to produce better results at the monthly and seasonal scales in mam although fbc modeled seasonal et0 with an acceptable accuracy at the majority of locations its poor performance in estimating et0 in march at about 28 of the semi arid and sub humid humid areas implies that this model may not provide accurate monthly estimates over mam in these regions the models of tpms and hs underestimated seasonal and monthly et0 at 65 or more of the hyper arid arid sites figs 3 5 to 3 7 and 5 c in mam as to semi arid and sub humid humid areas springtime et0 was however mainly overestimated by hs and tpm2 whereas fbc and tpmu predominantly underestimated it figs 3 5 to 3 8 and 5 d for the majority of stations the greatest absolute correlation coefficients were determined between the u anomalies and the residuals figs 4 5 to 4 8 5 e and 5 f however for some western and northwestern stations the residual in seasonal and monthly estimation was associated more highly with the rh changes in mam figs 4 5 to 4 8 and figs 3 9 to 3 20 in supplementary material in addition the tmean variability was observed to be the most influential on the fbc s error over northern sub humid humid regions during mam season march and april figs 4 8 and figs 3 12 and 3 16 in supplementary material seasonal and monthly et0 were not reliably modeled i e nrmse of 30 by means of the temperature based models in 18 of the hyper arid arid areas and 9 of the semi arid and sub humid humid sites during the june july august jja figs 2 9 to 2 12 5 a and 5 b overall the temperature based models gave a better estimate of summer et0 over the semi arid and sub humid humid regions relative to the hyper arid arid environments moreover application of tpmu resulted in a decrease of nrmse to less than 30 at 38 50 23 and 23 of stations in which tpm2 s performance was poor i e nrmse of 30 during jja season june july and august respectively for more than 65 of the hyper arid arid sites there was a tendency towards underestimation of the summertime et0 by the temperature based equations figs 3 9 to 3 12 and 5 c in the semi arid sites fbc and tpms mostly overestimated and underestimated seasonal and monthly et0 over jja respectively figs 3 9 3 10 3 12 and 5 d hs and fbc also tended to overestimate the summertime et0 for most sub humid humid locations the variation in u was found to be the most contributing factor to the residuals over the hyper arid arid and semi arid areas figs 4 9 to 4 12 5 e and 5 f for most costal sub humid humid stations of the caspian sea in the north and arid sites located in the oman sea and the persian gulf coastal strip in the south other controlling factors i e tmean rh and sr had the greatest correlation with the determined residuals over jja season and months figs 4 9 to 4 12 and figs 3 21 to 3 32 in supplementary material during the september october november son an inaccurate estimate i e nrmse of 30 of seasonal et0 was obtained using tpm2 hs and fbc for 11 18 and 20 of the hyper arid arid regions and 5 9 and 14 of the semi arid and sub humid humid areas respectively figs 2 13 2 15 and 2 16 however except for one case khalkhal no 64 in table 1 tpmu gave an acceptable estimate i e nrmse of 30 of seasonal et0 in son over all locations fig 2 14 hs and tpmu models provided accurate monthly estimates nrmse of 30 for more than 85 of studied sites fig 5 a and 5 b however tpm2 and fbc were unable to model et0 with reliable accuracy for around one third of surveyed sites in november therefore tpm2 and fbc may not be suited to model monthly et0 over son particularly in the semi arid and sub humid humid sites et0 was modeled by tpmu with the nrmse less than 30 for 100 69 100 and 87 of sites in which tpm2 estimated the et0 erroneously i e nrmse of 30 during son season september october and november respectively in the case of data availability feeding tpm with average u appears thus to be recommendable for seasonal and monthly et0 estimation in autumn for the majority of hyper arid arid areas fbc and hs showed a tendency towards over and underestimation during son season and months respectively figs 3 15 3 16 and 5 c seasonal and monthly et0 were mostly overestimated in the semi arid and humid sub humid locations by tpms and fbc in son figs 3 13 3 14 3 16 and 5 d at most sites the u anomalies was identified as the major cause of error in the son et0 estimation by the temperature based equations figs 4 13 to 4 16 5 e and 5 f in the annual scale tpm2 hs and fbc models estimated et0 inaccurately i e nrmse of 30 for 11 of the hyper arid arid and 7 of the semi arid and sub humid humid locations figs 2 17 2 19 and 2 20 furthermore tpmu provided a reliable estimate of annual et0 i e nrmse of 30 for all studied sites indicating that the tpm s accuracy can be greatly enhanced by considering the local long term average u figs 2 18 there was a tendency for annual et0 overestimation in the semi arid and sub humid humid regions and annual et0 underestimation in the hyper arid arid sites by tpm2 hs and fbc figs 3 17 3 19 and 3 20 annual et0 was however underestimated by tpmu in around 77 of locations figs 3 18 for the majority of sites the u anomalies was the most influencing climatic variable with an average correlation coefficient of 0 86 0 89 0 89 and 0 82 for tpm2 tpmu hs and fbc respectively leading to error in the temperature based annual et0 estimation figs 4 17 to 4 20 overall there was a closer association between the u changes and the residuals in the hyper arid arid sites and during jja months fig 5 e and 5 f therefore one can conclude that the accuracy of temperature based et0 estimation is more impacted by the u data quality and availability in more arid and warmer conditions furthermore the residuals of fbc were less correlated to the u variability in respect to those of tpms and hs fig 5 e and 5 f according to the results presented in table 2 a higher correlation coefficient determined between nrmse of tpm2 and nrmse of hs demonstrates more similar performance of tpm2 and hs over our study area the models performance was however less similar for wintertime these results are in accordance with those of raziei and pereira 2013 except for djf season and months the residuals for et0 estimation were mainly resulted from the u anomalies particularly for the water limited conditions i e the semi arid and hyper arid arid regions the models of tpm2 hs and fbc are expected to provide more accurate monthly seasonal and annual et0 estimates for the sites with the u values ranging between 1 5 and 2 5 m s 1 fig 6 and fig 4 in supplementary material this is due to the fact that u is assumed to be equaled to 2 m s 1 for fbc and tpm2 additionally although u is not directly considered for hs this model also displaysmorerobustperformance at regions with average u around 2 m s 1 for most sites with average u of 1 non windy condition or of 3 windy environment m s 1 et0 was not satisfactorily modeled by tpm2 hs and fbc in all temporal scales for example these equations performed poorly in estimating et0 at four windy locations i e zahak zabol khoor birjand and manjil which are no 145 144 118 and 72 in table 1 respectively with u of 3 m s 1 and kashan no 63 in table 1 with u of 1 m s 1 a non windy region in all time scales it can be thus concluded that et0 estimation is prone to significant error and bias when u data are missing or of low quality at most regions in iran the trend in u has been reported as the most affecting factor on the et0 trend and variability in the water limited areas of iran dinpashoh et al 2011 nouri and bannayan 2018 nouri et al 2017a and worldwide mcvicar et al 2012 raziei and pereira 2013 also attributed the weak performance of hs and tpm2 against pm to the u extremes and variations in the hyper arid arid areas mainly located in the southern and southeastern iran shiri 2017 also pointed out that pm with estimated u gave less accurate estimates with respect to pm fed with estimated rs denoting the significant influence of the u dynamics on the et0 estimation in iran at all scales more reliable et0 estimation can be achieved by using tpmu in both windy and non windy environments fig 6 nonetheless et0 was still modeled with nrmse of 30 for some sites mostly with winter u of 1 5 m s 1 moreover for 9 locations 8 of which have summertime u of 3 m s 1 tpmu was unable to provide a robust estimate of the jja et0 raziei and pereira 2013 included that tpm computation by using measured average u value resulted in a marked improvement in accuracy of et0 estimation in iran when minimum weather data are available trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 also suggested the use of local long term average u instead of default value of 2 m s 1 for more robust estimation of et0 based on only temperature data in humid regions of serbia defining additional factor or expression is a technique employed to enhance the accuracy of temperature based et0 models under windy or non windy conditions allen 1993 droogers and allen 2002 jensen et al 1997 martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 the effectiveness of the proposed empirical wind functions is however very site specific creating the need of recalibration for other regions furthermore if the required wind speed data for such wind functions are available one can easily use pm instead of temperature based models droogers and allen 2002 as a result developing such wind functions is not only unlikely to yield more accurate temperature based et0 estimates in windy or non windy ecosystems but also increases the model complexity droogers and allen 2002 hargreaves and allen 2003 martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 another method more commonly applied to enhance the performance of temperature based models is recalibration of the empirical coefficients the latter technique has been also evaluated and used in iran raziei and pereira 2013 sepaskhah and razzaghi 2009 tabari and talaee 2011 like deriving wind functions readjustment of temperature based models coefficients highly depends on local condition and may even worsen the performance of model for other regions ravazzani et al 2012 moreover the updated coefficients for a specific site may vary with time as an instance tabari and talaee 2011 recommended a krs of 0 26 for hs using 1994 2005 climate data while raziei and pereira 2013 proposed 0 18 for krs based on the data for the period of 1971 2005 at a site located in the southeastern iran bam no 101 in table 1 for this case the average annual u for bam was 1 85 and 2 28 m s 1 in 1971 2005 and 1994 2005 respectively explaining the difference in krs suggested for hs by raziei and pereira 2013 and tabari and talaee 2011 such difference and inconsistency can be hence attributable to the climatic changes and variations being highly dependent on the length of study period and site specific readjustment of empirical coefficients of temperature based models may be misleading to decision makers and planners in addition model recalibration requires a reliable datasets with high spatial resolution which is not easily available particularly in developing countries overall application of the above mentioned methods to improve the temperature based equations performance is unlikely to be practically useful in iran for some periods and sites a closer correlation existed between the residuals and anomalies in rh and rs illustrates that the variations in these inputs tend to introduce more estimation error for instance the rh variation made the most substantial contribution to error in et0 estimation in some western semi arid areas during mam season and months fig 2 5 to 2 8 and figs 3 9 to 3 20 in supplementary material further there was a stronger relationship between the residuals and the anomalies of rs in some northern and southern coastal regions over jja season and months figs 2 9 to 2 12 and figs 3 21 to 3 32 in supplementary material hence using unreliable or estimated rs and rh series ishighlylikelyto jeopardize the accuracy of estimates over these sites in four western semi arid and sub humid sites i e ghorveh khodabandeh sardasht and bijar no 6 65 24 and 2 in table 1 respectively in which the nrmse of tpm2 for the mam et0 estimation was greater than 20 replacing the estimated rh based on eq 3 with the recorded series led to the largest decline about 9 in the nrmse value these results demonstrate that in such areas with high sensitivity of et0 estimation to the rh changes using estimated rh may result in erroneous results in jja feeding tpm2 with measured rs caused the greatest reduction in the nrmse quantity from 22 to 6 in three coastal regions i e anzali bandar jask and abomosa no 40 113 and 97 in table 1 respectively in which the highest association was observed between the residuals and the rs variability the effects of application of estimated rh and rs on the et0 estimation accuracy have been also addressed in the literature shiri 2017 concluded that pm fed with estimated rs surpassed pm calculated by estimated u whereas kimberly penman model kp using estimated rs performed weaker as compared with kp with estimated u for some arid areas in the southern iran it seems hence that data unavailability affects the et0 models performance differently landeras et al 2008 argued that using estimated rh to compute pm introduced more error compared with application of estimated rs for some regions located in the northern spain trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 however indicated that pm with estimated rh outperformed pm with estimated rs in some humid sites in serbia as a result the influences of rh and rs data missing seem to be site specific and also depend on the employed model selecting the best alternative to estimate et0 using merely temperature data depends on the issue being addressed as an instance for a rough estimate of renewable water quantity needing annual et0 all studied models can be employed at most regions however if an accurate temperature based et0 estimation is desired at the monthly scale tpmu is more recommendable as it outperformed for most cases however in the case of lack of long term average u hs appears to provide more accurate monthly and seasonal et0 as compared with tpm2 and fbc since these two latter models performed poorly in cold months these results are very helpful and beneficial for decision makers in the iran ministry of energy where its data bank does not cover u sr and rh and long term pan evaporation sets of data are often of questionable validity and spatially sparsely distributed it is worth mentioning that further investigations are required to analyze the error in estimating daily temperature based et0 and the impact of daily temperature variation and extreme on temperature based et0 estimation furthermore assessing the temperature based et0 estimation at different spatial scales can provide valuable information for regional hydrological studies and agricultural and water resources planning and development 4 conclusions our results revealed that except for the december january february djf the temperature based equations estimated seasonal and annual reference evapotranspiration et0 acceptably i e normalized root mean square of 30 at 83 or more of sites in wintertime fao blaney criddle fbc and temperature based penman monteith fao 56 with default wind speed u value tpm2 estimated seasonal et0 erroneously for around 44 and 38 of surveyed stations respectively at the monthly scale fbc was also unable to confidently estimate et0 in november december january and february for around 32 65 60 and 40 of locations respectively in addition tpm2 performed poorly for approximately 53 and 43 of regions in december and january respectively therefore tpm2 and fbc seem not to provide a reliable monthly and seasonal estimates in cold months particularly for the semi arid regions overall temperature based penman monteith fao 56 fed with average u value tpmu and hargreaves samani hs models mostly surpassed fbc and tpm2 at all temporal scales hs and tpmu are thus more recommendable under lack of data for most cases and periods in the case of data availability tpm is recommended to be calculated with local average u the temperature based models tended to underestimate seasonal and monthly et0 at most hyper arid arid sites during the march april may mam and june july august jja tpm2 and hs showed an overall tendency of overestimation at the seasonal and monthly scales in the majority of semi arid and sub humid humid areas the u anomalies made the greatest contribution to the error in estimating temperature based et0 for most sites and periods deviation of u from the range of 1 5 2 5 m s 1 mostly causes an increase in the absolute error of tpm2 hs and fbc the results of this study can be useful for policy makers to adopt appropriate decisions under data limitation acknowledgment this

hargreaves samani hs and fao blaney criddle fbc against penman monteith fao 56 pm using data recorded in 1993 2015 at 146 sites over iran two statistics i e normalized root mean square nrmse and relative mean bias error rmbe were calculated to analyze the absolute error and bias magnitude of the temperature based et0 estimation respectively except for the december january february djf the models gave reliable seasonal estimates i e nrmse of 30 for the majority of studied areas at monthly scale fbc gave poor estimates of et0 in djf for more than 60 of semi arid and sub humid humid sites et0 in december and january was not also modeled reliably by tpm2 for 61 and 52 of the semi arid and sub humid humid sites respectively hence application of fbc and tpm2 appears not to be recommendable in cold areas and months over iran overall tpmu and hs are better suited at all temporal scales under data limitation over the studied areas in the case of data availability calculation of tpm with local average u instead of default quantity of 2 m s 1 is highly likely to improve the estimation accuracy seasonal and monthly et0 were mostly underestimated over the hyper arid arid sites during the march april may mam and june july august jja however tpm2 and hs overestimated et0 for the majority of semi arid and sub humid humid areas the u anomalies were identified as the primary contributing factor to the error in temperature based et0 estimation for most cases tpm2 hs and fbc provided more accurate estimates for the u range of 1 5 2 5 m s 1 these findings are of significant practical importance for agricultural hydrological and climatic studies and applications under data sparse condition keywords crop water demand irrigation scheduling temperature based et0 estimation water resources management wind speed 1 introduction evapotranspiration as a basic component of the hydrological cycle accounts for about 60 of global precipitated water and creates a direct linkage between water and energy balances as it consumes 50 or more of radiative energy absorbed hirschi et al 2017 teuling et al 2009 around one third of total water is evapotranspired from crop and range lands oki and kanae 2006 homaee and schmidhalter 2008 homaee et al 2002 however as determination of water flux through crops is technically complex actual crop evapotranspiration is

designing and managing irrigation schemes irmak et al 2006 jensen and allen 2016 shiri 2018 furthermore et0 estimates are of a great importance for determining watershed scale evapotranspiration and preparing inputs of hydrological models gong et al 2006 not varying with soil physical characteristics and water availability et0 is only function of climatic variables and represents atmosphere s evaporative demand allen et al 1998 therefore investigating long term et0 variability and dynamics discloses invaluable information and understanding of past and future climate change nouri et al 2018 wang et al 2013 in order to avoid ambiguity and complexity allen et al 1998 defined et0 as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop which has an assumed height of 12 cm a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 greatly resembling evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass with uniform height actively growing well watered and completely shading the ground based on the assumptions considered for the reference surface allen et al 1998 proposed a robust model namely the penman monteith fao 56 pm based on the original penman monteith equation although pm has been successfully employed to calculate et0 worldwide allen et al 2006 milly and dunne 2016 pereira et al 2015 todorovic et al 2013 it needs substantial sets of data including solar radiation sr wind speed u minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax and relative humidity rh such comprehensive datasets may however be unavailable or of poor quality jensen et al 1997 trajkovic 2005 solar radiation or sunshine hour data are not always available or of acceptable quality jensen et al 1997 for instance the sunshine duration data are commonly missing in the period of 1979 1982 in iran further measuring rh by electronic sensors is a demanding task and prone to inherent error arising from hysteresis nonlinearity and calibration allen 1996 moreover rh data acquired over non reference sites including most weather stations in water limited regions are plagued by bias allen 1996 jensen et al 1997 recording u may be also site specific and unreliable in particular under extreme conditions allen 1996 jensen et al 1997 additionally et0 estimates are required in irrigated farms in which the rh u and sr data are mostly lacking particularly for developing countries allen and pruitt 1986 maeda et al 2011 temperature based equations have been therefore developed to model et0 based merely on available temperature data abtew and melesse 2013 trajkovic 2005 some studies have been also carried out to assess the accuracy of temperature based et0 equations against pm or lysimeter measurements in different climates geographic conditions and scales aguilar

1993 droogers and allen 2002 iran is located in the middle east with predominantly semi arid and arid climate nouri et al 2016 and evapotranspiration amounts to as much as 70 of the average fallen precipitation alizadeh and keshavarz 2005 around 92 of agricultural outputs are produced in irrigated lands which clearly illustrates the vital role of irrigation in maintenance of food security in iran ministry of agriculture 2016 although agriculture sector accounts for approximately 92 of water consumption in iran the average irrigation efficiency is pretty low around 35 and only around 5 of cultivated areas are currently under pressurized irrigation madani 2014 thus increasing water productivity through promoting efficient irrigation systems is highly desired besides the issue of efficiency there is an urgent need to take real water saving and evaporation control measures over the country which is experiencing climate change and growing population madani 2014 nouri et al 2017a these actions and strategies require a robust estimation of et0 hargreaves and allen 2003 maeda et al 2011 in practice et0 may not however be modeled and mapped with a reliable scale based on pm due to sparse distribution of stations recording the needed inputs over iran in addition missing or poor quality data particularly for sr are obstacle for calculating pm with an acceptable level of accuracy for some regions hence there is a need for a comprehensive assessment of temperature based et0 estimation over iran there are some studies conducted to evaluate the accuracy of temperature based et0 models in iran farzanpour et al 2018 fooladmand 2011 kiafar et al 2016 raziei and pereira 2013 tabari et al 2011 valipour 2014 in addition improvement in accuracy of temperature based et0 estimates in iran has been attempted by several investigators e g raziei and pereira 2013 shiri et al 2014 shiri et al 2015 tabari and talaee 2011 most of these analyses have been performed at a regional scale one or two province s e g farzanpour et al 2018 fooladmand 2011 tabari and talaee 2011 or considered limited number of sites over iran raziei and pereira 2013 valipour 2014 also addressed the performance of some temperature based methods against pm using data for 181 locations across iran although this work seems to consider adequate stations it lacks the monthly and seasonal and contribution analyses it is noteworthy that clearer and more informative results can be obtained by studying monthly and seasonal temperature based et0 estimation aguilar and polo 2011 in addition the performance of temperature based penman monteith fao 56 tpm against pm has not been assessed by valipour 2014 therefore the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of four temperature based et0 models i e the hargreaves samani hs fao blaney criddle fbc and two variants of tpm with relative to pm over 146 sites in iran moreover the contribution of mean temperature tmean u rh and rs to the residuals the differences between et0 values estimated by pm and temperature based methods was also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area and data iran is a country lying in the southwest asia and has a high climate diversity chiefly owing to the existence of two mountain ranges i e the alborz in the north and the zagros in the west humid and sub humid climates mainly dominate along the southern coast of the caspian sea fig 1 the climate of western half and northeast of iran is mostly semi arid however a hyper arid arid climate prevails in the central southeastern southern and eastern iran fig 1 the geographic properties and numbers names of 146 stations investigated are given in fig 1 and table 1 it should be noted that the aridity index ai used for climate classification was determined based on unep 1997 i e the ratio of precipitation to the pm calculated et0 if ai value equals to 0 05 0 05 0 20 0 20 0 50 0 50 0 65 0 65 1 00 and 1 00

interpolation method monthly meteorological data recorded at 146 stations including precipitation tmin tmax u rh and rs were obtained from the iran meteorological organization irimo in 1993 2015 to

can be approximated on the basis of assumption of tmin tdew dew point temperature allen et al 1998 3 e a 0 611 exp 17 27 t min t min 237 3 the assumption of tmin tdew may not however be valid for arid and semi arid environments wherein the atmosphere might not be fully saturated when air temperature is minimum and a correction for the relationship seems thus to be necessary in hyper arid arid semi arid and dry sub humid regions the following relationships were respectively employed tdew tmin 4 tdew tmin 2 tdew tmin 1 and tdew tmin 1 tdew was considered to be equal to tmin at moist sub humid and humid areas allen et al 1998 in the case of absence of u data the value of 2 m s 1 average of u for 2000 stations on the globe can be used allen et al 1998 furthermore application of local long term average u value instead of default value of 2 m s 1 was recommended in the hydrology literature djaman et al 2017 raziei and pereira 2013 rojas and sheffield 2013 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 using eqs 2 and 3 and magnitude of 2 m s 1 or local average for u eq 1 can estimate et0 with only temperature data in the current study temperature based penman monteith fao 56 fed with local average u and the value of 2 m s 1 were hereafter referred to as tpmu and tpm2 respectively the hs equation is as follows hargreaves and samani 1985 4 e t 0 0 0135 k rs r a t max t min 0 5 t m e a n 17 8 doorenbos

and allen 2016 2 3 quantitative evaluation the performance of the temperature based models relative to pm was assessed using normalized root mean square error nrmse and relative means bias error rmbe the mathematical expressions of these statistics are 6 nrmse 100 o i 1 n s i o i 2 n 7 rmbe 100 o 1 n i 1 n s i o i where si denotes et0 calculated using the temperature based methods oi is the pm estimated et0 value si oi is the residual in temperature based estimation o represents the average pm estimated et0 and n is the number of comparisons the nrmse is frequently utilized to quantify the absolute error of estimation nouri et al 2016 babaeian et al 2015 the model performance is considered perfect when nrmse is 10 good if nrmse is between 10 and 20 fair if nrmse ranges between 20 and 30 and poor unreliable if nrmse exceeds 30 dettori et al 2011 ku et al 2018 the rmbe is an index quantifying the model bias and systematic error and its negative positive values show the model s tendency to underestimate overestimate nouri et al 2017b if the estimations are equivalent to the observations si oi the model performance is excellent and the magnitude of rmbe and nrmse statistics are equal to 0 0 in order to carry out the contribution analysis the correlation coefficient between the residual values si oi and the rh rs u and tmean anomalies x i x was determined the anomalies in the most contributing factor to the absolute error of the temperature based et0 estimation correlate more strongly with the residuals 3 results and discussion during the december january february djf season the performance of tpm2 tpmu hs and fbc was poor i e nrmse of 30 for 30 12 10 and 27 of the hyper arid arid and 48 15 15 and 64 of the semi arid and sub humid humid areas respectively fig 2 1 to 2 4 tpm2 estimated et0 inaccurately in january and december for about 43 and 53 of sites respectively fig 5 a and 5 b furthermore the nrmse of fbc estimates in january february and december was greater than 30 at 60 40 and 65 of investigated areas respectively thus monthly et0 seems not to be modeled robustly based on fbc and tpm2 in djf the sites in which the nrmse of fbc and tpm2 was greater than 30 were majorly located in the western half center and northeast of the country figs 2 1 and 2 4 and figs 1 1 1 4 1 5 1 8 1 45 and 1 48 in supplementary material hs and tpmu however surpassed the other two models at most cases particularly those located in cold semi arid areas figs 2 2 and 2 3 figs 1 2 1 3 1 6 1 7 1 46 and 1 47 in supplementary material using tpmu decreased the nrmse value to less than 30 for approximately 73 65 94 and 44 of sites in which tpm2 estimated et0 unreliably i e nrmse of 30 in djf season january february and december respectively it can be thus concluded that considering local average of winter u instead of default value of 2 m s 1 noticeably improved the performance of tpm in wintertime particularly for the semi arid regions however when long term u data are lacking hs seems to be better suited to model et0 based on temperature data in djf season and months under non ideal circumstances growth of autumn sown crops in particular rainfed cereals predominantly cultivated in semi arid drylands and wintertime hydrological processes seem hence to be simulated with greater accuracy by using hs and tpmu for most sites tpm2 and tpmu had an overall tendency of overestimation while fbc tended to underestimate seasonal and monthly et0 over djf figs 3 1 3 2 3 4 5 c and 5 d tpm2 and tpmu significantly overestimated i e rmbe of 15 the djf et0 over the studied semi arid environments and arid northeastern regions and fbc considerably underestimated i e rmbe of 15 in these areas an overall tendency to over or underestimate seasonal and monthly et0 was however not found for hs during winter figs 3 3 5 a and 5 d a stronger correlation existed between the residuals of tpms and hs and the u anomalies over djf season december january and february in more than 85 76 76 and 58 of stations figs 4 1 to 4 3 5 e and 5 f tpm2 poorly estimated winter et0 over the northeastern northwestern and western semi arid and northern sub humid humid areas with winter u of 1 3 m s 1 however the residual of fbc had a closer association with the tmean anomalies in 79 77 86 and 68 of the semi arid and sub humid humid regions over djf season december january and february figs 4 4 and 5 f therefore the tmean variations appear to be the most significant cause of error in estimation of seasonal and monthly et0 by fbc over the semi arid and sub humid humid areas in wintertime fbc showed a weak performance in estimating wintertime et0 for almost all sites with winter tmean of 3 co mainly located in the western northwestern and northeastern iran seasonal et0 was estimated weakly i e nrmse of 30 by the temperature based models at 5 of the hyper arid arid and 10 of the semi arid and sub humid humid sites fig 2 5 to 2 8 over the march april may mam on the monthly scale the performance of temperature based models was reliable i e nrmse of 30 for more than 82 of stations fig 5 a nad 5 b overall tpms and hs seem to produce better results at the monthly and seasonal scales in mam although fbc modeled seasonal et0 with an acceptable accuracy at the majority of locations its poor performance in estimating et0 in march at about 28 of the semi arid and sub humid humid areas implies that this model may not provide accurate monthly estimates over mam in these regions the models of tpms and hs underestimated seasonal and monthly et0 at 65 or more of the hyper arid arid sites figs 3 5 to 3 7 and 5 c in mam as to semi arid and sub humid humid areas springtime et0 was however mainly overestimated by hs and tpm2 whereas fbc and tpmu predominantly underestimated it figs 3 5 to 3 8 and 5 d for the majority of stations the greatest absolute correlation coefficients were determined between the u anomalies and the residuals figs 4 5 to 4 8 5 e and 5 f however for some western and northwestern stations the residual in seasonal and monthly estimation was associated more highly with the rh changes in mam figs 4 5 to 4 8 and figs 3 9 to 3 20 in supplementary material in addition the tmean variability was observed to be the most influential on the fbc s error over northern sub humid humid regions during mam season march and april figs 4 8 and figs 3 12 and 3 16 in supplementary material seasonal and monthly et0 were not reliably modeled i e nrmse of 30 by means of the temperature based models in 18 of the hyper arid arid areas and 9 of the semi arid and sub humid humid sites during the june july august jja figs 2 9 to 2 12 5 a and 5 b overall the temperature based models gave a better estimate of summer et0 over the semi arid and sub humid humid regions relative to the hyper arid arid environments moreover application of tpmu resulted in a decrease of nrmse to less than 30 at 38 50 23 and 23 of stations in which tpm2 s performance was poor i e nrmse of 30 during jja season june july and august respectively for more than 65 of the hyper arid arid sites there was a tendency towards underestimation of the summertime et0 by the temperature based equations figs 3 9 to 3 12 and 5 c in the semi arid sites fbc and tpms mostly overestimated and underestimated seasonal and monthly et0 over jja respectively figs 3 9 3 10 3 12 and 5 d hs and fbc also tended to overestimate the summertime et0 for most sub humid humid locations the variation in u was found to be the most contributing factor to the residuals over the hyper arid arid and semi arid areas figs 4 9 to 4 12 5 e and 5 f for most costal sub humid humid stations of the caspian sea in the north and arid sites located in the oman sea and the persian gulf coastal strip in the south other controlling factors i e tmean rh and sr had the greatest correlation with the determined residuals over jja season and months figs 4 9 to 4 12 and figs 3 21 to 3 32 in supplementary material during the september october november son an inaccurate estimate i e nrmse of 30 of seasonal et0 was obtained using tpm2 hs and fbc for 11 18 and 20 of the hyper arid arid regions and 5 9 and 14 of the semi arid and sub humid humid areas respectively figs 2 13 2 15 and 2 16 however except for one case khalkhal no 64 in table 1 tpmu gave an acceptable estimate i e nrmse of 30 of seasonal et0 in son over all locations fig 2 14 hs and tpmu models provided accurate monthly estimates nrmse of 30 for more than 85 of studied sites fig 5 a and 5 b however tpm2 and fbc were unable to model et0 with reliable accuracy for around one third of surveyed sites in november therefore tpm2 and fbc may not be suited to model monthly et0 over son particularly in the semi arid and sub humid humid sites et0 was modeled by tpmu with the nrmse less than 30 for 100 69 100 and 87 of sites in which tpm2 estimated the et0 erroneously i e nrmse of 30 during son season september october and november respectively in the case of data availability feeding tpm with average u appears thus to be recommendable for seasonal and monthly et0 estimation in autumn for the majority of hyper arid arid areas fbc and hs showed a tendency towards over and underestimation during son season and months respectively figs 3 15 3 16 and 5 c seasonal and monthly et0 were mostly overestimated in the semi arid and humid sub humid locations by tpms and fbc in son figs 3 13 3 14 3 16 and 5 d at most sites the u anomalies was identified as the major cause of error in the son et0 estimation by the temperature based equations figs 4 13 to 4 16 5 e and 5 f in the annual scale tpm2 hs and fbc models estimated et0 inaccurately i e nrmse of 30 for 11 of the hyper arid arid and 7 of the semi arid and sub humid humid locations figs 2 17 2 19 and 2 20 furthermore tpmu provided a reliable estimate of annual et0 i e nrmse of 30 for all studied sites indicating that the tpm s accuracy can be greatly enhanced by considering the local long term average u figs 2 18 there was a tendency for annual et0 overestimation in the semi arid and sub humid humid regions and annual et0 underestimation in the hyper arid arid sites by tpm2 hs and fbc figs 3 17 3 19 and 3 20 annual et0 was however underestimated by tpmu in around 77 of locations figs 3 18 for the majority of sites the u anomalies was the most influencing climatic variable with an average correlation coefficient of 0 86 0 89 0 89 and 0 82 for tpm2 tpmu hs and fbc respectively leading to error in the temperature based annual et0 estimation figs 4 17 to 4 20 overall there was a closer association between the u changes and the residuals in the hyper arid arid sites and during jja months fig 5 e and 5 f therefore one can conclude that the accuracy of temperature based et0 estimation is more impacted by the u data quality and availability in more arid and warmer conditions furthermore the residuals of fbc were less correlated to the u variability in respect to those of tpms and hs fig 5 e and 5 f according to the results presented in table 2 a higher correlation coefficient determined between nrmse of tpm2 and nrmse of hs demonstrates more similar performance of tpm2 and hs over our study area the models performance was however less similar for wintertime these results are in accordance with those of raziei and pereira 2013 except for djf season and months the residuals for et0 estimation were mainly resulted from the u anomalies particularly for the water limited conditions i e the semi arid and hyper arid arid regions the models of tpm2 hs and fbc are expected to provide more accurate monthly seasonal and annual et0 estimates for the sites with the u values ranging between 1 5 and 2 5 m s 1 fig 6 and fig 4 in supplementary material this is due to the fact that u is assumed to be equaled to 2 m s 1 for fbc and tpm2 additionally although u is not directly considered for hs this model also displaysmorerobustperformance at regions with average u around 2 m s 1 for most sites with average u of 1 non windy condition or of 3 windy environment m s 1 et0 was not satisfactorily modeled by tpm2 hs and fbc in all temporal scales for example these equations performed poorly in estimating et0 at four windy locations i e zahak zabol khoor birjand and manjil which are no 145 144 118 and 72 in table 1 respectively with u of 3 m s 1 and kashan no 63 in table 1 with u of 1 m s 1 a non windy region in all time scales it can be thus concluded that et0 estimation is prone to significant error and bias when u data are missing or of low quality at most regions in iran the trend in u has been reported as the most affecting factor on the et0 trend and variability in the water limited areas of iran dinpashoh et al 2011 nouri and bannayan 2018 nouri et al 2017a and worldwide mcvicar et al 2012 raziei and pereira 2013 also attributed the weak performance of hs and tpm2 against pm to the u extremes and variations in the hyper arid arid areas mainly located in the southern and southeastern iran shiri 2017 also pointed out that pm with estimated u gave less accurate estimates with respect to pm fed with estimated rs denoting the significant influence of the u dynamics on the et0 estimation in iran at all scales more reliable et0 estimation can be achieved by using tpmu in both windy and non windy environments fig 6 nonetheless et0 was still modeled with nrmse of 30 for some sites mostly with winter u of 1 5 m s 1 moreover for 9 locations 8 of which have summertime u of 3 m s 1 tpmu was unable to provide a robust estimate of the jja et0 raziei and pereira 2013 included that tpm computation by using measured average u value resulted in a marked improvement in accuracy of et0 estimation in iran when minimum weather data are available trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 also suggested the use of local long term average u instead of default value of 2 m s 1 for more robust estimation of et0 based on only temperature data in humid regions of serbia defining additional factor or expression is a technique employed to enhance the accuracy of temperature based et0 models under windy or non windy conditions allen 1993 droogers and allen 2002 jensen et al 1997 martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 the effectiveness of the proposed empirical wind functions is however very site specific creating the need of recalibration for other regions furthermore if the required wind speed data for such wind functions are available one can easily use pm instead of temperature based models droogers and allen 2002 as a result developing such wind functions is not only unlikely to yield more accurate temperature based et0 estimates in windy or non windy ecosystems but also increases the model complexity droogers and allen 2002 hargreaves and allen 2003 martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 another method more commonly applied to enhance the performance of temperature based models is recalibration of the empirical coefficients the latter technique has been also evaluated and used in iran raziei and pereira 2013 sepaskhah and razzaghi 2009 tabari and talaee 2011 like deriving wind functions readjustment of temperature based models coefficients highly depends on local condition and may even worsen the performance of model for other regions ravazzani et al 2012 moreover the updated coefficients for a specific site may vary with time as an instance tabari and talaee 2011 recommended a krs of 0 26 for hs using 1994 2005 climate data while raziei and pereira 2013 proposed 0 18 for krs based on the data for the period of 1971 2005 at a site located in the southeastern iran bam no 101 in table 1 for this case the average annual u for bam was 1 85 and 2 28 m s 1 in 1971 2005 and 1994 2005 respectively explaining the difference in krs suggested for hs by raziei and pereira 2013 and tabari and talaee 2011 such difference and inconsistency can be hence attributable to the climatic changes and variations being highly dependent on the length of study period and site specific readjustment of empirical coefficients of temperature based models may be misleading to decision makers and planners in addition model recalibration requires a reliable datasets with high spatial resolution which is not easily available particularly in developing countries overall application of the above mentioned methods to improve the temperature based equations performance is unlikely to be practically useful in iran for some periods and sites a closer correlation existed between the residuals and anomalies in rh and rs illustrates that the variations in these inputs tend to introduce more estimation error for instance the rh variation made the most substantial contribution to error in et0 estimation in some western semi arid areas during mam season and months fig 2 5 to 2 8 and figs 3 9 to 3 20 in supplementary material further there was a stronger relationship between the residuals and the anomalies of rs in some northern and southern coastal regions over jja season and months figs 2 9 to 2 12 and figs 3 21 to 3 32 in supplementary material hence using unreliable or estimated rs and rh series ishighlylikelyto jeopardize the accuracy of estimates over these sites in four western semi arid and sub humid sites i e ghorveh khodabandeh sardasht and bijar no 6 65 24 and 2 in table 1 respectively in which the nrmse of tpm2 for the mam et0 estimation was greater than 20 replacing the estimated rh based on eq 3 with the recorded series led to the largest decline about 9 in the nrmse value these results demonstrate that in such areas with high sensitivity of et0 estimation to the rh changes using estimated rh may result in erroneous results in jja feeding tpm2 with measured rs caused the greatest reduction in the nrmse quantity from 22 to 6 in three coastal regions i e anzali bandar jask and abomosa no 40 113 and 97 in table 1 respectively in which the highest association was observed between the residuals and the rs variability the effects of application of estimated rh and rs on the et0 estimation accuracy have been also addressed in the literature shiri 2017 concluded that pm fed with estimated rs surpassed pm calculated by estimated u whereas kimberly penman model kp using estimated rs performed weaker as compared with kp with estimated u for some arid areas in the southern iran it seems hence that data unavailability affects the et0 models performance differently landeras et al 2008 argued that using estimated rh to compute pm introduced more error compared with application of estimated rs for some regions located in the northern spain trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 however indicated that pm with estimated rh outperformed pm with estimated rs in some humid sites in serbia as a result the influences of rh and rs data missing seem to be site specific and also depend on the employed model selecting the best alternative to estimate et0 using merely temperature data depends on the issue being addressed as an instance for a rough estimate of renewable water quantity needing annual et0 all studied models can be employed at most regions however if an accurate temperature based et0 estimation is desired at the monthly scale tpmu is more recommendable as it outperformed for most cases however in the case of lack of long term average u hs appears to provide more accurate monthly and seasonal et0 as compared with tpm2 and fbc since these two latter models performed poorly in cold months these results are very helpful and beneficial for decision makers in the iran ministry of energy where its data bank does not cover u sr and rh and long term pan evaporation sets of data are often of questionable validity and spatially sparsely distributed it is worth mentioning that further investigations are required to analyze the error in estimating daily temperature based et0 and the impact of daily temperature variation and extreme on temperature based et0 estimation furthermore assessing the temperature based et0 estimation at different spatial scales can provide valuable information for regional hydrological studies and agricultural and water resources planning and development 4 conclusions our results revealed that except for the december january february djf the temperature based equations estimated seasonal and annual reference evapotranspiration et0 acceptably i e normalized root mean square of 30 at 83 or more of sites in wintertime fao blaney criddle fbc and temperature based penman monteith fao 56 with default wind speed u value tpm2 estimated seasonal et0 erroneously for around 44 and 38 of surveyed stations respectively at the monthly scale fbc was also unable to confidently estimate et0 in november december january and february for around 32 65 60 and 40 of locations respectively in addition tpm2 performed poorly for approximately 53 and 43 of regions in december and january respectively therefore tpm2 and fbc seem not to provide a reliable monthly and seasonal estimates in cold months particularly for the semi arid regions overall temperature based penman monteith fao 56 fed with average u value tpmu and hargreaves samani hs models mostly surpassed fbc and tpm2 at all temporal scales hs and tpmu are thus more recommendable under lack of data for most cases and periods in the case of data availability tpm is recommended to be calculated with local average u the temperature based models tended to underestimate seasonal and monthly et0 at most hyper arid arid sites during the march april may mam and june july august jja tpm2 and hs showed an overall tendency of overestimation at the seasonal and monthly scales in the majority of semi arid and sub humid humid areas the u anomalies made the greatest contribution to the error in estimating temperature based et0 for most sites and periods deviation of u from the range of 1 5 2 5 m s 1 mostly causes an increase in the absolute error of tpm2 hs and fbc the results of this study can be useful for policy makers to adopt appropriate decisions under data limitation acknowledgment this
