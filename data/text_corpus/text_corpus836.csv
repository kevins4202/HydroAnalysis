4180,vegetation restoration is widely recognized as the most effective measure in controlling runoff and soil erosion under different climatic zones and topographical conditions nevertheless few studies have been performed to quantify its effectiveness in controlling runoff and soil erosion on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions this study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion and further identify its main factors influencing runoff and soil erosion under typical plant communities on steep gully slopes of the loess plateau china runoff and erosion were analyzed on monthly scale from 14 micro plots for three consecutive years 2018 2020 the results showed that vegetation restoration can effectively reduce runoff and erosion compare to bare land runoff and erosion reduced by 37 5 to 93 0 and 83 9 to 99 6 under different plant communities the mean percent runoff and soil erosion reduction and the ratio of percent runoff reduction to percent erosion reduction of shrub community were 1 34 1 06 and 1 29 times those of grass community the corresponding values of grass community with tap root systems were 0 60 0 91 and 0 64 times that with fibrous root systems shrub community was more effective than grass community in reducing erosion whereas grass community especially with tap root systems was more effective in maintaining runoff although runoff and erosion varied greatly between different plant communities their relationships could be well simulated by power functions variations in runoff were primarily affected by rainfall amount the maximum 30 minute intensity 60 minute rainfall kinetic energy litter coverage and biological crust coverage variations in erosion were dominantly influenced by runoff the maximum 30 minute intensity plant canopy coverage and litter density overall our study suggested that grass community especially with tap root systems is likely a more suitable and advisable choice for vegetation restoration on steep gully slope in arid and semiarid regions the results of this study provide the scientific guide for policy making of vegetation restoration on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions i e the loess plateau keywords vegetation restoration soil conservation runoff plot steep slope the loess plateau 1 introduction as one of the most severe worldwide eco environmental problem soil erosion by water not only produces on site soil and nutrient loss biodiversity reduction and land degradation but also the off site surface water pollution river channel and reservoir deposition and flood risk increasing lal 2001 wang et al 2019a liu et al 2020a how to control soil erosion effectively and economically is a long term and hard task for communities of scientists and engineers vegetation restoration has been widely considered as one most effective measure to control runoff and soil erosion across the world especially in arid and semi arid regions anache et al 2018 liang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 however vegetation restoration is probably not always positive for the sustainability of regional economic development cao et al 2011 the long term and large scale vegetation restoration is likely altering soil water balance and producing negative effects on river streamflow which further restricts the sustainable development of down reaches farley et al 2005 feng et al 2016 jia et al 2017 liu et al 2020b therefore it is vital to assess the effectiveness of vegetation to control runoff and soil erosion for the choice of vegetation restoration strategy under different climatic and topographic conditions on slopes runoff and soil erosion are primarily affected by rainfall topography soil properties vegetation properties and land uses anache et al 2018 chen et al 2018 gyssels et al 2005 mohammad and adam 2010 wei et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 rainfall is recognized as the key driving factor of runoff and soil erosion chen et al 2018 dos santos et al 2017 its effects are closely related to rainfall amount duration intensity kinetic energy and erosivity dos santos et al 2017 ran et al 2012 wei et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 among these rainfall characteristics rainfall intensity plays the most crucial role in runoff and soil erosion in regions controlled by infiltration excess runoff chen et al 2018 dos santos et al 2017 moreover due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of rainfall rainfall type also greatly affects the processes of runoff and soil erosion particularly in arid and semi arid regions duan et al 2021 feng et al 2020 liang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 taken the chinese loess plateau as an example most runoff and soil erosion are produced by a small number of rainstorm events with short rainfall duration but high intensity chen et al 2018 wei et al 2014 topography i e slope length aspect and gradient also greatly affects runoff and soil erosion fang and guo 2015 heras et al 2010 liu et al 2020c nord and esteves 2010 generally runoff and soil erosion increase with slope length wischmeier et al 1958 zhang et al 2018 whereas they likely decline with slope length under relative low intensity rainfall events heras et al 2010 due to the great differences in solar radiation vegetation growth and antecedent soil water content between different slope aspects runoff and soil erosion also differed significantly fang and guo 2015 sadeghi et al 2012 nevertheless the effect of slope gradient on runoff and soil erosion is complex runoff and soil erosion increase with slope gradient initially then decrease when the slope gradient is greater than the critical one liu et al 2020c wang et al 2019a in addition the reduction effects of vegetation in runoff and soil erosion also varied with slope gradient liu et al 2020c nord and esteves 2010 wang et al 2019a generally runoff and soil erosion reduction effects decline with slope gradient defersha and melesse 2012 wang et al 2019a the influences of vegetation properties on runoff and soil erosion are closely related to plant species community above ground biomass canopy coverage litter coverage and density and root mass density and its system gyssels et al 2005 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 many studies have demonstrated that runoff and soil erosion decreased significantly after revegetation plant community with multiple stratified structures is better in reducing runoff and soil erosion than that with a single stratified structure chen et al 2018 mohammad and adam 2010 zhang et al 2015 both runoff and erosion decrease with plant above ground biomass plant canopy litter coverage and density and root mass density de baets et al 2007 gyssels et al 2005 wang et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 furthermore the effects of vegetation on runoff and soil erosion are also related to the functions of plant root system de baets et al 2007 found that grass with fibrous root systems was more effective in preventing soil to be detached by flowing water than that with tap root systems which were further confirmed by some latter studies wang et al 2018 wang and zhang 2017 in addition the improvement of soil properties and development of biological crust also play considerable roles in influencing the processes of runoff and erosion zhang et al 2019a b zhu et al 2020a b overall vegetation affects runoff and soil erosion via intercepting rainfall eliminating rainfall kinetic energy preventing soil surface from raindrop splash increasing land surface roughness and infiltration capacity and decreasing runoff erosive power soil erodibility detachment capacity and sediment transport capacity directly and indirectly sun et al 2016 wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2020a b c taking the loess plateau as an example to control such serious soil erosion the chinese government has implemented a series of measures such as the implementation of the grain for green project zhao et al 2013 zhu et al 2020c as a result massive steep farmlands more than 25 have been converted to woodland shrub land or grassland vegetation restoration has significantly increased plant species diversity canopy coverage and biomass which consequently decreased runoff and soil erosion cao et al 2011 feng et al 2020 liang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 found that compare to bare land surface runoff and soil erosion decreased by 68 0 to 97 4 and 98 0 to 99 9 after vegetation restoration liu et al 2020c also found that vegetation restoration could decrease runoff and soil erosion effectively and forestland was more effective in reducing both runoff and soil erosion than grassland nevertheless due to the highly fragmented terrain steep slope and poor vegetation condition serious soil erosion still commonly occurs on steep gully slopes on the loess plateau chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a b and is widely recognized as the main sediment contributor at small watershed scales in the loess hilly and gully region of the loess plateau steep gully slope is the principal component in the small watershed accounts for approximately 42 of the total regional area zhang et al 2019a b therefore more attention needs to be paid to soil and water conservation on steep gully slopes some recent studies conducted on steep gully slopes concluded that vegetation growth i e plant species diversity above ground biomass canopy coverage litter density and root density and soil properties i e soil organic matter content infiltration rate soil detachment capacity and soil erodibility differed significantly between different gentle hillslopes and steep gully slopes and were also plant community dependence yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a b zhu et al 2020c as discussed above all these differences likely affect the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion on steep gully slopes however most previous studies related to the effects of plant communities or vegetation restoration on runoff and soil erosion were conducted under either natural rainfall events on gentle hillslopes or simulated rainfall events on steep slopes anache et al 2018 liang et al 2020 wang et al 2019a wei et al 2007 only chen et al 2018 investigated runoff soil erosion and their relationships under different vegetation types on steep slopes under natural rainfall events and found that grassland and shrub land with high ground cover were more effective in controlling runoff and soil erosion than forestland with poor ground cover however as mentioned above the effectiveness of vegetation in controlling runoff and erosion is closely related to rainfall characteristics and vegetation growth in arid and semi arid regions rainfall fluctuates greatly within a year and plant growth responds directly to rainfall thus consecutive field observation is needed to quantify the benefits of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and erosion on steep gully slopes therefore the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the variations in runoff and soil erosion using micro plots under typical plant communities 2 compare the reduction effects of runoff rre and soil erosion sre and the ratio of rre to sre rrsr between different plant communities 3 identify the main factors influencing the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion during a 3 year period consecutive observation on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid region i e the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and testing sites selection this study was carried out in the zhifanggou watershed 36 43 28 36 46 42 n 109 13 46 109 16 03 e elevation 1010 1431 m a s l area 8 27 km2 in ansai county of shaanxi province which is the field experimental site of the institute of soil and water conservation cas fig 1 the watershed locates in the core area of the loess plateau and belongs to the typical loess hilly gullied region the climate is a typical arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 8 8 and average annual precipitation of 505 mm 1970 2006 nevertheless about 70 of the total precipitation falls during the growing season from june to september as short heavy rainfall the dominant soil in the watershed is a typical silt loam texture usda soil texture classes and the soil type is classified as a calcaric regosols wrb soil classification system zhu et al 2020b currently the remaining vegetation in the watershed are forests robinia pseudoacacia and pinus tabuliformis shrubs caragana korshinskii and hippophae rhamnoides and grasses artemisia sacrorum artemisia giraldii and bothriochloa ischaemum restored by artificial planting or nature succession in order to select plant communities widely distributed on steep gully slopes a detailed field survey was conducted over the whole watershed in may 2018 finally one bare land as control two typical shrub communities of caragana korshinskii ck and hippophae rhamnoides hr and four typical grass communities of artemisia sacrorum as artemisia giraldii ag bothriochloa ischaemum bi and carex lanceolata cl distributed on different steep gully slopes were selected as the testing sites fig 1 plant communities of bi and cl had fibrous root systems and other four plant communities had tap root systems in each testing site runoff and soil erosion were measured by two replications the slope gradients of the tested sites range from 27 2 to 37 0 table 1 table 1 except for plant community of ck other five plant communities were restored by natural succession nevertheless all the selected plant communities were not disturbed by any human activities for more than twenty years thus some herbs i e artemisia sacrorum artemisia giraldii and bothriochloa ischaemum grew in the two typical shrub communities moreover the soil type and previous tillage operations of all the selected plant sites were similar the basic information of each testing site is listed in table 1 table 1 2 2 rainfall characteristics calculation and erosive rainfall event selection to eliminate the influence of the spatial distribution of rainfall two self recording tipping bucket rain gauges 6465 m with a 0 2 mm resolution were installed in two testing sites to record rainfall data at 1 min interval fig 1 based on these monitored rainfall data rainfall characteristics of each rainfall event e g rainfall amount p duration rd average intensity ari the maximum intensities of 5 minute i 5 15 minute i 15 30 minute i 30 and 60 minute i 60 total kinetic energy e 60 minute rainfall kinetic energy e 60 and rainfall erosivity ei 30 were calculated using rainrecord software version 1 06 which was developed by beijing normal university based on the calculated rainfall characteristics of each rainfall event the erosive rainfall events were selected according to three criterions presented by xie et al 2002 xie et al 2002 on the loess plateau of china they were 1 rainfall amount is equal to or greater than 12 mm 2 the average rainfall intensity is equal to or greater than 2 4 mm h 1 and 3 the 30 minute maximum rainfall intensity is equal to or greater than 13 3 mm h 1 once the rainfall event characteristics satisfied any one of these three criterions it was considered as the erosive rainfall event the monthly erosive rainfall characteristics of ari i 5 i 15 i 30 and i 60 were calculated as the mean ari i i 5i i 15i i 30i and i 60i of erosive rainfall events within one month holwerda et al 2010 holwerda et al 2010 moreover the monthly erosive rainfall characteristics of p rd e e 60 and ei 30 were computed as the sum p i rd i e i e 60i and ei 30i of erosive rainfall events within one month 2 3 runoff and soil erosion measurement runoff and soil erosion of each testing site were measured by two nearby micro runoff plots all 14 runoff plots were established in may 2018 with a projection area of 3 m2 3 m in length 1 m in width the runoff plots were bounded by impervious pvc sheets 20 cm in height 2 mm in thickness pvc sheet was inserted perpendicularly into the soil to a depth of approximately 10 cm and the remaining was protruding above soil surface to separate runoff and sediment from runoff plot at the downslope of runoff plots a plastic aqueduct and volumetric barrel 75 l were installed at the outlet of each runoff plot to collect runoff and sediment fig 1 the volumetric barrels were sealed by lids and thus the collected runoff within them could not be lost via evaporation the runoff and sediment were collected immediately after a heavy rain otherwise they were collected once for one month since no enough runoff and sediment were produced runoff was firstly determined via measuring the water level of the volumetric barrel then the runoff within the volumetric barrel was mixed thoroughly and the mixed runoff samples were collected using two 1000 ml plastic bottles if the runoff sample within the volumetric barrel was less than 2000 ml and all runoff was collected after that the volumetric barrel was cleaned to collect runoff and sediment for next erosive rainfall event the collected runoff samples were taken back to the laboratory to determine sediment concentration by oven dried method finally soil loss of the runoff plot was calculated via multiplying runoff volume and sediment concentration the mean of the observed results from the two runoff plots was considered as the observed runoff and soil loss for that tested site in this study runoff and soil erosion reflected by runoff depth mm and soil erosion modulus t km 2 were analyzed on monthly scale for three consecutive years from 2018 to 2020 the runoff depth r and soil erosion modulus sm were computed as 1 r v a 10 3 2 sm sl a where v is the monthly runoff volume m3 sl is the monthly soil loss g a is the projection area of runoff plot m2 soil erosion was greatly affected by slope gradient chen et al 2018 liu et al 1994 in this study the slope gradients were different between different testing sites table 1 to make the results comparable the computed soil erosion modulus for different plant communities were modified to slope gradient of bare land using the equation proposed by liu et al 1994 on steep slope 3 s m mod 21 91 sin θ 0 0 96 21 91 sin θ i 0 96 s m i where s m mod is the modified soil erosion modulus to the slope gradient of bare land t km 2 s m i is the soil erosion modulus of different plant communities calculated by eq 2 eqn 2 t km 2 θ 0 is the slope gradient of bare land θ i is the slope gradient of different plant communities 2 4 vegetation properties measurement vegetation properties except for plant canopy coverage were measured monthly nearby the runoff plots from may to october 2018 july to october 2019 and may to october 2020 with three replicates for six plant communities plant above ground biomass agb was determined by the harvested and oven dried method litter coverage lc and biological crust coverage bsc were measured by quadrat 50 cm 50 cm method litter density ld was determined by the water washed and oven dried method root mass density rmd of the top soil layer 0 10 cm was measured using a root drill 9 cm in diameter then water washed and oven dried nevertheless plant canopy coverage pc was determined monthly from may to october 2018 july to october 2019 and may to october 2020 by a photogrammetric method for three replicates at each runoff plot photos were taken by a camera canon eos 80d right above the runoff plot and applied to calculate plant canopy coverage by pcover software some detailed procedures were fully described in our previously published papers zhu et al 2020b c 2 5 percent runoff and soil erosion reduction calculation three indices were applied to reflect the effectiveness of plant community in reducing runoff and soil erosion which were percent runoff reduction rre percent soil erosion reduction sre and the ratio of percent runoff reduction to percent soil erosion reduction rrsr generally plant community with high rre and sre indicated more effective in reducing runoff and soil erosion conversely plant community with low rrsr implied more effective in reducing soil erosion than in reducing runoff in other words more runoff was produced for the same reduction in sediment rre sre and rrsr were calculated as following zhao et al 2014 4 rre r c r v r c 100 5 sre s c s v s c 100 6 rrsr rre sre 100 where r c and r v is the runoff depth of bare plot and plots covered by plant communities s c and s v is the soil erosion modulus of bare plot and plots covered by plant communities 2 6 data analysis the least significant difference lsd test of one way anova analysis was employed to detect the differences in vegetation properties runoff soil erosion and percent runoff and soil erosion reduction under different plant communities at 0 05 significance level the non linear regression method was applied to analyze the relationships between soil erosion and runoff pearson correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis methods were used to determine the relationships between runoff and soil erosion and rainfall characteristics and vegetation properties the goodness of the relationships was evaluated by pearson correlation coefficients and the coefficients of determination r 2 the path analysis method was utilized to determine the main factors influencing runoff and soil erosion all data were analyzed by ibm spss statistics software version 21 0 and origin pro 2016 software 3 results 3 1 runoff and soil erosion under different plant communities runoff and soil erosion were greatly affected by vegetation one way anova analysis showed that runoff and soil erosion decreased significantly p 0 05 after vegetation restoration fig 2 the average runoff and soil erosion of bare land were 8 13 mm and 331 26 t km 2 per month which were 7 4 14 3 2 0 3 1 3 7 9 0 and 127 2 324 9 8 2 16 9 23 8 159 3 times those of plant communities of ck hr as ag bi and cl respectively moreover runoff and soil erosion also differed greatly between different plant communities runoff and soil erosion of as were significantly greater p 0 05 than those of ck hr and cl fig 2 both runoff and soil erosion were influenced by vegetation type overall the average runoff of grass community 2 44 mm was 2 9 times that of shrub community 0 84 mm the average soil erosion of grass community 18 96 t km 2 was 10 5 times that of shrub community 1 81 t km 2 runoff and soil erosion fluctuated greatly over time during the three consecutive years nevertheless variations in monthly runoff and soil erosion follow the variations in monthly rainfall patterns as expected fig 3 the non linear regression analysis found that the relationships between runoff and soil erosion could be well fitted as a power function of sm αrβ the fitted coefficient α could be interpreted as soil loss per unit runoff reflecting the sensitivity of soil to be eroded in this study the fitted coefficient α also differed greatly between different communities plant community of bi had the maximum α whereas hr had the minimum one table 2 for different vegetation types the fitted coefficient α of bare land was the maximum 7 28 followed by the grass community 1 29 and shrub community 0 95 3 2 percent runoff and soil erosion reduction under different plant communities percent runoff and soil erosion reduction and their ratio varied greatly between different plant communities fig 4 the mean rre sre and rrsr varied from 37 5 to 93 0 83 9 to 99 6 and 43 4 to 93 4 with the mean of 75 7 95 6 and 77 7 plant community of hr had the maximum mean rre sre and rrsr whereas as had the minimum ones one way anova analysis indicated that rre sre and rrsr of as were significantly less than those of other five plant communities p 0 05 fig 4 moreover rre sre and rrsr also varied greatly between different vegetation types the mean rre sre and rrsr of shrub community and grass community were 91 0 99 5 91 5 and 68 0 93 7 70 7 the formers were 1 34 1 06 and 1 29 times those of the latters for grass communities the rre sre and rrsr were also significantly affected by root structure the mean rre sre and rrsr of tap and fibrous root systems were 50 7 89 2 55 0 and 85 2 98 1 86 5 respectively the formers were 0 60 0 91 and 0 64 times those of the latters in addition to quantify the effectiveness of different plant communities in controlling runoff and soil erosion under extreme rainfall events two extreme rainfall events were selected occurred on july 21 2019 and august 5 2020 with rainfall amounts of 73 8 mm and 125 8 mm the results showed that the rre sre and rrsr of different plant communities ranged from 42 60 to 99 61 85 46 to 99 99 and 46 56 to 99 56 table 3 the mean rre sre and rrsr were 93 29 99 98 93 31 and 75 83 96 72 77 62 for shrub and grass communities respectively these results implied that soil erosion of steep gully slopes could be controlled effectively after vegetation restoration even under extreme rainfall events shrub community was more effective in reducing runoff and soil erosion whereas grass community could also effectively control soil erosion and maintain runoff more effectively the effectiveness of plant communities in controlling runoff and soil erosion depends upon rainfall intensity for non extreme rainfall events the computed rre sre and rrsr of different plant communities ranged from 50 19 to 96 73 99 88 to 92 01 and 54 67 to 96 84 table 3 the mean rre sre and rrsr for shrub and grass communities were 95 13 99 85 95 26 and 77 68 96 95 79 75 compared to the results of extreme rainfall events the mean rre sre and rrsr were slightly great for both of shrub and grass communities under non extreme rainfall events except for sre of shrub community 3 3 factors influencing runoff and soil erosion the measured vegetation properties varied greatly between different plant communities table 1 plant community of ck had the maximum above ground biomass plant coverage litter coverage and density and root mass density whereas plant community of as had the minimum ones one way anova analysis indicated that vegetation properties of agb ld and rmd of ck were significantly greater than the other five plant communities p 0 05 overall all these vegetation properties of shrub community were significantly greater than those of grass community runoff and soil erosion were greatly affected by rainfall characteristics and vegetation properties on steep gully slopes the results of pearson correlation analysis indicated that both runoff and soil erosion of bare land and other five plant communities except for hr were positively correlated with rainfall characteristics tables a 1 a 2 runoff was significantly correlated with p rd e e 60 and ei 30 table 4 soil erosion was significantly correlated with p e e 60 and ei 30 for bare land and plant communities of as and bi whereas it was only significantly correlated with e 60 and ei 30 for plant communities of ck and cl table 4 nevertheless the relationships between runoff and soil erosion and rainfall intensity i e mri i 5 i 10 i 30 i 60 were not significant tables a 1 a 2 the results of pearson correlations analysis revealed that only an insignificant negative correlation was found between runoff and litter density table a 1 and an insignificant negative correlation was detected between soil erosion and litter coverage table a 2 in addition as expected runoff and soil erosion were greatly affected by the cover of biological crust for plant communities covered by biological crust runoff increased significantly with biological crust coverage table 4 table 4 moreover an insignificant increasing trend was also found between soil erosion and biological crust coverage table a 2 however the relationships between rrsr and rainfall characteristics and vegetation properties were complex except for hr negative relationships were found between rrsr and p i 5 i 15 e e 60 and ei 30 whereas a positive relationship was detected between rrsr and lc table a 3 rrsr was only significantly correlated with e 60 e 60 ei 30 and lc for plant communities of ck bi and cl table 4 moreover for plant communities covered by biological crust an insignificant negative correlation was determined between rrsr and biological crust coverage table a 3 3 4 estimation of runoff and soil erosion the long term measurement of runoff and soil erosion are time consuming costly and difficult in the field conditions especially on steep gully slopes thus it is valuable to estimate runoff and soil erosion via some easily calculated parameters according to the results of some previous studies the relationships between soil erosion and its influencing factors could be described as power functions thus we logarithmed the soil erosion modulus and its influencing factors quantified their linear relationships by stepwise regression analysis method and then converted the linear functions to power functions the results of stepwise regression analysis showed that runoff depth r could be estimated by p i 60 e 60 lc and bsc as a linear function with a r 2 of 0 73 soil erosion sm could be estimated by r i 30 pc and ld as a power function with a r 2 of 0 82 fig 5 the fitted equations were 7 r 0 02 p 0 10 i 60 0 14 e 60 0 005 l c 0 07 b s c 0 75 r 2 0 73 8 sm 10 3 96 r 1 24 i 30 0 87 p c 2 13 l d 0 44 r 2 0 82 where p is the rainfall amount mm i 60 is the maximum 60 minute intensity mm h 1 e 60 is the 60 minute rainfall kinetic energy mj hm 2 lc is the litter coverage bsc is the biological crust coverage i 30 is the maximum 30 minute intensity mm h 1 pc is the plant canopy coverage and ld is the litter density g m 2 4 discussions 4 1 variations in runoff and soil erosion with vegetation restoration runoff and soil erosion decreased significantly after re vegetation and varied greatly between different plant communities fig 2 these results are in accordance with the results of some previous studies anache et al 2018 chen et al 2018 liang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 2014 the changes in runoff and erosion with vegetation were contributed to the increasing of soil surface coverage and plant root mass density developing of biological crust and improving of soil structure i e soil porosity and water stable aggregate content increased wang et al 2017c zhang et al 2019a zhu et al 2020a these changes in near soil surface characteristics of plant community affected runoff and erosion via preventing soil surface from raindrop splash through intercepting raindrops and eliminating their kinetic energy salles et al 2000 wang et al 2020 zhang and xie 2019 increasing land surface roughness zhu et al 2020a b enhancing soil infiltration capacity zhu et al 2020c and decreasing soil erodibility soil detachment capacity and sediment transport capacity by overland flow wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2019a b the decrease in soil erosion with vegetation restoration was the comprehensive results of the reduction in erosive power and the enhancement in soil erodibility moreover vegetation properties i e agb pc lc ld and rmd biological crust coverage table 1 soil erodibility soil detachment capacity and infiltration rate varied greatly between different plant communities zhang et al 2019a b zhu et al 2020c which certainly trigged to the differences in runoff and soil erosion between different plant communities on steep gully slopes fig 2 overall the average runoff and soil erosion of grass community were significantly greater than those of shrub community on steep gully slopes fig 2 these results are contrast to the conclusions of zhang et al 2019a b who stated that both soil erodibility and detachment capacity by overland flow of shrub community were greater than those of grass community on steep gully slopes in their studies soil erodibility and soil detachment capacity by overland flow were evaluated or tested separately many processes related to hydrology i e interception infiltration land surface roughness and its effect on flow velocity or erosive power and erosion i e raindrops splash and sediment transport were not considered in the studies of zhang et al 2019a b this difference indicated that the influences of the changes in hydrological processes raindrop splash and sediment transport triggered by vegetation restoration were likely greater than those of the changes in erodibility and soil detachment capacity by overland flow the differences in observed runoff and soil erosion between shrub and grass communities agree with the results of some previous studies concluded on hillslopes mohammad and adam 2010 wei et al 2007 compare to grass shrub had multiple stratified structures due to the existence of understory herbs thereby reducing more runoff and soil erosion chen et al 2018 mohammad and adam 2010 this result was expected in regions with enough precipitation to provide soil water or good landscapes feeding enough soil nutrients for the growths of both shrub and understory herbs moreover some previous studies have demonstrated that runoff and soil erosion decreased with above ground biomass canopy and litter coverages and root mass density borrelli et al 2017 wei et al 2007 in this study the mean above ground biomass canopy coverage litter coverage and density and root mass density of the shrub were greater than those of grass table 1 the greater reductions in runoff and erosion from shrub than those from grass were expected furthermore infiltration rate of the shrub was also greater than that of the grass zhu et al 2020c which resulted in less runoff directly and thus less soil erosion indirectly in shrub plots 4 2 effects of rainfall and vegetation on surface runoff and soil erosion runoff and soil erosion modulus were closely related to rainfall characteristics and vegetation properties for rainfall characteristics except for plant community of hr runoff and soil erosion were positively correlated with rainfall amount duration intensity kinetic energy and erosivity tables a 1 a 2 these results are in line with the results of some previous studies mohamadi and kavian 2015 ran et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 rainfall with high intensity kinetic energy and erosivity splashes on soil surface strongly stimulating the formation of soil physical crust vandervaere et al 1997 consequently soil infiltration rate decreased whereas runoff amount and its velocity increased which likely further enhanced soil detachment capacity and sediment transport capacity by overland flow assouline 2004 nevertheless the negative relationships between rrsr and p i 5 i 15 e e 60 and ei 30 indicated that rainfall plays a worse role in reducing runoff than that of soil erosion for all testing sites runoff and soil erosion modulus were significantly negatively correlated with vegetation properties tables a 1 a 2 these results are consistent with the results of previous studies gyssels et al 2005 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 they found that runoff and erosion were negatively correlated to plant coverage above ground biomass litter coverage and density and root mass density however for each testing sites runoff and soil erosion modulus were insignificantly negatively correlated with most vegetation properties tables a 1 a 2 this difference was likely attributed to the seasonal and annual variations in rainfall and vegetation properties between different years as shown in fig 3 the seasonal distribution of monthly rainfall varied greatly between different years which directly influenced the growth of vegetation since the tested region has a typical semi arid climate thus the relationships between percent runoff and soil erosion reduction and vegetation properties were further analyzed in one growing season the results showed that rre and sre increased with agb pc lc and rmd fig 6 indicated that the effectiveness of vegetation in controlling runoff and soil erosion were enhanced with vegetation growth the cover of plant canopy and litter can intercept rainfall eliminate rainfall kinetic energy increase land surface roughness and prevent soil surface from raindrops directly chen et al 2018 gyssels et al 2005 zhu et al 2020a b which prevents the generation of runoff and occurrence of soil erosion plant litter can also reduce runoff and soil erosion indirectly via being incorporated into top soil layer which decreases soil erodibility and detachment capacity and increases erosion resistance and soil infiltration sun et al 2016 zhu et al 2020c moreover root system can promote soil erosion resistance via the physical binding and chemical exudate bonding effects de baets et al 2007 wang et al 2014 and enhance infiltration capacity by improving soil structure zhu et al 2020c thus reducing runoff and soil erosion in addition for plant communities covered with biological crust a significant positive relationship was found between runoff and bsc table 4 whereas an insignificant positive relationship was detected between soil erosion modules and bsc table a 2 these results are inconsistent with the conclusions of some previous studies belnap 2006 chamizo et al 2012 but agree with the outcome concluded by gao et al 2020 this difference may be attributed to the following two aspects firstly the formation and development of biological crust respond directly to rainfall in arid and semi arid regions in the studied area rainfall is concentrated on july and august and runoff and soil erosion modules as well as bsc were greater than other months secondly biological crust at the testing sites was dominated by cyanobacterial crusts which can form a relatively non porous layer when they are wetted wang et al 2017a b and thus increases runoff amount and its erosive power however the biological crust coverage was less than 40 and soil erosion from land surface not covered by biological crust likely increases due to the increased runoff erosive power consequently the positive relationships were detected between runoff soil erosion modules and bsc moreover the positive relationship between rrsr and lc and the negative relationship between rrsr and bsc suggested that litter coverage was more effective in reducing runoff than erosion whereas an opposite role was detected for biological crust as mentioned above the variations in runoff and soil erosion were affected by multiple factors tables a 1 a 2 therefore the path analysis was utilized to determine the main factors influencing runoff and soil erosion the results showed that runoff was dominantly affected by p i 30 e 60 lc and bsc with the sum path coefficients of 0 64 0 24 0 65 0 30 and 0 48 respectively table 5 this result indicated that lc had a negative effect whereas p i 30 e 60 and bsc had positive effects on runoff nevertheless the direct and indirect path coefficients of p i 30 e 60 lc and bsc were 0 52 0 18 0 27 0 03 0 43 and 0 12 0 42 0 38 0 27 0 05 correspondingly table 5 these results suggested that the influences of p and bsc on runoff were dominantly attributed to their direct effects whereas the effects of i 30 e 60 and lc were mainly contributed to their indirect effects the indirect effect of lc could affect biological crust indirectly via covering and promoting the decomposition of biological crust wu et al 2020 thereby reducing runoff soil erosion was dominantly affected by r i 30 pc and ld the corresponding sum path coefficients were 0 88 0 30 0 09 and 0 30 table 6 indicated that r and i 30 had positive effects whereas pc and ld had negative effects on soil erosion among these factors runoff r played the most significant role the direct and indirect path coefficients of r i 30 pc and ld were 0 82 0 19 0 16 0 09 and 0 06 0 11 0 07 0 21 table 6 implied r i 30 and pc influencing soil erosion directly whereas ld affecting erosion indirectly the indirect effect of plant litter could reduce r indirectly via intercepting rainfall and increasing infiltration thereby reducing soil erosion modulus 4 3 implications for vegetation restoration on steep slopes vegetation restoration can effectively control runoff and soil erosion especially in arid and semiarid regions however the function of vegetation is closely related to vegetation species the large scale inappropriate vegetation restoration might inhibit the growth or natural succession of on site vegetation via reducing soil water content and forming dried soil layer chen et al 2018 jia et al 2017 and restrict the sustainable development of off site river ecosystems via reducing river streamflow i e the yellow river farley et al 2005 feng et al 2016 therefore the vegetation restoration in these regions should be turned from reducing runoff and soil erosion to maintaining runoff while reducing soil erosion chen et al 2015 liu et al 2020b in this study the mean sre of shrub 99 5 and grass 93 7 was almost the same whereas the mean rre and rrsr of shrub 91 0 and 91 5 were significantly greater than those of grass 68 0 and 70 7 moreover the mean rre sre and rrsr of grass with tap root systems were 0 60 0 91 and 0 64 times those with fibrous root systems these results implied that shrub community was more effective in controlling runoff and soil erosion whereas grass community especially with tap root systems could also effectively control soil erosion while was more effective in maintaining runoff consequently grass community with tap root systems was suggested to be a more suitable and advisable choice for vegetation restoration on steep slope in arid and semiarid regions 5 conclusions this study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion on steep gully slopes based on the monthly measured data from 14 runoff plots for three consecutive years 2018 to 2020 the results showed that vegetation restoration could effectively reduce runoff and soil erosion by 37 5 to 93 0 and 83 9 to 99 6 under different plant communities the mean rre sre and rrsr of shrub and grass community were 91 0 99 5 91 5 and 68 0 93 7 70 7 respectively which suggested that shrub community was more effective in reducing runoff and soil erosion whereas grass community especially those with tap root systems could also effectively control soil erosion while maintaining runoff more effectively runoff and soil erosion varied greatly between different plant communities but their relationships could be well described by power functions runoff and soil erosion were positively correlated with rainfall characteristics and biological crust coverage whereas were negatively correlated with vegetation properties runoff was primarily affected by p i 30 e 60 lc and bsc while soil erosion was dominantly influenced by r i 30 pc and ld therefore grass community especially those with tap root systems is likely a more suitable and advisable choice for vegetation restoration on steep gully slope in arid and semiarid regions however more studies are needed in the future to monitor the long term change in soil water content and the potential effects in soil conservation benefit under these typical plant communities credit authorship contribution statement pingzong zhu conceptualization methodology formal analysis

4180,vegetation restoration is widely recognized as the most effective measure in controlling runoff and soil erosion under different climatic zones and topographical conditions nevertheless few studies have been performed to quantify its effectiveness in controlling runoff and soil erosion on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions this study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion and further identify its main factors influencing runoff and soil erosion under typical plant communities on steep gully slopes of the loess plateau china runoff and erosion were analyzed on monthly scale from 14 micro plots for three consecutive years 2018 2020 the results showed that vegetation restoration can effectively reduce runoff and erosion compare to bare land runoff and erosion reduced by 37 5 to 93 0 and 83 9 to 99 6 under different plant communities the mean percent runoff and soil erosion reduction and the ratio of percent runoff reduction to percent erosion reduction of shrub community were 1 34 1 06 and 1 29 times those of grass community the corresponding values of grass community with tap root systems were 0 60 0 91 and 0 64 times that with fibrous root systems shrub community was more effective than grass community in reducing erosion whereas grass community especially with tap root systems was more effective in maintaining runoff although runoff and erosion varied greatly between different plant communities their relationships could be well simulated by power functions variations in runoff were primarily affected by rainfall amount the maximum 30 minute intensity 60 minute rainfall kinetic energy litter coverage and biological crust coverage variations in erosion were dominantly influenced by runoff the maximum 30 minute intensity plant canopy coverage and litter density overall our study suggested that grass community especially with tap root systems is likely a more suitable and advisable choice for vegetation restoration on steep gully slope in arid and semiarid regions the results of this study provide the scientific guide for policy making of vegetation restoration on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions i e the loess plateau keywords vegetation restoration soil conservation runoff plot steep slope the loess plateau 1 introduction as one of the most severe worldwide eco environmental problem soil erosion by water not only produces on site soil and nutrient loss biodiversity reduction and land degradation but also the off site surface water pollution river channel and reservoir deposition and flood risk increasing lal 2001 wang et al 2019a liu et al 2020a how to control soil erosion effectively and economically is a long term and hard task for communities of scientists and engineers vegetation restoration has been widely considered as one most effective measure to control runoff and soil erosion across the world especially in arid and semi arid regions anache et al 2018 liang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 however vegetation restoration is probably not always positive for the sustainability of regional economic development cao et al 2011 the long term and large scale vegetation restoration is likely altering soil water balance and producing negative effects on river streamflow which further restricts the sustainable development of down reaches farley et al 2005 feng et al 2016 jia et al 2017 liu et al 2020b therefore it is vital to assess the effectiveness of vegetation to control runoff and soil erosion for the choice of vegetation restoration strategy under different climatic and topographic conditions on slopes runoff and soil erosion are primarily affected by rainfall topography soil properties vegetation properties and land uses anache et al 2018 chen et al 2018 gyssels et al 2005 mohammad and adam 2010 wei et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 rainfall is recognized as the key driving factor of runoff and soil erosion chen et al 2018 dos santos et al 2017 its effects are closely related to rainfall amount duration intensity kinetic energy and erosivity dos santos et al 2017 ran et al 2012 wei et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 among these rainfall characteristics rainfall intensity plays the most crucial role in runoff and soil erosion in regions controlled by infiltration excess runoff chen et al 2018 dos santos et al 2017 moreover due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of rainfall rainfall type also greatly affects the processes of runoff and soil erosion particularly in arid and semi arid regions duan et al 2021 feng et al 2020 liang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 taken the chinese loess plateau as an example most runoff and soil erosion are produced by a small number of rainstorm events with short rainfall duration but high intensity chen et al 2018 wei et al 2014 topography i e slope length aspect and gradient also greatly affects runoff and soil erosion fang and guo 2015 heras et al 2010 liu et al 2020c nord and esteves 2010 generally runoff and soil erosion increase with slope length wischmeier et al 1958 zhang et al 2018 whereas they likely decline with slope length under relative low intensity rainfall events heras et al 2010 due to the great differences in solar radiation vegetation growth and antecedent soil water content between different slope aspects runoff and soil erosion also differed significantly fang and guo 2015 sadeghi et al 2012 nevertheless the effect of slope gradient on runoff and soil erosion is complex runoff and soil erosion increase with slope gradient initially then decrease when the slope gradient is greater than the critical one liu et al 2020c wang et al 2019a in addition the reduction effects of vegetation in runoff and soil erosion also varied with slope gradient liu et al 2020c nord and esteves 2010 wang et al 2019a generally runoff and soil erosion reduction effects decline with slope gradient defersha and melesse 2012 wang et al 2019a the influences of vegetation properties on runoff and soil erosion are closely related to plant species community above ground biomass canopy coverage litter coverage and density and root mass density and its system gyssels et al 2005 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 many studies have demonstrated that runoff and soil erosion decreased significantly after revegetation plant community with multiple stratified structures is better in reducing runoff and soil erosion than that with a single stratified structure chen et al 2018 mohammad and adam 2010 zhang et al 2015 both runoff and erosion decrease with plant above ground biomass plant canopy litter coverage and density and root mass density de baets et al 2007 gyssels et al 2005 wang et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 furthermore the effects of vegetation on runoff and soil erosion are also related to the functions of plant root system de baets et al 2007 found that grass with fibrous root systems was more effective in preventing soil to be detached by flowing water than that with tap root systems which were further confirmed by some latter studies wang et al 2018 wang and zhang 2017 in addition the improvement of soil properties and development of biological crust also play considerable roles in influencing the processes of runoff and erosion zhang et al 2019a b zhu et al 2020a b overall vegetation affects runoff and soil erosion via intercepting rainfall eliminating rainfall kinetic energy preventing soil surface from raindrop splash increasing land surface roughness and infiltration capacity and decreasing runoff erosive power soil erodibility detachment capacity and sediment transport capacity directly and indirectly sun et al 2016 wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2020a b c taking the loess plateau as an example to control such serious soil erosion the chinese government has implemented a series of measures such as the implementation of the grain for green project zhao et al 2013 zhu et al 2020c as a result massive steep farmlands more than 25 have been converted to woodland shrub land or grassland vegetation restoration has significantly increased plant species diversity canopy coverage and biomass which consequently decreased runoff and soil erosion cao et al 2011 feng et al 2020 liang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 found that compare to bare land surface runoff and soil erosion decreased by 68 0 to 97 4 and 98 0 to 99 9 after vegetation restoration liu et al 2020c also found that vegetation restoration could decrease runoff and soil erosion effectively and forestland was more effective in reducing both runoff and soil erosion than grassland nevertheless due to the highly fragmented terrain steep slope and poor vegetation condition serious soil erosion still commonly occurs on steep gully slopes on the loess plateau chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a b and is widely recognized as the main sediment contributor at small watershed scales in the loess hilly and gully region of the loess plateau steep gully slope is the principal component in the small watershed accounts for approximately 42 of the total regional area zhang et al 2019a b therefore more attention needs to be paid to soil and water conservation on steep gully slopes some recent studies conducted on steep gully slopes concluded that vegetation growth i e plant species diversity above ground biomass canopy coverage litter density and root density and soil properties i e soil organic matter content infiltration rate soil detachment capacity and soil erodibility differed significantly between different gentle hillslopes and steep gully slopes and were also plant community dependence yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a b zhu et al 2020c as discussed above all these differences likely affect the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion on steep gully slopes however most previous studies related to the effects of plant communities or vegetation restoration on runoff and soil erosion were conducted under either natural rainfall events on gentle hillslopes or simulated rainfall events on steep slopes anache et al 2018 liang et al 2020 wang et al 2019a wei et al 2007 only chen et al 2018 investigated runoff soil erosion and their relationships under different vegetation types on steep slopes under natural rainfall events and found that grassland and shrub land with high ground cover were more effective in controlling runoff and soil erosion than forestland with poor ground cover however as mentioned above the effectiveness of vegetation in controlling runoff and erosion is closely related to rainfall characteristics and vegetation growth in arid and semi arid regions rainfall fluctuates greatly within a year and plant growth responds directly to rainfall thus consecutive field observation is needed to quantify the benefits of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and erosion on steep gully slopes therefore the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the variations in runoff and soil erosion using micro plots under typical plant communities 2 compare the reduction effects of runoff rre and soil erosion sre and the ratio of rre to sre rrsr between different plant communities 3 identify the main factors influencing the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion during a 3 year period consecutive observation on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid region i e the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and testing sites selection this study was carried out in the zhifanggou watershed 36 43 28 36 46 42 n 109 13 46 109 16 03 e elevation 1010 1431 m a s l area 8 27 km2 in ansai county of shaanxi province which is the field experimental site of the institute of soil and water conservation cas fig 1 the watershed locates in the core area of the loess plateau and belongs to the typical loess hilly gullied region the climate is a typical arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 8 8 and average annual precipitation of 505 mm 1970 2006 nevertheless about 70 of the total precipitation falls during the growing season from june to september as short heavy rainfall the dominant soil in the watershed is a typical silt loam texture usda soil texture classes and the soil type is classified as a calcaric regosols wrb soil classification system zhu et al 2020b currently the remaining vegetation in the watershed are forests robinia pseudoacacia and pinus tabuliformis shrubs caragana korshinskii and hippophae rhamnoides and grasses artemisia sacrorum artemisia giraldii and bothriochloa ischaemum restored by artificial planting or nature succession in order to select plant communities widely distributed on steep gully slopes a detailed field survey was conducted over the whole watershed in may 2018 finally one bare land as control two typical shrub communities of caragana korshinskii ck and hippophae rhamnoides hr and four typical grass communities of artemisia sacrorum as artemisia giraldii ag bothriochloa ischaemum bi and carex lanceolata cl distributed on different steep gully slopes were selected as the testing sites fig 1 plant communities of bi and cl had fibrous root systems and other four plant communities had tap root systems in each testing site runoff and soil erosion were measured by two replications the slope gradients of the tested sites range from 27 2 to 37 0 table 1 table 1 except for plant community of ck other five plant communities were restored by natural succession nevertheless all the selected plant communities were not disturbed by any human activities for more than twenty years thus some herbs i e artemisia sacrorum artemisia giraldii and bothriochloa ischaemum grew in the two typical shrub communities moreover the soil type and previous tillage operations of all the selected plant sites were similar the basic information of each testing site is listed in table 1 table 1 2 2 rainfall characteristics calculation and erosive rainfall event selection to eliminate the influence of the spatial distribution of rainfall two self recording tipping bucket rain gauges 6465 m with a 0 2 mm resolution were installed in two testing sites to record rainfall data at 1 min interval fig 1 based on these monitored rainfall data rainfall characteristics of each rainfall event e g rainfall amount p duration rd average intensity ari the maximum intensities of 5 minute i 5 15 minute i 15 30 minute i 30 and 60 minute i 60 total kinetic energy e 60 minute rainfall kinetic energy e 60 and rainfall erosivity ei 30 were calculated using rainrecord software version 1 06 which was developed by beijing normal university based on the calculated rainfall characteristics of each rainfall event the erosive rainfall events were selected according to three criterions presented by xie et al 2002 xie et al 2002 on the loess plateau of china they were 1 rainfall amount is equal to or greater than 12 mm 2 the average rainfall intensity is equal to or greater than 2 4 mm h 1 and 3 the 30 minute maximum rainfall intensity is equal to or greater than 13 3 mm h 1 once the rainfall event characteristics satisfied any one of these three criterions it was considered as the erosive rainfall event the monthly erosive rainfall characteristics of ari i 5 i 15 i 30 and i 60 were calculated as the mean ari i i 5i i 15i i 30i and i 60i of erosive rainfall events within one month holwerda et al 2010 holwerda et al 2010 moreover the monthly erosive rainfall characteristics of p rd e e 60 and ei 30 were computed as the sum p i rd i e i e 60i and ei 30i of erosive rainfall events within one month 2 3 runoff and soil erosion measurement runoff and soil erosion of each testing site were measured by two nearby micro runoff plots all 14 runoff plots were established in may 2018 with a projection area of 3 m2 3 m in length 1 m in width the runoff plots were bounded by impervious pvc sheets 20 cm in height 2 mm in thickness pvc sheet was inserted perpendicularly into the soil to a depth of approximately 10 cm and the remaining was protruding above soil surface to separate runoff and sediment from runoff plot at the downslope of runoff plots a plastic aqueduct and volumetric barrel 75 l were installed at the outlet of each runoff plot to collect runoff and sediment fig 1 the volumetric barrels were sealed by lids and thus the collected runoff within them could not be lost via evaporation the runoff and sediment were collected immediately after a heavy rain otherwise they were collected once for one month since no enough runoff and sediment were produced runoff was firstly determined via measuring the water level of the volumetric barrel then the runoff within the volumetric barrel was mixed thoroughly and the mixed runoff samples were collected using two 1000 ml plastic bottles if the runoff sample within the volumetric barrel was less than 2000 ml and all runoff was collected after that the volumetric barrel was cleaned to collect runoff and sediment for next erosive rainfall event the collected runoff samples were taken back to the laboratory to determine sediment concentration by oven dried method finally soil loss of the runoff plot was calculated via multiplying runoff volume and sediment concentration the mean of the observed results from the two runoff plots was considered as the observed runoff and soil loss for that tested site in this study runoff and soil erosion reflected by runoff depth mm and soil erosion modulus t km 2 were analyzed on monthly scale for three consecutive years from 2018 to 2020 the runoff depth r and soil erosion modulus sm were computed as 1 r v a 10 3 2 sm sl a where v is the monthly runoff volume m3 sl is the monthly soil loss g a is the projection area of runoff plot m2 soil erosion was greatly affected by slope gradient chen et al 2018 liu et al 1994 in this study the slope gradients were different between different testing sites table 1 to make the results comparable the computed soil erosion modulus for different plant communities were modified to slope gradient of bare land using the equation proposed by liu et al 1994 on steep slope 3 s m mod 21 91 sin θ 0 0 96 21 91 sin θ i 0 96 s m i where s m mod is the modified soil erosion modulus to the slope gradient of bare land t km 2 s m i is the soil erosion modulus of different plant communities calculated by eq 2 eqn 2 t km 2 θ 0 is the slope gradient of bare land θ i is the slope gradient of different plant communities 2 4 vegetation properties measurement vegetation properties except for plant canopy coverage were measured monthly nearby the runoff plots from may to october 2018 july to october 2019 and may to october 2020 with three replicates for six plant communities plant above ground biomass agb was determined by the harvested and oven dried method litter coverage lc and biological crust coverage bsc were measured by quadrat 50 cm 50 cm method litter density ld was determined by the water washed and oven dried method root mass density rmd of the top soil layer 0 10 cm was measured using a root drill 9 cm in diameter then water washed and oven dried nevertheless plant canopy coverage pc was determined monthly from may to october 2018 july to october 2019 and may to october 2020 by a photogrammetric method for three replicates at each runoff plot photos were taken by a camera canon eos 80d right above the runoff plot and applied to calculate plant canopy coverage by pcover software some detailed procedures were fully described in our previously published papers zhu et al 2020b c 2 5 percent runoff and soil erosion reduction calculation three indices were applied to reflect the effectiveness of plant community in reducing runoff and soil erosion which were percent runoff reduction rre percent soil erosion reduction sre and the ratio of percent runoff reduction to percent soil erosion reduction rrsr generally plant community with high rre and sre indicated more effective in reducing runoff and soil erosion conversely plant community with low rrsr implied more effective in reducing soil erosion than in reducing runoff in other words more runoff was produced for the same reduction in sediment rre sre and rrsr were calculated as following zhao et al 2014 4 rre r c r v r c 100 5 sre s c s v s c 100 6 rrsr rre sre 100 where r c and r v is the runoff depth of bare plot and plots covered by plant communities s c and s v is the soil erosion modulus of bare plot and plots covered by plant communities 2 6 data analysis the least significant difference lsd test of one way anova analysis was employed to detect the differences in vegetation properties runoff soil erosion and percent runoff and soil erosion reduction under different plant communities at 0 05 significance level the non linear regression method was applied to analyze the relationships between soil erosion and runoff pearson correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis methods were used to determine the relationships between runoff and soil erosion and rainfall characteristics and vegetation properties the goodness of the relationships was evaluated by pearson correlation coefficients and the coefficients of determination r 2 the path analysis method was utilized to determine the main factors influencing runoff and soil erosion all data were analyzed by ibm spss statistics software version 21 0 and origin pro 2016 software 3 results 3 1 runoff and soil erosion under different plant communities runoff and soil erosion were greatly affected by vegetation one way anova analysis showed that runoff and soil erosion decreased significantly p 0 05 after vegetation restoration fig 2 the average runoff and soil erosion of bare land were 8 13 mm and 331 26 t km 2 per month which were 7 4 14 3 2 0 3 1 3 7 9 0 and 127 2 324 9 8 2 16 9 23 8 159 3 times those of plant communities of ck hr as ag bi and cl respectively moreover runoff and soil erosion also differed greatly between different plant communities runoff and soil erosion of as were significantly greater p 0 05 than those of ck hr and cl fig 2 both runoff and soil erosion were influenced by vegetation type overall the average runoff of grass community 2 44 mm was 2 9 times that of shrub community 0 84 mm the average soil erosion of grass community 18 96 t km 2 was 10 5 times that of shrub community 1 81 t km 2 runoff and soil erosion fluctuated greatly over time during the three consecutive years nevertheless variations in monthly runoff and soil erosion follow the variations in monthly rainfall patterns as expected fig 3 the non linear regression analysis found that the relationships between runoff and soil erosion could be well fitted as a power function of sm αrβ the fitted coefficient α could be interpreted as soil loss per unit runoff reflecting the sensitivity of soil to be eroded in this study the fitted coefficient α also differed greatly between different communities plant community of bi had the maximum α whereas hr had the minimum one table 2 for different vegetation types the fitted coefficient α of bare land was the maximum 7 28 followed by the grass community 1 29 and shrub community 0 95 3 2 percent runoff and soil erosion reduction under different plant communities percent runoff and soil erosion reduction and their ratio varied greatly between different plant communities fig 4 the mean rre sre and rrsr varied from 37 5 to 93 0 83 9 to 99 6 and 43 4 to 93 4 with the mean of 75 7 95 6 and 77 7 plant community of hr had the maximum mean rre sre and rrsr whereas as had the minimum ones one way anova analysis indicated that rre sre and rrsr of as were significantly less than those of other five plant communities p 0 05 fig 4 moreover rre sre and rrsr also varied greatly between different vegetation types the mean rre sre and rrsr of shrub community and grass community were 91 0 99 5 91 5 and 68 0 93 7 70 7 the formers were 1 34 1 06 and 1 29 times those of the latters for grass communities the rre sre and rrsr were also significantly affected by root structure the mean rre sre and rrsr of tap and fibrous root systems were 50 7 89 2 55 0 and 85 2 98 1 86 5 respectively the formers were 0 60 0 91 and 0 64 times those of the latters in addition to quantify the effectiveness of different plant communities in controlling runoff and soil erosion under extreme rainfall events two extreme rainfall events were selected occurred on july 21 2019 and august 5 2020 with rainfall amounts of 73 8 mm and 125 8 mm the results showed that the rre sre and rrsr of different plant communities ranged from 42 60 to 99 61 85 46 to 99 99 and 46 56 to 99 56 table 3 the mean rre sre and rrsr were 93 29 99 98 93 31 and 75 83 96 72 77 62 for shrub and grass communities respectively these results implied that soil erosion of steep gully slopes could be controlled effectively after vegetation restoration even under extreme rainfall events shrub community was more effective in reducing runoff and soil erosion whereas grass community could also effectively control soil erosion and maintain runoff more effectively the effectiveness of plant communities in controlling runoff and soil erosion depends upon rainfall intensity for non extreme rainfall events the computed rre sre and rrsr of different plant communities ranged from 50 19 to 96 73 99 88 to 92 01 and 54 67 to 96 84 table 3 the mean rre sre and rrsr for shrub and grass communities were 95 13 99 85 95 26 and 77 68 96 95 79 75 compared to the results of extreme rainfall events the mean rre sre and rrsr were slightly great for both of shrub and grass communities under non extreme rainfall events except for sre of shrub community 3 3 factors influencing runoff and soil erosion the measured vegetation properties varied greatly between different plant communities table 1 plant community of ck had the maximum above ground biomass plant coverage litter coverage and density and root mass density whereas plant community of as had the minimum ones one way anova analysis indicated that vegetation properties of agb ld and rmd of ck were significantly greater than the other five plant communities p 0 05 overall all these vegetation properties of shrub community were significantly greater than those of grass community runoff and soil erosion were greatly affected by rainfall characteristics and vegetation properties on steep gully slopes the results of pearson correlation analysis indicated that both runoff and soil erosion of bare land and other five plant communities except for hr were positively correlated with rainfall characteristics tables a 1 a 2 runoff was significantly correlated with p rd e e 60 and ei 30 table 4 soil erosion was significantly correlated with p e e 60 and ei 30 for bare land and plant communities of as and bi whereas it was only significantly correlated with e 60 and ei 30 for plant communities of ck and cl table 4 nevertheless the relationships between runoff and soil erosion and rainfall intensity i e mri i 5 i 10 i 30 i 60 were not significant tables a 1 a 2 the results of pearson correlations analysis revealed that only an insignificant negative correlation was found between runoff and litter density table a 1 and an insignificant negative correlation was detected between soil erosion and litter coverage table a 2 in addition as expected runoff and soil erosion were greatly affected by the cover of biological crust for plant communities covered by biological crust runoff increased significantly with biological crust coverage table 4 table 4 moreover an insignificant increasing trend was also found between soil erosion and biological crust coverage table a 2 however the relationships between rrsr and rainfall characteristics and vegetation properties were complex except for hr negative relationships were found between rrsr and p i 5 i 15 e e 60 and ei 30 whereas a positive relationship was detected between rrsr and lc table a 3 rrsr was only significantly correlated with e 60 e 60 ei 30 and lc for plant communities of ck bi and cl table 4 moreover for plant communities covered by biological crust an insignificant negative correlation was determined between rrsr and biological crust coverage table a 3 3 4 estimation of runoff and soil erosion the long term measurement of runoff and soil erosion are time consuming costly and difficult in the field conditions especially on steep gully slopes thus it is valuable to estimate runoff and soil erosion via some easily calculated parameters according to the results of some previous studies the relationships between soil erosion and its influencing factors could be described as power functions thus we logarithmed the soil erosion modulus and its influencing factors quantified their linear relationships by stepwise regression analysis method and then converted the linear functions to power functions the results of stepwise regression analysis showed that runoff depth r could be estimated by p i 60 e 60 lc and bsc as a linear function with a r 2 of 0 73 soil erosion sm could be estimated by r i 30 pc and ld as a power function with a r 2 of 0 82 fig 5 the fitted equations were 7 r 0 02 p 0 10 i 60 0 14 e 60 0 005 l c 0 07 b s c 0 75 r 2 0 73 8 sm 10 3 96 r 1 24 i 30 0 87 p c 2 13 l d 0 44 r 2 0 82 where p is the rainfall amount mm i 60 is the maximum 60 minute intensity mm h 1 e 60 is the 60 minute rainfall kinetic energy mj hm 2 lc is the litter coverage bsc is the biological crust coverage i 30 is the maximum 30 minute intensity mm h 1 pc is the plant canopy coverage and ld is the litter density g m 2 4 discussions 4 1 variations in runoff and soil erosion with vegetation restoration runoff and soil erosion decreased significantly after re vegetation and varied greatly between different plant communities fig 2 these results are in accordance with the results of some previous studies anache et al 2018 chen et al 2018 liang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 2014 the changes in runoff and erosion with vegetation were contributed to the increasing of soil surface coverage and plant root mass density developing of biological crust and improving of soil structure i e soil porosity and water stable aggregate content increased wang et al 2017c zhang et al 2019a zhu et al 2020a these changes in near soil surface characteristics of plant community affected runoff and erosion via preventing soil surface from raindrop splash through intercepting raindrops and eliminating their kinetic energy salles et al 2000 wang et al 2020 zhang and xie 2019 increasing land surface roughness zhu et al 2020a b enhancing soil infiltration capacity zhu et al 2020c and decreasing soil erodibility soil detachment capacity and sediment transport capacity by overland flow wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2019a b the decrease in soil erosion with vegetation restoration was the comprehensive results of the reduction in erosive power and the enhancement in soil erodibility moreover vegetation properties i e agb pc lc ld and rmd biological crust coverage table 1 soil erodibility soil detachment capacity and infiltration rate varied greatly between different plant communities zhang et al 2019a b zhu et al 2020c which certainly trigged to the differences in runoff and soil erosion between different plant communities on steep gully slopes fig 2 overall the average runoff and soil erosion of grass community were significantly greater than those of shrub community on steep gully slopes fig 2 these results are contrast to the conclusions of zhang et al 2019a b who stated that both soil erodibility and detachment capacity by overland flow of shrub community were greater than those of grass community on steep gully slopes in their studies soil erodibility and soil detachment capacity by overland flow were evaluated or tested separately many processes related to hydrology i e interception infiltration land surface roughness and its effect on flow velocity or erosive power and erosion i e raindrops splash and sediment transport were not considered in the studies of zhang et al 2019a b this difference indicated that the influences of the changes in hydrological processes raindrop splash and sediment transport triggered by vegetation restoration were likely greater than those of the changes in erodibility and soil detachment capacity by overland flow the differences in observed runoff and soil erosion between shrub and grass communities agree with the results of some previous studies concluded on hillslopes mohammad and adam 2010 wei et al 2007 compare to grass shrub had multiple stratified structures due to the existence of understory herbs thereby reducing more runoff and soil erosion chen et al 2018 mohammad and adam 2010 this result was expected in regions with enough precipitation to provide soil water or good landscapes feeding enough soil nutrients for the growths of both shrub and understory herbs moreover some previous studies have demonstrated that runoff and soil erosion decreased with above ground biomass canopy and litter coverages and root mass density borrelli et al 2017 wei et al 2007 in this study the mean above ground biomass canopy coverage litter coverage and density and root mass density of the shrub were greater than those of grass table 1 the greater reductions in runoff and erosion from shrub than those from grass were expected furthermore infiltration rate of the shrub was also greater than that of the grass zhu et al 2020c which resulted in less runoff directly and thus less soil erosion indirectly in shrub plots 4 2 effects of rainfall and vegetation on surface runoff and soil erosion runoff and soil erosion modulus were closely related to rainfall characteristics and vegetation properties for rainfall characteristics except for plant community of hr runoff and soil erosion were positively correlated with rainfall amount duration intensity kinetic energy and erosivity tables a 1 a 2 these results are in line with the results of some previous studies mohamadi and kavian 2015 ran et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 rainfall with high intensity kinetic energy and erosivity splashes on soil surface strongly stimulating the formation of soil physical crust vandervaere et al 1997 consequently soil infiltration rate decreased whereas runoff amount and its velocity increased which likely further enhanced soil detachment capacity and sediment transport capacity by overland flow assouline 2004 nevertheless the negative relationships between rrsr and p i 5 i 15 e e 60 and ei 30 indicated that rainfall plays a worse role in reducing runoff than that of soil erosion for all testing sites runoff and soil erosion modulus were significantly negatively correlated with vegetation properties tables a 1 a 2 these results are consistent with the results of previous studies gyssels et al 2005 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 they found that runoff and erosion were negatively correlated to plant coverage above ground biomass litter coverage and density and root mass density however for each testing sites runoff and soil erosion modulus were insignificantly negatively correlated with most vegetation properties tables a 1 a 2 this difference was likely attributed to the seasonal and annual variations in rainfall and vegetation properties between different years as shown in fig 3 the seasonal distribution of monthly rainfall varied greatly between different years which directly influenced the growth of vegetation since the tested region has a typical semi arid climate thus the relationships between percent runoff and soil erosion reduction and vegetation properties were further analyzed in one growing season the results showed that rre and sre increased with agb pc lc and rmd fig 6 indicated that the effectiveness of vegetation in controlling runoff and soil erosion were enhanced with vegetation growth the cover of plant canopy and litter can intercept rainfall eliminate rainfall kinetic energy increase land surface roughness and prevent soil surface from raindrops directly chen et al 2018 gyssels et al 2005 zhu et al 2020a b which prevents the generation of runoff and occurrence of soil erosion plant litter can also reduce runoff and soil erosion indirectly via being incorporated into top soil layer which decreases soil erodibility and detachment capacity and increases erosion resistance and soil infiltration sun et al 2016 zhu et al 2020c moreover root system can promote soil erosion resistance via the physical binding and chemical exudate bonding effects de baets et al 2007 wang et al 2014 and enhance infiltration capacity by improving soil structure zhu et al 2020c thus reducing runoff and soil erosion in addition for plant communities covered with biological crust a significant positive relationship was found between runoff and bsc table 4 whereas an insignificant positive relationship was detected between soil erosion modules and bsc table a 2 these results are inconsistent with the conclusions of some previous studies belnap 2006 chamizo et al 2012 but agree with the outcome concluded by gao et al 2020 this difference may be attributed to the following two aspects firstly the formation and development of biological crust respond directly to rainfall in arid and semi arid regions in the studied area rainfall is concentrated on july and august and runoff and soil erosion modules as well as bsc were greater than other months secondly biological crust at the testing sites was dominated by cyanobacterial crusts which can form a relatively non porous layer when they are wetted wang et al 2017a b and thus increases runoff amount and its erosive power however the biological crust coverage was less than 40 and soil erosion from land surface not covered by biological crust likely increases due to the increased runoff erosive power consequently the positive relationships were detected between runoff soil erosion modules and bsc moreover the positive relationship between rrsr and lc and the negative relationship between rrsr and bsc suggested that litter coverage was more effective in reducing runoff than erosion whereas an opposite role was detected for biological crust as mentioned above the variations in runoff and soil erosion were affected by multiple factors tables a 1 a 2 therefore the path analysis was utilized to determine the main factors influencing runoff and soil erosion the results showed that runoff was dominantly affected by p i 30 e 60 lc and bsc with the sum path coefficients of 0 64 0 24 0 65 0 30 and 0 48 respectively table 5 this result indicated that lc had a negative effect whereas p i 30 e 60 and bsc had positive effects on runoff nevertheless the direct and indirect path coefficients of p i 30 e 60 lc and bsc were 0 52 0 18 0 27 0 03 0 43 and 0 12 0 42 0 38 0 27 0 05 correspondingly table 5 these results suggested that the influences of p and bsc on runoff were dominantly attributed to their direct effects whereas the effects of i 30 e 60 and lc were mainly contributed to their indirect effects the indirect effect of lc could affect biological crust indirectly via covering and promoting the decomposition of biological crust wu et al 2020 thereby reducing runoff soil erosion was dominantly affected by r i 30 pc and ld the corresponding sum path coefficients were 0 88 0 30 0 09 and 0 30 table 6 indicated that r and i 30 had positive effects whereas pc and ld had negative effects on soil erosion among these factors runoff r played the most significant role the direct and indirect path coefficients of r i 30 pc and ld were 0 82 0 19 0 16 0 09 and 0 06 0 11 0 07 0 21 table 6 implied r i 30 and pc influencing soil erosion directly whereas ld affecting erosion indirectly the indirect effect of plant litter could reduce r indirectly via intercepting rainfall and increasing infiltration thereby reducing soil erosion modulus 4 3 implications for vegetation restoration on steep slopes vegetation restoration can effectively control runoff and soil erosion especially in arid and semiarid regions however the function of vegetation is closely related to vegetation species the large scale inappropriate vegetation restoration might inhibit the growth or natural succession of on site vegetation via reducing soil water content and forming dried soil layer chen et al 2018 jia et al 2017 and restrict the sustainable development of off site river ecosystems via reducing river streamflow i e the yellow river farley et al 2005 feng et al 2016 therefore the vegetation restoration in these regions should be turned from reducing runoff and soil erosion to maintaining runoff while reducing soil erosion chen et al 2015 liu et al 2020b in this study the mean sre of shrub 99 5 and grass 93 7 was almost the same whereas the mean rre and rrsr of shrub 91 0 and 91 5 were significantly greater than those of grass 68 0 and 70 7 moreover the mean rre sre and rrsr of grass with tap root systems were 0 60 0 91 and 0 64 times those with fibrous root systems these results implied that shrub community was more effective in controlling runoff and soil erosion whereas grass community especially with tap root systems could also effectively control soil erosion while was more effective in maintaining runoff consequently grass community with tap root systems was suggested to be a more suitable and advisable choice for vegetation restoration on steep slope in arid and semiarid regions 5 conclusions this study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion on steep gully slopes based on the monthly measured data from 14 runoff plots for three consecutive years 2018 to 2020 the results showed that vegetation restoration could effectively reduce runoff and soil erosion by 37 5 to 93 0 and 83 9 to 99 6 under different plant communities the mean rre sre and rrsr of shrub and grass community were 91 0 99 5 91 5 and 68 0 93 7 70 7 respectively which suggested that shrub community was more effective in reducing runoff and soil erosion whereas grass community especially those with tap root systems could also effectively control soil erosion while maintaining runoff more effectively runoff and soil erosion varied greatly between different plant communities but their relationships could be well described by power functions runoff and soil erosion were positively correlated with rainfall characteristics and biological crust coverage whereas were negatively correlated with vegetation properties runoff was primarily affected by p i 30 e 60 lc and bsc while soil erosion was dominantly influenced by r i 30 pc and ld therefore grass community especially those with tap root systems is likely a more suitable and advisable choice for vegetation restoration on steep gully slope in arid and semiarid regions however more studies are needed in the future to monitor the long term change in soil water content and the potential effects in soil conservation benefit under these typical plant communities credit authorship contribution statement pingzong zhu conceptualization methodology formal analysis

4181,in this study a low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr apparatus with the ability to adjust sample temperatures was used to measure the unfrozen water content of frozen soils sampled from the qinghai tibet plateau based on low field nmr theory two cutoff values were proposed to quantitatively identify three types of unfrozen water bulk capillary and bound water in the frozen soils the influences of soil properties the clay content particle size distribution and clay mineral content on these three different types of unfrozen water during the soil freezing process were analyzed the results showed that the soil freezing characteristic curve of unfrozen water could be divided into three stages namely the unfrozen the rapid drop and the residual stages in the rapid drop stage the unfrozen bound water content increases gradually with the increasing clay or clay mineral content and at a certain temperature the unfrozen capillary water content increases as the sand and silt content increases a published power function model is then used to fit the measured data in this study we found that the single parameter related to soil properties in this model could not sufficiently reflect the influence of clay mineral content or clay content on unfrozen water content keywords two cutoff values unfrozen water content soil properties soil freezing characteristic curve nuclear magnetic resonance 1 introduction due to the complex pore structure of soil solute concentration and cohesive and adhesive forces a certain amount of water remains unfrozen in soils at sub freezing temperatures chai et al 2018 kong et al 2020 lara et al 2021 watanabe and wake 2009 xu et al 2001 this is termed unfrozen water the unfrozen water content θ u has a remarkable influence on the dynamic properties hydraulic characteristics and thermodynamic properties of frozen soils kong et al 2020 watanabe and wake 2009 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 therefore investigating θ u and its corresponding influential factors is of great importance for the understanding of hydrological processes and engineering design in cold regions according to previous studies many factors influence θ u including the initial water content freeze thaw cycles dry soil density and soil properties e g the particle size distribution psd clay mineral content and clay content bing et al 2007 chai et al 2018 ishizaki et al 1996 wen et al 2012 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2001 the relationship between the θ u and temperature which is represented by the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc was proposed by many studies kong et al 2020 koopmans and miller 1966 pardo lara et al 2020 lara et al 2021 tian et al 2018 watanabe and wake 2009 wen et al 2012 determined sfccs by investigating the silty clay on the qinghai tibet plateau they found that initial water content and clay content had significant influences on the freezing point and θ u although θ u was confirmed to be sensitive to soil properties at the same temperature kong et al 2020 few studies have been conducted to establish the relationship between soil properties and θ u in particular most researchers only considered the effect of clay content on θ u kozlowski and nartowska 2013 kruse and darrow 2017 tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in fact there are differences between clay and clay minerals clay is a type of fine grained natural soil material that contains clay minerals clay minerals are hydrous aluminum phyllosilicates in other words the clay content and the clay mineral content have different influences on θ u therefore it is important to study the influence of soil properties e g the particle size distribution clay content and clay mineral content on θ u in frozen soils many methods and techniques are available to measure θ u in frozen soils including thermal resistance temperature probes bittelli et al 2003 wen et al 2012 capacitance techniques li et al 2018 differential scanning calorimetry dsc kozlowski and nartowska 2013 time domain reflectometry tdr watanabe and wake 2009 zhou et al 2014 and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr kong et al 2020 stingaciu et al 2009 tian et al 2018 watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 yuan et al 2018 tdr and nmr are two commonly used methods smith and tice 1988 tian et al 2014 watanabe and wake 2009 tdr is fast cheap and portable but it remains unclear whether the soil dielectric constant measured by tdr can be used to effectively determine the unfrozen pore water content this is because that in tdr calibration equations it is implicitly assumed that the dielectric constant of ice is equal to that of air and the effects of temperature on the liquid water dielectric constant are neglected seyfried and murdock 1996 wang et al 2011 however nmr has proven useful for studying θ u in frozen soils without damaging the soil or disturbing the sample liu et al 2020 it is well known that the water in soils is classified as bulk water capillary water and bound water according to its form of existence the bound water is defined as the water in the electric double layer while the water outside the electric double layer can be divided into capillary water and bulk water i e gravitational water previous studies have shown that the soil water type varies for different soils chai et al 2018 mu et al 2018 for accurate determination of θ u and analysis of the influence of soil properties on θ u one needs first distinguish the unfrozen pore water nmr is not only capable of measuring θ u in frozen soils but is also used to divide the pore water in soils into different types coates et al 1999 tian et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 based on the t 2 distribution curve of saturated soil tested by nmr t 2 cutoffs have been used to distinguish different types of pore water coates et al 1999 in the past decades many studies have focused on defining nmr t 2 cutoffs and distinguishing different types of pore water bouton et al 1996 morriss et al 1997 saidian and prasad 2015 yuan et al 2018 most of these studies focused on rock samples such as sandstone and shale while studies on the classification of nmr t 2 values for soils are limited tian et al 2018 performed an nmr test on three soil samples with different clay contents and confirmed 5 8 ms as the t 2 cutoff to distinguish between bound water and capillary water since their test was performed within a narrow temperature range from 4 c to 7 5 c it was difficult to further analyze the types of pore water especially distinguishing between bulk capillary and bound water therefore it is important to apply nmr t 2 distribution curves for the further division of different types of pore water in frozen soils within a wide temperature range in addition many analytical models for predicting the θ u of freezing soils have been developed kurylyk and watanabe 2013 lu et al 2019 mckenzie et al 2007 proposed an exponential function for the volumetric θ u by considering the relationship between the degree of saturation and temperature zhang et al 2017 developed a power function model to predict volumetric θ u by soil temperature moreover some gravimetric θ u models also have been obtained in the calculation of θ u with temperature change anderson and tice 1972 kozlowski 2007 michalowski 1993 the development and use of models are important for saving costs on test methods and numerical simulations however the derivation of models is often based on specific conditions and the applicability of these models needs to be verified in this study to investigate the influence of soil properties on θ u and sfcc three soil samples from the yarlung zangbo river basin on the qinghai tibet plateau were prepared for each soil sample θ u within the wide temperature range from 30 c to 15 c was measured by nmr this wider temperature range is more conducive to the analysis of the variation of pore water with the decrease of temperature based on the t 2 distribution curves of soil samples two cutoff values were proposed and determined to divide the unfrozen water into bulk water capillary water and bound water to improve the accuracy of nmr at low temperatures the influence of temperature on nmr signals was calibrated based on the calibrated nmr signals the effects of the clay content psd and clay mineral content on θ u and sfcc were investigated in addition a published power function model was used to fit the measured data 2 methods and materials 2 1 nmr measurement principle and apparatus nmr is a physical phenomenon in which the atomic nucleus responds to a magnetic field in a water saturated porous medium when there is no external magnetic field the hydrogen atom spin axes are randomly arranged when a static magnetic field b 0 is applied all hydrogen protons in the porous medium will be aligned along the direction of the magnetic field the difference between the number of protons aligned parallel and anti parallel to the b 0 forms the bulk magnetization m 0 that provides the signal measured by the nmr apparatus for the case of n nuclei per unit volume the m 0 is given by curie s law as cowan 1997 1 m 0 n γ 2 h 2 i i 1 3 4 π 2 k t b 0 where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio for h γ 267 54 mhz t h is planck s constant h 6 62607015 10 34 j s i is the spin quantum number of the nucleus for h i 1 2 k is boltzman s constant 1 3807 10 23 j k and t is temperature if a magnetic pulse of a radio frequency rf is applied the magnetization can be temporarily oriented to a new unstable direction thereby forming a transverse part of m 0 and decaying with time once the pulse is removed each proton spin emits the absorbed energy and returns to the initial equilibrium position through a series of relaxation processes which can be characterized using nmr the relaxation process with the transverse relaxation time t 2 is expressed as 2 m t m 0 e x p t t 2 for fluids in rock and soil pores there are three mechanisms responsible for the transverse relaxation of hydrogen atoms namely bulk relaxation t 2bulk coates et al 1999 surface relaxation t 2surf kenyon 1992 and diffusion relaxation t 2diff bendel 1990 all three processes act in parallel therefore the transverse relaxation time t 2 of the pore fluid is measured by coates et al 1999 kenyon 1992 3 1 t 2 1 t 2 b u l k 1 t 2 s u r f 1 t 2 d i f f 1 t 2 b u l k ρ 2 s v 1 t 2 d i f f in eq 3 s is the surface area of a pore v is the volume of a pore and ρ 2 is the surface relaxivity 1 t 2bulk is proportional to the fluid viscosity since the viscosity of water is small it can be ignored coates et al 1999 additionally 1 t 2diff is proportional to the self diffusion coefficient of liquids and the square of the echo spacing te bendel 1990 diffusion of water molecules is very fast and thus the value of te set in this experiment is small high precision therefore diffusion relaxation is negligible in porous media the interactions between water protons and grain surfaces accelerate the relaxation of protons bird et al 2005 schaumann et al 2005 moreover in water saturated porous media t 2 dominates with t 2surf coates et al 1999 thus eq 3 can be simplified to 4 1 t 2 1 t 2 s u r f ρ 2 s v the proton relaxation time is related to pore sizes i e sv 1 f s r 1 where sv 1 is the ratio of the surface area to volume of a pore jaeger et al 2009 f s is a geometrical shape factor that is assumed to be 1 2 or 3 for planar cylindrical or spherical pores respectively and r is the pore radius we set 1 f s ρ 2 c where c is a conversion coefficient thus eq 4 can be expressed as 5 t 2 cr eq 5 indicates that t 2 is proportional to the pore size in other words the size of a pore in which unfrozen water is located can be calculated from t 2 therefore the distribution of unfrozen water in frozen soils can be monitored and recorded with nmr in this study an online real time temperature control nmr apparatus macromr12 150h i produced by the suzhou niumag co ltd china is used to measure the θ u of soils during the freezing process the apparatus consisted of a temperature controlled system an nmr system and a data acquisition and analysis system as shown in fig 1 the nmr system included a sample tube a magnet unit and an rf system to generate a stable magnetic field the temperature of the magnet unit was maintained at 32 c and the allowable variation range is 0 01 c the core of the temperature controlled system was a temperature control device for cooling and heating with fluorinated liquid fluorinated liquid can be quickly cooled to achieve good cooling effect the temperature control device included a circulating pump and an air compressor the circulating pump was used to circulate the refrigerant around the sample for temperature control while the air compressor was used to dry the ambient air of the sample to ensure the accuracy of the measurement results moreover the temperature controlled system was connected to the nmr data acquisition and analysis systems for real time and precise temperature control of the samples in the tube with almost no temperature loss the temperature of the samples was controlled to be consistent with the freezing temperature kong et al 2020 the panel of the temperature controlled system and the temperature module of the data acquisition system can both display real time temperature and were used to adjust temperature the temperature probe controlled by the data acquisition system was connected to the sample tube for temperature acquisition the range of the temperature controlled system ranges from 45 c to 250 c and the accuracy is 0 5 c 2 2 soil sample preparation silty clay from the yarlung zangbo river basin on the qinghai tibet plateau was sampled and used in the experiment three soil samples were taken from sejila mountain pass and cuomujiri ice lake where the average altitude of every location is 4300 m the sampling location is shown in fig 2 all soil samples were taken from the location 50 mm below the ground surface by a soil sampler and stored in a plastic cube the soil samples from sejila mountain pass were named s1 and s2 and the sample from cuomujiri ice lake was named c the soil samples were crushed after drying in an oven at 110 c for 12 h then the psd of the soil samples was determined using a standard sieve and a densitometer the psd curves of the three soil samples are shown in fig 3 after psd measurement the samples were analyzed using a dx 2700 x ray diffractometer dandong fangyuan instrument co ltd china to determine the mineral composition of the soil samples before preforming the x ray test the samples were dried and ground with an agate mortar and pestle to ensure that they could pass through a standard 0 075 mm sieve then samples of the same mass were added to the x ray diffractometer for testing the x ray test results were analyzed in the corresponding analysis software jade 6 once the psd and mineral composition of the soil samples were determined three sampled soils were prepared for nmr test the sample tube of the nmr system was cylindrical and made of teflon plastic rings whose diameter and height are were 25 mm and 60 mm the dry density of the prepared cylindrical samples by layer by layer compaction was 1 5 g cm3 the corresponding porosities were 42 16 43 55 and 34 67 for sample s1 s2 and c respectively prior to nmr test the prepared cylindrical samples were saturated using a vacuum saturation device the steps were as follows first the samples were placed in a container to prevent the samples from being damaged then the container was placed in a closed saturation chamber and a vacuum pump was operated for 30 min next deionized water was injected and the vacuum chamber was pressurized at 10 mpa and saturated for 24 h the saturated soil samples were wrapped with plastic film and left for another 24 h to reach a water heat balance 2 3 freezing test and parameters setting the prepared cylindrical samples were placed in the teflon plastic sample tube of the nmr system for testing the ambient temperature of the samples was gradually decreased from 15 c to 30 c at 13 set points 15 c 8 c 2 c 0 c 1 c 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 30 c previous results indicated that 30 min is enough to ensure the accuracy of the nmr signal kong et al 2020 therefore at each set point data were collected when the temperature of the soil samples stabilized for at least 30 min once the t 2 distribution curve was determined the experiment was repeated at the next set point for each sample the complete sfcc was obtained after all temperatures were tested a standard nmr pulse sequence carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg was used to measure t2 relaxation times during the freezing process the parameters of the nmr test were set by the data acquisition and analysis system the interval between adjacent echoes was 200 μs the interval of repeated sampling was 6000 ms and the cumulative number of sampling times was 16 after each sample was frozen the original data collected by the nmr system were inverted using the inversion program in the data analysis system tian et al 2018 to obtain the t 2 distribution curve of the measured sample 2 4 calibration of θu during freezing test by nmr although nmr measurements are able to determine the magnetization m0 with respect to the amount of θ u temperature has an effect on the measured magnetization m m 0 by nmr due to the thermal motion of water molecules a previous study showed a linear relationship exists between temperature and m m 0 as follows tian et al 2018 6 m m 0 α β t where α and β are fitting parameters the deviation of the slopes from the theoretical magnetization m t 0 based on the curie law can be interpreted as a result of the reduction in the activity of water molecules in the soil kiwilsza et al 2015 pajzderska et al 2014 since there is no frozen water at positive temperatures for the saturated soil sample θ u is constant and equal to the saturated water content θ s the measured magnetization m m 0 at positive temperatures can be fitted using eq 6 to determine the deviation of the slopes from the theoretical magnetization m t 0 for each sample thus the calibrated θ u at a given temperature is related to the ratio of m m 0 to m t 0 and is given by 7 θ u m m 0 m t 0 1 θ s θ s fig 4 shows the calibration of θ u for sample s1 s2 and c first the regression equation line bc was established based on the measured magnetization m m 0 at temperature 15 c 8 c 2 c for each sample second the ratio of m m 0 to m t 0 extrapolated from the regression equation at a certain temperature was determined finally the ratio determined above was multiplied by θ s numerically equal to the porosity of the saturated sample to obtain the calibrated θ u at the corresponding temperature hereafter θ u refers to the calibrated θ u 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying the different types of unfrozen water by two t2 cutoffs to accurately calculate the content of each type of water and to study the changes between the three types of unfrozen water it is necessary to distinguish the three types of water e g bulk water capillary water and bound water according to eq 5 t 2 varies for water distributed in pores of different sizes in other words the different relaxation times t 2 correspond to different types of water in fact the different types of pore water have different energy states mitchell and soga 2005 the intensity of the physical and chemical reactions between the pore water and soil grains decreases as distance from the grain surface increases consequently the chemical potential and freezing point of bound water are lower than those of capillary water and bulk water a previous study showed the magnitude of t 2 for different types of water dastidar 2007 also shown in fig 5 as the temperature decreases the freezing order of different types of pore water in soil differs in the process of soil freezing the change of the t 2 decay curve reflects the change in the freezing process of pore water therefore the different types of water can be classified according to the t 2 distribution curve previous studies proposed various t2 cutoff values to distinguish the different types of pore water for different samples based on the nmr method as summarized in table 1 although the different types of pore water can be distinguished based on t2 cutoffs these values are not fixed as listed in table 1 it should be mentioned that a single t2 cutoff is able to distinguish no more than two different types of pore water and is thus inadequate to recognize all types of unfrozen water e g bulk water capillary water and bound water within a wide temperature range in this study we proposed two t2 cutoffs to distinguish bulk water capillary water and bound water within a wide temperature range from 30 c to 15 c fig 6 shows the t 2 distribution curves at different temperatures in the freezing process for soil samples s1 s2 and c it is found that the t 2 curves intersect at one point when the temperature is between 15 c and 2 c as the temperature increases on the left side of the intersection point the nmr signal intensity increases while on the right side the signal intensity decreases the intersection point is called cutoff 2 which is between bulk water and capillary water the values of cutoff 2 for s1 s2 and c are 2 95 1 84 and 3 92 ms respectively when the temperature drops to below 2 c the t 2 curve continuously moves to the left until the temperature decreases to 10 c fig 6 illustrates that the t 2 curves do not continue to migrate when the temperature is between 10 c and 30 c this is because that type of pore water is fixed and the content of pore water decreases slowly the maximum t 2 value is called cutoff 1 which differentiates between bulk water and capillary water the values of cutoff 1 for s1 s2 and c are 1 65 1 53 and 1 77 ms respectively based on the above analysis the bulk water capillary water and bound water can be distinguished by two t2 cutoffs 3 2 change behavior of the unfrozen water content with temperature fig 7 a d illustrate that the curves of θ u change with temperature for different types of water in various samples temperature is the variable driving the variation of θ u with the continuous decrease of temperature θ u shows changing behavior fig 7 shows that the trend of the sfcc for each type of water is relatively consistent the variation in θ u with decreasing temperature for each type of water can be generally divided into three stages i e stages i ii and iii as shown in fig 7 θ u remained nearly unchanged when the temperature was positive and between 0 and a certain negative temperature in stage i thus stage i is called the unfrozen stage in other words the pore water is not frozen in this stage further when the temperature is between 0 c and a certain degree below zero the process of temperature decreasing coexists with that of the release of latent heat this is called the transition stage in the study the temperature corresponding to the end of the transition stage is the initial freezing temperature tf of the soil when the temperature was lower than tf θ u decreased dramatically with decreasing temperature until 10 c was reached in stage ii the pore water progressively freezes and θ u keeps decreasing in this stage this stage is called the rapid drop stage and is the most important part of the sfcc the rapid drop stage is characterized by changes in water migration dynamic characteristics and thermodynamic properties anderson and tice 1972 kozlowski 2007 mckenzie et al 2007 michalowski 1993 zhang et al 2017 θ u in the soils tended to stabilize when the temperature was lower than 10 c in stage iii which is called the residual stage in this stage θ u hardly changes and is called the residual θ u fig 7 shows that θ u drops to zero when the temperature is lower than 10 c for the bulk water and capillary water in other words θ u is mainly thin film water on the surface of soil particles i e bound water when the temperature is lower than 10 c the thin film water gradually becomes thinner as the temperature decreases and the thinner the water the less likely it is to freeze hence θ u gradually stabilizes fig 7 a also shows that the different soil samples have different initial total water contents for saturated soil samples the initial total water content is mainly determined by the porosity therefore the initial total water content increases with increasing porosity however for the total unfrozen water and bulk water as the temperature decreases the changing rates of θ u for the various soil samples show similar trends in stage ii in other words the total water content has no significant effect on the changing rate of θ u with respect to temperature moreover the influence of soil properties on θ u can be neglected for the total unfrozen water and the bulk water therefore in this study we considered that the influence of soil properties on the unfrozen contents of different types of water is mainly manifested in capillary water and bound water 3 3 influence of clay content on the unfrozen water content it has been generally recognized that clay content is a non negligible physical property in water soil systems therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of clay content on θ u in the freezing process of soils first the clay content in the soil samples needs to be determined different countries and sectors have different particle size division methods in this study we used the usda fao system for division the particle size limits of this system are as follows clay grains 2 μm 2 silt grains 50 μm and 50 sand grains 2000 μm minasny and mcbratney 2001 table 2 summarizes the proportions of different particle sizes for various soil samples as shown in table 2 s1 and s2 have comparatively high contents of clay and silt particles and low contents of sand particles and c has a higher content of sand particles and lower contents of clay and silt particles the clay contents of s1 s2 and c are 3 31 6 44 and 2 98 respectively fig 7 d shows that the sample with the highest clay content s2 has the largest θ u in the unfrozen stage additionally when the temperature is between 3 c and 5 c the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature is smallest for samples with lower clay contents the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature for sample c which has the lowest clay content is almost zero in other words samples with low clay contents have higher initial freezing temperatures for bound water moreover the tf values of samples s1 and c are about 3 c and 5 c respectively and the tf of sample s2 is between 3 c and 5 c the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature is significantly different in the rapid drop stage as shown in fig 7 d when the soil temperature decreases from tf to 10 c θ u continues to decrease however the descending rate is different for various samples the soil samples with high clay contents display rapid descending rates this may be due to the different interaction strengths associated with different clay contents for soil particles and pore water in addition tf for bound water is significantly lower than that for bulk water this relation indirectly confirms that the bulk water freezes first and the bound water freezes last as the temperature drops the sfcc of various samples displays a slight change in the residual stage the residual θ u of samples s1 and s2 are almost same for the bound water according to kozlowski 2007 the residual θ u is related to the total specific surface area of the soil the fine particle content of soil has a considerable influence on its specific surface area table 2 shows that there is almost no difference in the clay and silt contents of soil samples s1 and s2 the clay and silt contents of sample c are the lowest the residual water can be regarded as strongly bound water in comparison the weakly bound water freezes in the rapid drop stage 3 4 influence of psd on the unfrozen water content psd can be quantitatively described by statistical parameters including specific particle sizes such as d 10 d 30 and d 60 the coefficient of curvature c c the coefficient of uniformity c u and the silt and sand content li et al 2013 wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2010 yong et al 2017 the coefficient of curvature c c d2 30 d 60 d 10 reflects the pattern of the psd curve of soils and the coefficient of uniformity c u d 60 d 10 reflects the distribution of grains of different sizes generally the soil grade distribution is considered good when c c is between 1 and 3 and c u is equal to or greater than 5 the psd parameters for the three samples are summarized in table 3 table 3 shows that the c u value for all samples is greater than 5 in other words there are enough fine particles to fill the gaps between the coarse particles to make the soil compact for all the samples thus the influence of c u on θ u can be ignored in this study samples s1 and s2 have large c c values greater than 1 and sample c has a smaller c c lower than 1 that is sample c with a narrower psd has fewer fine particles than samples s1 and s2 therefore sample c has a smaller specific surface area than samples s1 and s2 as mentioned above the bound water is affected by the specific surface area of the soil thus c c is mainly related to bound water fig 7 d shows that the sample with the largest c c has the highest initial water content in the unfrozen stage the c c of sample c is the lowest and 1 therefore the psd curve of sample c lacks fine particles therefore sample c which has the smallest specific surface area has the lowest initial bound water content the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature for various samples with different c c values varies in the rapid drop stage additionally the residual θ u of samples s1 and s2 display almost no difference due to the similar c c values capillary water mostly exists in sand and silt the pores of clay are too small for capillary water and are mainly occupied by bound water thus the capillary water content is low the sand and silt content mainly affects the capillary water content in the soil freezing process fig 7 c shows that θ u increases with increasing sand and silt content in the unfrozen stage the θ u of samples s1 and c are almost the same because they have similar sand and silt contents in the rapid drop stage the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature gradually decreases as the sand and silt content decreases similarly samples s1 and c have almost the same decreasing rates with similar sand and silt contents the capillary water in all samples was completely frozen in the residual stage 3 5 influence of clay mineral content on the unfrozen water content to study the influence of clay mineral content on θ u in the soil the mineral compositions were analyzed using an x ray diffractometer for each sample the test results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that all soil samples share common minerals namely illite chamosite quartz and chlorite in addition other common minerals in s1 and c are plagioclase k feldspar and manganite s1 and s2 also have the common mineral forsterite vaterite and alunite are unique to s2 the types of minerals contained in each soil sample are summarized in table 4 table 4 shows that the main mineral contained in all soils is illite which accounts for more than half of the minerals detected the clay mineral contents of s1 s2 and c are 67 64 73 67 and 64 42 respectively clay minerals are hydrated aluminum layered silicates that form in the presence of water the particles of clay minerals are extremely fine and there are many negative charges on their surfaces therefore the surfaces of clay mineral particles with large specific surface areas can form a viscous hydration film in other words clay minerals have a notable influence on the bound water content this study mainly considers the influence of the clay mineral content on the unfrozen content of bound water fig 7 d shows that the descending rate of θ u with temperature gradually decreases with decreasing total clay mineral content in the rapid drop stage sample s2 has the highest bound water content and sample c has the lowest bound water content in the unfrozen stage samples s1 and s2 have greater residual θ u than sample c these results illustrate that the unfrozen content of bound water differs with different clay mineral contents the greater the clay mineral content the larger the specific surface area and the greater the bound water content 4 fitting the power function model of the sfcc the zhang et al 2017 model which has a single fitting parameter is a power function to predict θ u this model has been effectively applied in cold regions zhao et al 2020 in this study this model was used to fit the measured nmr results on the one hand this model could verify the accuracy of our experimental data on the other hand the data could test the practicability of the model the zhang et al 2017 model is as follows 8 θ u θ 0 1 t f t t k 0 t f ω t k 0 t t f θ 0 t t f where tk 0 is a constant which converts centigrade temperature to kelvin temperature and tk 0 273 15 c in the model θ 0 is the initial volumetric θ u and ω is the fitting parameter related to soil properties fig 9 a d show the fitted results of the model and measured data by nmr for various soil samples and different types of water it can be seen that the results obtained with the model are in good agreement with the measured data especially for bound water in this model the only fitting parameter related to soil properties is ω in other words ω will vary in accordance with the soil properties fig 9 a shows that samples s1 and s2 are similar in the fitting parameters indicating that the soil properties of these two soil samples are similar this is in good accordance with the fact that these two soil samples were taken from the same location and the soil properties especially psd were almost the same in fact there is a difference in the total clay mineral content and clay content for these two soil samples see table 4 however there is almost no difference in the sum of clay and silt content see table 2 therefore the influence of the total clay mineral content or clay content on the sfcc cannot be reflected in the model the fitting parameters of soil samples c and s2 are significantly different this indicates that the soil properties of these samples are different from tables 2 and 3 it can be seen that there are significant differences in the clay and silt content and the coefficient of curvature c c for soil samples c and s2 zhang et al 2017 model has a comprehensive and lumped parameter containing the multiple influence of several soil properties as a result ω as a single parameter in this model is insensitive to the influence of individual soil properties on θ u from the above analysis and the fitting results ω is able to reflect the influence of the clay and silt content and the psd on θ u however the ω was insufficient to reflect the influence of total clay mineral content or clay content on θ u 5 conclusions in this study the influence of soil properties on changes in unfrozen water content θ u was studied during the freezing process of soils based on nmr testing techniques according to the t 2 distribution curves obtained within a wider temperature range by nmr two t 2 cutoffs were proposed to distinguish three different types of water e g bulk water capillary water and bound water the θ u of each type of water was also calculated the effects of the clay content psd and clay mineral content on the unfrozen contents of various types of water during the freezing process were analyzed the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 for the three tested soils two cutoffs can be established to divide the t 2 distribution curve into three parts corresponding to three different types of water the behavior of the bulk capillary and bound water identified by two cutoffs was discussed in detail according to the variations in the sfcc for different types of water the bulk water freezes first followed by capillary water and some bound water and finally just the bound water in addition the cutoff 1 values for soil samples s1 s2 and c are 1 65 1 53 and 1 77 ms respectively and the cutoff 2 values for soil samples s1 s2 and c are 2 95 1 84 and 3 92 ms respectively 2 the sfccs of different types of water can be divided into three stages the unfrozen stage i the rapid drop stage ii and the residual stage iii the residual θ u for bulk water and capillary water is zero in addition the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature in the rapid drop stage displays little variation among samples for the total unfrozen water and bulk water 3 the clay content and clay mineral content mainly affect the sfcc of bound water the greater the clay content and the total clay mineral content the higher the θ u values in the unfrozen stage and residual stage and the greater the change rate in the rapid drop stage the psd affects the changes in the sfccs of both bound water and capillary water the change rate of the sfcc gradually decreases as the sand and silt content decreases in the rapid drop stage for capillary water however these conclusions cannot be extrapolated at this time more samples will be examined in the future 4 in general the variations of θ u calculated by the zhang et al 2017 model fit the measured data well especially for bound water the fitting parameter ω can reflect the effects of the psd and the content of both clay and silt on θ u however the single parameter ω was not sufficient to reflect the effect of clay mineral content or clay content on the θ u credit authorship contribution statement

4181,in this study a low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr apparatus with the ability to adjust sample temperatures was used to measure the unfrozen water content of frozen soils sampled from the qinghai tibet plateau based on low field nmr theory two cutoff values were proposed to quantitatively identify three types of unfrozen water bulk capillary and bound water in the frozen soils the influences of soil properties the clay content particle size distribution and clay mineral content on these three different types of unfrozen water during the soil freezing process were analyzed the results showed that the soil freezing characteristic curve of unfrozen water could be divided into three stages namely the unfrozen the rapid drop and the residual stages in the rapid drop stage the unfrozen bound water content increases gradually with the increasing clay or clay mineral content and at a certain temperature the unfrozen capillary water content increases as the sand and silt content increases a published power function model is then used to fit the measured data in this study we found that the single parameter related to soil properties in this model could not sufficiently reflect the influence of clay mineral content or clay content on unfrozen water content keywords two cutoff values unfrozen water content soil properties soil freezing characteristic curve nuclear magnetic resonance 1 introduction due to the complex pore structure of soil solute concentration and cohesive and adhesive forces a certain amount of water remains unfrozen in soils at sub freezing temperatures chai et al 2018 kong et al 2020 lara et al 2021 watanabe and wake 2009 xu et al 2001 this is termed unfrozen water the unfrozen water content θ u has a remarkable influence on the dynamic properties hydraulic characteristics and thermodynamic properties of frozen soils kong et al 2020 watanabe and wake 2009 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 therefore investigating θ u and its corresponding influential factors is of great importance for the understanding of hydrological processes and engineering design in cold regions according to previous studies many factors influence θ u including the initial water content freeze thaw cycles dry soil density and soil properties e g the particle size distribution psd clay mineral content and clay content bing et al 2007 chai et al 2018 ishizaki et al 1996 wen et al 2012 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2001 the relationship between the θ u and temperature which is represented by the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc was proposed by many studies kong et al 2020 koopmans and miller 1966 pardo lara et al 2020 lara et al 2021 tian et al 2018 watanabe and wake 2009 wen et al 2012 determined sfccs by investigating the silty clay on the qinghai tibet plateau they found that initial water content and clay content had significant influences on the freezing point and θ u although θ u was confirmed to be sensitive to soil properties at the same temperature kong et al 2020 few studies have been conducted to establish the relationship between soil properties and θ u in particular most researchers only considered the effect of clay content on θ u kozlowski and nartowska 2013 kruse and darrow 2017 tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in fact there are differences between clay and clay minerals clay is a type of fine grained natural soil material that contains clay minerals clay minerals are hydrous aluminum phyllosilicates in other words the clay content and the clay mineral content have different influences on θ u therefore it is important to study the influence of soil properties e g the particle size distribution clay content and clay mineral content on θ u in frozen soils many methods and techniques are available to measure θ u in frozen soils including thermal resistance temperature probes bittelli et al 2003 wen et al 2012 capacitance techniques li et al 2018 differential scanning calorimetry dsc kozlowski and nartowska 2013 time domain reflectometry tdr watanabe and wake 2009 zhou et al 2014 and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr kong et al 2020 stingaciu et al 2009 tian et al 2018 watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 yuan et al 2018 tdr and nmr are two commonly used methods smith and tice 1988 tian et al 2014 watanabe and wake 2009 tdr is fast cheap and portable but it remains unclear whether the soil dielectric constant measured by tdr can be used to effectively determine the unfrozen pore water content this is because that in tdr calibration equations it is implicitly assumed that the dielectric constant of ice is equal to that of air and the effects of temperature on the liquid water dielectric constant are neglected seyfried and murdock 1996 wang et al 2011 however nmr has proven useful for studying θ u in frozen soils without damaging the soil or disturbing the sample liu et al 2020 it is well known that the water in soils is classified as bulk water capillary water and bound water according to its form of existence the bound water is defined as the water in the electric double layer while the water outside the electric double layer can be divided into capillary water and bulk water i e gravitational water previous studies have shown that the soil water type varies for different soils chai et al 2018 mu et al 2018 for accurate determination of θ u and analysis of the influence of soil properties on θ u one needs first distinguish the unfrozen pore water nmr is not only capable of measuring θ u in frozen soils but is also used to divide the pore water in soils into different types coates et al 1999 tian et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 based on the t 2 distribution curve of saturated soil tested by nmr t 2 cutoffs have been used to distinguish different types of pore water coates et al 1999 in the past decades many studies have focused on defining nmr t 2 cutoffs and distinguishing different types of pore water bouton et al 1996 morriss et al 1997 saidian and prasad 2015 yuan et al 2018 most of these studies focused on rock samples such as sandstone and shale while studies on the classification of nmr t 2 values for soils are limited tian et al 2018 performed an nmr test on three soil samples with different clay contents and confirmed 5 8 ms as the t 2 cutoff to distinguish between bound water and capillary water since their test was performed within a narrow temperature range from 4 c to 7 5 c it was difficult to further analyze the types of pore water especially distinguishing between bulk capillary and bound water therefore it is important to apply nmr t 2 distribution curves for the further division of different types of pore water in frozen soils within a wide temperature range in addition many analytical models for predicting the θ u of freezing soils have been developed kurylyk and watanabe 2013 lu et al 2019 mckenzie et al 2007 proposed an exponential function for the volumetric θ u by considering the relationship between the degree of saturation and temperature zhang et al 2017 developed a power function model to predict volumetric θ u by soil temperature moreover some gravimetric θ u models also have been obtained in the calculation of θ u with temperature change anderson and tice 1972 kozlowski 2007 michalowski 1993 the development and use of models are important for saving costs on test methods and numerical simulations however the derivation of models is often based on specific conditions and the applicability of these models needs to be verified in this study to investigate the influence of soil properties on θ u and sfcc three soil samples from the yarlung zangbo river basin on the qinghai tibet plateau were prepared for each soil sample θ u within the wide temperature range from 30 c to 15 c was measured by nmr this wider temperature range is more conducive to the analysis of the variation of pore water with the decrease of temperature based on the t 2 distribution curves of soil samples two cutoff values were proposed and determined to divide the unfrozen water into bulk water capillary water and bound water to improve the accuracy of nmr at low temperatures the influence of temperature on nmr signals was calibrated based on the calibrated nmr signals the effects of the clay content psd and clay mineral content on θ u and sfcc were investigated in addition a published power function model was used to fit the measured data 2 methods and materials 2 1 nmr measurement principle and apparatus nmr is a physical phenomenon in which the atomic nucleus responds to a magnetic field in a water saturated porous medium when there is no external magnetic field the hydrogen atom spin axes are randomly arranged when a static magnetic field b 0 is applied all hydrogen protons in the porous medium will be aligned along the direction of the magnetic field the difference between the number of protons aligned parallel and anti parallel to the b 0 forms the bulk magnetization m 0 that provides the signal measured by the nmr apparatus for the case of n nuclei per unit volume the m 0 is given by curie s law as cowan 1997 1 m 0 n γ 2 h 2 i i 1 3 4 π 2 k t b 0 where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio for h γ 267 54 mhz t h is planck s constant h 6 62607015 10 34 j s i is the spin quantum number of the nucleus for h i 1 2 k is boltzman s constant 1 3807 10 23 j k and t is temperature if a magnetic pulse of a radio frequency rf is applied the magnetization can be temporarily oriented to a new unstable direction thereby forming a transverse part of m 0 and decaying with time once the pulse is removed each proton spin emits the absorbed energy and returns to the initial equilibrium position through a series of relaxation processes which can be characterized using nmr the relaxation process with the transverse relaxation time t 2 is expressed as 2 m t m 0 e x p t t 2 for fluids in rock and soil pores there are three mechanisms responsible for the transverse relaxation of hydrogen atoms namely bulk relaxation t 2bulk coates et al 1999 surface relaxation t 2surf kenyon 1992 and diffusion relaxation t 2diff bendel 1990 all three processes act in parallel therefore the transverse relaxation time t 2 of the pore fluid is measured by coates et al 1999 kenyon 1992 3 1 t 2 1 t 2 b u l k 1 t 2 s u r f 1 t 2 d i f f 1 t 2 b u l k ρ 2 s v 1 t 2 d i f f in eq 3 s is the surface area of a pore v is the volume of a pore and ρ 2 is the surface relaxivity 1 t 2bulk is proportional to the fluid viscosity since the viscosity of water is small it can be ignored coates et al 1999 additionally 1 t 2diff is proportional to the self diffusion coefficient of liquids and the square of the echo spacing te bendel 1990 diffusion of water molecules is very fast and thus the value of te set in this experiment is small high precision therefore diffusion relaxation is negligible in porous media the interactions between water protons and grain surfaces accelerate the relaxation of protons bird et al 2005 schaumann et al 2005 moreover in water saturated porous media t 2 dominates with t 2surf coates et al 1999 thus eq 3 can be simplified to 4 1 t 2 1 t 2 s u r f ρ 2 s v the proton relaxation time is related to pore sizes i e sv 1 f s r 1 where sv 1 is the ratio of the surface area to volume of a pore jaeger et al 2009 f s is a geometrical shape factor that is assumed to be 1 2 or 3 for planar cylindrical or spherical pores respectively and r is the pore radius we set 1 f s ρ 2 c where c is a conversion coefficient thus eq 4 can be expressed as 5 t 2 cr eq 5 indicates that t 2 is proportional to the pore size in other words the size of a pore in which unfrozen water is located can be calculated from t 2 therefore the distribution of unfrozen water in frozen soils can be monitored and recorded with nmr in this study an online real time temperature control nmr apparatus macromr12 150h i produced by the suzhou niumag co ltd china is used to measure the θ u of soils during the freezing process the apparatus consisted of a temperature controlled system an nmr system and a data acquisition and analysis system as shown in fig 1 the nmr system included a sample tube a magnet unit and an rf system to generate a stable magnetic field the temperature of the magnet unit was maintained at 32 c and the allowable variation range is 0 01 c the core of the temperature controlled system was a temperature control device for cooling and heating with fluorinated liquid fluorinated liquid can be quickly cooled to achieve good cooling effect the temperature control device included a circulating pump and an air compressor the circulating pump was used to circulate the refrigerant around the sample for temperature control while the air compressor was used to dry the ambient air of the sample to ensure the accuracy of the measurement results moreover the temperature controlled system was connected to the nmr data acquisition and analysis systems for real time and precise temperature control of the samples in the tube with almost no temperature loss the temperature of the samples was controlled to be consistent with the freezing temperature kong et al 2020 the panel of the temperature controlled system and the temperature module of the data acquisition system can both display real time temperature and were used to adjust temperature the temperature probe controlled by the data acquisition system was connected to the sample tube for temperature acquisition the range of the temperature controlled system ranges from 45 c to 250 c and the accuracy is 0 5 c 2 2 soil sample preparation silty clay from the yarlung zangbo river basin on the qinghai tibet plateau was sampled and used in the experiment three soil samples were taken from sejila mountain pass and cuomujiri ice lake where the average altitude of every location is 4300 m the sampling location is shown in fig 2 all soil samples were taken from the location 50 mm below the ground surface by a soil sampler and stored in a plastic cube the soil samples from sejila mountain pass were named s1 and s2 and the sample from cuomujiri ice lake was named c the soil samples were crushed after drying in an oven at 110 c for 12 h then the psd of the soil samples was determined using a standard sieve and a densitometer the psd curves of the three soil samples are shown in fig 3 after psd measurement the samples were analyzed using a dx 2700 x ray diffractometer dandong fangyuan instrument co ltd china to determine the mineral composition of the soil samples before preforming the x ray test the samples were dried and ground with an agate mortar and pestle to ensure that they could pass through a standard 0 075 mm sieve then samples of the same mass were added to the x ray diffractometer for testing the x ray test results were analyzed in the corresponding analysis software jade 6 once the psd and mineral composition of the soil samples were determined three sampled soils were prepared for nmr test the sample tube of the nmr system was cylindrical and made of teflon plastic rings whose diameter and height are were 25 mm and 60 mm the dry density of the prepared cylindrical samples by layer by layer compaction was 1 5 g cm3 the corresponding porosities were 42 16 43 55 and 34 67 for sample s1 s2 and c respectively prior to nmr test the prepared cylindrical samples were saturated using a vacuum saturation device the steps were as follows first the samples were placed in a container to prevent the samples from being damaged then the container was placed in a closed saturation chamber and a vacuum pump was operated for 30 min next deionized water was injected and the vacuum chamber was pressurized at 10 mpa and saturated for 24 h the saturated soil samples were wrapped with plastic film and left for another 24 h to reach a water heat balance 2 3 freezing test and parameters setting the prepared cylindrical samples were placed in the teflon plastic sample tube of the nmr system for testing the ambient temperature of the samples was gradually decreased from 15 c to 30 c at 13 set points 15 c 8 c 2 c 0 c 1 c 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 30 c previous results indicated that 30 min is enough to ensure the accuracy of the nmr signal kong et al 2020 therefore at each set point data were collected when the temperature of the soil samples stabilized for at least 30 min once the t 2 distribution curve was determined the experiment was repeated at the next set point for each sample the complete sfcc was obtained after all temperatures were tested a standard nmr pulse sequence carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg was used to measure t2 relaxation times during the freezing process the parameters of the nmr test were set by the data acquisition and analysis system the interval between adjacent echoes was 200 μs the interval of repeated sampling was 6000 ms and the cumulative number of sampling times was 16 after each sample was frozen the original data collected by the nmr system were inverted using the inversion program in the data analysis system tian et al 2018 to obtain the t 2 distribution curve of the measured sample 2 4 calibration of θu during freezing test by nmr although nmr measurements are able to determine the magnetization m0 with respect to the amount of θ u temperature has an effect on the measured magnetization m m 0 by nmr due to the thermal motion of water molecules a previous study showed a linear relationship exists between temperature and m m 0 as follows tian et al 2018 6 m m 0 α β t where α and β are fitting parameters the deviation of the slopes from the theoretical magnetization m t 0 based on the curie law can be interpreted as a result of the reduction in the activity of water molecules in the soil kiwilsza et al 2015 pajzderska et al 2014 since there is no frozen water at positive temperatures for the saturated soil sample θ u is constant and equal to the saturated water content θ s the measured magnetization m m 0 at positive temperatures can be fitted using eq 6 to determine the deviation of the slopes from the theoretical magnetization m t 0 for each sample thus the calibrated θ u at a given temperature is related to the ratio of m m 0 to m t 0 and is given by 7 θ u m m 0 m t 0 1 θ s θ s fig 4 shows the calibration of θ u for sample s1 s2 and c first the regression equation line bc was established based on the measured magnetization m m 0 at temperature 15 c 8 c 2 c for each sample second the ratio of m m 0 to m t 0 extrapolated from the regression equation at a certain temperature was determined finally the ratio determined above was multiplied by θ s numerically equal to the porosity of the saturated sample to obtain the calibrated θ u at the corresponding temperature hereafter θ u refers to the calibrated θ u 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying the different types of unfrozen water by two t2 cutoffs to accurately calculate the content of each type of water and to study the changes between the three types of unfrozen water it is necessary to distinguish the three types of water e g bulk water capillary water and bound water according to eq 5 t 2 varies for water distributed in pores of different sizes in other words the different relaxation times t 2 correspond to different types of water in fact the different types of pore water have different energy states mitchell and soga 2005 the intensity of the physical and chemical reactions between the pore water and soil grains decreases as distance from the grain surface increases consequently the chemical potential and freezing point of bound water are lower than those of capillary water and bulk water a previous study showed the magnitude of t 2 for different types of water dastidar 2007 also shown in fig 5 as the temperature decreases the freezing order of different types of pore water in soil differs in the process of soil freezing the change of the t 2 decay curve reflects the change in the freezing process of pore water therefore the different types of water can be classified according to the t 2 distribution curve previous studies proposed various t2 cutoff values to distinguish the different types of pore water for different samples based on the nmr method as summarized in table 1 although the different types of pore water can be distinguished based on t2 cutoffs these values are not fixed as listed in table 1 it should be mentioned that a single t2 cutoff is able to distinguish no more than two different types of pore water and is thus inadequate to recognize all types of unfrozen water e g bulk water capillary water and bound water within a wide temperature range in this study we proposed two t2 cutoffs to distinguish bulk water capillary water and bound water within a wide temperature range from 30 c to 15 c fig 6 shows the t 2 distribution curves at different temperatures in the freezing process for soil samples s1 s2 and c it is found that the t 2 curves intersect at one point when the temperature is between 15 c and 2 c as the temperature increases on the left side of the intersection point the nmr signal intensity increases while on the right side the signal intensity decreases the intersection point is called cutoff 2 which is between bulk water and capillary water the values of cutoff 2 for s1 s2 and c are 2 95 1 84 and 3 92 ms respectively when the temperature drops to below 2 c the t 2 curve continuously moves to the left until the temperature decreases to 10 c fig 6 illustrates that the t 2 curves do not continue to migrate when the temperature is between 10 c and 30 c this is because that type of pore water is fixed and the content of pore water decreases slowly the maximum t 2 value is called cutoff 1 which differentiates between bulk water and capillary water the values of cutoff 1 for s1 s2 and c are 1 65 1 53 and 1 77 ms respectively based on the above analysis the bulk water capillary water and bound water can be distinguished by two t2 cutoffs 3 2 change behavior of the unfrozen water content with temperature fig 7 a d illustrate that the curves of θ u change with temperature for different types of water in various samples temperature is the variable driving the variation of θ u with the continuous decrease of temperature θ u shows changing behavior fig 7 shows that the trend of the sfcc for each type of water is relatively consistent the variation in θ u with decreasing temperature for each type of water can be generally divided into three stages i e stages i ii and iii as shown in fig 7 θ u remained nearly unchanged when the temperature was positive and between 0 and a certain negative temperature in stage i thus stage i is called the unfrozen stage in other words the pore water is not frozen in this stage further when the temperature is between 0 c and a certain degree below zero the process of temperature decreasing coexists with that of the release of latent heat this is called the transition stage in the study the temperature corresponding to the end of the transition stage is the initial freezing temperature tf of the soil when the temperature was lower than tf θ u decreased dramatically with decreasing temperature until 10 c was reached in stage ii the pore water progressively freezes and θ u keeps decreasing in this stage this stage is called the rapid drop stage and is the most important part of the sfcc the rapid drop stage is characterized by changes in water migration dynamic characteristics and thermodynamic properties anderson and tice 1972 kozlowski 2007 mckenzie et al 2007 michalowski 1993 zhang et al 2017 θ u in the soils tended to stabilize when the temperature was lower than 10 c in stage iii which is called the residual stage in this stage θ u hardly changes and is called the residual θ u fig 7 shows that θ u drops to zero when the temperature is lower than 10 c for the bulk water and capillary water in other words θ u is mainly thin film water on the surface of soil particles i e bound water when the temperature is lower than 10 c the thin film water gradually becomes thinner as the temperature decreases and the thinner the water the less likely it is to freeze hence θ u gradually stabilizes fig 7 a also shows that the different soil samples have different initial total water contents for saturated soil samples the initial total water content is mainly determined by the porosity therefore the initial total water content increases with increasing porosity however for the total unfrozen water and bulk water as the temperature decreases the changing rates of θ u for the various soil samples show similar trends in stage ii in other words the total water content has no significant effect on the changing rate of θ u with respect to temperature moreover the influence of soil properties on θ u can be neglected for the total unfrozen water and the bulk water therefore in this study we considered that the influence of soil properties on the unfrozen contents of different types of water is mainly manifested in capillary water and bound water 3 3 influence of clay content on the unfrozen water content it has been generally recognized that clay content is a non negligible physical property in water soil systems therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of clay content on θ u in the freezing process of soils first the clay content in the soil samples needs to be determined different countries and sectors have different particle size division methods in this study we used the usda fao system for division the particle size limits of this system are as follows clay grains 2 μm 2 silt grains 50 μm and 50 sand grains 2000 μm minasny and mcbratney 2001 table 2 summarizes the proportions of different particle sizes for various soil samples as shown in table 2 s1 and s2 have comparatively high contents of clay and silt particles and low contents of sand particles and c has a higher content of sand particles and lower contents of clay and silt particles the clay contents of s1 s2 and c are 3 31 6 44 and 2 98 respectively fig 7 d shows that the sample with the highest clay content s2 has the largest θ u in the unfrozen stage additionally when the temperature is between 3 c and 5 c the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature is smallest for samples with lower clay contents the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature for sample c which has the lowest clay content is almost zero in other words samples with low clay contents have higher initial freezing temperatures for bound water moreover the tf values of samples s1 and c are about 3 c and 5 c respectively and the tf of sample s2 is between 3 c and 5 c the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature is significantly different in the rapid drop stage as shown in fig 7 d when the soil temperature decreases from tf to 10 c θ u continues to decrease however the descending rate is different for various samples the soil samples with high clay contents display rapid descending rates this may be due to the different interaction strengths associated with different clay contents for soil particles and pore water in addition tf for bound water is significantly lower than that for bulk water this relation indirectly confirms that the bulk water freezes first and the bound water freezes last as the temperature drops the sfcc of various samples displays a slight change in the residual stage the residual θ u of samples s1 and s2 are almost same for the bound water according to kozlowski 2007 the residual θ u is related to the total specific surface area of the soil the fine particle content of soil has a considerable influence on its specific surface area table 2 shows that there is almost no difference in the clay and silt contents of soil samples s1 and s2 the clay and silt contents of sample c are the lowest the residual water can be regarded as strongly bound water in comparison the weakly bound water freezes in the rapid drop stage 3 4 influence of psd on the unfrozen water content psd can be quantitatively described by statistical parameters including specific particle sizes such as d 10 d 30 and d 60 the coefficient of curvature c c the coefficient of uniformity c u and the silt and sand content li et al 2013 wichtmann and triantafyllidis 2010 yong et al 2017 the coefficient of curvature c c d2 30 d 60 d 10 reflects the pattern of the psd curve of soils and the coefficient of uniformity c u d 60 d 10 reflects the distribution of grains of different sizes generally the soil grade distribution is considered good when c c is between 1 and 3 and c u is equal to or greater than 5 the psd parameters for the three samples are summarized in table 3 table 3 shows that the c u value for all samples is greater than 5 in other words there are enough fine particles to fill the gaps between the coarse particles to make the soil compact for all the samples thus the influence of c u on θ u can be ignored in this study samples s1 and s2 have large c c values greater than 1 and sample c has a smaller c c lower than 1 that is sample c with a narrower psd has fewer fine particles than samples s1 and s2 therefore sample c has a smaller specific surface area than samples s1 and s2 as mentioned above the bound water is affected by the specific surface area of the soil thus c c is mainly related to bound water fig 7 d shows that the sample with the largest c c has the highest initial water content in the unfrozen stage the c c of sample c is the lowest and 1 therefore the psd curve of sample c lacks fine particles therefore sample c which has the smallest specific surface area has the lowest initial bound water content the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature for various samples with different c c values varies in the rapid drop stage additionally the residual θ u of samples s1 and s2 display almost no difference due to the similar c c values capillary water mostly exists in sand and silt the pores of clay are too small for capillary water and are mainly occupied by bound water thus the capillary water content is low the sand and silt content mainly affects the capillary water content in the soil freezing process fig 7 c shows that θ u increases with increasing sand and silt content in the unfrozen stage the θ u of samples s1 and c are almost the same because they have similar sand and silt contents in the rapid drop stage the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature gradually decreases as the sand and silt content decreases similarly samples s1 and c have almost the same decreasing rates with similar sand and silt contents the capillary water in all samples was completely frozen in the residual stage 3 5 influence of clay mineral content on the unfrozen water content to study the influence of clay mineral content on θ u in the soil the mineral compositions were analyzed using an x ray diffractometer for each sample the test results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that all soil samples share common minerals namely illite chamosite quartz and chlorite in addition other common minerals in s1 and c are plagioclase k feldspar and manganite s1 and s2 also have the common mineral forsterite vaterite and alunite are unique to s2 the types of minerals contained in each soil sample are summarized in table 4 table 4 shows that the main mineral contained in all soils is illite which accounts for more than half of the minerals detected the clay mineral contents of s1 s2 and c are 67 64 73 67 and 64 42 respectively clay minerals are hydrated aluminum layered silicates that form in the presence of water the particles of clay minerals are extremely fine and there are many negative charges on their surfaces therefore the surfaces of clay mineral particles with large specific surface areas can form a viscous hydration film in other words clay minerals have a notable influence on the bound water content this study mainly considers the influence of the clay mineral content on the unfrozen content of bound water fig 7 d shows that the descending rate of θ u with temperature gradually decreases with decreasing total clay mineral content in the rapid drop stage sample s2 has the highest bound water content and sample c has the lowest bound water content in the unfrozen stage samples s1 and s2 have greater residual θ u than sample c these results illustrate that the unfrozen content of bound water differs with different clay mineral contents the greater the clay mineral content the larger the specific surface area and the greater the bound water content 4 fitting the power function model of the sfcc the zhang et al 2017 model which has a single fitting parameter is a power function to predict θ u this model has been effectively applied in cold regions zhao et al 2020 in this study this model was used to fit the measured nmr results on the one hand this model could verify the accuracy of our experimental data on the other hand the data could test the practicability of the model the zhang et al 2017 model is as follows 8 θ u θ 0 1 t f t t k 0 t f ω t k 0 t t f θ 0 t t f where tk 0 is a constant which converts centigrade temperature to kelvin temperature and tk 0 273 15 c in the model θ 0 is the initial volumetric θ u and ω is the fitting parameter related to soil properties fig 9 a d show the fitted results of the model and measured data by nmr for various soil samples and different types of water it can be seen that the results obtained with the model are in good agreement with the measured data especially for bound water in this model the only fitting parameter related to soil properties is ω in other words ω will vary in accordance with the soil properties fig 9 a shows that samples s1 and s2 are similar in the fitting parameters indicating that the soil properties of these two soil samples are similar this is in good accordance with the fact that these two soil samples were taken from the same location and the soil properties especially psd were almost the same in fact there is a difference in the total clay mineral content and clay content for these two soil samples see table 4 however there is almost no difference in the sum of clay and silt content see table 2 therefore the influence of the total clay mineral content or clay content on the sfcc cannot be reflected in the model the fitting parameters of soil samples c and s2 are significantly different this indicates that the soil properties of these samples are different from tables 2 and 3 it can be seen that there are significant differences in the clay and silt content and the coefficient of curvature c c for soil samples c and s2 zhang et al 2017 model has a comprehensive and lumped parameter containing the multiple influence of several soil properties as a result ω as a single parameter in this model is insensitive to the influence of individual soil properties on θ u from the above analysis and the fitting results ω is able to reflect the influence of the clay and silt content and the psd on θ u however the ω was insufficient to reflect the influence of total clay mineral content or clay content on θ u 5 conclusions in this study the influence of soil properties on changes in unfrozen water content θ u was studied during the freezing process of soils based on nmr testing techniques according to the t 2 distribution curves obtained within a wider temperature range by nmr two t 2 cutoffs were proposed to distinguish three different types of water e g bulk water capillary water and bound water the θ u of each type of water was also calculated the effects of the clay content psd and clay mineral content on the unfrozen contents of various types of water during the freezing process were analyzed the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 for the three tested soils two cutoffs can be established to divide the t 2 distribution curve into three parts corresponding to three different types of water the behavior of the bulk capillary and bound water identified by two cutoffs was discussed in detail according to the variations in the sfcc for different types of water the bulk water freezes first followed by capillary water and some bound water and finally just the bound water in addition the cutoff 1 values for soil samples s1 s2 and c are 1 65 1 53 and 1 77 ms respectively and the cutoff 2 values for soil samples s1 s2 and c are 2 95 1 84 and 3 92 ms respectively 2 the sfccs of different types of water can be divided into three stages the unfrozen stage i the rapid drop stage ii and the residual stage iii the residual θ u for bulk water and capillary water is zero in addition the rate of change of θ u descending with temperature in the rapid drop stage displays little variation among samples for the total unfrozen water and bulk water 3 the clay content and clay mineral content mainly affect the sfcc of bound water the greater the clay content and the total clay mineral content the higher the θ u values in the unfrozen stage and residual stage and the greater the change rate in the rapid drop stage the psd affects the changes in the sfccs of both bound water and capillary water the change rate of the sfcc gradually decreases as the sand and silt content decreases in the rapid drop stage for capillary water however these conclusions cannot be extrapolated at this time more samples will be examined in the future 4 in general the variations of θ u calculated by the zhang et al 2017 model fit the measured data well especially for bound water the fitting parameter ω can reflect the effects of the psd and the content of both clay and silt on θ u however the single parameter ω was not sufficient to reflect the effect of clay mineral content or clay content on the θ u credit authorship contribution statement

4182,in order to multi objectives and uncertainties in the optimization allocation of irrigation water resources this paper developed an improved interval multi objectives programming method the proposed model was then applied to a case study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption are regarded as planning objectives a series of planting structure optimal schemes were obtained under different representative hydrological years from the result shortage of water resources has a negative effect on the development of jinghuiqu irrigation district moreover the remaining water resources prefer vegetable to wheat after meeting the minimum demand of the developed model which characterized with high economic benefit and lower energy consumption moreover due to the introduction of effective precipitation a lot of irrigation water resources have been saved such as 47 14 of total water consumption was saved when p 25 furthermore the desired optimal schemes can be obtained by the decision makers based on the results of the developed model keywords multi objectives energy consumption optimization allocation uncertainties 1 introduction with the rapid development of economic and rapid growth of population the demand for water resources is increasing rapidly gong et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 today however the amount of available water resource is decreasing due to climate change and the deterioration of water quality ren et al 2019 therefore there is severe conflict between water demand and water supply which has caused water shortage crisis especially for arid and semi arid area for example a quarter of the world s population is facing water shortages and humanity is facing a global water crisis according to the world water development report published in 2019 zhang et al 2020 in addition the waste of water resources in agricultural planting has exacerbated the severe water shortages crisis li et al 2020a for example agricultural water consumption accounts for 61 4 of the total water consumption in china however the irrigation water utilization coefficient is only 0 532 zhang et al 2019a li et al 2020b therefore optimization allocation of irrigation water resources is a potential way to deal with the above problems recently many studies have been put forwarded to optimize irrigation water resources difallah et al 2017 abdulbaki et al 2017 lin et al 2017 dong et al 2018 li et al 2019 yan et al 2020 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021 for example a linear programming model made maximize economic benefit as objective was developed to the optimal land and water resources allocation which can be used in conjunction with poor quality groundwater and good quality canal water singh and panda 2012 garg et al 2014 proposed a non linear optimization model for deficit irrigation which made deficit levels of irrigation as variables in order to improve utilization efficiency of irrigation water an improved ant colony optimization formulation was developed to the allocation of crops and water which made maximize net returns as objective nguyen et al 2016 when faced with shortage of water resources a simulation optimization programming model combined crop water model and field water cycle model with optimization model was developed which made maximize system net benefit as objective lin et al 2017 for the purpose of optimizing regional crop water consumption a single objective linear programming model coupled the distributed water consumption model with crop suitability was proposed which made net benefit as objective he et al 2018 in order to deal with the irrigation water allocation problem in the tunisian case a hybrid fuzzy multi criteria decision making was proposed elleuch et al 2019 in order to deal with shortage of agricultural water resources a simulation optimization model for irrigation scheduling optimization integrated the soil water balance simulation model and the optimization model was developed which aimed to maximize crop yield li et al 2020a li et al 2020b li et al 2020c li et al 2020d li et al 2020e when considering shortage of water resources and climate change a network flow programming based modsim coupled with grey wolf optimization algorithm was proposed to improve irrigation water use efficiency jamshidpey and shourian 2020 for the purpose of improving irrigation water use efficiency and controlling soil salinity an irrigation drainage collaborative optimization model was developed which aimed at maximizing economic benefit li et al 2020c in order to achieve maximum economic benefits a fuzzy dependent chance programming was developed to optimize limited irrigation water zhang et al 2021 although the above studies have contributed to improving the irrigation water use efficiency most of them only focus on obtaining the maximum economic benefits or minimum the system cost however fewer studies take energy consumption under consideration when optimizing irrigation water resources energy plays an irreplaceable role in planting industry which is always ignored in the process of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources li et al 2020d tsolas et al 2018 for example energy consumption is involved in the process of water extraction transportation irrigation and drainage in addition the whole process of plant growth also involves energy consumption such as pesticides fertilizers cai et al 2018 tian et al 2018 in addition according to the global risk report published in 2011 water energy food nexus risk group was first identified as one of the three annual risk groups davis 2011 therefore energy consumption should also be considered when optimizing the allocation of agricultural water resources therefore in this study an optimization model which takes both energy consumption and water resources use efficiency under consideration was developed moreover in the process of agricultural production many uncertain factors are involved in the water resources system and energy consumption system which are characterized by it cannot provide accurate values xie et al 2017 ren and zhang 2019 hu et al 2020 for example the amount of available surface water resources may have stochastic uncertainty and the crop prices may have fuzzy uncertainty yang et al 2015 yang et al 2021 in order to deal with the above problems a series of mathematical programming models have been developed such as stochastic linear fractional programming model interval two stage stochastic model intuitionistic fuzzy interval two stage stochastic programming model ren et al 2013 fu et al 2018a fu et al 2018b guo et al 2019 in this paper some parameters are characteristic by interval uncertainty such as available groundwater resources crop price and energy consumption per area thus interval mathematical programming was introduced into the developed optimization allocation model because it has the ability to deal with the interval parameter which have the characteristic of replacing accurate values with the upper and lower values fu et al 2018a fu et al 2018b guo et al 2010 in addition in this study economic benefit and energy consumption are both under consideration which is a multi objective problem in the past some studies put attention on multi objectives problem when faced with the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources mortazavi et al 2012 davijani et al 2016 for example when faced with multi objectives problems in optimizing irrigation water resources li just assigned weight to each objective based on her own judgment li and guo 2014 in order to deal with the optimization allocation of water and land resources under uncertainty a multi objective programming model was developed which also assigned weight to each objective based on subjective judgment ren et al 2017 in order to relieve the negative influence on optimal plans caused by assigning weight among multi objectives based on subjective judgement the analytic hierarchy process method was introduced to deal with the weight distribution in multi objective programming leong et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however whether the weight of each objective is determined by the subjective judgement or the analytic hierarchy process method the negative influence caused by assigned weight cannot be eliminated therefore in order to deal with the above problem the zimmermann programming was incorporated into the developed model which has the ability to obtain the pareto solution under the maximum total satisfaction and minimum total satisfaction zimmermann 1978 guo and li 2008 therefore in order to deal with the multiple objectives and multiple uncertainties problems in irrigation system this paper developed an improved interval multi objectives programming model imopm to optimize the allocation of irrigation water resources in addition due to the irreplaceable role of energy in the planting industry energy consumption is taken into consideration which was always been ignored in many other studies then the proposed model was applied to jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption are made as objectives the advantages of the put forwarded model are as follows a it has the ability to deal with multiple objectives problems b it can effectively eliminate the negative influence on optimization plans caused by weight distribution among multiple objectives c energy consumption were taken into account d it can effectively deal with multiple uncertainties expressed as interval e it takes groundwater exploitation food security under consideration f it can provides a series of optimization allocation plans for irrigation water resources under different representative hydrological years 2 model formulation 2 1 interval multi objective programming the interval multi objective programming model imopm are formulated as follows 1a min f k x j 1 n a kj x j k 1 2 p 1b j 1 n b ij x j c i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 j 1 2 n where f k x k 1 2 p represents the objective function a kj and b ij respectively represent k by j and i by j matrix which are characterized with interval uncertainty c i represents column vector with i components for the interval parameter a a a it can be represented as follows according to the perspective of set 2 a a a r ij a a 0 r ij 1 therefore the model 1 can be transformed as follows 3a min f k x j 1 n a kj j 1 n r kj a ki a kj x j 3b j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij s ij x j c i c i t i c i 3c x j 00 r kj 10 s ij 10 t i 1 where a ki and a kj respectively represent upper and lower bound of matrix a ki a and a represent upper and lower bound of interval parameter a respectively b ij and b ij respectively represent upper and lower bound of matrix b ij c i and c i respectively represent upper and lower bound of column vector c i let p kj r kj x j and q ij s ij x j then 0 p kj x j and 0 q ij x j therefore the model 3 can be transformed as follows 4a min f k x p k j 1 n a kj x j j 1 n a kj a kj p kj 4b j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 4c x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 for the purpose of using the zimmermann programming to deal with the model 4 the membership function of each objective function z k x p k should be defined firstly which is represented as follows 5 μ k x p k 1 f k x p k f k min f k max f k x p k f k max f k min f k min f k x p k 0 f k x p k f k max where f k min and f k max respectively represent the optimal value of the single objective linear programming model 6 and 7 which are represented as follows 6a min f k x p k j 1 n a kj x j j 1 n a kj a kj p kj 6b j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 6c x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 7a max f k x p k j 1 n a kj x j j 1 n a kj a kj p kj 7b j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 7c x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 therefore the model 4 can be transformed into a linear programming as follows 8a max λ 8b λ μ k x p k 8c j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 8d x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 where λ means total satisfactory degree of each objective function the model 9 can be obtained by bringing model 5 into model 8 which represent as follows 9a max λ 9b f k max f k min λ j 1 n a kj x j j 1 n a kj a kj p kj f k max 9c j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 9d x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 based on the model 2 the model 9 can be transformed into interval linear programming model as below 10a max λ 10b f k max f k min λ j 1 n a kj x j f k max 10c j 1 n b ij x j c i 10d x j 0 therefore the model 10 can be solved by establishing the best value model and the worst optimal value model according to the interval programming huang et al 1993 the best value model 11a max λ 11b f k max f k min λ j 1 n a kj x j f k max 11c j 1 n b ij x j c i 11d x j 0 the worst value model 12a max λ 12b f k max f k min λ j 1 n a kj x j f k max 12c j 1 n b ij x j c i 12d x j 0 by solving the above models 11 and 12 the optimal values λ and λ can be obtained respectively in addition the optimal value of model 11 is brought into the optimal objective function f k x j 1 n a kj x j of the kth objective function f k x j 1 n a kj x j and the corresponding optimal objective value f k can be obtained similarly the optimal value of model 12 is brought into the optimal objective function f k x j 1 n a kj x j of the kth objective function f k x j 1 n a kj x j and the corresponding optimal objective value f k can be obtained therefore the optimal interval value of the kth objective function of imolp f k f k can be obtained based on the above analysis multi objective issues and multiple uncertainty issue can be solved simultaneously by the developed improved interval multi objective programming model the steps of solving the imopm model are as follows a build the original imopm model 14 b set the representative hydrological year pi and solve the interval multi objective programming model by section 2 1 c change the value of representative hydrological year pi and repeat steps b to d d get the solutions under different representative hydrological years 3 application 3 1 study area jinghuiqu irrigation district located in the middle of the guanzhong plain shaanxi province was selected as study aera in this study fig 1 the irrigation district is 70 km long from east to west and 20 km wide from north to south with a total area of 118 103 ha and it plays an irreplaceable role in the economic and social development of shaanxi province yi et al 2010 in addition the annual average precipitation of jinghuiqu irrigation district is 538 90 mm mainly from july to september however the annual average is 1212 00 mm which means that it has the characteristics of high evaporation and low precipitation bi level moreover the runoff of jinghe river which is the main water supply source of jinghuiqu irrigation district is gradually decreasing due to the impact of human activities and climate change wei et al 2020 moreover a lot of water resources is wasted in the process of agricultural production and agriculture is a heavily water consumption industry therefore water resources shortage which has caused negative influence on the sustainable development of irrigation district is existed in the irrigation district optimal allocation of water resources is a potential way to deal with the above problems wheat maize fruit tree and vegetable were selected as study crops which are the main crops of study area 3 2 energy consumption calculation with the development of agricultural mechanization a lot of energy is consumed in modern agricultural production which has become an energy intensive industry for example approximately 30 of the world s available energy is consumed in the food system thus energy plays an irreplaceable role in the process of agricultural production during the process of agricultural production four forms of energy consumption play a major role chemical fertilizers consumption total power of agricultural machinery agricultural electricity consumption and pesticide consumption zhang et al 2019b the fuel consumed in agriculture is mainly diesel and engine oil and engine oil consumption is relatively small compared to diesel therefore only diesel fuel is considered for fuel consumption a diesel consumption calculation 13 e 1 t f 1 t p 1 t n 1 f 7 f 4 m p 1 t n 1 e 1 t diesel energy consumption in the t

the t year due to the mechanical operation fee means that the cost paid by farmers for renting machinery this fee includes the cost of purchasing fuel and the rental fee therefore it is necessary to

table 1 represents the energy consumption coefficients therefore according to the energy consumption calculation and energy consumption coefficient the energy consumption of selected study crops is represented in table 2 3 3 model building based on the above analysis an improved inexact multi objective stochastic model which made maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption as objectives was developed for optimizing irrigation water resources under multiple uncertainties fig 2 illustrates the research process of this study the formulation of the established model is presented below objective function 1 maximization of economic benefit 18a max p i y i a r i c w i w i a r i objective function 2 minimum of energy consumption 18b min e c i a r i constraints available

max total crop area constraint 18h i 1 i a r i a r the parameters of the establish model were shown in the table 3 in addition 54 years of precipitation series data were collected to analyze the for hydrological frequency analysis by the hydrologic frequency analysis method based on the above analysis the effective precipitation of wet normal and dry hydrological year was obtained which is presented in table 4 table 5 and 6 represented the crop evapotranspiration and crop water production function of study crops respectively based on the obtained wet normal and dry representative hydrological years the corresponding available surface water are 2 6351 108 m3 2 4508 108 m3 and 1 8440 108 m3 respectively moreover the other main parameters of the developed model were presented in tables 7 and 8 in addition during the process of dealing with the established multi objectives optimization model the single maximum economic benefit objective and minimum energy consumption optimization models with the same constraints can be obtained based on the interval linear programming huang et al 1992 the optimal values of single objective can be got which can be used to compared with the optimal values of multi objectives 4 result and discussion in this study wet p 25 normal p 50 and dry p 75 representative hydrological years were determined by the developed model and during the process of deal with the established multi objectives model the optimal values under minimum or maximum economic benefit objective and minimum or maximum energy consumption objective can be obtained fig 3 illustrates the economic benefit of multi objectives under different representative hydrological years from fig 3 as representative hydrological year changes the optimal value of upper and lower bound are changing in general the optimal value of lower and upper bound would decline when representative hydrological years changes from wet to dry for example the lower bound of economic benefit would decrease from 86 69 108 to 38 31 108 the upper bound of economic benefit would decrease from 144 70 108 to 57 69 108 in this paper standard coal contains 7000 kcal energy by one kilogram was selected as the unit of energy consumption fig 4 shows the optimized energy consumption of multi objectives under different representative hydrological years from fig 4 it represents the same trend as fig 3 for example the lower bound of energy consumption would decrease from 62 49 103 t to 49 22 103 t the upper bound of economic benefit would decrease from 79 11 103 t to 57 83 103 t moreover according to the optimization results a large amount of energy is consumed in the agricultural production process figs 5 and 6 illustrate the optimization allocation of irrigation area and optimal distribution of irrigation area among different crops under different representative hydrological years from figures the lower and upper bound of optimal value would change when the representative hydrological years changed from fig 5 the lower and upper bound of optimized irrigation area show a downward trend as representative hydrological years change from wet to dry for example the upper bound of optimized irrigation area would change from 7 03 104 ha to 5 84 104 ha and the lower bound of optimized irrigation area would change from 6 82 104 ha to 5 84 104 ha when comparing figs 5 and 4 although there are similar trends there are still differences vegetable shows the same trend as fig 4 when representative hydrological years changed for example when representative hydrological years change from wet to dry the lower and upper bound of optimized irrigation area in vegetable would decrease from 1 5 104 ha to 0 48 104 ha and 1 69 104 ha to 0 48 104 ha respectively while when facing wheat the lower and upper bound of optimal values have remained unchanged when representative hydrological years change from wet to dry when facing maize the value lower and upper bound would change as the representative hydrological years changed but the value of lower and upper bound remain unchanged under the same representative hydrological years for example when pi 25 the value of lower and upper bound is 2 24 104 ha and when pi 50 the value of lower and upper bound is 2 17 104 ha when facing fruit tree it shows the same trend as wheat except when wet representative hydrological years for example the value of lower and upper bound are 0 63 104 ha and 0 65 104 ha respectively the reason is that the minimum irrigation area demand and food security demand should be satisfied firstly based on the established model thus the remaining water resources would be distributed to the crops characterized with low energy consumption and high economic benefit or high yield therefore the remaining water resources prefer vegetable to wheat after meeting the minimum demand of the developed model which characterized with high economic benefit and lower energy consumption in general based on the above analysis water resources shortage has become the main factor restricting the development of irrigation district in addition in the process of solving the multi objective programming model the optimal values under minimum or maximum economic benefit objective and minimum or maximum energy consumption objective can be obtained figs 7 8 and 9 represent the lower and upper bound of economic benefit energy consumption and irrigation area of different objectives under different representative hydrological years respectively from figures as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the upper bound of economic benefit energy consumption and irrigation area represented a downward trend for example when representative hydrological year changed from wet to dry the upper bound of economic benefit under economic objective multi objectives and energy objective reduced from 157 55 108 to 57 67 108 144 70 108 to 57 69 108 and 144 74 108 to 65 94 108 respectively when facing the value of lower bound under different objectives only the optimal value of lower bound under multiple objectives represents the same trend as the optimal value of upper bound for example the economic benefit reduced from 86 69 108 to 38 31 108 when representative hydrological years changed moreover from the figures no matter how the representative hydrological years changed the lower bound of economic benefit energy consumption and irrigation area under economic and energy consumption objective are the same this is because that only the minimum constraints need to be satisfied under single minimum economic benefit and energy consumption objective moreover from the figures whether economic benefit objective and energy consumption objective there is big gap between the maximum and minimum optimal value and making pi 25 as an example the optimization allocation of irrigation area under minimum economic benefit and energy consumption objective is 5 8 104 ha the optimization allocation of irrigation area under maximum economic benefit and energy consumption objective are 7 89 104 ha and 8 07 104 ha respectively however the lower and upper bound of optimal irrigation area under multi objectives are 6 82 104 ha and 7 03 104 ha respectively which did not show great gap as the optimal value of economic benefit and energy consumption objective the reason is that the multi objective programming model has the ability to balance multiple conflicting objectives and obtain the optimal value which is the advantage of the multi objective optimization programming model from figs 7 and 8 pi 25 was also selected as an example the economic benefit and energy consumption under maximum economic objective are 157 55 108 and 101 72 103 t while the economic benefit and energy consumption under minimum energy consumption objective are 35 52 108 and 49 01 103 t when pi 25 based on the above result when achieving the objective of maximizing economic benefit there are a lot of energy have been consumed while when achieving the objective of minimizing energy consumption economic benefits are severely reduced there are great conflicts between maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption however the economic benefit and energy consumption under multi objectives are 86 69 108 144 70 108 and 62 49 103 79 11 103 t based on the result a balance is reached between two great conflicting objectives based on the developed multi objectives programming model in addition figs 10 and 11 represent total consumption of water resources under different representative hydrological years and composition of water resources consumption when p 25 respectively from fig 10 optimized total water consumption would change as representative hydrological years changed although it has roughly the same trend as fig 4 there is a big difference the difference is that both upper and lower bound of water consumption under p 50 are higher than they are under p 25 respectively this is because that crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation are taken into account during the process of optimization allocation of irrigation water resources and the crop evapotranspiration at p 50 is relatively higher than it at p 25 therefore although the optimal total crop area at p 25 is higher than it at p 50 the optimal water consumption of the former is lower than that of the latter in addition the wet representative hydrological year was chosen as the representative one to interpret the composition of water resources consumption fig 11 represents the composition of total water resources consumption when p 25 from figure the total water consumption is consisted of optimization allocation of water resources and effective precipitation and regardless of the upper and lower bound of total water consumption effective precipitation accounts for a large proportion for example the upper bound of total water consumption is 43110 104 m3 optimization allocation of water resources is 22790 104 m3 but the effective precipitation is 20320 104 m3 which accounts for 47 14 of total water consumption from the above analysis a lot of irrigation water resources by the effective precipitation therefore effective precipitation plays an important role in the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources especially when water resources shortage is particularly severe therefore when crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation were took under consideration in the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources irrigation water could be greatly saved by the developed model based on the above analysis the established model has important significance for the sustainable development of the jinghuiqu irrigation district moreover in real world problems multiple conflicting objectives are always involved in the process of optimizing irrigation water resources due to the complex of irrigation system especially when energy consumption is taken into account due to the introduction of effective precipitation a lot of irrigation water resources can be saved the developed model can not only deal with the problem of multi objectives but also solve the conflicting problems among multiple objectives effectively in addition a series of optimal scheme can be obtained under different representative hydrological years by the established model 5 conclusion in this study an improved interval multi objectives programming model was established to optimization allocation of irrigation water resources under uncertainties which could not only optimize the planting structure but also has the advantage of dealing with multiple conflicting objectives in addition the developed model could also deal with uncertainties expressed as interval sets and offer different optimal schemes under different representative hydrological years the proposed model was then applied in a real world study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china in this application maximum economic benefits and minimum energy consumption were regarded as objectives which is great conflict between them compared with the previous studies it has the following advantages a deal with the multiple objectives b eliminate the negative influence on optimization plans caused by weight distribution among multiple objectives c take energy consumption into account d deal with the multiple uncertainties expressed as interval e take groundwater exploitation food security under consideration moreover different optimal schemes were obtained under different representative hydrological years by the proposed model although the established model has the ability deal with multi objectives problems and uncertainties expressed as interval sets it still has potential for improvement for example during the process of energy consumption calculation it focuses on the chemical fertilizers agricultural machinery power electricity consumption and pesticides based on the assumption in addition there are different types of uncertainties in the complex irrigation system such as fuzzy uncertainty and random uncertainty and in the process of solving the multi objective problems they may not only have a competitive relationship but also be located at different levels which belongs to two programming problems therefore attention should be putted on detailed energy consumption calculation multiple types of uncertainties and two programming problems credit authorship

4182,in order to multi objectives and uncertainties in the optimization allocation of irrigation water resources this paper developed an improved interval multi objectives programming method the proposed model was then applied to a case study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption are regarded as planning objectives a series of planting structure optimal schemes were obtained under different representative hydrological years from the result shortage of water resources has a negative effect on the development of jinghuiqu irrigation district moreover the remaining water resources prefer vegetable to wheat after meeting the minimum demand of the developed model which characterized with high economic benefit and lower energy consumption moreover due to the introduction of effective precipitation a lot of irrigation water resources have been saved such as 47 14 of total water consumption was saved when p 25 furthermore the desired optimal schemes can be obtained by the decision makers based on the results of the developed model keywords multi objectives energy consumption optimization allocation uncertainties 1 introduction with the rapid development of economic and rapid growth of population the demand for water resources is increasing rapidly gong et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 today however the amount of available water resource is decreasing due to climate change and the deterioration of water quality ren et al 2019 therefore there is severe conflict between water demand and water supply which has caused water shortage crisis especially for arid and semi arid area for example a quarter of the world s population is facing water shortages and humanity is facing a global water crisis according to the world water development report published in 2019 zhang et al 2020 in addition the waste of water resources in agricultural planting has exacerbated the severe water shortages crisis li et al 2020a for example agricultural water consumption accounts for 61 4 of the total water consumption in china however the irrigation water utilization coefficient is only 0 532 zhang et al 2019a li et al 2020b therefore optimization allocation of irrigation water resources is a potential way to deal with the above problems recently many studies have been put forwarded to optimize irrigation water resources difallah et al 2017 abdulbaki et al 2017 lin et al 2017 dong et al 2018 li et al 2019 yan et al 2020 li et al 2021 wang et al 2021 for example a linear programming model made maximize economic benefit as objective was developed to the optimal land and water resources allocation which can be used in conjunction with poor quality groundwater and good quality canal water singh and panda 2012 garg et al 2014 proposed a non linear optimization model for deficit irrigation which made deficit levels of irrigation as variables in order to improve utilization efficiency of irrigation water an improved ant colony optimization formulation was developed to the allocation of crops and water which made maximize net returns as objective nguyen et al 2016 when faced with shortage of water resources a simulation optimization programming model combined crop water model and field water cycle model with optimization model was developed which made maximize system net benefit as objective lin et al 2017 for the purpose of optimizing regional crop water consumption a single objective linear programming model coupled the distributed water consumption model with crop suitability was proposed which made net benefit as objective he et al 2018 in order to deal with the irrigation water allocation problem in the tunisian case a hybrid fuzzy multi criteria decision making was proposed elleuch et al 2019 in order to deal with shortage of agricultural water resources a simulation optimization model for irrigation scheduling optimization integrated the soil water balance simulation model and the optimization model was developed which aimed to maximize crop yield li et al 2020a li et al 2020b li et al 2020c li et al 2020d li et al 2020e when considering shortage of water resources and climate change a network flow programming based modsim coupled with grey wolf optimization algorithm was proposed to improve irrigation water use efficiency jamshidpey and shourian 2020 for the purpose of improving irrigation water use efficiency and controlling soil salinity an irrigation drainage collaborative optimization model was developed which aimed at maximizing economic benefit li et al 2020c in order to achieve maximum economic benefits a fuzzy dependent chance programming was developed to optimize limited irrigation water zhang et al 2021 although the above studies have contributed to improving the irrigation water use efficiency most of them only focus on obtaining the maximum economic benefits or minimum the system cost however fewer studies take energy consumption under consideration when optimizing irrigation water resources energy plays an irreplaceable role in planting industry which is always ignored in the process of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources li et al 2020d tsolas et al 2018 for example energy consumption is involved in the process of water extraction transportation irrigation and drainage in addition the whole process of plant growth also involves energy consumption such as pesticides fertilizers cai et al 2018 tian et al 2018 in addition according to the global risk report published in 2011 water energy food nexus risk group was first identified as one of the three annual risk groups davis 2011 therefore energy consumption should also be considered when optimizing the allocation of agricultural water resources therefore in this study an optimization model which takes both energy consumption and water resources use efficiency under consideration was developed moreover in the process of agricultural production many uncertain factors are involved in the water resources system and energy consumption system which are characterized by it cannot provide accurate values xie et al 2017 ren and zhang 2019 hu et al 2020 for example the amount of available surface water resources may have stochastic uncertainty and the crop prices may have fuzzy uncertainty yang et al 2015 yang et al 2021 in order to deal with the above problems a series of mathematical programming models have been developed such as stochastic linear fractional programming model interval two stage stochastic model intuitionistic fuzzy interval two stage stochastic programming model ren et al 2013 fu et al 2018a fu et al 2018b guo et al 2019 in this paper some parameters are characteristic by interval uncertainty such as available groundwater resources crop price and energy consumption per area thus interval mathematical programming was introduced into the developed optimization allocation model because it has the ability to deal with the interval parameter which have the characteristic of replacing accurate values with the upper and lower values fu et al 2018a fu et al 2018b guo et al 2010 in addition in this study economic benefit and energy consumption are both under consideration which is a multi objective problem in the past some studies put attention on multi objectives problem when faced with the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources mortazavi et al 2012 davijani et al 2016 for example when faced with multi objectives problems in optimizing irrigation water resources li just assigned weight to each objective based on her own judgment li and guo 2014 in order to deal with the optimization allocation of water and land resources under uncertainty a multi objective programming model was developed which also assigned weight to each objective based on subjective judgment ren et al 2017 in order to relieve the negative influence on optimal plans caused by assigning weight among multi objectives based on subjective judgement the analytic hierarchy process method was introduced to deal with the weight distribution in multi objective programming leong et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however whether the weight of each objective is determined by the subjective judgement or the analytic hierarchy process method the negative influence caused by assigned weight cannot be eliminated therefore in order to deal with the above problem the zimmermann programming was incorporated into the developed model which has the ability to obtain the pareto solution under the maximum total satisfaction and minimum total satisfaction zimmermann 1978 guo and li 2008 therefore in order to deal with the multiple objectives and multiple uncertainties problems in irrigation system this paper developed an improved interval multi objectives programming model imopm to optimize the allocation of irrigation water resources in addition due to the irreplaceable role of energy in the planting industry energy consumption is taken into consideration which was always been ignored in many other studies then the proposed model was applied to jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption are made as objectives the advantages of the put forwarded model are as follows a it has the ability to deal with multiple objectives problems b it can effectively eliminate the negative influence on optimization plans caused by weight distribution among multiple objectives c energy consumption were taken into account d it can effectively deal with multiple uncertainties expressed as interval e it takes groundwater exploitation food security under consideration f it can provides a series of optimization allocation plans for irrigation water resources under different representative hydrological years 2 model formulation 2 1 interval multi objective programming the interval multi objective programming model imopm are formulated as follows 1a min f k x j 1 n a kj x j k 1 2 p 1b j 1 n b ij x j c i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 j 1 2 n where f k x k 1 2 p represents the objective function a kj and b ij respectively represent k by j and i by j matrix which are characterized with interval uncertainty c i represents column vector with i components for the interval parameter a a a it can be represented as follows according to the perspective of set 2 a a a r ij a a 0 r ij 1 therefore the model 1 can be transformed as follows 3a min f k x j 1 n a kj j 1 n r kj a ki a kj x j 3b j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij s ij x j c i c i t i c i 3c x j 00 r kj 10 s ij 10 t i 1 where a ki and a kj respectively represent upper and lower bound of matrix a ki a and a represent upper and lower bound of interval parameter a respectively b ij and b ij respectively represent upper and lower bound of matrix b ij c i and c i respectively represent upper and lower bound of column vector c i let p kj r kj x j and q ij s ij x j then 0 p kj x j and 0 q ij x j therefore the model 3 can be transformed as follows 4a min f k x p k j 1 n a kj x j j 1 n a kj a kj p kj 4b j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 4c x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 for the purpose of using the zimmermann programming to deal with the model 4 the membership function of each objective function z k x p k should be defined firstly which is represented as follows 5 μ k x p k 1 f k x p k f k min f k max f k x p k f k max f k min f k min f k x p k 0 f k x p k f k max where f k min and f k max respectively represent the optimal value of the single objective linear programming model 6 and 7 which are represented as follows 6a min f k x p k j 1 n a kj x j j 1 n a kj a kj p kj 6b j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 6c x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 7a max f k x p k j 1 n a kj x j j 1 n a kj a kj p kj 7b j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 7c x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 therefore the model 4 can be transformed into a linear programming as follows 8a max λ 8b λ μ k x p k 8c j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 8d x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 where λ means total satisfactory degree of each objective function the model 9 can be obtained by bringing model 5 into model 8 which represent as follows 9a max λ 9b f k max f k min λ j 1 n a kj x j j 1 n a kj a kj p kj f k max 9c j 1 n b ij x j j 1 n b ij b ij q ij c i c i t i c i 9d x j 00 p kj x j 0 q ij x j 0 t i 1 based on the model 2 the model 9 can be transformed into interval linear programming model as below 10a max λ 10b f k max f k min λ j 1 n a kj x j f k max 10c j 1 n b ij x j c i 10d x j 0 therefore the model 10 can be solved by establishing the best value model and the worst optimal value model according to the interval programming huang et al 1993 the best value model 11a max λ 11b f k max f k min λ j 1 n a kj x j f k max 11c j 1 n b ij x j c i 11d x j 0 the worst value model 12a max λ 12b f k max f k min λ j 1 n a kj x j f k max 12c j 1 n b ij x j c i 12d x j 0 by solving the above models 11 and 12 the optimal values λ and λ can be obtained respectively in addition the optimal value of model 11 is brought into the optimal objective function f k x j 1 n a kj x j of the kth objective function f k x j 1 n a kj x j and the corresponding optimal objective value f k can be obtained similarly the optimal value of model 12 is brought into the optimal objective function f k x j 1 n a kj x j of the kth objective function f k x j 1 n a kj x j and the corresponding optimal objective value f k can be obtained therefore the optimal interval value of the kth objective function of imolp f k f k can be obtained based on the above analysis multi objective issues and multiple uncertainty issue can be solved simultaneously by the developed improved interval multi objective programming model the steps of solving the imopm model are as follows a build the original imopm model 14 b set the representative hydrological year pi and solve the interval multi objective programming model by section 2 1 c change the value of representative hydrological year pi and repeat steps b to d d get the solutions under different representative hydrological years 3 application 3 1 study area jinghuiqu irrigation district located in the middle of the guanzhong plain shaanxi province was selected as study aera in this study fig 1 the irrigation district is 70 km long from east to west and 20 km wide from north to south with a total area of 118 103 ha and it plays an irreplaceable role in the economic and social development of shaanxi province yi et al 2010 in addition the annual average precipitation of jinghuiqu irrigation district is 538 90 mm mainly from july to september however the annual average is 1212 00 mm which means that it has the characteristics of high evaporation and low precipitation bi level moreover the runoff of jinghe river which is the main water supply source of jinghuiqu irrigation district is gradually decreasing due to the impact of human activities and climate change wei et al 2020 moreover a lot of water resources is wasted in the process of agricultural production and agriculture is a heavily water consumption industry therefore water resources shortage which has caused negative influence on the sustainable development of irrigation district is existed in the irrigation district optimal allocation of water resources is a potential way to deal with the above problems wheat maize fruit tree and vegetable were selected as study crops which are the main crops of study area 3 2 energy consumption calculation with the development of agricultural mechanization a lot of energy is consumed in modern agricultural production which has become an energy intensive industry for example approximately 30 of the world s available energy is consumed in the food system thus energy plays an irreplaceable role in the process of agricultural production during the process of agricultural production four forms of energy consumption play a major role chemical fertilizers consumption total power of agricultural machinery agricultural electricity consumption and pesticide consumption zhang et al 2019b the fuel consumed in agriculture is mainly diesel and engine oil and engine oil consumption is relatively small compared to diesel therefore only diesel fuel is considered for fuel consumption a diesel consumption calculation 13 e 1 t f 1 t p 1 t n 1 f 7 f 4 m p 1 t n 1 e 1 t diesel energy consumption in the t

the t year due to the mechanical operation fee means that the cost paid by farmers for renting machinery this fee includes the cost of purchasing fuel and the rental fee therefore it is necessary to

table 1 represents the energy consumption coefficients therefore according to the energy consumption calculation and energy consumption coefficient the energy consumption of selected study crops is represented in table 2 3 3 model building based on the above analysis an improved inexact multi objective stochastic model which made maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption as objectives was developed for optimizing irrigation water resources under multiple uncertainties fig 2 illustrates the research process of this study the formulation of the established model is

hydrological frequency analysis by the hydrologic frequency analysis method based on the above analysis the effective precipitation of wet normal and dry hydrological year was obtained which is presented in table 4 table 5 and 6 represented the crop evapotranspiration and crop water production function of study crops respectively based on the obtained wet normal and dry representative hydrological years the corresponding available surface water are 2 6351 108 m3 2 4508 108 m3 and 1 8440 108 m3 respectively moreover the other main parameters of the developed model were presented in tables 7 and 8 in addition during the process of dealing with the established multi objectives optimization model the single maximum economic benefit objective and minimum energy consumption optimization models with the same constraints can be obtained based on the interval linear programming huang et al 1992 the optimal values of single objective can be got which can be used to compared with the optimal values of multi objectives 4 result and discussion in this study wet p 25 normal p 50 and dry p 75 representative hydrological years were determined by the developed model and during the process of deal with the established multi objectives model the optimal values under minimum or maximum economic benefit objective and minimum or maximum energy consumption objective can be obtained fig 3 illustrates the economic benefit of multi objectives under different representative hydrological years from fig 3 as representative hydrological year changes the optimal value of upper and lower bound are changing in general the optimal value of lower and upper bound would decline when representative hydrological years changes from wet to dry for example the lower bound of economic benefit would decrease from 86 69 108 to 38 31 108 the upper bound of economic benefit would decrease from 144 70 108 to 57 69 108 in this paper standard coal contains 7000 kcal energy by one kilogram was selected as the unit of energy consumption fig 4 shows the optimized energy consumption of multi objectives under different representative hydrological years from fig 4 it represents the same trend as fig 3 for example the lower bound of energy consumption would decrease from 62 49 103 t to 49 22 103 t the upper bound of economic benefit would decrease from 79 11 103 t to 57 83 103 t moreover according to the optimization results a large amount of energy is consumed in the agricultural production process figs 5 and 6 illustrate the optimization allocation of irrigation area and optimal distribution of irrigation area among different crops under different representative hydrological years from figures the lower and upper bound of optimal value would change when the representative hydrological years changed from fig 5 the lower and upper bound of optimized irrigation area show a downward trend as representative hydrological years change from wet to dry for example the upper bound of optimized irrigation area would change from 7 03 104 ha to 5 84 104 ha and the lower bound of optimized irrigation area would change from 6 82 104 ha to 5 84 104 ha when comparing figs 5 and 4 although there are similar trends there are still differences vegetable shows the same trend as fig 4 when representative hydrological years changed for example when representative hydrological years change from wet to dry the lower and upper bound of optimized irrigation area in vegetable would decrease from 1 5 104 ha to 0 48 104 ha and 1 69 104 ha to 0 48 104 ha respectively while when facing wheat the lower and upper bound of optimal values have remained unchanged when representative hydrological years change from wet to dry when facing maize the value lower and upper bound would change as the representative hydrological years changed but the value of lower and upper bound remain unchanged under the same representative hydrological years for example when pi 25 the value of lower and upper bound is 2 24 104 ha and when pi 50 the value of lower and upper bound is 2 17 104 ha when facing fruit tree it shows the same trend as wheat except when wet representative hydrological years for example the value of lower and upper bound are 0 63 104 ha and 0 65 104 ha respectively the reason is that the minimum irrigation area demand and food security demand should be satisfied firstly based on the established model thus the remaining water resources would be distributed to the crops characterized with low energy consumption and high economic benefit or high yield therefore the remaining water resources prefer vegetable to wheat after meeting the minimum demand of the developed model which characterized with high economic benefit and lower energy consumption in general based on the above analysis water resources shortage has become the main factor restricting the development of irrigation district in addition in the process of solving the multi objective programming model the optimal values under minimum or maximum economic benefit objective and minimum or maximum energy consumption objective can be obtained figs 7 8 and 9 represent the lower and upper bound of economic benefit energy consumption and irrigation area of different objectives under different representative hydrological years respectively from figures as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the upper bound of economic benefit energy consumption and irrigation area represented a downward trend for example when representative hydrological year changed from wet to dry the upper bound of economic benefit under economic objective multi objectives and energy objective reduced from 157 55 108 to 57 67 108 144 70 108 to 57 69 108 and 144 74 108 to 65 94 108 respectively when facing the value of lower bound under different objectives only the optimal value of lower bound under multiple objectives represents the same trend as the optimal value of upper bound for example the economic benefit reduced from 86 69 108 to 38 31 108 when representative hydrological years changed moreover from the figures no matter how the representative hydrological years changed the lower bound of economic benefit energy consumption and irrigation area under economic and energy consumption objective are the same this is because that only the minimum constraints need to be satisfied under single minimum economic benefit and energy consumption objective moreover from the figures whether economic benefit objective and energy consumption objective there is big gap between the maximum and minimum optimal value and making pi 25 as an example the optimization allocation of irrigation area under minimum economic benefit and energy consumption objective is 5 8 104 ha the optimization allocation of irrigation area under maximum economic benefit and energy consumption objective are 7 89 104 ha and 8 07 104 ha respectively however the lower and upper bound of optimal irrigation area under multi objectives are 6 82 104 ha and 7 03 104 ha respectively which did not show great gap as the optimal value of economic benefit and energy consumption objective the reason is that the multi objective programming model has the ability to balance multiple conflicting objectives and obtain the optimal value which is the advantage of the multi objective optimization programming model from figs 7 and 8 pi 25 was also selected as an example the economic benefit and energy consumption under maximum economic objective are 157 55 108 and 101 72 103 t while the economic benefit and energy consumption under minimum energy consumption objective are 35 52 108 and 49 01 103 t when pi 25 based on the above result when achieving the objective of maximizing economic benefit there are a lot of energy have been consumed while when achieving the objective of minimizing energy consumption economic benefits are severely reduced there are great conflicts between maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption however the economic benefit and energy consumption under multi objectives are 86 69 108 144 70 108 and 62 49 103 79 11 103 t based on the result a balance is reached between two great conflicting objectives based on the developed multi objectives programming model in addition figs 10 and 11 represent total consumption of water resources under different representative hydrological years and composition of water resources consumption when p 25 respectively from fig 10 optimized total water consumption would change as representative hydrological years changed although it has roughly the same trend as fig 4 there is a big difference the difference is that both upper and lower bound of water consumption under p 50 are higher than they are under p 25 respectively this is because that crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation are taken into account during the process of optimization allocation of irrigation water resources and the crop evapotranspiration at p 50 is relatively higher than it at p 25 therefore although the optimal total crop area at p 25 is higher than it at p 50 the optimal water consumption of the former is lower than that of the latter in addition the wet representative hydrological year was chosen as the representative one to interpret the composition of water resources consumption fig 11 represents the composition of total water resources consumption when p 25 from figure the total water consumption is consisted of optimization allocation of water resources and effective precipitation and regardless of the upper and lower bound of total water consumption effective precipitation accounts for a large proportion for example the upper bound of total water consumption is 43110 104 m3 optimization allocation of water resources is 22790 104 m3 but the effective precipitation is 20320 104 m3 which accounts for 47 14 of total water consumption from the above analysis a lot of irrigation water resources by the effective precipitation therefore effective precipitation plays an important role in the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources especially when water resources shortage is particularly severe therefore when crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation were took under consideration in the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources irrigation water could be greatly saved by the developed model based on the above analysis the established model has important significance for the sustainable development of the jinghuiqu irrigation district moreover in real world problems multiple conflicting objectives are always involved in the process of optimizing irrigation water resources due to the complex of irrigation system especially when energy consumption is taken into account due to the introduction of effective precipitation a lot of irrigation water resources can be saved the developed model can not only deal with the problem of multi objectives but also solve the conflicting problems among multiple objectives effectively in addition a series of optimal scheme can be obtained under different representative hydrological years by the established model 5 conclusion in this study an improved interval multi objectives programming model was established to optimization allocation of irrigation water resources under uncertainties which could not only optimize the planting structure but also has the advantage of dealing with multiple conflicting objectives in addition the developed model could also deal with uncertainties expressed as interval sets and offer different optimal schemes under different representative hydrological years the proposed model was then applied in a real world study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china in this application maximum economic benefits and minimum energy consumption were regarded as objectives which is great conflict between them compared with the previous studies it has the following advantages a deal with the multiple objectives b eliminate the negative influence on optimization plans caused by weight distribution among multiple objectives c take energy consumption into account d deal with the multiple uncertainties expressed as interval e take groundwater exploitation food security under consideration moreover different optimal schemes were obtained under different representative hydrological years by the proposed model although the established model has the ability deal with multi objectives problems and uncertainties expressed as interval sets it still has potential for improvement for example during the process of energy consumption calculation it focuses on the chemical fertilizers agricultural machinery power electricity consumption and pesticides based on the assumption in addition there are different types of uncertainties in the complex irrigation system such as fuzzy uncertainty and random uncertainty and in the process of solving the multi objective problems they may not only have a competitive relationship but also be located at different levels which belongs to two programming problems therefore attention should be putted on detailed energy consumption calculation multiple types of uncertainties and two programming problems credit authorship

4183,as climate change is intensifying the frequency and severity of floods around the globe adaptation is increasingly vital besides structural measures to mitigate flood risk non structural measures are known to be highly effective and low cost such non structural measures include flood early warning systems fews effective warning creation and dissemination are crucial to successful fews despite extensive bodies of research that cross the boundaries between disciplines and application domains systematic understanding of the detailed aspects contributing to the effectiveness of flood warnings is lacking we systematically review the state of the art in risk perception and warning communication present in academic and grey literature for fews we focus on the elements of risk warnings specifically rather than reviewing the topic of risk communication in general we start with exploring how personal attributes affect individual risk perception related to flood warnings we then deconstruct flood warnings into three basic components content format and dissemination channel most importantly we found 21 individual elements options for these components each associated with varying levels of support for their effectiveness in literature important caveats were identified such as a lack of research into the speech format and sms channel we then describe and visualise the warning creation process providing a framework for guidance accelerating technological advancement necessitates continued research into the effectiveness of novel formats and channels rendering the currently most widely supported and researched elements increasingly obsolete further research is needed to explore the complex interplay between elements i e how do different combinations impact effectiveness finally little is known about the transferability of our findings to africa asia and south america as industrialised countries dominate the research we hope our findings will contribute to improved understanding and support the practice of creating effective flood warnings keywords flood early warning system fews warning natural hazard risk communication disaster emergency management 1 introduction 1 1 background floods are the most frequent and widespread natural disasters worldwide wmo 2013 with climate change the frequency and severity of floods are projected to increase allen et al 2019 over the past decades flood management has shifted from structural measures i e physical flood protection structures to non structural measures such as the distribution of flood warnings unisdr 2018 indeed early warning systems ews can save lives and prevent damage while having relatively low operational costs baudoin et al 2014 zhu et al 2010 ews are designed to predict incoming hazards and warn affected populations ahead of time flood early warning systems fews have been installed in countries across the world acosta coll et al 2018 cred 2015 timely and accurate flood warnings can reduce the physical and psychological impacts of flooding munro et al 2017 the need for early warning systems has been underlined by the united nations through the paris agreement and the sustainable development goals un 2015 unfccc united nations framework convention on climate change 2015 and has been further articulated in the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction unisdr united nations international strategy for disaster reduction 2015 technological advances have made fews more accurate over the past two decades however the effectiveness of fews is just as dependent on the quality of the warning dissemination effective flood warnings inform the public about an impending flood and motivate them to take protective action morss et al 2016 wmo 2015 literature distinguishes between two types of warnings flood alerts and emergency warnings parker et al 2009 silver 2015 sutton and kuligowski 2019 alerts are characterised by a higher lead time i e the time between warning issuing and predicted impact and or lower predicted impact compared to emergency warnings the latter are used for more severe flood forecasts and shorter lead times golding 2009 flood warnings often fail to be received understood or evoke adequate responses o sullivan et al 2012 rollason et al 2018 sukhwani et al 2019 zhu et al 2010 to reach all targeted audiences both traditional media e g radio and tv as well as digital communication channels e g web sites and applications social media should be employed for flood warning dissemination feldman et al 2016 lam et al 2017 liu et al 2017 the inadequacy of responses to flood warnings has two common causes low individual risk perception and a lack of self efficacy hagemeier klose and wagner 2009 morss et al 2016 shreve et al 2016 put simply people underestimate the risk posed by floods and or perceive themselves as unequipped to mitigate this risk thus effective flood warnings should raise individual flood risk perception hereby increasing the likelihood of recipients to follow recommended protective actions keller et al 2006 potter et al 2018 to evoke adequate action among recipients flood warnings should contain all the information required to take sufficient action khalid and shafiai 2015 lindell et al 2017 rollason et al 2018 besides the characteristics of a warning itself an individual s response to a flood warning is shaped by personal attributes e g age knowledge of hazard trust in authorities and situational factors e g personal experience with floods location of housing that influence personal risk perception kellens et al 2013 lechowska 2018 wachinger et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge only a few studies specifically evaluate flood warnings and their efficacy höppner et al 2012 analysed 60 risk communication practices related to natural hazards and their outcomes across europe hagemeier klose 2007 reviewed tools used for issuing flood warnings across europe at various spatial levels a review of the impact of flood risk communication across multiple countries found low levels of information penetration and preparedness correlated with high levels of distrust towards responsible authorities o sullivan et al 2012 however abovementioned reviews focus on broader risk communication approaches e g long term trust building educational campaigns rather than exclusively on warning communication 1 2 the components of flood warnings two types of flood warnings can be identified depending on their level of urgency on the one hand alerts are characterised by a higher lead time i e longer time between warning issuing and predicted impact higher forecast uncertainty and or lower predicted impact on the other hand emergency warnings are used for more severe flood forecasts and shorter lead times golding 2009 the remainder of this paper will simply refer to warnings including both types flood warnings are comprised of content what where when why issued in a format text graphics maps face to face which is distributed via a communication channel radio tv web page sms etc we will call these three categories the components of flood warnings we will refer to the individual options available for each component as the elements which combine to form a complete warning although different variations are reported in literature the categorisation we adopt aligns well with the academic consensus on the core components of hazard warnings bean et al 2015 höppner et al 2012 mayhorn and mclaughlin 2014 mileti and peek 2000 the earliest categorisation of components was developed by covello et al 1986 who identified four components in risk communication messages the source message design channel and target audience more recently salman and li 2018 suggested three components message messenger and media this review explores the broad spectrum of individual flood warning elements that have been tested and discussed in literature we found novel elements that show significant potential for flood warning applications warranting significantly more research attention we refer to the process of combining different elements into a coherent warning dissemination as the warning development process 1 3 aim and objectives to our knowledge there have been few scholarly attempts to create an overview of the elements of effective flood warning communication furthermore recent studies point to a mismatch in practice between the warnings issued and the types of information that warning recipients seek and are able to comprehend johnson et al 2018 mays et al 2019 sukhwani et al 2019 this paper aims to uncover how to increase the effectiveness of flood early warnings therefore we critically and systematically review the academic literature on flood warning communication complemented with some grey literature to establish and organise the elements of flood warnings and their reported performance in practice we thus provide a framework to guide the effective production and dissemination of flood warnings three objectives support our aim i explore how personal attributes affect individual risk perception related to flood warnings ii establish the state of the art on the elements of flood warning communication and iii provide a framework to guide flood warning creation we start our review with organising the most prominent factors influencing individual flood risk perceptions we proceed by exploring warning elements found in literature and build a conceptual framework that synthesises the available research on of the building blocks of flood warnings our framework furthermore provides an overview of the empirical evidence on the efficacy of each warning element as reported in literature we identify knowledge gaps and promising future avenues of research we finish by giving a schematic representation of the warning development process we foresee two important contributions from this review i academic identification and conceptualisation of the important building blocks for the creation of flood warnings based on evidence literature and ii practical aiding flood warning creation by providing practitioners e g emergency management authorities with a practical framework for warning creation in a broad set of contexts 2 research approach 2 1 literature selection we employed the systematic review method preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis prisma developed by moher et al 2009 this method comprises four main steps i formulating keywords and questions ii selecting databases and search methods iii classifying and selecting criteria to group documents and iv extracting and synthesising the findings using the electronic databases scopus and web of science we conducted our literature search between november 2019 and march 2020 fig 1 we extended our search to include warning communication for natural hazards beyond only floods if deemed generalizable for example sutton et al 2014 test the effectiveness of warnings tweets sent during a canyon wildfire to ensure the inclusion of relevant articles that our search failed to identify we then applied a snowball sampling method jalali 2013 using highly relevant papers e g höppner et al 2012 kellens et al 2013 lechowska 2018 wachinger et al 2013 while the initial literature search focused solely on academic publications this selection also included highly relevant grey literature after removing duplicates we manually screened the articles by reading the abstract and excluded those we judged not to be related to our search terms while no hard exclusion criteria were used soft criteria of exclusions included when abstract keywords referred to unrelated topics such as risk management for natural hazards disaster management risk mitigation via protective actions willingness to pay research and technical reports guides demonstrating new current natural hazard warning systems to increase the relevance and quality of our findings we limited the search to papers published in peer reviewed journals between the years 2000 and 2020 however during the peer review process three extra papers were added two of which were from 2021 we did so assuming that the resulting papers build on the work preceding the year 2000 but are more relevant to current day communication technology which has changed significantly over the past decades alexander 2014 stephenson et al 2018 we added two highly relevant papers from before 2000 as they were identified as very important by the reviewed literature covello et al 1986 lipkus and hollands 1999 the final number of articles included in the review is 128 fig 1 we performed a meta analysis of the resulting collection of articles in a spreadsheet collecting statistics on year of publication geographic focus of the research and type of research or methodology for the latter aspect eight types of research were distinguished two types of reviews literature review and content review the latter indicates a review of documents other than academic literature such as warning messages six types of research papers were distinguished based on their main data gathering method case studies content analyses i e of actual warnings experiments interviews surveys and workshops we added a ninth category for studies that included more than one of the above eight methodologies mixed methods the effectiveness of flood warnings depends on their ability to alter recipients risk perception therefore personal attributes affecting an individual s risk perception need to be considered when developing and issuing warnings thus we distilled a list of the most important personal attributes influencing flood risk perception from literature unlike previous studies we specifically focused on risk perception factors related to flood warning communication our selection process followed three steps firstly we analysed the selected articles by collecting all attributes mentioned secondly we filtered the acquired list by retaining only those instances where a significant effect of the attribute on risk perception was reported by the authors thirdly we selected those attributes that were identified in at least three separate studies 2 2 analysis of the attributes affecting risk perception a number of factors unrelated to warning and alert messages themselves affect the way risk communication is perceived by recipients such factors or attributes are important to consider when designing risk communication during our literature search we gathered attributes from relevant literature reviews that analysed natural hazard and risk perception factors we grouped these attributes in five different categories individual flood experience socio economic characteristics demographics distance to flood hazards exposure and reputation and related trust into messenger we extracted the most important findings per category and summarised them 2 3 analysis of warning elements we developed the categorisation into the three components content format and communication channel to best suit our research scope focusing specifically on the building blocks of the warning message itself we analysed all articles resulting from the prisma review to identify the individual alternatives for each component which represent the elements we recorded each occurrence of each element and identified whether it concerned a study that concluded in favour or against adopting the element for the creation of flood warnings furthermore we collected reports of elements that were neutral provided insights suggested conditions for element adoption or suggested combinations of elements to be used we established the prominence of elements by counting the number of mentions among articles we established the net positive effect of elements by calculating the difference between number of articles with a positive and negative conclusion 3 results 3 1 literature meta analysis full results from the literature review depicted in fig 1 are provided in table a 1 of the appendix these data are summarised in fig 2 between 2000 and 2015 the number of articles rose and then stabilised fig 2 over 80 of articles focussed on industrialised countries in europe north america and oceania fig 2 in addition the majority of remaining articles were reviews with global focus but results taken mostly from industrialised countries only seven articles focused on asia 5 6 and none focused on south america or africa of the research articles by far the most popular data gathering method used were surveys followed by experiments fig 2 subjects of surveys were usually the public in a specific geographic context while experiments were often conducted with students 3 2 attributes affecting flood risk perception a significant body of literature explored risk perception related to natural hazards covered by three recent reviews wachinger et al 2013 argued that the process of shaping risk perception is influenced by four groups of factors related to 1 the type and severity of the natural hazard 2 the source and amount of information received 3 personal and cultural attributes such as age gender and religion and 4 context such as closeness to hazard and community size o neill et al 2016 found that often incorrectly perceived flood exposure rather than actual exposure determines flood risk perception this tendency depended on cognitive behavioural socioeconomic and geographical factors most recently lechowska 2018 pointed to the uncertainty of the mechanisms behind risk perception formation exposing the varying levels of clarity and knowledge in the research community regarding the effect of different factors for the purpose of creating effective flood risk communication we present the most significant personal attributes affecting risk perception table 1 these attributes are part of the background to the warning development cycle fig 4 3 3 the elements of flood warning communication fig 3 presents an overview of the elements of flood warning communication the results for the components content format and channel are presented in tables 2 4 respectively the process of selecting and combining these elements is the backbone of the warning development cycle fig 4 the most important elements of content for warning messages include the source of the warning the nature location and time of the hazard and recommended action table 2 while there was little disagreement between studies on these and most other elements of content there was some disagreement regarding uncertainties although transparency concerning the inherent uncertainty associated with a flood risk e g likelihood of occurring severity and timing were often associated with increased understanding some studies highlighted the complexity associated with interpreting such information mileti et al 2004 shanahan et al 2019 spiegelhalter and riesch 2011 inhibiting improvement of response measures taken by recipients besides decisions on the type of elements the order in which information are presented also affects the interpretation of a warning bean et al 2015 and sutton and kuligowski 2019 suggest the following order of content source hazard location time and guidance this reflects the prominence of elements as reported in the body of literature see ordering of table 2 notably including a source is mentioned most often and literature suggests that a recipients preparedness to act largely depends on the perceived credibility of this e g bean et al 2016 turner et al 2014 in contrast to the academic consensus around the content of flood warnings there was considerable disagreement between the findings of different studies on the formatting of messages table 3 writing and graphics were most commonly identified as effective warning formats additionally combining these elements increased their individual effectiveness hogan carr et al 2016 lipkus 2007 savelli and joslyn 2013 using affective writing tended to increase warning effectiveness perreault et al 2014 shanahan et al 2019 indeed images appeared more effective than any other type of graphics as they evoke emotional engagement dobson et al 2018 keller et al 2006 wagner 2007 flood maps were subject to the greatest contradictions between studies table 3 advances in location and cartographic design make flood maps an increasingly effective flood warning format dransch et al 2010 henstra et al 2019 however study subjects often appeared unable to understand a map or locate themselves on one during an emergency liu et al 2017 therefore designing maps containing appropriate information density and complexity is a delicate balancing act for practitioners issuing warnings to assist map design several authors evaluated users information perception from flood maps fuchs et al 2009 luke et al 2018 van kerkvoorde et al 2018 they suggested an extensive list of best practices for cartographic design on e g legend position and composition graphical differentiation between areas that are at risk and other areas and map scale fuchs et al 2009 henstra et al 2019 meyer et al 2012 studies disagreed on the benefit of using probabilistic information such as likelihood of the predicted event in addition the most appropriate format of probabilistic information was contested e g percentages fractions odd ratios and return periods keller et al 2006 leclerc and joslyn 2012 visschers et al 2009 communicating probabilities created misunderstanding among certain audiences that interpreted information heuristically instead of systematically moreover correct interpretation depended on education level and the format of presentation as graphical representations were understood better than numerical ones kashefi 2009 visschers et al 2009 differences in the outcomes of studies examining the effect of probabilities could be explained by the audience s level of education their understanding of probabilities and experience with probabilistic forecasts strathie et al 2017 visschers et al 2009 the most effective channels were those that relied predominantly on the speech format table 4 this might be because spoken messages are more easily understood personal and indicate a sense of urgency lamb et al 2012 turner et al 2014 widely studied in the uk warnings delivered face to face were proven highly effective evoking a high sense of urgency as the most personal communication channel it is resource intensive turner et al 2014 while the uk has a longstanding and community supported flood warden scheme by the environmental agency nagarajan et al 2012 the effectiveness of face to face warnings in different contexts might vary besides formally organised face to face warning systems informal warning systems also play an important role particularly in the global south e g parker and handmer 1998 although the importance of such systems cannot be overestimated we chose not to include such warning systems in our framework which focuses on formal warning systems that can be adopted by authorities next highest net support was found for two other channels that are highly dependent on speech telephone and radio telephone can refer to pre recorded mass distributed messages or interactive flood lines both accessible by landlines as well as mobile phones advantages of both telephone and radio include relatively high accessibility and affordability rendering these channels low cost and high reach e g perreault et al 2014 another advantage of telephone was its potential to provide additional tailored information to recipients if required liu et al 2015 turner et al 2014 a limitation of radio was that messages cannot be repeated on demand to be effective warnings should therefore be repeated with high frequency liu et al 2015 the low level of net support for sms was in contrast with the widespread application by agencies worldwide perera et al 2019 such as the us federal emergency management bean et al 2015 potter et al 2018 swiss national weather agency weyrich et al 2018 and the meteorological service of new zealand potter et al 2018 possible explanation for the low net support is a general underrepresentation in literature from the past two decades as it was deemed a proven and effective written warning channel sutton and kuligowski 2019 contrarily social media were widely researched as a warning channel over the past two decades conclusions about their effectiveness varied and were found context dependent table 4 recent research indicated a significant demand for flood warnings disseminated via social media cho et al 2013 morss et al 2018 stephenson et al 2018 although presumably skewed towards the younger population taylor et al 2018 social media are particularly prone to the spread of misinformation due to their democratic access which is in principle a good feature but may compromise their reliability for risk communication e g lovari and bowen 2020 this tendency increases the responsibility of emergency management to refute misleading content and provide accurate information on this channel the effectiveness of web sites and applications was highly contested they were often considered ineffective because of their inaccessibility e g lam et al 2017 rohrmann 2004 for example questionnaire interviews with over a thousand residents of hong kong showed that recipients were reluctant to visit a website to acquire warning information lam et al 2017 however a comprehensive review on early warning system practices reports this channel to be the most commonly used around the world perera et al 2019 these findings align with the increasing importance of mobile applications for hazard communication tan et al 2017 indeed websites and mobile apps appear to be useful in providing additional detailed information to other warning channels such as sms or social media dallo and marti 2021 finally the effectiveness of sirens was also contested although easy to install and maintain sirens cannot transmit complex information therefore their effectiveness depends on the availability of prior knowledge on appropriate responses in the population fakhruddin et al 2015 most scholars agreed that sirens are only effective when paired with a channel that can transmit information that is more detailed such as on the ground flood wardens and radio fakhruddin et al 2015 hayden et al 2007 höppner et al 2012 woody and ellison 2014 given the popularity and scientific evidence supporting the use of channels that depend on speech e g radio tv face to face see table 4 the lack of research on the speech format is remarkable table 3 a possible explanation could lie in the complexity of empirically testing spoken communication formats feldman et al 2016 3 4 quality criteria for flood warning development selecting the right combination of content format and dissemination channel for flood warnings is critical in order to evoke desired behavioural responses from targeted audiences besides deciding on the type of elements certain guidelines considering their quality should be observed quality criteria are part of the background to the warning development cycle fig 4 most importantly warnings should be specific specific and brief warnings are most effective bean et al 2015 warning development is a balancing act to make messages short enough for quick comprehension but covering all essential information bean et al 2015 hagemeier klose and wagner 2009 sutton et al 2014 use appropriate language a study from the usa concluded that a common flood risk management language was lacking between emergency managers and scientists wood et al 2012 personal attributes such as age and education level affect how warnings are understood and interpreted non technical language and local jargon can increase the reach of warnings among different communities perić and cvetković 2019 particularly when quick decision making is required from recipients the complexity of warnings language should be reduced doksaeter sivle and kolstø 2016 language should be tailored to the targeted audience as for example a 100 year flood is understood very differently between scientists and the public bell and tobin 2007 hagemeier klose and wagner 2009 furthermore language can be perceived as positive or negative and even induce fear although alarmist language can trigger certain desired behaviour the opposite effect is observed in the absence of clear directions and recommended actions nerlich et al 2010 provoking fear while effective in certain circumstances may induce fatalism paralysis or sensationalism o neill and nicholson cole 2009 perreault et al 2014 be transparent warnings should clearly outline what is known what remains unknown and what is uncertain the level of transparency translates to the level of trust and perceived credibility of a message and its source höppner et al 2012 sutton et al 2014 uncertainty should be explained in conjunction with recommendations for action lundgren and mcmakin 2009 transparency is closely related to trust in the message and its source which plays a vital role in warning effectiveness terpstra 2011 wachinger et al 2013 be consistent warnings should be consistent but clear about changes to the hazard all different sources of communication should align their communication strategy and content mileti and peek 2000 weyrich et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 creating effective warnings the warning development cycle is generally triggered when a forecast from meteorological hydrological services exceeds a certain critical threshold such forecasts are often produced on a daily basis and represented by the forecast cycle in fig 4 warning development then commences selecting from 21 elements identified between the three components of flood warning messages eight elements of content five of format and eight of channel fig 3 this process can be either partly or fully automated in the fews or manual when automated a warning system has been set up in advance to select a combination of elements that best fit an exceeded trigger level from a forecast theoretically any number of elements from each component could be combined to create a warning resulting in 2 8 1 2 5 1 2 8 1 2 0 m i l l i o n different options note that this number inflates exponentially with additional elements although many of these combinations are practically impossible or undesirable e g sending an image over the radio emergency managers are faced with a broad pallet of alternatives tables 2 4 provide insights to narrow down the options by presenting the evidence available in literature for and against using different elements however it should be noted that the effectiveness of warnings is highly context dependent höppner et al 2012 keoduangsine and goodwin 2012 taylor et al 2018 the net support for different elements presented in section 3 3 should therefore not be considered a universally valid ranking firstly shortly incumbent and severe flooding requires immediate action from the population making specific elements better suited for example warnings disseminated through sirens are immediately received by large parts of the population while written newspaper articles result in a delayed and potentially smaller reach fakhruddin et al 2015 secondly farmers from a rural community without fast internet connections are more effectively reached by sms radio or flood wardens while the population of a modern city can be reached by a diverse set of channels including those requiring the internet thus context defines desirable choice of elements through the characteristics of 1 the impending hazard including the lead time and severity and 2 the location e g keoduangsine and goodwin 2012 lam et al 2017 mu et al 2018 additionally the availability and preferences for communication technology both for the sender and receiver of the warning define the choice of elements keoduangsine and goodwin 2012 lam et al 2017 mills and curtis 2008 stephens et al 2013 unisdr 2015 together these considerations of contexts are part of the background to the warning development cycle fig 4 the attributes of risk perception discussed in section 3 2 further shape the choice of elements for example past exposure to floods affects current risk perception of a population wood et al 2012 lack of experience with floods is associated with an underestimation of risk low risk perception and limited understanding on appropriate responses exacerbating flood impact bera and daněk 2018 o neill et al 2016 similarly providing references to previous floods in warning messages as well as physical references such as flood markers on buildings keeps risk perception higher for longer bradford et al 2012 wagner 2007 trust as another example of an attribute of risk perception enhances warning effectiveness adding a reference to a trusted organisation in a warning message may therefore improve the warning while the opposite would be achieved when the referenced source lacks public trust heitz et al 2009 lópez vázquez and marván 2003 terpstra 2011 wachinger et al 2013 once the content channel and format are determined a drafted warning should adhere to best practice as outlined in the quality criteria of section 3 4 as emphasised throughout this review these guidelines the attributes of risk perception and the context interplay with one another constituting the background and framework within which the warning is crafted fig 4 as the channel is most constrained because of its dependency on available technology and infrastructure it can serve as the entry point to the warning development cycle however this process should not be linear and multiple cycles of changes and adjustments to the elements of warnings can be made for refinement höppner et al 2012 even argue to open up such cycles via two way communication strategies in order to elicit the informational needs of specific groups and tailor the risk communication approach after every cycle the drafted warning is evaluated to fulfil all contextual and quality criteria before it is dispatched to the target audience fig 4 finally lessons can be drawn from evaluating the effects of the disseminated warning in practice warning dissemination cycle to improve warning development in subsequent emergency situations mayhorn and mclaughlin 2014 in contexts that use semi automated warning systems such as the ipaws system in the usa bean et al 2015 several parts of the stylised warning development process from fig 4 are performed as part of the development and consecutive refinements of such system for example depending on the severity of the forecasted flood a system might either simply depict the risk on a map online low severity or send a sms and push notification to all residents in a risk area high severity here we provide a simple example to illustrate the non automated warning development process as depicted in fig 4 the emergency management agency of a small african country receives information from the hydrological services about a forecast for extreme discharge within three days in a river with bordering agricultural land and villages in a rural area the emergency managers know that to prepare the local residents and farmers immediate warnings should be issued as internet connections are limited in the area but phone connections are good and widely used they decide to select this channel for their warning they want to inform the residents of the timing and exact location of the flood as well as the possible consequences for the farmers content they decide to use both the format of sms messages as well as to open a flood line providing a contact point for more information combining these contents and for all formats they create the warning after evaluation they conclude that the sms is too long when including all the information they therefore decide to limit the information to the timing and type of hazard and add the contact details of the flood line to provide more information to those in need for it they furthermore add the urgent request to inform any family members of the impeding flood as not all elderly members of the community own a phone but family ties are strong after recreating the warning they send the sms out to the relevant communities 4 2 outlook research in hazard detection and risk warning communication is scattered across disciplines e g hazard forecasting risk analysis behavioural psychology applications diverse set of natural and anthropogenic hazards and domains academic research emergency management practice to advance the field transdisciplinary efforts are required to integrate and synthesise all relevant knowledge across academia and practice lang et al 2012 this review is an attempt to do just that draw from different disciplines e g publications in hydrology risk management and psychology and applications focus on flood warnings but include other types warning implementation to provide insights that help create more effective flood warnings further testing of academic findings such as those from this review in practical settings should be undertaken to assess their validity outside the controlled academic setting they stem from such validation of the findings from this review was attempted by the authors undertaking this review was inspired by and part of a larger project fanfar 2021 focussing on co development of a flood forecast and early warning system for west african countries andersson et al 2020 lienert et al 2020a 2021 2020b systematic discussion of the implications of our findings with emergency managers of 17 countries in west africa was planned and commenced as part of this project in a workshop in abuja nigeria in february 2020 we started with discussing different individual warning elements in isolation we planned follow up research including the assessment of different combinations of elements in complete warnings and linking such warnings to different scenarios in terms of hazard type and context preliminary results kuller et al 2020 unfortunately this research effort was halted due to logistical problems and health risks posed by the global covid 19 pandemic prohibiting further personal interactions with our research colleagues and co development participants holding these types of systematic discussions and even implementing findings in real world settings in africa is even more important considering that this review largely reflects the state of the art of knowledge and application in industrialised countries with the bulk of available research coming from europe north america and oceania as emphasised before risk communication is highly embedded in local contexts this highlights the need to investigate the transferability of our findings to different contexts such as africa asia and south america even within industrialised countries research findings are occasionally skewed to specific geographies as is the case for e g research on flood wardens in the uk therefore we urge the research community to further explore transferability of our findings both to different contexts within industrialised countries and beyond this review concentrates on warnings for hydrological hazards as the most frequent and impactful natural hazard worldwide however most findings are directly applicable to other types of natural and even anthropogenic hazards psychological and behavioural mechanisms involved in the hazard response cycle are universal and largely independent from the nature of the hazard hence this review draws from research beyond the confines of the flood domain indeed most of our findings regarding the elements of successful warnings can be extended outside the flood domain acknowledging differences that might exist with other hazards regarding e g lead times geographic characteristics and desired response measures recognising the generic nature of warning communication research attention is increasingly directed at integrating and streamlining hazard and warning communication through multi hazard platforms dallo et al 2020 such platforms aim to present diverse hazards in a single location adopting uniform content and formatting recent developments in information and communication technology provide interactive and intuitive user interfaces enhancing a users broad risk awareness and providing a one stop shop for warning dissemination e g alertswiss app online available at https www alert swiss they furthermore promote collaborative two way communication and sharing functions deemed desirable to increase success ehnis and bunker 2012 höppner et al 2012 the rise of multi hazard platforms also sparks attention for the interplay between different warning elements and the effectiveness of different sets of combinations traditionally most research attention has been directed at the effects of different elements in isolation as reflected in tables 2 4 extrapolating the effect of individual elements in warnings containing combinations of those elements is problematic considering the varying research approaches contexts and subjects from individual studies although we have some insights into the combination of certain elements such as different formats or a format with a channel little is known about the comparative effect of different constellations of elements that form a complete warning such knowledge is crucial as in practice warnings must always constitute a coherent ensemble of at least one piece of content format and channel reciprocal interactions between elements could change findings regarding the effect of individual elements further complexity is added when considering the diverse possible implementation scenarios with varying context in terms of location hazard type severity and targeted populations systematic investigation of this complex interplay depicted in fig 4 is required to move the field of risk communication forward while the increasingly accelerating advancements in technology uncover seemingly endless opportunities for risk monitoring representation and distribution both practice and academia struggle to keep up with this ash et al 2014 feldman et al 2016 henstra et al 2019 new channels of communication become available to growing fractions of the population while futuristic formats are mainstreamed at a high pace e g real time location tracking an increased effort in development and testing of the novel tools at the disposal of emergency management is urgently needed for example the application of web pages apps and social media result in highly contradictory outcomes table 4 while the highest levels of agreement are concerned with formats and channels that are increasingly archaic and obsolete tables 3 and 4 5 concluding remarks providing early warnings are an effective way to mitigate the negative impacts of flooding when developing flood early warning systems a strong focus is generally put on the accuracy and reliability of the hydrological forecast while accuracy is of great concern for obvious reasons the importance of the quality of warning communication should not be overlooked no matter the quality of the forecast if this information fails to reach the relevant actors in a comprehendible and timely fashion it is rendered useless the effectiveness of a warning is determined by its capacity to evoke certain intended and desired behaviour among its recipients this capacity in turn is the outcome of a complex interplay between its elements of content format and channel the generation of flood warnings should occur in the light of personal attributes of the target audience such as demographics and experiences with past events at the same time warnings should be sensitive to the specific local contexts and forecast scenarios the importance of a tailored approach cannot be overstated as no one size fits all exists indeed while this review outlines the state of the art in research on the effectiveness of all warning elements the academic evidence presented to support or reject the effectiveness of individual elements should be appreciated in their specific context and integration with other elements nevertheless our insights are crucial to shape and improve warning communication in the future the framework provided in this paper comprises a clear overview of the known elements of food warnings and a conceptual representation of their implementation in the development cycle of flood warnings other aspects informing this development include the risk context local context the attributes of risk perception and general warning quality criteria to further research in flood warning development future studies should explore the complex interplay of individual elements in real world case studies focussing beyond the context of industrialised countries declaration of competing

4183,as climate change is intensifying the frequency and severity of floods around the globe adaptation is increasingly vital besides structural measures to mitigate flood risk non structural measures are known to be highly effective and low cost such non structural measures include flood early warning systems fews effective warning creation and dissemination are crucial to successful fews despite extensive bodies of research that cross the boundaries between disciplines and application domains systematic understanding of the detailed aspects contributing to the effectiveness of flood warnings is lacking we systematically review the state of the art in risk perception and warning communication present in academic and grey literature for fews we focus on the elements of risk warnings specifically rather than reviewing the topic of risk communication in general we start with exploring how personal attributes affect individual risk perception related to flood warnings we then deconstruct flood warnings into three basic components content format and dissemination channel most importantly we found 21 individual elements options for these components each associated with varying levels of support for their effectiveness in literature important caveats were identified such as a lack of research into the speech format and sms channel we then describe and visualise the warning creation process providing a framework for guidance accelerating technological advancement necessitates continued research into the effectiveness of novel formats and channels rendering the currently most widely supported and researched elements increasingly obsolete further research is needed to explore the complex interplay between elements i e how do different combinations impact effectiveness finally little is known about the transferability of our findings to africa asia and south america as industrialised countries dominate the research we hope our findings will contribute to improved understanding and support the practice of creating effective flood warnings keywords flood early warning system fews warning natural hazard risk communication disaster emergency management 1 introduction 1 1 background floods are the most frequent and widespread natural disasters worldwide wmo 2013 with climate change the frequency and severity of floods are projected to increase allen et al 2019 over the past decades flood management has shifted from structural measures i e physical flood protection structures to non structural measures such as the distribution of flood warnings unisdr 2018 indeed early warning systems ews can save lives and prevent damage while having relatively low operational costs baudoin et al 2014 zhu et al 2010 ews are designed to predict incoming hazards and warn affected populations ahead of time flood early warning systems fews have been installed in countries across the world acosta coll et al 2018 cred 2015 timely and accurate flood warnings can reduce the physical and psychological impacts of flooding munro et al 2017 the need for early warning systems has been underlined by the united nations through the paris agreement and the sustainable development goals un 2015 unfccc united nations framework convention on climate change 2015 and has been further articulated in the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction unisdr united nations international strategy for disaster reduction 2015 technological advances have made fews more accurate over the past two decades however the effectiveness of fews is just as dependent on the quality of the warning dissemination effective flood warnings inform the public about an impending flood and motivate them to take protective action morss et al 2016 wmo 2015 literature distinguishes between two types of warnings flood alerts and emergency warnings parker et al 2009 silver 2015 sutton and kuligowski 2019 alerts are characterised by a higher lead time i e the time between warning issuing and predicted impact and or lower predicted impact compared to emergency warnings the latter are used for more severe flood forecasts and shorter lead times golding 2009 flood warnings often fail to be received understood or evoke adequate responses o sullivan et al 2012 rollason et al 2018 sukhwani et al 2019 zhu et al 2010 to reach all targeted audiences both traditional media e g radio and tv as well as digital communication channels e g web sites and applications social media should be employed for flood warning dissemination feldman et al 2016 lam et al 2017 liu et al 2017 the inadequacy of responses to flood warnings has two common causes low individual risk perception and a lack of self efficacy hagemeier klose and wagner 2009 morss et al 2016 shreve et al 2016 put simply people underestimate the risk posed by floods and or perceive themselves as unequipped to mitigate this risk thus effective flood warnings should raise individual flood risk perception hereby increasing the likelihood of recipients to follow recommended protective actions keller et al 2006 potter et al 2018 to evoke adequate action among recipients flood warnings should contain all the information required to take sufficient action khalid and shafiai 2015 lindell et al 2017 rollason et al 2018 besides the characteristics of a warning itself an individual s response to a flood warning is shaped by personal attributes e g age knowledge of hazard trust in authorities and situational factors e g personal experience with floods location of housing that influence personal risk perception kellens et al 2013 lechowska 2018 wachinger et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge only a few studies specifically evaluate flood warnings and their efficacy höppner et al 2012 analysed 60 risk communication practices related to natural hazards and their outcomes across europe hagemeier klose 2007 reviewed tools used for issuing flood warnings across europe at various spatial levels a review of the impact of flood risk communication across multiple countries found low levels of information penetration and preparedness correlated with high levels of distrust towards responsible authorities o sullivan et al 2012 however abovementioned reviews focus on broader risk communication approaches e g long term trust building educational campaigns rather than exclusively on warning communication 1 2 the components of flood warnings two types of flood warnings can be identified depending on their level of urgency on the one hand alerts are characterised by a higher lead time i e longer time between warning issuing and predicted impact higher forecast uncertainty and or lower predicted impact on the other hand emergency warnings are used for more severe flood forecasts and shorter lead times golding 2009 the remainder of this paper will simply refer to warnings including both types flood warnings are comprised of content what where when why issued in a format text graphics maps face to face which is distributed via a communication channel radio tv web page sms etc we will call these three categories the components of flood warnings we will refer to the individual options available for each component as the elements which combine to form a complete warning although different variations are reported in literature the categorisation we adopt aligns well with the academic consensus on the core components of hazard warnings bean et al 2015 höppner et al 2012 mayhorn and mclaughlin 2014 mileti and peek 2000 the earliest categorisation of components was developed by covello et al 1986 who identified four components in risk communication messages the source message design channel and target audience more recently salman and li 2018 suggested three components message messenger and media this review explores the broad spectrum of individual flood warning elements that have been tested and discussed in literature we found novel elements that show significant potential for flood warning applications warranting significantly more research attention we refer to the process of combining different elements into a coherent warning dissemination as the warning development process 1 3 aim and objectives to our knowledge there have been few scholarly attempts to create an overview of the elements of effective flood warning communication furthermore recent studies point to a mismatch in practice between the warnings issued and the types of information that warning recipients seek and are able to comprehend johnson et al 2018 mays et al 2019 sukhwani et al 2019 this paper aims to uncover how to increase the effectiveness of flood early warnings therefore we critically and systematically review the academic literature on flood warning communication complemented with some grey literature to establish and organise the elements of flood warnings and their reported performance in practice we thus provide a framework to guide the effective production and dissemination of flood warnings three objectives support our aim i explore how personal attributes affect individual risk perception related to flood warnings ii establish the state of the art on the elements of flood warning communication and iii provide a framework to guide flood warning creation we start our review with organising the most prominent factors influencing individual flood risk perceptions we proceed by exploring warning elements found in literature and build a conceptual framework that synthesises the available research on of the building blocks of flood warnings our framework furthermore provides an overview of the empirical evidence on the efficacy of each warning element as reported in literature we identify knowledge gaps and promising future avenues of research we finish by giving a schematic representation of the warning development process we foresee two important contributions from this review i academic identification and conceptualisation of the important building blocks for the creation of flood warnings based on evidence literature and ii practical aiding flood warning creation by providing practitioners e g emergency management authorities with a practical framework for warning creation in a broad set of contexts 2 research approach 2 1 literature selection we employed the systematic review method preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis prisma developed by moher et al 2009 this method comprises four main steps i formulating keywords and questions ii selecting databases and search methods iii classifying and selecting criteria to group documents and iv extracting and synthesising the findings using the electronic databases scopus and web of science we conducted our literature search between november 2019 and march 2020 fig 1 we extended our search to include warning communication for natural hazards beyond only floods if deemed generalizable for example sutton et al 2014 test the effectiveness of warnings tweets sent during a canyon wildfire to ensure the inclusion of relevant articles that our search failed to identify we then applied a snowball sampling method jalali 2013 using highly relevant papers e g höppner et al 2012 kellens et al 2013 lechowska 2018 wachinger et al 2013 while the initial literature search focused solely on academic publications this selection also included highly relevant grey literature after removing duplicates we manually screened the articles by reading the abstract and excluded those we judged not to be related to our search terms while no hard exclusion criteria were used soft criteria of exclusions included when abstract keywords referred to unrelated topics such as risk management for natural hazards disaster management risk mitigation via protective actions willingness to pay research and technical reports guides demonstrating new current natural hazard warning systems to increase the relevance and quality of our findings we limited the search to papers published in peer reviewed journals between the years 2000 and 2020 however during the peer review process three extra papers were added two of which were from 2021 we did so assuming that the resulting papers build on the work preceding the year 2000 but are more relevant to current day communication technology which has changed significantly over the past decades alexander 2014 stephenson et al 2018 we added two highly relevant papers from before 2000 as they were identified as very important by the reviewed literature covello et al 1986 lipkus and hollands 1999 the final number of articles included in the review is 128 fig 1 we performed a meta analysis of the resulting collection of articles in a spreadsheet collecting statistics on year of publication geographic focus of the research and type of research or methodology for the latter aspect eight types of research were distinguished two types of reviews literature review and content review the latter indicates a review of documents other than academic literature such as warning messages six types of research papers were distinguished based on their main data gathering method case studies content analyses i e of actual warnings experiments interviews surveys and workshops we added a ninth category for studies that included more than one of the above eight methodologies mixed methods the effectiveness of flood warnings depends on their ability to alter recipients risk perception therefore personal attributes affecting an individual s risk perception need to be considered when developing and issuing warnings thus we distilled a list of the most important personal attributes influencing flood risk perception from literature unlike previous studies we specifically focused on risk perception factors related to flood warning communication our selection process followed three steps firstly we analysed the selected articles by collecting all attributes mentioned secondly we filtered the acquired list by retaining only those instances where a significant effect of the attribute on risk perception was reported by the authors thirdly we selected those attributes that were identified in at least three separate studies 2 2 analysis of the attributes affecting risk perception a number of factors unrelated to warning and alert messages themselves affect the way risk communication is perceived by recipients such factors or attributes are important to consider when designing risk communication during our literature search we gathered attributes from relevant literature reviews that analysed natural hazard and risk perception factors we grouped these attributes in five different categories individual flood experience socio economic characteristics demographics distance to flood hazards exposure and reputation and related trust into messenger we extracted the most important findings per category and summarised them 2 3 analysis of warning elements we developed the categorisation into the three components content format and communication channel to best suit our research scope focusing specifically on the building blocks of the warning message itself we analysed all articles resulting from the prisma review to identify the individual alternatives for each component which represent the elements we recorded each occurrence of each element and identified whether it concerned a study that concluded in favour or against adopting the element for the creation of flood warnings furthermore we collected reports of elements that were neutral provided insights suggested conditions for element adoption or suggested combinations of elements to be used we established the prominence of elements by counting the number of mentions among articles we established the net positive effect of elements by calculating the difference between number of articles with a positive and negative conclusion 3 results 3 1 literature meta analysis full results from the literature review depicted in fig 1 are provided in table a 1 of the appendix these data are summarised in fig 2 between 2000 and 2015 the number of articles rose and then stabilised fig 2 over 80 of articles focussed on industrialised countries in europe north america and oceania fig 2 in addition the majority of remaining articles were reviews with global focus but results taken mostly from industrialised countries only seven articles focused on asia 5 6 and none focused on south america or africa of the research articles by far the most popular data gathering method used were surveys followed by experiments fig 2 subjects of surveys were usually the public in a specific geographic context while experiments were often conducted with students 3 2 attributes affecting flood risk perception a significant body of literature explored risk perception related to natural hazards covered by three recent reviews wachinger et al 2013 argued that the process of shaping risk perception is influenced by four groups of factors related to 1 the type and severity of the natural hazard 2 the source and amount of information received 3 personal and cultural attributes such as age gender and religion and 4 context such as closeness to hazard and community size o neill et al 2016 found that often incorrectly perceived flood exposure rather than actual exposure determines flood risk perception this tendency depended on cognitive behavioural socioeconomic and geographical factors most recently lechowska 2018 pointed to the uncertainty of the mechanisms behind risk perception formation exposing the varying levels of clarity and knowledge in the research community regarding the effect of different factors for the purpose of creating effective flood risk communication we present the most significant personal attributes affecting risk perception table 1 these attributes are part of the background to the warning development cycle fig 4 3 3 the elements of flood warning communication fig 3 presents an overview of the elements of flood warning communication the results for the components content format and channel are presented in tables 2 4 respectively the process of selecting and combining these elements is the backbone of the warning development cycle fig 4 the most important elements of content for warning messages include the source of the warning the nature location and time of the hazard and recommended action table 2 while there was little disagreement between studies on these and most other elements of content there was some disagreement regarding uncertainties although transparency concerning the inherent uncertainty associated with a flood risk e g likelihood of occurring severity and timing were often associated with increased understanding some studies highlighted the complexity associated with interpreting such information mileti et al 2004 shanahan et al 2019 spiegelhalter and riesch 2011 inhibiting improvement of response measures taken by recipients besides decisions on the type of elements the order in which information are presented also affects the interpretation of a warning bean et al 2015 and sutton and kuligowski 2019 suggest the following order of content source hazard location time and guidance this reflects the prominence of elements as reported in the body of literature see ordering of table 2 notably including a source is mentioned most often and literature suggests that a recipients preparedness to act largely depends on the perceived credibility of this e g bean et al 2016 turner et al 2014 in contrast to the academic consensus around the content of flood warnings there was considerable disagreement between the findings of different studies on the formatting of messages table 3 writing and graphics were most commonly identified as effective warning formats additionally combining these elements increased their individual effectiveness hogan carr et al 2016 lipkus 2007 savelli and joslyn 2013 using affective writing tended to increase warning effectiveness perreault et al 2014 shanahan et al 2019 indeed images appeared more effective than any other type of graphics as they evoke emotional engagement dobson et al 2018 keller et al 2006 wagner 2007 flood maps were subject to the greatest contradictions between studies table 3 advances in location and cartographic design make flood maps an increasingly effective flood warning format dransch et al 2010 henstra et al 2019 however study subjects often appeared unable to understand a map or locate themselves on one during an emergency liu et al 2017 therefore designing maps containing appropriate information density and complexity is a delicate balancing act for practitioners issuing warnings to assist map design several authors evaluated users information perception from flood maps fuchs et al 2009 luke et al 2018 van kerkvoorde et al 2018 they suggested an extensive list of best practices for cartographic design on e g legend position and composition graphical differentiation between areas that are at risk and other areas and map scale fuchs et al 2009 henstra et al 2019 meyer et al 2012 studies disagreed on the benefit of using probabilistic information such as likelihood of the predicted event in addition the most appropriate format of probabilistic information was contested e g percentages fractions odd ratios and return periods keller et al 2006 leclerc and joslyn 2012 visschers et al 2009 communicating probabilities created misunderstanding among certain audiences that interpreted information heuristically instead of systematically moreover correct interpretation depended on education level and the format of presentation as graphical representations were understood better than numerical ones kashefi 2009 visschers et al 2009 differences in the outcomes of studies examining the effect of probabilities could be explained by the audience s level of education their understanding of probabilities and experience with probabilistic forecasts strathie et al 2017 visschers et al 2009 the most effective channels were those that relied predominantly on the speech format table 4 this might be because spoken messages are more easily understood personal and indicate a sense of urgency lamb et al 2012 turner et al 2014 widely studied in the uk warnings delivered face to face were proven highly effective evoking a high sense of urgency as the most personal communication channel it is resource intensive turner et al 2014 while the uk has a longstanding and community supported flood warden scheme by the environmental agency nagarajan et al 2012 the effectiveness of face to face warnings in different contexts might vary besides formally organised face to face warning systems informal warning systems also play an important role particularly in the global south e g parker and handmer 1998 although the importance of such systems cannot be overestimated we chose not to include such warning systems in our framework which focuses on formal warning systems that can be adopted by authorities next highest net support was found for two other channels that are highly dependent on speech telephone and radio telephone can refer to pre recorded mass distributed messages or interactive flood lines both accessible by landlines as well as mobile phones advantages of both telephone and radio include relatively high accessibility and affordability rendering these channels low cost and high reach e g perreault et al 2014 another advantage of telephone was its potential to provide additional tailored information to recipients if required liu et al 2015 turner et al 2014 a limitation of radio was that messages cannot be repeated on demand to be effective warnings should therefore be repeated with high frequency liu et al 2015 the low level of net support for sms was in contrast with the widespread application by agencies worldwide perera et al 2019 such as the us federal emergency management bean et al 2015 potter et al 2018 swiss national weather agency weyrich et al 2018 and the meteorological service of new zealand potter et al 2018 possible explanation for the low net support is a general underrepresentation in literature from the past two decades as it was deemed a proven and effective written warning channel sutton and kuligowski 2019 contrarily social media were widely researched as a warning channel over the past two decades conclusions about their effectiveness varied and were found context dependent table 4 recent research indicated a significant demand for flood warnings disseminated via social media cho et al 2013 morss et al 2018 stephenson et al 2018 although presumably skewed towards the younger population taylor et al 2018 social media are particularly prone to the spread of misinformation due to their democratic access which is in principle a good feature but may compromise their reliability for risk communication e g lovari and bowen 2020 this tendency increases the responsibility of emergency management to refute misleading content and provide accurate information on this channel the effectiveness of web sites and applications was highly contested they were often considered ineffective because of their inaccessibility e g lam et al 2017 rohrmann 2004 for example questionnaire interviews with over a thousand residents of hong kong showed that recipients were reluctant to visit a website to acquire warning information lam et al 2017 however a comprehensive review on early warning system practices reports this channel to be the most commonly used around the world perera et al 2019 these findings align with the increasing importance of mobile applications for hazard communication tan et al 2017 indeed websites and mobile apps appear to be useful in providing additional detailed information to other warning channels such as sms or social media dallo and marti 2021 finally the effectiveness of sirens was also contested although easy to install and maintain sirens cannot transmit complex information therefore their effectiveness depends on the availability of prior knowledge on appropriate responses in the population fakhruddin et al 2015 most scholars agreed that sirens are only effective when paired with a channel that can transmit information that is more detailed such as on the ground flood wardens and radio fakhruddin et al 2015 hayden et al 2007 höppner et al 2012 woody and ellison 2014 given the popularity and scientific evidence supporting the use of channels that depend on speech e g radio tv face to face see table 4 the lack of research on the speech format is remarkable table 3 a possible explanation could lie in the complexity of empirically testing spoken communication formats feldman et al 2016 3 4 quality criteria for flood warning development selecting the right combination of content format and dissemination channel for flood warnings is critical in order to evoke desired behavioural responses from targeted audiences besides deciding on the type of elements certain guidelines considering their quality should be observed quality criteria are part of the background to the warning development cycle fig 4 most importantly warnings should be specific specific and brief warnings are most effective bean et al 2015 warning development is a balancing act to make messages short enough for quick comprehension but covering all essential information bean et al 2015 hagemeier klose and wagner 2009 sutton et al 2014 use appropriate language a study from the usa concluded that a common flood risk management language was lacking between emergency managers and scientists wood et al 2012 personal attributes such as age and education level affect how warnings are understood and interpreted non technical language and local jargon can increase the reach of warnings among different communities perić and cvetković 2019 particularly when quick decision making is required from recipients the complexity of warnings language should be reduced doksaeter sivle and kolstø 2016 language should be tailored to the targeted audience as for example a 100 year flood is understood very differently between scientists and the public bell and tobin 2007 hagemeier klose and wagner 2009 furthermore language can be perceived as positive or negative and even induce fear although alarmist language can trigger certain desired behaviour the opposite effect is observed in the absence of clear directions and recommended actions nerlich et al 2010 provoking fear while effective in certain circumstances may induce fatalism paralysis or sensationalism o neill and nicholson cole 2009 perreault et al 2014 be transparent warnings should clearly outline what is known what remains unknown and what is uncertain the level of transparency translates to the level of trust and perceived credibility of a message and its source höppner et al 2012 sutton et al 2014 uncertainty should be explained in conjunction with recommendations for action lundgren and mcmakin 2009 transparency is closely related to trust in the message and its source which plays a vital role in warning effectiveness terpstra 2011 wachinger et al 2013 be consistent warnings should be consistent but clear about changes to the hazard all different sources of communication should align their communication strategy and content mileti and peek 2000 weyrich et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 creating effective warnings the warning development cycle is generally triggered when a forecast from meteorological hydrological services exceeds a certain critical threshold such forecasts are often produced on a daily basis and represented by the forecast cycle in fig 4 warning development then commences selecting from 21 elements identified between the three components of flood warning messages eight elements of content five of format and eight of channel fig 3 this process can be either partly or fully automated in the fews or manual when automated a warning system has been set up in advance to select a combination of elements that best fit an exceeded trigger level from a forecast theoretically any number of elements from each component could be combined to create a warning resulting in 2 8 1 2 5 1 2 8 1 2 0 m i l l i o n different options note that this number inflates exponentially with additional elements although many of these combinations are practically impossible or undesirable e g sending an image over the radio emergency managers are faced with a broad pallet of alternatives tables 2 4 provide insights to narrow down the options by presenting the evidence available in literature for and against using different elements however it should be noted that the effectiveness of warnings is highly context dependent höppner et al 2012 keoduangsine and goodwin 2012 taylor et al 2018 the net support for different elements presented in section 3 3 should therefore not be considered a universally valid ranking firstly shortly incumbent and severe flooding requires immediate action from the population making specific elements better suited for example warnings disseminated through sirens are immediately received by large parts of the population while written newspaper articles result in a delayed and potentially smaller reach fakhruddin et al 2015 secondly farmers from a rural community without fast internet connections are more effectively reached by sms radio or flood wardens while the population of a modern city can be reached by a diverse set of channels including those requiring the internet thus context defines desirable choice of elements through the characteristics of 1 the impending hazard including the lead time and severity and 2 the location e g keoduangsine and goodwin 2012 lam et al 2017 mu et al 2018 additionally the availability and preferences for communication technology both for the sender and receiver of the warning define the choice of elements keoduangsine and goodwin 2012 lam et al 2017 mills and curtis 2008 stephens et al 2013 unisdr 2015 together these considerations of contexts are part of the background to the warning development cycle fig 4 the attributes of risk perception discussed in section 3 2 further shape the choice of elements for example past exposure to floods affects current risk perception of a population wood et al 2012 lack of experience with floods is associated with an underestimation of risk low risk perception and limited understanding on appropriate responses exacerbating flood impact bera and daněk 2018 o neill et al 2016 similarly providing references to previous floods in warning messages as well as physical references such as flood markers on buildings keeps risk perception higher for longer bradford et al 2012 wagner 2007 trust as another example of an attribute of risk perception enhances warning effectiveness adding a reference to a trusted organisation in a warning message may therefore improve the warning while the opposite would be achieved when the referenced source lacks public trust heitz et al 2009 lópez vázquez and marván 2003 terpstra 2011 wachinger et al 2013 once the content channel and format are determined a drafted warning should adhere to best practice as outlined in the quality criteria of section 3 4 as emphasised throughout this review these guidelines the attributes of risk perception and the context interplay with one another constituting the background and framework within which the warning is crafted fig 4 as the channel is most constrained because of its dependency on available technology and infrastructure it can serve as the entry point to the warning development cycle however this process should not be linear and multiple cycles of changes and adjustments to the elements of warnings can be made for refinement höppner et al 2012 even argue to open up such cycles via two way communication strategies in order to elicit the informational needs of specific groups and tailor the risk communication approach after every cycle the drafted warning is evaluated to fulfil all contextual and quality criteria before it is dispatched to the target audience fig 4 finally lessons can be drawn from evaluating the effects of the disseminated warning in practice warning dissemination cycle to improve warning development in subsequent emergency situations mayhorn and mclaughlin 2014 in contexts that use semi automated warning systems such as the ipaws system in the usa bean et al 2015 several parts of the stylised warning development process from fig 4 are performed as part of the development and consecutive refinements of such system for example depending on the severity of the forecasted flood a system might either simply depict the risk on a map online low severity or send a sms and push notification to all residents in a risk area high severity here we provide a simple example to illustrate the non automated warning development process as depicted in fig 4 the emergency management agency of a small african country receives information from the hydrological services about a forecast for extreme discharge within three days in a river with bordering agricultural land and villages in a rural area the emergency managers know that to prepare the local residents and farmers immediate warnings should be issued as internet connections are limited in the area but phone connections are good and widely used they decide to select this channel for their warning they want to inform the residents of the timing and exact location of the flood as well as the possible consequences for the farmers content they decide to use both the format of sms messages as well as to open a flood line providing a contact point for more information combining these contents and for all formats they create the warning after evaluation they conclude that the sms is too long when including all the information they therefore decide to limit the information to the timing and type of hazard and add the contact details of the flood line to provide more information to those in need for it they furthermore add the urgent request to inform any family members of the impeding flood as not all elderly members of the community own a phone but family ties are strong after recreating the warning they send the sms out to the relevant communities 4 2 outlook research in hazard detection and risk warning communication is scattered across disciplines e g hazard forecasting risk analysis behavioural psychology applications diverse set of natural and anthropogenic hazards and domains academic research emergency management practice to advance the field transdisciplinary efforts are required to integrate and synthesise all relevant knowledge across academia and practice lang et al 2012 this review is an attempt to do just that draw from different disciplines e g publications in hydrology risk management and psychology and applications focus on flood warnings but include other types warning implementation to provide insights that help create more effective flood warnings further testing of academic findings such as those from this review in practical settings should be undertaken to assess their validity outside the controlled academic setting they stem from such validation of the findings from this review was attempted by the authors undertaking this review was inspired by and part of a larger project fanfar 2021 focussing on co development of a flood forecast and early warning system for west african countries andersson et al 2020 lienert et al 2020a 2021 2020b systematic discussion of the implications of our findings with emergency managers of 17 countries in west africa was planned and commenced as part of this project in a workshop in abuja nigeria in february 2020 we started with discussing different individual warning elements in isolation we planned follow up research including the assessment of different combinations of elements in complete warnings and linking such warnings to different scenarios in terms of hazard type and context preliminary results kuller et al 2020 unfortunately this research effort was halted due to logistical problems and health risks posed by the global covid 19 pandemic prohibiting further personal interactions with our research colleagues and co development participants holding these types of systematic discussions and even implementing findings in real world settings in africa is even more important considering that this review largely reflects the state of the art of knowledge and application in industrialised countries with the bulk of available research coming from europe north america and oceania as emphasised before risk communication is highly embedded in local contexts this highlights the need to investigate the transferability of our findings to different contexts such as africa asia and south america even within industrialised countries research findings are occasionally skewed to specific geographies as is the case for e g research on flood wardens in the uk therefore we urge the research community to further explore transferability of our findings both to different contexts within industrialised countries and beyond this review concentrates on warnings for hydrological hazards as the most frequent and impactful natural hazard worldwide however most findings are directly applicable to other types of natural and even anthropogenic hazards psychological and behavioural mechanisms involved in the hazard response cycle are universal and largely independent from the nature of the hazard hence this review draws from research beyond the confines of the flood domain indeed most of our findings regarding the elements of successful warnings can be extended outside the flood domain acknowledging differences that might exist with other hazards regarding e g lead times geographic characteristics and desired response measures recognising the generic nature of warning communication research attention is increasingly directed at integrating and streamlining hazard and warning communication through multi hazard platforms dallo et al 2020 such platforms aim to present diverse hazards in a single location adopting uniform content and formatting recent developments in information and communication technology provide interactive and intuitive user interfaces enhancing a users broad risk awareness and providing a one stop shop for warning dissemination e g alertswiss app online available at https www alert swiss they furthermore promote collaborative two way communication and sharing functions deemed desirable to increase success ehnis and bunker 2012 höppner et al 2012 the rise of multi hazard platforms also sparks attention for the interplay between different warning elements and the effectiveness of different sets of combinations traditionally most research attention has been directed at the effects of different elements in isolation as reflected in tables 2 4 extrapolating the effect of individual elements in warnings containing combinations of those elements is problematic considering the varying research approaches contexts and subjects from individual studies although we have some insights into the combination of certain elements such as different formats or a format with a channel little is known about the comparative effect of different constellations of elements that form a complete warning such knowledge is crucial as in practice warnings must always constitute a coherent ensemble of at least one piece of content format and channel reciprocal interactions between elements could change findings regarding the effect of individual elements further complexity is added when considering the diverse possible implementation scenarios with varying context in terms of location hazard type severity and targeted populations systematic investigation of this complex interplay depicted in fig 4 is required to move the field of risk communication forward while the increasingly accelerating advancements in technology uncover seemingly endless opportunities for risk monitoring representation and distribution both practice and academia struggle to keep up with this ash et al 2014 feldman et al 2016 henstra et al 2019 new channels of communication become available to growing fractions of the population while futuristic formats are mainstreamed at a high pace e g real time location tracking an increased effort in development and testing of the novel tools at the disposal of emergency management is urgently needed for example the application of web pages apps and social media result in highly contradictory outcomes table 4 while the highest levels of agreement are concerned with formats and channels that are increasingly archaic and obsolete tables 3 and 4 5 concluding remarks providing early warnings are an effective way to mitigate the negative impacts of flooding when developing flood early warning systems a strong focus is generally put on the accuracy and reliability of the hydrological forecast while accuracy is of great concern for obvious reasons the importance of the quality of warning communication should not be overlooked no matter the quality of the forecast if this information fails to reach the relevant actors in a comprehendible and timely fashion it is rendered useless the effectiveness of a warning is determined by its capacity to evoke certain intended and desired behaviour among its recipients this capacity in turn is the outcome of a complex interplay between its elements of content format and channel the generation of flood warnings should occur in the light of personal attributes of the target audience such as demographics and experiences with past events at the same time warnings should be sensitive to the specific local contexts and forecast scenarios the importance of a tailored approach cannot be overstated as no one size fits all exists indeed while this review outlines the state of the art in research on the effectiveness of all warning elements the academic evidence presented to support or reject the effectiveness of individual elements should be appreciated in their specific context and integration with other elements nevertheless our insights are crucial to shape and improve warning communication in the future the framework provided in this paper comprises a clear overview of the known elements of food warnings and a conceptual representation of their implementation in the development cycle of flood warnings other aspects informing this development include the risk context local context the attributes of risk perception and general warning quality criteria to further research in flood warning

4184,for cyclic injection extraction wells with various radial flow geometries we study the transport and recovery of solute and heat we derive analytical approximations for the recovery efficiency in closed form elementary functions the recovery efficiency increases as injection extraction flow rates increase dispersion decreases and spatial dimensionality decreases in most scenarios recovery increases as cycle periods increase but we show numerically and analytically that it varies non monotonically with cycle period in three dimensional flow fields due to competing effects between diffusion and mechanical dispersion this illustrates essential differences between the spreading mechanisms and reveals that for a single well it may be impossible to optimize recovery of both solute and heat simultaneously whether retardation increases or decreases recovery thus depends on aquifer geometry and the dominant dispersion process as the dominant dispersion process heavily determines the sensitivity of the recovery efficiency to other parameters we introduce the dimensionless kinetic dispersion factor s t to distinguish whether diffusion or mechanical dispersion dominates we also introduce the geometric dispersion factor g which is derived from our full solution for the recovery efficiency and improves upon the concept of the area to volume ratio a v often used in analysing well problems unlike a v g accounts for spatio temporal interactions between dispersion and flow field geometry and can be applied to determine recovery efficiencies across a wider range of scenarios it is found that a v is a special case of g describing the recovery efficiency only when mechanical dispersion with linear velocity dependence is the sole mechanism of spreading keywords groundwater

and van der zee 1998 natural forces also drive oscillatory environmental flows coastal aquifers experience oscillatory flows due to tidal seasonal and glacial cycles resulting in the oscillatory transport of salinity pool et al 2016 across freshwater lenses another example of oscillatory environmental flow is barometric pumping subsurface gases and vapors are periodically drawn upwards and forced downwards due to seasonal variations in atmospheric pressure stauffer et al 2019 nilson et al 1991 scotter and raats 1968 oscillatory flows also result from a combination of human and natural factors for example soils in semi arid regions receive sodium ions from capillary rise in the dry season which are subsequently flushed downwards by infiltrating rain and irrigation van de craats et al 2020 van der zee et al 2014 in many of these oscillatory flow problems an interface separates two bodies of water of different quality a classical example being the freshwater lens with aquifer storage systems the interface separates the injected freshwater or hot water from background groundwater a chemical or thermal gradient which undergoes transport due to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion is responsible for the difference in water quality across the interface in light of the wide variety of applications especially regarding water environmental and energy sustainability fundamental research into the general behavior of solute and heat transport under oscillatory conditions has recently received a significant amount of engagement e g laemmel et al 2019 stauffer et al 2019 van duijn and van der zee 2018 dey and sekhar 2014 pauw et al 2016 sanz prat et al 2016 cirkel et al 2015 eeman et al 2017 wang and chen 2015 lu et al 2011 amongst the various oscillatory flow scenarios managed aquifer recharge systems such as asr and ates are unique in that they are concerned with not only the spreading of solutes and heat in the subsurface but also the recovery of freshwater or heat in this study we characterize the performance of aquifer storage systems a key performance metric of an injection extraction system is the recovery efficiency of injected solutes or heat which is the proportion of injected solute mass or thermal energy that can be recovered during the extraction phase solutes and heat spread around the injected water front due to hydrodynamic dispersion processes that are partly advection velocity dependent such as mechanical pore scale dispersion and partly velocity independent such as molecular and thermal diffusion the types of dispersion process that occur the relative strengths of the dispersion processes the strength of dispersion relative to advection and a number of other factors such as flow field geometry and injection rate determine the recovery efficiency we employ analytical methods to derive simple solutions for the recovery efficiency as a function of these parameters and discuss the implications of well design well operational parameters and aquifer characteristics on the recovery efficiency 2 literature review many prior analytical characterizations of injection extraction systems make use of exact solutions e g yang et al 2010 yates 1990 chen 1987 veling 2012 aichi and akitaya 2018 and are valid for specific scenarios for example they might apply only to specific flow field geometries or omit either mechanical dispersion or molecular diffusion some giving non closed form functions that require numerical integration may be somewhat less transparent for directly comparing different geometrical or dispersion properties furthermore no exact analytical solutions are available for some scenarios such as wells modelled as point sources quite a number of analytical solutions are available including studies with closed form analytical solutions e g pophillat et al 2020a gelhar and collins 1971 but they currently describe only the spatial distribution of concentration and temperature but not the recovery efficiency a large body of literature on direct numerical simulations of the recovery efficiency exists e g doughty et al 1982 sommer et al 2013 sommer et al 2015 van lopik et al 2016 bloemendal and hartog 2018 pophillat et al 2020a pophillat et al 2020b however such numerical studies are computationally intensive and specific to certain combinations of parameter values and aquifer geometry which makes their findings difficult to generalize to overcome these limitations we turn to analytical approximations to describe the recovery efficiency with elementary mathematical functions such closed form analytical approximations allow for straightforward sensitivity analysis rapid evaluation of a vast parameter space and identification of suitable regions within parameter space for further in depth investigation with more exact methods they also give more insight in synergistic and antagonistic effects of different parameters and they are fast to evaluate the area to volume ratio a v is a popular approximate method for estimating the recovery efficiency of radial transport systems e g sommer et al 2015 schout et al 2014 novo et al 2010 forkel and daniels 1995 it is based on a simple principle in three spatial dimensions the volume of a storage unit increases as the cube of the characteristic dimension i e storage radius and its area for heat loss increases as the square so increasing the size reduces the loss to capacity ratio duffie and beckman 2013 similar considerations apply to problems of any number of spatial dimensions however the a v is a purely geometric argument that does not consider other factors within the system such as those previously described these other aspects of the system also interact with flow field geometry in determining the recovery efficiency thus the validity of the a v ratio in characterizing recovery efficiency hinges upon these other factors for instance the evolution of the a v ratio with time depends on the flow field geometry and injection rate at the well and so does the peclet number kim et al 2010 while the a v ratio might decrease over time as the storage radius increases and indicate a larger recovery efficiency the magnitude of dispersion relative to advection might in some cases increase with the storage radius thereby suggesting a smaller recovery efficiency therefore the a v ratio as an indicator of recovery efficiency ignores aspects of complexity that are instrumental to the problem gelhar and collins 1971 classical model of concentration profiles around injection wells remains instrumental today in characterizing aquifer well systems pophillat et al 2020a furthermore gelhar and collins model for the concentration profiles continues to be applied and modified in recent years e g shi et al 2020 guimerà et al 2007 schroth and istok 2005 hence we derive approximate solutions for the recovery efficiency taking into account the interactions between flow field geometry hydrodynamic dispersion and the recovery efficiency that are ignored with the a v ratio by extending the model of gelhar and collins 1971 and validating our analytical results with numerical models for notational convenience and brevity we proceed with solute transport terminology under the assumption that density differences induced by chemical and thermal gradients are negligible the analysis is mathematically analogous and fully applicable to heat transport lee 1998 3 methods in homogeneous aquifers with negligible background flow flow fields around wells can be described as radially axisymmetric flow around a point source radial flow in one two and three dimensions implies a linear disk shaped and spherical flow field respectively these three radial geometries correspond respectively to d 1 2 3 in the mathematical construct of a d dimensional sphere the radially axisymmetric advection dispersion equation ade describing conservative solute

concentration of the solute t is time v is the flow velocity α is the longitudinal mechanical dispersivity and d m is the molecular or thermal diffusion coefficient chemical and thermal retardation is

requiring that the rate of volumetric expansion contraction of the body of injected water is equal to the injection extraction rate in practice for injection extraction in groundwater aquifers the d 2 situation of a fully penetrating well seems to be quite common the confining layers below and on top of the aquifer may affect the flow pattern somewhat if they are not completely impermeable for leaky aquifers or wells that do not penetrate fully a d 3 point injection may be a more appropriate limiting case the one dimensional d 1 case reflects an infinite row of fully penetrating wells in which case the flow of injected water occurs rectilinearly along one dimension e g molinari and peaudeceff 1977 sauty 1977 a graphic illustration of these flow field geometries is presented in fig 1 note that although fig 1 illustrates 3d rectangular and cylindrical flow fields for the 1d and 2d cases respectively for the sake of visualization these cases are identical to 1d line and 2d disk flow

manner in a d dimensional infinite domain we henceforth refer to this base scenario as the standard cycle the standard cycle consists of equal volumes of injected and extracted water during each phase v in v ex later we also investigate the effects of varying the ratio of extraction to injection volume the flow field achieves steady state instantaneously upon switching between injection or extraction the well injects a total mass m c 0 q t of solute and recovers m r i over the i th injection period therefore the recoverable proportion f r of solute over the i th injection extraction

the overlying or underlying low hydraulic conductivity layers and flow driven by density gradients and comment on these simplifications at the end we also disregard storage periods where the injection and extraction phases are separated by a period where neither occurs numerical simulations were performed using modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms langevin and guo 2006 for flow and solute transport respectively for the computation of the flow field the initial hydraulic head in the entire domain was set to a uniform value the boundaries of the numerical domain are set as uniform constant head boundaries which imply an absence of background flow the geometry of the numerical domains are identical to that of the flow field being modelled i e line disc and sphere shaped domains for 1d 2d and 3d respectively the solute boundary condition at the edge of the domain is 11 c r 0 to preserve the continuity of c r and minimize dispersive spreading caused by the boundary to minimize

attained during a cycle recall that the flow field is modelled as a sequence of successive steady states since ω is a path integral over the travel history of the hydraulic front and since the indefinite integral in ω during the extraction phase is negative of that during the injection phase gelhar and collins 1971 ω for the complete cycle is 20 ω 0 r m v r d m α v r 3 d r r m 0 v r d m α v

recovery efficiency of the first cycle in fig 2 a and b the solutions agree excellently with the numerical results for all cases but deviate moderately for 3d flow fields when molecular diffusion dominates at larger t in this case 21 is not a proper expression for f r because expression 21 becomes negative at large t which is physically impossible this deviation occurs because the approximation 15 is appropriate only when the scale of transport due to hydrodynamic dispersion is not larger than that of advection gelhar and collins 1971 in 3d advective transport scales with r t 1 3 see eq 12 and thus so does mechanical dispersion in contrast displacement due to molecular diffusion scale with t 1 2 regardless of dimensionality woess 2000 therefore 15 and 21 are accurate in all modelled scenarios except in 3d if molecular diffusion is dominant several important characteristics of the system are revealed in 21 f r increases monotonically as q increases and as d decreases remarkably if α 0 and d m 0 in 1d and 2d f r increases monotonically as t increases but varies non monotonically in 3d with a maximum these observations can be explained in further detail by considering the following scenarios which we will refer to as limiting scenarios notice that the rightmost root term 21 contains the sum of a mechanical dispersive and a diffusive component in limiting cases where one hydrodynamic dispersion process completely dominates i e either d α v or d d m then 21 simplifies to 22a f r q t 1 b α q x t y 22b x 1 2 d 22c y 1 2 d for d α v and 23a f r q t 1 b d m q x t y 23b x 2 2 d 23c y d 2 2 d for d d m where all terms in 21 not explicitly written in 22a and 23a are lumped into b for brevity essentially b is a function of dimensionality and the identity but not magnitude of the dominant dispersion process values of x and y in scenarios of all spatial dimensions are included in table 2 in all limiting cases 1 f r α or 1 f r d m regardless of dimensionality note however that when both α and d m are non zero the relationship 1 f r α q d m does not hold as follows from the above equations the period exponent y and flow exponent x are crucial in determining how both concentration profile and dispersive loss are affected by t and q in the limiting cases described by 22 23 f r d 2 d d m is independent of t and f r d 3 d d m decreases as t increases in all other limiting cases f r increases as t increases and as q increases the fact that f r d 3 d d m decreases as t increases whereas f r d 3 d α v increases as t increases explains why f r d 3 d α v d m varies non monotonically with t many problems in practice can be reduced to such limiting cases for example thermal diffusion typically dominates heat transport anderson 2005 vandenbohede et al 2009 while mechanical dispersion typically dominates solute transport anderson 1984 direct estimation with 21 is inaccurate if the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient is sufficiently large to result in a single cycle f r smaller than 0 7 the reason is that in scenarios with smaller f r the scale of dispersive transport becomes large relative to advection nevertheless in practice aquifer storage systems typically have recovery efficiencies of 0 7 or higher drijver et al 2012 except for systems with very large concentration or thermal gradients where density effects play a significant role in transport schout et al 2016 thus 21 remains applicable to real systems 21 is also inaccurate in predicting the cumulative recovery efficiency f c if the number of cycles is larger than 1 in these two cases it is possible to gain insight on f r q t and the cumulative recovery efficiency f c q t by extrapolation even if α and d m are unknown provided it is a limiting case where either mechanical dispersion or molecular diffusion completely dominates if f r q 0 t 0 or f c q 0 t 0 of some reference injection rate q 0 and injection period t 0 is known then the recovery efficiency for any q t can be approximated using 24a f r q t 1 1 f r q 0 t 0 q q 0 x t t 0 y 24b f c q t 1 1 f c q 0 t 0 q q 0 x t t 0 y fig 2c shows a good agreement for the single cycle recovery efficiency f r and fig 2d for the cumulative recovery efficiency f c after 50 cycles a comparison of fig 2c and d suggests that the accuracy of the extrapolation improves as the number of elapsed cycles increases here too the solution is inaccurate in 3d scenarios where molecular diffusion dominate but 24 nevertheless reveals the qualitatively valid outcome that f r decreases as t increases a retardation factor representing linear adsorption implies a linear re scaling of time thus for a fixed injection duration t an increase in the retardation factor implies a decrease in recovery for scenarios where y 0 and vice versa this means that the linear retardation of diffusion dominated transport hinders recovery in 1d flow fields has no effect in 2d flow fields and enhances recovery in 3d flow fields 4 3 multiple cycles consider a scenario in which the total operational duration of the injection extraction well is prescribed whereas the total number of cycles n is a variable assume that one standard cycle operated with an injection duration of t 0 results in a total solute mass loss of m c t t 0 n 1 m 0 0 in the low frequency multiple cycle scenario t n t 0 n 1 where n 1 is an arbitrary integer the total solute mass loss is m n 0 n y m 0 0 the high frequency multiple cycle case is t t 0 n n and has an identical total duration as the low frequency multiple cycle case we approach the high frequency case by first assuming that m 0 n n z m 0 0 where z is a constant then the upper bound of the cycle exponent z can be inferred by assuming that c r 0 at the onset of each new cycle whereupon m 0 n n m 0 0 exactly and z 1 if this assumption is omitted then m 0 n n z m 0 0 thus we can conclude z 1 a lower bound for z is found if after the first injection phase the boundary condition at the well is c r 0 t 0 instead of c 0 t c 0 so that previously extracted water is re injected without mixing in the well in this case multiplying the number of cycles by n implies that ω is also multiplied by n which yields m 0 n n m 0 0 or z 1 2 under the original boundary condition c 0 t c 0 new solute is injected into the system therefore z 1 2 necessarily in summary we have found for the cycle exponent that 1 2 z 1 using m 0 n n z m 0 0 we obtain the recovery efficiency of the n th cycle 25 f r h 1 m 0 0 n z m 0 0 n 1 1 f r 0 n z 1 where f r 0 is the recovery efficiency of the first cycle numerical results using empirically fitted z agree excellently with 25 fig 3 and fitted z values fall within the bounds predicted 1 2 z 1 fig 3 also shows that although the fitted value of z increases slightly with the number of cycles the difference is small even when data from 5 and 50 cycles is compared this shows the added value that only a minimal amount of data is required to empirically calibrate z the manner by which the upper and lower bounds for the cycle exponent z have been derived suggest that z can be interpreted as a measure of how much the recovery efficiency of a cycle is affected by all preceding cycles the larger the value of z the smaller this memory effect fig 3a b illustrates this showing that z increases as the spatial dimensionality increases this occurs because in each subsequent cycle the ambient chemical gradient enveloping the new injection water front dissipates more rapidly when the spatial dimensionality is large thus weakening the memory effect similarly fig 3c d shows that a larger dispersion coefficient d d m α v leads to faster dissipation of ambient solute resulting in a larger z comparing all the scenarios shown in fig 3 reveals that z is inversely related to f r of the first cycle this is logical in that a complete recovery implies no memory effect and vice versa combining 24 and 25 f r q t n can be extrapolated from a reference operation with known f r q 0 t 0 n 0 by using 26 f r q t n 1 1 f r q 0 t 0 n 0 q q 0 x t t 0 y n n 0 z 1 from 26 we can deduce how cycle frequency affects dispersive losses if y z 1 then high frequency operations under a prescribed total time result in larger f r and vice versa since z 1 2 it means that in 1d where y 1 2 more dispersive losses occur for high than for low frequencies fig 4 a since z 1 it follows that for y 1 more dispersive losses occur in low than for high frequencies therefore for d d m in 2d y 1 fig 4b and 3d y 7 6 fig 4c f c decreases as t increases in the case of a fixed total time this is in contrast with the case of d d m for a fixed t where f c is independent of t in 2d and decreases as t increases in 3d if y z 1 then recovery is roughly independent of frequency this is most likely to occur in general in 2d where 1 4 y 0 and 1 2 z 1 0 and the ranges of y and z 1 overlap closely e g curves for d α v in fig 4b 4 4 kinetic dispersion factor in d 1 the velocity and hence hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient is the same everywhere for d 1 since r t 1 d the cycle period influences the relative lengths of time for which dispersive loss is primarily controlled by either mechanical dispersion or molecular diffusion the relative contribution from mechanical dispersion α v to the dispersion coefficient d d m α v decreases with r and t 1 d as distance increases because v decreases with distance therefore in d 1 the dominant process of spreading of solutes around the plume front increasingly shifts towards molecular diffusion with distance from the well field evidence has shown that thermal breakthrough curves are highly sensitive to mechanical dispersivity at early times of the injection phase due to the large v r associated with small plume volumes vandenbohede et al 2011 this means that some ates systems are controlled by mechanical disperson lin et al 2019 although heat transport is predominantly controlled by thermal diffusion in uniform flow fields hence it is important to be able to determine the relative strengths of diffusion and mechanical dispersion as a function of well operational parameters dispersive losses attributable to α v relative to d m can be obtained by taking the ratio of their contributions to f r in 21 and yields 27 s t 3 d 2 α a d 3 d 1 d t d 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 d m a d 3 d 2 d t d 3 d 2 d where we introduce the dimensionless kinetic dispersion factor s t writing this in terms of v r yields 28 s t 3 d 2 α v r 2 d 1 d m which is a weighted form of the ratio α v r d m of the components of d r d m α v r the unweighted ratio omits the contribution of the term d 1 d m r c r to the ade 5 in 1d d 1 d m r c r vanishes and the weighted ratio becomes equal to the unweighted ratio as spatial dimensionality increases so does s t which suggests that the effects of velocity dependent and velocity independent dispersion are increasingly different in higher dimensional spaces expansions of s t are presented in table 3 concepts similar to s t have been used in prior studies to determine relative contributions of the dispersion processes in radial flow hoopes and harleman 1967 obtained a weighted ratio 4 α v r 3 d m which is 28 with d 2 specifically while bloemendal and hartog 2018 applied the unweighted ratio α v r d m to a two dimensional radial problem which underestimates the contribution of mechanical dispersion in 3d scenarios f r t increases monotonically for d α v yet decreases monotonically for d d m thus a logical reason for the non monotonicity of f r t in 3d fig 5 a is that the relative strengths of α v and d m at the hydraulic front change with t solving f r t t 0 in 21 yields s t 1 this agrees with the numerical results for f r fig 5b therefore the optimum period t m that corresponds to the maximum f r t can be found by solving substituting t t m d 3 and s t 1 in 27 and solving for t m 29 t m 7 α 5 d m 3 q 36 π θ 29 agrees excellently with numerical results for the first cycle fig 6 empirically we observe that f c after 50 cycles also peaks close to s t 1 fig 5c however the presence of ambient solute in the aquifer causes 29 to overestimate t m for multiple cycles fig 6 as only the first cycle recovery efficiency was considered in deriving 29 nevertheless fig 6 shows that the proportional relationship t m α d m 3 2 remains valid even after 50 cycles 4 5 geometric dispersion factor recall that a d q the area to volume ratio a v which was previously discussed in the introduction is 30 a v d d a d t 1 d q t 1 d which suggests that either q or t should be maximized to minimize losses through the surface area while a v is identical for any combination of q and t that yield identical qt the recovery efficiency can significantly differ for different combinations of q and t doughty et al 1982 found that when the total solute mass injected c 0 q t was kept constant in a system with d d m the recovery efficiency was higher under large q small t operation than under small q large t operation bloemendal and hartog 2018 investigated heat storage in a system with a 2d flow field they concluded from sensitivity analyses of q that 1 f r a v approximately when thermal diffusion dominates which agrees superficially with our findings for 2d flow fields that 1 f r q 1 2 t 0 equation 23 because a v q t 1 2 since t was not tested framing the solution in terms of a v might lead to ambiguity in interpretation the principle behind a v does not consider that the rate of velocity dependent and independent dispersive loss depend differently on plume area and volume and flow field dimensionality the recovery efficiency can be expressed as a function of q and t in the limiting cases previously discussed where a single dispersion process dominates namely 1 f r q x t y 22 23 which is similar in form to a v q t 1 d therefore as an alternative to a v we propose the geometric dispersion factor g 31 g q x t y the curves in fig 2a and b for scenarios with a single dominant dispersion process illustrate the dependence of g on t and q respectively unlike a v the exponents of q and t in g are not necessarily identical essentially g generalizes a v by considering spatio temporal as opposed to solely spatial interactions between plume geometry and hydrodynamic dispersion table 2 shows that g is a function of a v namely g a v only when the velocity independent dispersion process is omitted hence g should replace a v in the characterization of aquifer well systems as it provides deeper insight into how recovery varies with well operation parameters 4 6 production and recovery by substituting 12 into 13 and using the form of ω appropriate for the extraction phase gelhar and collins 1971 32 ω

cases 34 in the form 35 c r 0 v ex v in 1 2 c 0 erfc ζ v ex v in 1 2 1 v ex v in δ 1 v ex v in where the exponent δ ranges from 0 δ 4 3 depending on the spatial dimensionality and dominant hydrodynamic dispersion process and the other terms are lumped into the constant ζ for readability fig 7 a shows that for a fixed value of ζ the influence of varying the exponent δ on the production concentration is negligible therefore v ex v in is effectively the only independent variable in 35 if ζ is fixed physically this implies that at any given production concentration the marginal effect on the production concentration of increasing v ex v in is almost independent of flow field dimensionality and the dominant hydrodynamic dispersion process therefore the recovery efficiency as a function of v ex v in can be obtained by numerically integrating 35 with respect to v ex v in the outcomes of which for δ 1 2 are shown in fig 7b the concavity of the curves in fig 7b implies that the marginal benefit to f r of increasing v ex v in has diminishing returns in all cases where ζ is small e g 3d scenarios or scenarios with large d f r of a symmetric cycle v ex v in 1 is small in these cases using a longer extraction period v ex v in 1 can increase f r significantly fig 7b because there remains relatively large amounts of solute mass deposited immediately outside the hydraulic front however where ζ is large the marginal benefit to f r is small when v ex v in is increased beyond 1 this agrees with sauty et al s 1982 conclusion that symmetric cycles yield an optimum balance between cost v ex and benefit f r in some applications the recovered hot water in ates is too cold for heating or in asr is of marginal quality for drinking or irrigation if the production concentration or temperature falls below a critical value c crit hence we may define the effective recovery efficiency as 36 f eff c r 0 c crit d v ex c 0 c crit v in an example f eff as a function of v ex v in solved numerically is presented in fig 7c with δ 1 2 and c crit 1 4 c 0 if v ex v in 1 then f eff is simply equal to f r c crit c 0 1 c crit c 0 once c r 0 t t c crit extraction should cease because the remaining water is unusable and the marginal benefit of increasing v ex v in becomes negative extraction of additional water beyond this point will degrade the quality of the earlier extracted water if they mix the marginal benefit to f eff of increasing v ex v in becomes smaller for larger c crit because c r 0 c crit monotonically decreases as c crit increases these diminishing returns can become negative returns if c crit is non zero as illustrated in fig 7c 4 7 generalizations since all derived expressions i e f r s t g can be written as functions of d the preceding analyses can be generalized to non integer dimensions non integer dimensions are primarily used to describe porous media with fractal pore scale geometry dispersive transport in fractal geometry is a distinct aspect of research into pore scale connectivity and percolation bouchaud and georges 1990 fractured porous media sahimi 2011 and multi phase transport hunt et al 2014 fig 8 a shows that if all other parameters are kept constant the recovery efficiency mostly decreases monotonically as dimensionality increases interestingly however in the range of small d and small q f r d is non monotonic with a maximum whether this non monotonicity and non integer dimensional radial flow in general describe meaningful physical phenomena or are mathematical artefacts remains to be investigated fig 8b shows that curves of f r d for different t intersect at some point at d 2 this implies that f r t can be non monotonic in any d 2 amongst all model parameters such behavior is unique to t in section 4 2 we discussed d 3 a specific instance of this analyses under other definitions of hydrodynamic dispersion are also possible using the methods we have presented for example power law mechanical dispersion α v η with 0 η 2 not necessarily an integer molecular diffusion corresponds to η 0 and standard mechanical dispersion to η 1 other suggested values of η include η 1 2 for peclet numbers 5 p e 300

2 we discussed a specific instance of this namely d 2 η 0 5 discussion our more general results agree with specific scenarios discussed in the literature several numerical studies e g bakker 2010 lu et al 2011 chen 2014 barker et al 2016 majumdar et al 2021 showed that in 2d and with d m 0 the recovery efficiency can be increased by increasing the injection period or the injection rate which agrees with the exponents we found for the geometric dispersion factor g the fact that the recovery efficiency increases as q or t increases for d 2 has also been observed in practice e g bloemendal and hartog 2018 kastner et al 2017 bakker 2010 modelled an asr system in a 2d cylindrical flow field in a homogeneous medium and investigated how varying the injection and storage duration affected the recovery efficiency of freshwater they demonstrated that the recovery efficiency increases sub linearly with the number of cycles the sub linear increase of the recovery efficiency with cycle number was also observed in practice bakr et al 2013 kastner et al 2017 and in other numerical studies sommer et al 2013 zeghici et al 2015 lu et al 2011 majumdar et al 2021 these findings in the literature agree with the bounds we derived for the cycle exponent 1 2 z 1 it is possible for a single well to function both as an ates heat storage and asr freshwater storage in a brackish aquifer system simultaneously miotliński and dillon 2015 given that as previously elaborated heat spreading is primarily controlled by thermal conduction while solute spreading depends mostly on mechanical dispersion the optimal operational parameters of the well for recovering heat and solutes will differ when spreading occurs in three dimensions increasing t might increase the recovery efficiency of freshwater but decrease that of heat therefore it is impossible to optimize for the recovery efficiency for both heat and solutes simultaneously single well push pull tracer tests are often used to determine various hydrogeological properties of aquifers such as porosity hall et al 1991 in situ microbial activity istok et al 1997 fracture geometry klepikova et al 2016 and geochemical reaction rates haggerty et al 1998 by interpreting breakthrough data at the well during the extraction phase schroth et al 2000 eqs 33 and 35 may be used to interpret data from push pull tests using the methodology of schroth and istok 2005 schroth and istok s results pertain only to solute transport in 2d and 3d radial flow fields with a more limited model of dispersion defined as d α v whereas our results apply to a wider range of dispersion models and also in the presence of multiple coexisting dispersion mechanisms e g d d m α v in this study to enable an analytical approach we omitted several aspects these include heterogeneity in aquifer physical properties background regional flow diffusion of heat and solute into confining layers density driven convection nevertheless these omissions do not negatively affect the ability of simple approximate analyses like that discussed in this study from accurately predicting the behavior of well aquifer systems under a wide range of realistic conditions pophillat et al 2020a the assumption of homogeneity has been found to be appropriate for aquifers where the log conductivity field is autocorrelated and has a variance smaller than 0 25 wang et al 2018 in some systems the injection and extraction regimes are separated by a stand still storage phase thus some adaptation may be needed if the velocity independent component of hydrodynamic dispersion is significant and if the storage phase is long with low or no regional groundwater flow the storage period reduces the recovery efficiency by only around 0 5 percentage points per month majumdar et al 2021 and thus has minimal impact all of these omitted factors would cause a decrease in the recovery efficiency if they were accounted for therefore our analysis forms a theoretical upper bound of the recovery efficiency of some real applications witt et al 2021 presented injection extraction experiments of density driven flow with several fully penetrating and partially penetrating well configurations where freshwater was injected into a laboratory scale brackish aquifer experimentally doubling the injection extraction rate and halving the injection extraction duration maintaining the total volume led to an increase in recovery efficiency for three well shapes that create 2d radial flow fields the recovery efficiency increases they observed were from 0 39 to 0 55 0 40 to 0 61 and 0 55 to 0 69 they calibrated the hydrogeological parameters based on experimental data yielding d m 8 8 10 8 m m i n and α 7 10 3 m with injection rates around 2 10 6 m 3 m i n to 5 10 6 m 3 m i n and injection durations of around 60 min we obtain s t 28 this value suggests that mechanical dispersion dominates over molecular diffusion however they also noted that density driven convection dominated over hydrodynamic mixing in the transport of the salinity gradient hence the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion was weaker than that of density driven convection when we insert their hydrogeological parameters into our equation 26 and set x 1 2 y 0 to account for velocity independent spreading in 2d the calculated increases in recovery efficiency would be from 0 39 to 0 57 0 40 to 0 58 and 0 55 to 0 69 which agrees almost exactly with their experimental results our power law relationship between number of cycles and recovery efficiency also agrees well with their results which show diminishing marginal returns as the number of cycles increases compare out fig 3 with witt et al s figure 9 the agreement between our results for spreading under molecular diffusion and their results for density driven convection suggests that the effects of density driven convection on recovery efficiencies might be similar to the effects of molecular diffusion in some idealized problems this is possibly because density driven convection is a form of velocity independent spreading at these low viscosities that results in a radial plume shape i e conical shape see witt et al s fig 2h the modelled flow field geometries often arise as small or large time limiting cases in other flow field geometries for example a point source in a typical vertically confined aquifer generates a 3d spherical solute plume at small times and a 2d spherical solute plume i e cylindrical at large times when the size of the plume has grown large e g schroth and istok 2005 from field data bloemendal and hartog 2018 found that when the outlet screen height of a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer is reduced the recovery efficiency of heat decreases this is because the flow field of a non fully penetrating well is three dimensional at small times and that losses are larger when spatial dimensionality d increases see eq 21 for space use efficiency often multiple wells are spatially distributed in a single large aquifer such as with zonation patterns e g sommer et al 2015 in such implementations the dimensionality of the flow field essentially depends on whether the neighboring wells mutually interfere kandelous et al 2011 thus a transitional time scale also exists for such systems during transitional regimes when solute plumes transition from for example a 3d to 2d geometry the dispersive behavior is bounded by the solutions for 2d and 3d systems this is because the radial velocity of the plume front which affects the plume size surface area and mechanical dispersion is bounded from above by the 2d solution and from below by the 3d solution consequently it appears plausible that a mathematical description of dispersion and recovery during transitional times can be obtained by setting 2 d 3 in the analysis see section 4 7 and is a topic for further research if and only if d 2 the recovery efficiency varies non monotonically with well parameters and retardation may increase the recovery efficiency instead of decreasing it hence systems that undergo transitional regimes experience profound differences in parameter sensitivity across the small transitional and large time scales 6 conclusions in our analysis we approximated solute and heat transport towards the recovery efficiency of injected solute and heat in 1d 2d and 3d homogeneous aquifers under cyclic radial flow these new analytical solutions are broadly applicable in sensitivity analyses as they comprise simple closed form expressions these expressions enable to determine the effect on the recovery efficiency of varying the i mechanical dispersion and diffusion parameters ii aquifer hydrogeological parameters iii injection and extraction duration iv injection and extraction rate v flow field geometry vi number of operating cycles and vii extraction volume relative to injection volume hence a first order assessment of aquifer well systems can be conducted with minimal computational demand e g to pave the way for further focussed evaluations with numerical modelling or exact analyses by enabling the identification of interesting regions in parameter space as discussed our solutions are in broad agreement with various analytical experimental and numerical modelling studies in the literature key factors that determine the recovery efficiency are the flow field geometry and whether mechanical dispersion or diffusion dominates whereas in 1d and 2d flow fields recovery efficiency is a non decreasing function of the injection extraction duration and rate in 3d flow fields it increases with the duration of the cycle when velocity dependent mechanical dispersion dominates but decreases if velocity independent diffusion dominates consequently if velocity dependent and independent dispersion are of comparable magnitude in 3d spreading recovery varies with cycle duration non monotonically peaking at a maximum therefore as solute and heat injection extraction are dominated by different dispersion processes it may be impossible to optimize for the recovery efficiency of both simultaneously another consequence is that when diffusion dominates over mechanical dispersion chemical or thermal retardation leads to decreased recovery in 1d and 2d flow fields but increased recovery in 3d flow fields we generalized this to non integer dimensional flow fields and for mechanical dispersion processes that have an arbitrary power law dependence on advection velocity as the sensitivity of the recovery efficiency to parameters is highly dependent on the dominant dispersion process we introduce the kinetic dispersion factor for identifying the dominant dispersion process we also introduce the geometric dispersion factor a simplified form of our full solution for recovery efficiency that applies if the spreading of solutes or heat may be described by a single dispersion process we show that the classical area to volume ratio is a special case of the geometric dispersion factor that characterizes the recovery efficiency only in the specific scenario where mechanical dispersion with linear velocity dependence is the sole

4184,for cyclic injection extraction wells with various radial flow geometries we study the transport and recovery of solute and heat we derive analytical approximations for the recovery efficiency in closed form elementary functions the recovery efficiency increases as injection extraction flow rates increase dispersion decreases and spatial dimensionality decreases in most scenarios recovery increases as cycle periods increase but we show numerically and analytically that it varies non monotonically with cycle period in three dimensional flow fields due to competing effects between diffusion and mechanical dispersion this illustrates essential differences between the spreading mechanisms and reveals that for a single well it may be impossible to optimize recovery of both solute and heat simultaneously whether retardation increases or decreases recovery thus depends on aquifer geometry and the dominant dispersion process as the dominant dispersion process heavily determines the sensitivity of the recovery efficiency to other parameters we introduce the dimensionless kinetic dispersion factor s t to distinguish whether diffusion or mechanical dispersion dominates we also introduce the geometric dispersion factor g which is derived from our full solution for the recovery efficiency and improves upon the concept of the area to volume ratio a v often used in analysing well problems unlike a v g accounts for spatio temporal interactions between dispersion and flow field geometry and can be applied to determine recovery efficiencies across a wider range of scenarios it is found that a v is a special case of g describing the recovery efficiency only when mechanical dispersion with linear velocity dependence is the sole mechanism of spreading keywords groundwater

forced downwards due to seasonal variations in atmospheric pressure stauffer et al 2019 nilson et al 1991 scotter and raats 1968 oscillatory flows also result from a combination of human and natural factors for example soils in semi arid regions receive sodium ions from capillary rise in the dry season which are subsequently flushed downwards by infiltrating rain and irrigation van de craats et al 2020 van der zee et al 2014 in many of these oscillatory flow problems an interface separates two bodies of water of different quality a classical example being the freshwater lens with aquifer storage systems the interface separates the injected freshwater or hot water from background groundwater a chemical or thermal gradient which undergoes transport due to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion is responsible for the difference in water quality across the interface in light of the wide variety of applications especially regarding water environmental and energy sustainability fundamental research into the general behavior of solute and heat transport under oscillatory conditions has recently received a significant amount of engagement e g laemmel et al 2019 stauffer et al 2019 van duijn and van der zee 2018 dey and sekhar 2014 pauw et al 2016 sanz prat et al 2016 cirkel et al 2015 eeman et al 2017 wang and chen 2015 lu et al 2011 amongst the various oscillatory flow scenarios managed aquifer recharge systems such as asr and ates are unique in that they are concerned with not only the spreading of solutes and heat in the subsurface but also the recovery of freshwater or heat in this study we characterize the performance of aquifer storage systems a key performance metric of an injection extraction system is the recovery efficiency of injected solutes or heat which is the proportion of injected solute mass or thermal energy that can be recovered during the extraction phase solutes and heat spread around the injected water front due to hydrodynamic dispersion processes that are partly advection velocity dependent such as mechanical pore scale dispersion and partly velocity independent such as molecular and thermal diffusion the types of dispersion process that occur the relative strengths of the dispersion processes the strength of dispersion relative to advection and a number of other factors such as flow field geometry and injection rate determine the recovery efficiency we employ analytical methods to derive simple solutions for the recovery efficiency as a function of these parameters and discuss the implications of well design well operational parameters and aquifer characteristics on the recovery efficiency 2 literature review many prior analytical characterizations of injection extraction systems make use of exact solutions e g yang et al 2010 yates 1990 chen 1987 veling 2012 aichi and akitaya 2018 and are valid for specific scenarios for example they might apply only to specific flow field geometries or omit either mechanical dispersion or molecular diffusion some giving non closed form functions that require numerical integration may be somewhat less transparent for directly comparing different geometrical or dispersion properties furthermore no exact analytical solutions are available for some scenarios such as wells modelled as point sources quite a number of analytical solutions are available including studies with closed form analytical solutions e g pophillat et al 2020a gelhar and collins 1971 but they currently describe only the spatial distribution of concentration and temperature but not the recovery efficiency a large body of literature on direct numerical simulations of the recovery efficiency exists e g doughty et al 1982 sommer et al 2013 sommer et al 2015 van lopik et al 2016 bloemendal and hartog 2018 pophillat et al 2020a pophillat et al 2020b however such numerical studies are computationally intensive and specific to certain combinations of parameter values and aquifer geometry which makes their findings difficult to generalize to overcome these limitations we turn to analytical approximations to describe the recovery efficiency with elementary mathematical functions such closed form analytical approximations allow for straightforward sensitivity analysis rapid evaluation of a vast parameter space and identification of suitable regions within parameter space for further in depth investigation with more exact methods they also give more insight in synergistic and antagonistic effects of different parameters and they are fast to evaluate the area to volume ratio a v is a popular approximate method for estimating the recovery efficiency of radial transport systems e g sommer et al 2015 schout et al 2014 novo et al 2010 forkel and daniels 1995 it is based on a simple principle in three spatial dimensions the volume of a storage unit increases as the cube of the characteristic dimension i e storage radius and its area for heat loss increases as the square so increasing the size reduces the loss to capacity ratio duffie and beckman 2013 similar considerations apply to problems of any number of spatial dimensions however the a v is a purely geometric argument that does not consider other factors within the system such as those previously described these other aspects of the system also interact with flow field geometry in determining the recovery efficiency thus the validity of the a v ratio in characterizing recovery efficiency hinges upon these other factors for instance the evolution of the a v ratio with time depends on the flow field geometry and injection rate at the well and so does the peclet number kim et al 2010 while the a v ratio might decrease over time as the storage radius increases and indicate a larger recovery efficiency the magnitude of dispersion relative to advection might in some cases increase with the storage radius thereby suggesting a smaller recovery efficiency therefore the a v ratio as an indicator of recovery efficiency ignores aspects of complexity that are instrumental to the problem gelhar and collins 1971 classical model of concentration profiles around injection wells remains instrumental today in characterizing aquifer well systems pophillat et al 2020a furthermore gelhar and collins model for the concentration profiles continues to be applied and modified in recent years e g shi et al 2020 guimerà et al 2007 schroth and istok 2005 hence we derive approximate solutions for the recovery efficiency taking into account the interactions between flow field geometry hydrodynamic dispersion and the recovery efficiency that are ignored with the a v ratio by extending the model of gelhar and collins 1971 and validating our analytical results with numerical models for notational convenience and brevity we proceed with solute transport terminology under the assumption that density differences induced by chemical and thermal gradients are negligible the analysis is mathematically analogous and fully applicable to heat transport lee 1998 3 methods in homogeneous aquifers with negligible background flow flow fields around wells can be described as radially axisymmetric flow around a point source radial flow in one two and three dimensions implies a linear disk shaped and spherical flow field respectively these three

situation of a fully penetrating well seems to be quite common the confining layers below and on top of the aquifer may affect the flow pattern somewhat if they are not completely impermeable for leaky aquifers or wells that do not penetrate fully a d 3 point injection may be a more appropriate limiting case the one dimensional d 1 case reflects an infinite row of fully penetrating wells in which case the flow of injected water occurs rectilinearly along one dimension e g molinari and peaudeceff 1977 sauty 1977 a graphic illustration of these flow field geometries is presented in fig 1 note that although fig 1 illustrates 3d rectangular and cylindrical flow fields for the 1d and 2d cases respectively for the sake of visualization these cases are identical to 1d line and 2d disk flow

v in v ex later we also investigate the effects of varying the ratio of extraction to injection volume the flow field achieves steady state instantaneously upon switching between injection or

and extraction phases are separated by a period where neither occurs numerical simulations were performed using modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms langevin and guo 2006 for flow and solute transport respectively for the computation of the flow field the initial hydraulic head in the entire domain was set to a uniform value the boundaries of the numerical domain are set as uniform constant head boundaries which imply an absence of background flow the geometry of the numerical domains are identical to that of the flow field being modelled i e line disc and sphere shaped domains

attained during a cycle recall that the flow field is modelled as a sequence of successive steady states since ω is a path integral over the travel history of the hydraulic front and since the

recovery efficiency of the first cycle in fig 2 a and b the solutions agree excellently with the numerical results for all cases but deviate moderately for 3d flow fields when molecular diffusion dominates at larger t in this case 21 is not a proper expression for f r because expression 21 becomes negative at large t which is physically impossible this deviation occurs because the approximation 15 is appropriate only when the scale of transport due to hydrodynamic dispersion is not larger than that of advection gelhar and collins 1971 in 3d advective transport scales with r t 1 3 see eq 12 and thus so does mechanical dispersion in contrast displacement due to molecular diffusion scale with t 1 2 regardless of dimensionality woess 2000 therefore 15 and 21 are accurate in all modelled scenarios except in 3d if molecular diffusion is dominant several important characteristics of the system are revealed in 21 f r increases monotonically as q increases and as d decreases remarkably if α 0 and d m 0 in 1d and 2d f r increases monotonically as t increases but varies non monotonically in 3d with a maximum these observations can be explained in further detail by considering the following scenarios which we will refer to as limiting scenarios notice that the rightmost root term 21 contains the sum of a mechanical dispersive and a diffusive component in limiting cases where one hydrodynamic dispersion process completely dominates i e either d α v or d d m then 21 simplifies to 22a f r q t 1 b α q x t y 22b x 1 2 d 22c y 1 2 d for d α v and 23a f r q t 1 b d m q x t y 23b x 2 2 d 23c y d 2 2 d for d d m where all terms in 21 not explicitly written in 22a and 23a are lumped into b for brevity essentially b is a function of dimensionality and the identity but not magnitude of the dominant dispersion process values of x and y in scenarios of all spatial dimensions are included in table 2 in all limiting cases 1 f r α or 1 f r d m regardless of dimensionality note however that when both α and d m are non zero the relationship 1 f r α q d m does not hold as follows from the above equations the period exponent y and flow exponent x are crucial in determining how both concentration profile and dispersive loss are affected by t and q in the limiting cases described by 22 23 f r d 2 d d m is independent of t and f r d 3 d d m decreases as t increases in all other limiting cases f r increases as t increases and as q increases the fact that f r d 3 d d m decreases as t increases whereas f r d 3 d α v increases as t increases explains why f r d 3 d α v d m varies non monotonically with t many problems in practice can be reduced to such limiting cases for example thermal diffusion typically dominates heat transport anderson 2005 vandenbohede et al 2009 while mechanical dispersion typically dominates solute transport anderson 1984 direct estimation with 21 is inaccurate if the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient is sufficiently large to result in a single cycle f r smaller than 0 7 the reason is that in scenarios with smaller f r the scale of dispersive transport becomes large relative to advection nevertheless in practice aquifer storage systems typically have recovery efficiencies of 0 7 or higher drijver et al 2012 except for systems with very large concentration or thermal gradients where density effects play a significant role in transport schout et al 2016 thus 21 remains applicable to real systems 21 is also inaccurate in predicting the cumulative recovery efficiency f c if the number of cycles is larger than 1 in these two cases it is possible to gain insight on f r q t and the cumulative recovery efficiency f c q t by extrapolation even if α and d m are unknown provided it is a limiting case where either mechanical dispersion or molecular diffusion completely dominates if f r q 0 t 0 or f c q 0 t 0 of some reference injection rate q 0 and injection period t 0 is known then the recovery efficiency for any q t can be approximated using 24a f r q t 1 1 f r q 0 t 0 q q 0 x t t 0 y 24b f c q t 1 1 f c q 0 t 0 q q 0 x t t 0 y fig 2c shows a good agreement for the single cycle recovery efficiency f r and fig 2d for the cumulative recovery efficiency f c after 50 cycles a comparison of fig 2c and d suggests that the accuracy of the extrapolation improves as the number of elapsed cycles increases here too the solution is inaccurate in 3d scenarios where molecular diffusion dominate but 24 nevertheless reveals the qualitatively valid outcome that f r decreases as t increases a retardation factor representing linear adsorption implies a linear re scaling of time thus for a fixed injection duration t an increase in the retardation factor implies a decrease in recovery for scenarios where y 0 and vice versa this means that the linear retardation of diffusion dominated transport hinders recovery in 1d flow fields has no effect in 2d flow fields and enhances recovery in 3d flow fields 4 3 multiple cycles consider a scenario in which the total operational duration of the injection extraction well is prescribed whereas the total number of cycles n is a variable assume that one standard cycle operated with an injection duration of t 0 results in a total solute mass loss of m c t t 0 n 1 m 0 0 in the low frequency multiple cycle scenario t n t 0 n 1 where n 1 is an arbitrary integer the total solute mass loss is m n 0 n y m 0 0 the high frequency multiple cycle case is t t 0 n n and has an identical total duration as the low frequency multiple cycle case we approach the high frequency case by first assuming that m 0 n n z m 0 0 where z is a constant then the upper bound of the cycle exponent z can be inferred by assuming that c r 0 at the onset of each new cycle whereupon m 0 n n m 0 0 exactly and z 1 if this assumption is omitted then m 0 n n z m 0 0 thus we can conclude z 1 a lower bound for z is found if after the first injection phase the boundary condition at the well is c r 0 t 0 instead of c 0 t c 0 so that previously extracted water is re injected without mixing in the well in this case multiplying the number of cycles by n implies that ω is also multiplied by n which yields m 0 n n m 0 0 or z 1 2 under the original boundary condition c 0 t c 0 new solute is injected into the system therefore z 1 2 necessarily in summary we have found for the cycle exponent that 1 2 z 1 using m 0 n n z m 0 0 we obtain the recovery efficiency of the n th cycle 25 f r h 1 m 0 0 n z m 0 0 n 1 1 f r 0 n z 1 where f r 0 is the recovery efficiency of the first cycle numerical results using empirically fitted z agree excellently with 25 fig 3 and fitted z values fall within the bounds predicted 1 2 z 1 fig 3 also shows that although the fitted value of z increases slightly with the number of cycles the difference is small even when data from 5 and 50 cycles is compared this shows the added value that only a minimal amount of data is required to empirically calibrate z the manner by which the upper and lower bounds for the cycle exponent z have been derived suggest that z can be interpreted as a measure of how much the recovery efficiency of a cycle is affected by all preceding cycles the larger the value of z the smaller this memory effect fig 3a b illustrates this showing that z increases as the spatial dimensionality increases this occurs because in each subsequent cycle the ambient chemical gradient enveloping the new injection water front dissipates more rapidly when the spatial dimensionality is large thus weakening the memory effect similarly fig 3c d shows that a larger dispersion coefficient d d m α v leads to faster dissipation of ambient solute resulting in a larger z comparing all the scenarios shown in fig 3 reveals that z is inversely related to f r of the first cycle this is logical in that a complete recovery implies no memory effect and vice versa combining 24 and 25 f r q t n can be extrapolated from a reference operation with known f r q 0 t 0 n 0 by using 26 f r q t n 1 1 f r q 0 t 0 n 0 q q 0 x t t 0 y n n 0 z 1 from 26 we can deduce how cycle frequency affects dispersive losses if y z 1 then high frequency operations under a prescribed total time result in larger f r and vice versa since z 1 2 it means that in 1d where y 1 2 more dispersive losses occur for high than for low frequencies fig 4 a since z 1 it follows that for y 1 more dispersive losses occur in low than for high frequencies therefore for d d m in 2d y 1 fig 4b and 3d y 7 6 fig 4c f c decreases as t increases in the case of a fixed total time this is in contrast with the case of d d m for a fixed t where f c is independent of t in 2d and decreases as t increases in 3d if y z 1 then recovery is roughly independent of frequency this is most likely to occur in general in 2d where 1 4 y 0 and 1 2 z 1 0 and the ranges of y and z 1 overlap closely e g curves for d α v in fig 4b 4 4 kinetic dispersion factor in d 1 the velocity and hence hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient is the same everywhere for d 1 since r t 1 d the cycle period influences the relative lengths of time for which dispersive loss is primarily controlled by either mechanical dispersion or molecular diffusion the relative contribution from mechanical dispersion α v to the dispersion coefficient d d m α v decreases with r and t 1 d as distance increases because v decreases with distance therefore in d 1 the dominant process of spreading of solutes around the plume front increasingly shifts towards molecular diffusion with distance from the well field evidence has shown that thermal breakthrough curves are highly sensitive to mechanical dispersivity at early times of the injection phase due to the large v r associated with small plume volumes vandenbohede et al 2011 this means that some ates systems are controlled by mechanical disperson lin et al 2019 although heat transport is predominantly controlled by thermal diffusion in uniform flow fields hence it is important to be able to determine the relative strengths of diffusion and mechanical dispersion as a function of well operational parameters dispersive losses attributable to α v relative to d m can be obtained by taking the ratio of their contributions to f r in 21 and yields 27 s t 3 d 2 α a d 3 d 1 d t d 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 d m a d 3 d 2 d t d 3 d 2 d where we introduce the dimensionless kinetic dispersion factor s t writing this in terms of v r yields 28 s t 3 d 2 α v r 2 d 1 d m which is a weighted form of the ratio α v r d m of the components of d r d m α v r the unweighted ratio omits the contribution of the term d 1 d m r c r to the ade 5 in 1d d 1 d m r c r vanishes and the weighted ratio becomes equal to the unweighted ratio as spatial dimensionality increases so does s t which suggests that the effects of velocity dependent and velocity independent dispersion are increasingly different in higher dimensional spaces expansions of s t are presented in table 3 concepts similar to s t have been used in prior studies to determine relative contributions of the dispersion processes in radial flow hoopes and harleman 1967 obtained a weighted ratio 4 α v r 3 d m which is 28 with d 2 specifically while bloemendal and hartog 2018 applied the unweighted ratio α v r d m to a two dimensional radial problem which underestimates the contribution of mechanical dispersion in 3d scenarios f r t increases monotonically for d α v yet decreases monotonically for d d m thus a logical reason for the non monotonicity of f r t in 3d fig 5 a is that the relative strengths of α v and d m at the hydraulic front change with t solving f r t t 0 in 21 yields s t 1 this agrees with the numerical results for f r fig 5b therefore the optimum period t m that corresponds to the maximum f r t can be found by solving substituting t t m d 3 and s t 1 in 27 and solving for t m 29 t m 7 α 5 d m 3 q 36 π θ 29 agrees excellently with numerical results for the first cycle fig 6 empirically we observe that f c after 50 cycles also peaks close to s t 1 fig 5c however the presence of ambient solute in the aquifer causes 29 to overestimate t m for multiple cycles fig 6 as only the first cycle recovery efficiency was considered in deriving 29 nevertheless fig 6 shows that the proportional relationship t m α d m 3 2 remains valid even after 50 cycles 4 5 geometric dispersion factor recall that a d q the area to volume ratio a v which was previously discussed in the introduction is 30 a v d d a d t 1 d q t 1 d which suggests that either q or t should be maximized to minimize losses through the surface area while a v is identical for any combination of q and t that yield identical qt the recovery efficiency can significantly differ for different combinations of q and t doughty et al 1982 found that when the total solute mass injected c 0 q t was kept constant in a system with d d m the recovery efficiency was higher under large q small t operation than under small q large t operation bloemendal and hartog 2018 investigated heat storage in a system with a 2d flow field they concluded from sensitivity analyses of q that 1 f r a v approximately when thermal diffusion dominates which agrees superficially with our findings for 2d flow fields that 1 f r q 1 2 t 0 equation 23 because a v q t 1 2 since t was not tested framing the solution in terms of a v might lead to ambiguity in interpretation the principle behind a v does not consider that the rate of velocity dependent and independent dispersive loss depend differently on plume area and volume and flow field dimensionality the recovery efficiency can be expressed as a function of q and t in the limiting cases previously discussed where a single dispersion process dominates namely 1 f r q x t y 22 23 which is similar in form to a v q t 1 d therefore as an alternative to a v we propose the geometric dispersion factor g 31 g q x t y the curves in fig 2a and b for scenarios with a single dominant dispersion process illustrate the dependence of g on t and q respectively unlike a v the exponents of q and t in g are not necessarily identical essentially g generalizes a v by considering spatio temporal as opposed to solely spatial interactions between plume geometry and hydrodynamic dispersion table 2 shows that g is a function of a v namely g a v only when the velocity independent dispersion process is omitted hence g should replace a v in the characterization of aquifer well systems as it provides deeper insight into how recovery varies with well operation parameters 4 6 production and recovery by substituting 12 into 13 and using the form of ω appropriate for the extraction phase gelhar and collins 1971 32 ω

cycles where v ex v in 1 we seek to express 33 as a function of v in q t and v ex q t t where q in 33 originates from a d this yields for limiting case where d α v 34a c r 0 t t 1 2 c 0 erfc v ex v in

when d d m 34b r 0 t t 1 2 c 0 erfc v ex v in 1 v in γ d 2 d 2 θ π d 2 2 d 2 d 3 d 2 a d 4 d 2 d m 2 1 v ex v in 2 d 2 d 1 v ex v in we can rewrite the production concentrations of the two limiting cases 34 in the form 35 c r 0 v ex v in 1 2 c 0 erfc ζ v ex v in 1 2 1 v ex v in δ 1 v ex v in where the exponent δ ranges from 0 δ 4 3 depending on the spatial dimensionality and dominant hydrodynamic dispersion process and the other terms are lumped into the constant ζ for readability fig 7 a shows that for a fixed value of ζ the influence of varying the exponent δ on the production concentration is negligible therefore v ex v in is effectively the only independent variable in 35 if ζ is fixed physically this implies that at any given production concentration the marginal effect on the production concentration of increasing v ex v in is almost independent of flow field dimensionality and the dominant hydrodynamic dispersion process therefore the recovery efficiency as a function of v ex v in can be obtained by numerically integrating 35 with respect to v ex v in the outcomes of which for δ 1 2 are shown in fig 7b the concavity of the curves in fig 7b implies that the marginal benefit to f r of increasing v ex v in has diminishing returns in all cases where ζ is small e g 3d scenarios or scenarios with large d f r of a symmetric cycle v ex v in 1 is small in these cases using a longer extraction period v ex v in 1 can increase f r significantly fig 7b because there remains relatively large amounts of solute mass deposited immediately outside the hydraulic front however where ζ is large the marginal benefit to f r is small when v ex v in is increased beyond 1 this agrees with sauty et al s 1982 conclusion that symmetric cycles yield an optimum balance between cost v ex and benefit f r in some applications the recovered hot water in ates is too cold for heating or in asr is of marginal quality for drinking or irrigation if the production concentration or temperature falls below a critical value c crit hence we may define the effective recovery efficiency as 36 f eff c r 0 c crit d v ex c 0 c crit v in an example f eff as a function of v ex v in solved numerically is presented in fig 7c with δ 1 2 and c crit 1 4 c 0 if v ex v in 1 then f eff is simply equal to f r c crit c 0 1 c crit c 0 once c r 0 t t c crit extraction should cease because the remaining water is unusable and the marginal benefit of increasing v ex v in becomes negative extraction of additional water beyond this point will degrade the quality of the earlier extracted water if they mix the marginal benefit to f eff of increasing v ex v in becomes smaller for larger c crit because c r 0 c crit monotonically decreases as c crit increases these diminishing returns can become negative returns if c crit is non zero as illustrated in fig 7c 4 7 generalizations since all derived expressions i e f r s t g can be written as functions of d the preceding analyses can be generalized to non integer dimensions non integer dimensions are primarily used to describe porous media with fractal pore scale geometry dispersive transport in fractal geometry is a distinct aspect of research into pore scale connectivity and percolation bouchaud and georges 1990 fractured porous media sahimi 2011 and multi phase transport hunt et al 2014 fig 8 a shows that if all other parameters are kept constant the recovery efficiency mostly decreases monotonically as dimensionality increases interestingly however in the range of small d and small q f r d is non monotonic with a maximum whether this non monotonicity and non integer dimensional radial flow in general describe meaningful physical phenomena or are mathematical artefacts remains to be investigated fig 8b shows that curves of f r d for different t intersect at some point at d 2 this implies that f r t can be non monotonic in any d 2 amongst all model parameters such behavior is unique to t in section 4 2 we discussed d 3 a specific instance of this analyses under other definitions of hydrodynamic dispersion are also possible using the methods we have presented for example power law mechanical dispersion α v η with 0 η 2 not necessarily an integer molecular diffusion corresponds to η 0 and standard mechanical dispersion to η 1 other suggested values of η include η 1 2 for peclet numbers 5 p e 300

factors derived from 38 in the same manner as in sections 4 1 and 4 2 are available in table 3 fig 8c and d illustrate the behavior of f r η when α and q respectively are varied remarkably when η 2 and d α v η 1 f r t 1 2 regardless of spatial dimensionality and recovery is independent of the injection rate comparing 39 and 40 reveals an additional limitation of the area to volume ratio f r is a function of a v i e x y only when d α v and never for d α v η with any η 1 furthermore when d α v η with d 2 η 1 η then 1 f r q η 2 2 d and recovery is independent of the injection period in section 4 2 we discussed a specific instance of this namely d 2 η 0 5 discussion our more general results agree with specific scenarios discussed in the literature several numerical studies e g bakker 2010 lu et al 2011 chen 2014 barker et al 2016 majumdar et al 2021 showed that in 2d and with d m 0 the recovery efficiency can be increased by increasing the injection period or the injection rate which agrees with the exponents we found for the geometric dispersion factor g the fact that the recovery efficiency increases as q or t increases for d 2 has also been observed in practice e g bloemendal and hartog 2018 kastner et al 2017 bakker 2010 modelled an asr system in a 2d cylindrical flow field in a homogeneous medium and investigated how varying the injection and storage duration affected the recovery efficiency of freshwater they demonstrated that the recovery efficiency increases sub linearly with the number of cycles the sub linear increase of the recovery efficiency with cycle number was also observed in practice bakr et al 2013 kastner et al 2017 and in other numerical studies sommer et al 2013 zeghici et al 2015 lu et al 2011 majumdar et al 2021 these findings in the literature agree with the bounds we derived for the cycle exponent 1 2 z 1 it is possible for a single well to function both as an ates heat storage and asr freshwater storage in a brackish aquifer system simultaneously miotliński and dillon 2015 given that as previously elaborated heat spreading is primarily controlled by thermal conduction while solute spreading depends mostly on mechanical dispersion the optimal operational parameters of the well for recovering heat and solutes will differ when spreading occurs in three dimensions increasing t might increase the recovery efficiency of freshwater but decrease that of heat therefore it is impossible to optimize for the recovery efficiency for both heat and solutes simultaneously single well push pull tracer tests are often used to determine various hydrogeological properties of aquifers such as porosity hall et al 1991 in situ microbial activity istok et al 1997 fracture geometry klepikova et al 2016 and geochemical reaction rates haggerty et al 1998 by interpreting breakthrough data at the well during the extraction phase schroth et al 2000 eqs 33 and 35 may be used to interpret data from push pull tests using the methodology of schroth and istok 2005 schroth and istok s results pertain only to solute transport in 2d and 3d radial flow fields with a more limited model of dispersion defined as d α v whereas our results apply to a wider range of dispersion models and also in the presence of multiple coexisting dispersion mechanisms e g d d m α v in this study to enable an analytical approach we omitted several aspects these include heterogeneity in aquifer physical properties background regional flow diffusion of heat and solute into confining layers density driven convection nevertheless these omissions do not negatively affect the ability of simple approximate analyses like that discussed in this study from accurately predicting the behavior of well aquifer systems under a wide range of realistic conditions pophillat et al 2020a the assumption of homogeneity has been found to be appropriate for aquifers where the log conductivity field is autocorrelated and has a variance smaller than 0 25 wang et al 2018 in some systems the injection and extraction regimes are separated by a stand still storage phase thus some adaptation may be needed if the velocity independent component of hydrodynamic dispersion is significant and if the storage phase is long with low or no regional groundwater flow the storage period reduces the recovery efficiency by only around 0 5 percentage points per month majumdar et al 2021 and thus has minimal impact all of these omitted factors would cause a decrease in the recovery efficiency if they were accounted for therefore our analysis forms a theoretical upper bound of the recovery efficiency of some real applications witt et al 2021 presented injection extraction experiments of density driven flow with several fully penetrating and partially penetrating well configurations where freshwater was injected into a laboratory scale brackish aquifer experimentally doubling the injection extraction rate and halving the injection extraction duration maintaining the total volume led to an increase in recovery efficiency for three well shapes that create 2d radial flow fields the recovery efficiency increases they observed were from 0 39 to 0 55 0 40 to 0 61 and 0 55 to 0 69 they calibrated the hydrogeological parameters based on experimental data yielding d m 8 8 10 8 m m i n and α 7 10 3 m with injection rates around 2 10 6 m 3 m i n to 5 10 6 m 3 m i n and injection durations of around 60 min we obtain s t 28 this value suggests that mechanical dispersion dominates over molecular diffusion however they also noted that density driven convection dominated over hydrodynamic mixing in the transport of the salinity gradient hence the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion was weaker than that of density driven convection when we insert their hydrogeological parameters into our equation 26 and set x 1 2 y 0 to account for velocity independent spreading in 2d the calculated increases in recovery efficiency would be from 0 39 to 0 57 0 40 to 0 58 and 0 55 to 0 69 which agrees almost exactly with their experimental results our power law relationship between number of cycles and recovery efficiency also agrees well with their results which show diminishing marginal returns as the number of cycles increases compare out fig 3 with witt et al s figure 9 the agreement between our results for spreading under molecular diffusion and their results for density driven convection suggests that the effects of density driven convection on recovery efficiencies might be similar to the effects of molecular diffusion in some idealized problems this is possibly because density driven convection is a form of velocity independent spreading at these low viscosities that results in a radial plume shape i e conical shape see witt et al s fig 2h the modelled flow field geometries often arise as small or large time limiting cases in other flow field geometries for example a point source in a typical vertically confined aquifer generates a 3d spherical solute plume at small times and a 2d spherical solute plume i e cylindrical at large times when the size of the plume has grown large e g schroth and istok 2005 from field data bloemendal and hartog 2018 found that when the outlet screen height of a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer is reduced the recovery efficiency of heat decreases this is because the flow field of a non fully penetrating well is three dimensional at small times and that losses are larger when spatial dimensionality d increases see eq 21 for space use efficiency often multiple wells are spatially distributed in a single large aquifer such as with zonation patterns e g sommer et al 2015 in such implementations the dimensionality of the flow field essentially depends on whether the neighboring wells mutually interfere kandelous et al 2011 thus a transitional time scale also exists for such systems during transitional regimes when solute plumes transition from for example a 3d to 2d geometry the dispersive behavior is bounded by the solutions for 2d and 3d systems this is because the radial velocity of the plume front which affects the plume size surface area and mechanical dispersion is bounded from above by the 2d solution and from below by the 3d solution consequently it appears plausible that a mathematical description of dispersion and recovery during transitional times can be obtained by setting 2 d 3 in the analysis see section 4 7 and is a topic for further research if and only if d 2 the recovery efficiency varies non monotonically with well parameters and retardation may increase the recovery efficiency instead of decreasing it hence systems that undergo transitional regimes experience profound differences in parameter sensitivity across the small transitional and large time scales 6 conclusions in our analysis we approximated solute and heat transport towards the recovery efficiency of injected solute and heat in 1d 2d and 3d homogeneous aquifers under cyclic radial flow these new analytical solutions are broadly applicable in sensitivity analyses as they comprise simple closed form expressions these expressions enable to determine the effect on the recovery efficiency of varying the i mechanical dispersion and diffusion parameters ii aquifer hydrogeological parameters iii injection and extraction duration iv injection and extraction rate v flow field geometry vi number of operating cycles and vii extraction volume relative to injection volume hence a first order assessment of aquifer well systems can be conducted with minimal computational demand e g to pave the way for further focussed evaluations with numerical modelling or exact analyses by enabling the identification of interesting regions in parameter space as discussed our solutions are in broad agreement with various analytical experimental and numerical modelling studies in the literature key factors that determine the recovery efficiency are the flow field geometry and whether mechanical dispersion or diffusion dominates whereas in 1d and 2d flow fields recovery efficiency is a non decreasing function of the injection extraction duration and rate in 3d flow fields it increases with the duration of the cycle when velocity dependent mechanical dispersion dominates but decreases if velocity independent diffusion dominates consequently if velocity dependent and independent dispersion are of comparable magnitude in 3d spreading recovery varies with cycle duration non monotonically peaking at a maximum therefore as solute and heat injection extraction are dominated by different dispersion processes it may be impossible to optimize for the recovery efficiency of both simultaneously another consequence is that when diffusion dominates over mechanical dispersion chemical or thermal retardation leads to decreased recovery in 1d and 2d flow fields but increased recovery in 3d flow fields we generalized this to non integer dimensional flow fields and for mechanical dispersion processes that have an arbitrary power law dependence on advection velocity as the sensitivity of the recovery efficiency to parameters is highly dependent on the dominant dispersion process we introduce the kinetic dispersion factor for identifying the dominant dispersion process we also introduce the geometric dispersion factor a simplified form of our full solution for recovery efficiency that applies if the spreading of solutes or heat may be described by a single dispersion process we show that the classical area to volume ratio is a special case of the geometric dispersion factor that characterizes the recovery efficiency only in the specific scenario where mechanical dispersion with linear velocity dependence is the sole
