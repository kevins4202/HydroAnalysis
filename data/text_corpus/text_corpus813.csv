4065,the thermal structure of a lake is strongly associated its hydrodynamics and climatic conditions and is an important basis to understand the physical chemical and ecological processes of the lake lake erhai 100 05 100 17 n and 25 36 25 58 e is a large and deep lake in yunnan province located on the yunnan guizhou plateau of southwest china some deep lakes located in areas adjacent to lake erhai with similar climatic conditions and water depths are warm monomictic lakes however the historical data of the surface water temperature and bottom water temperature for the past 15 years 2004 2018 showed small differences 1 c however ours and some other studies on the vertical water temperature profile showed mixing of the entire water column in different seasons we have applied a well established hydrodynamics model ce qual w2 to explore the main process that induces the particular thermal structure of lake erhai model calibration was conducted twice once with the extinction coefficient kd and fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta as the main calibrated parameters and the other considering the process of bottom water heat exchange represented by the sediment temperature tsed parameter in the ce qual w2 model the simulation results showed that the model can reproduce water level and surface water temperature accurately with the first calibration tsed is 14 8 c however only when the tsed is greater than 24 c the rmse can be less than 2 c the model reproduces the bottom water temperature well when the tsed value was 29 6 0 37 c moreover a series of scenarios were conducted to quantify the effect of wind speed and or tributary inflows temperature on the thermal structure of lake erhai and two stability indices schmidt stability birgean work were calculated to quantify the energy required for stratification and mixing these results demonstrated that the most likely process to establish the holomixis of lake erhai is geothermal heat transfer from sediment to water column and an additional 12 heat flux from sediment plus the actual external energy supplies from sediment are required to mix the entire water column of lake erhai in summer keywords thermal mixing lake erhai ce qual w2 geothermal heat 1 introduction most deep lakes especially in temperate regions can experience thermal stratification and cyclic changes within a year during warm seasons the surface waters are heated and have lower density than the deep waters which forms the metalimnion that can decrease the vertical diffusion rate of dissolved substances and cause hydrochemical differentiation of the water column into an oxic epilimnion and an anoxic hypolimninon thus thermal structure especially the mixing duration and stability of stratification can have various abiotic effects with consequences for biological production bueche and vetter 2014 generally lake stratification imposes a heterogeneous abiotic environment e g density temperature nutrient dissolved oxygen and light availability in the vertical water column with the potential to influence the vertical distribution and taxonomic composition of phytoplankton reynolds 1984 multilake observational whole lake manipulated and model simulated studies have supported the critical role of thermal structure especially epilimnion depth and thermocline depth which can alter the nutrients light ratio of nutrient and light and as well as their distribution in stratified water column and or mixed water column for phytoplankton dynamics diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 longhi and beisner 2009 weithoff et al 2000 for example a whole lake manipulated studies in lake lac croche proved that an increase in thermocline depth promoted phytoplankton production attributable mainly to increases in chlorophytes the assessment and analysis of the thermal structure vertical stratification and mixing dynamics of lakes is a necessary basis to understand the evolution of their tropic and ecological statuses fenocchi et al 2017 at a macroscopic scale as the very slow diffusive heat transport on a molecular level and shielded of deeper layers from the solar radiation weather conditions set up the thermal structure of lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 in the same climate zone the difference of the epilimnion thickness for different lakes is mainly determined by lake size and water clarity read et al 2014 rimmer et al 2011 rueda et al 2009 shikano et al 2004 the effect of lake size on the epilimnion thickness reflects the differential effect of wind induced mixing in small vs large lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 read et al 2014 wind stress at the lake surface is considered as a much more efficient heat transport by the kinetic energy and as a decisive factor for epilimnion thickness in nearly all lakes patalas 1984 for example boegman et al 2008 found that surface wind speeds 6 m s are sufficient to vertically mix the water column in lake erie simulation results for lake pääjärvi and lake valkea mustajärvi showed that the thermal stratification of a large lake is more susceptible to wind speed juhani and aija riitta 2011 factors such as colored dissolved organic matter cdom concentration the amount of suspended particles and phytoplankton concentration which affect water clarity and light penetration in water column cam affect epilimnion thickness especially in small lakes or lakes with extremely weak winds heiskanen et al 2015 hocking and straškraba 1999 in addition to the weather conditions lake size and water clarity heat transfer between bottom and water can play an important role affect lake thermal structure in some special lakes for example in some crater lakes the volcanic heat supply from the lake bottom also affects thermal stratification and causes deep mixing with a small water temperature difference between the epilimnion and hypolimnion during the stratification period crawford and collier 1997 shikano et al 2004 different methods have been proposed to study the thermal structure of lakes including monitoring a combination of monitoring and statistical methods davies colley 1988 rimmer et al 2011 shikano et al 2004 and advanced mechanistic models based on momentum equations boegman et al 2008 bueche and vetter 2014 noori et al 2015 because of the dynamic variation and compound factors influencing the thermal structure of lakes monitoring or a combination of monitoring and statistical methods is useful to investigate these phenomena but cannot easily identify the dominant process driving the variation of the thermal structure of a lake mechanistic models for assessing surface water temperature rise and vertical water temperature stratification in lakes have been widely applied dong et al 2020 mechanistic models once properly validated can be used to assess the effects of different scenarios and are a source of information on the driving processes and global dynamics of the studied systems they have been applied as an analytical tool to identify the main processes and mechanisms inducing variations of the thermal structure of lakes fenocchi et al 2017 hocking and straškraba 1999 read et al 2014 rimmer et al 2011 schwefel et al 2016 to understand thermal structure dynamics and to predict the thermal responses of lakes to climate change for example heiskanen et al 2015 used two one dimensional models lake and flake in lake kuivajärvi to evaluate the effects of water clarity on lake stratification bueche and vetter 2014 applied the one dimensional hydrodynamic lake model dynamic reservoir simulation model to evaluate the effect of climate change on annual stratification cycle of lake ammersee lake erhai is one of the plateau lakes of the yunnan plateau yp it is an eutrophic lake with concentration of chlorophyll a of 13 33 μg l and with a peak value exceeding 30 μg l wang et al 2020 observed data of surface water temperature swt and bottom water temperature bwt in the past 15 years and several measurements of vertical water temperatures profiles zhu et al 2017 showed entire water column mixing in different season in lake erhai however some deep lakes in yunnan plateau such as lake chenghai and lake yangzonghai located in areas adjacent to lake erhai with similar climatic conditions and similar water depths are both warm monomictic lakes lu et al 2017 yuan et al 2014 moreover according to a widely used empirical regression relating epilimnion thickness with lake area zepi 4 6a 0 205 in which zepi is the thickness of the epilimnion and a is the area of the lake surface in the deep basin of lake erhai in mid summer the mixing depth should be 14 8 m and there should be at least two layers in summer the epilimnion and thermocline therefore the cause of the holomixis of lake erhai is an interesting problem and also important to understand the physical chemical and ecological processes in this lake especially the phytoplankton dynamics in this study we applied the hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 wells 2019a which has been tested extensively in previous studies including detailed validations across a spectrum of lake contexts and proven to efficiently reproduce the thermal regimes of lakes cole 2000 to identify the main process that induce the special thermal structure of lake erhai 2 study area and data lake erhai is located in the yunnan guizhou plateau southwest china at 100 05 100 17 n and 25 36 25 58 e as shown in fig 1 at a surface elevation of 1966 m lake erhai has a surface area of 247 42 km2 a volume of 29 59 108 m3 a maximum depth of 21 3 m and an average depth of 10 8 m lake erhai is 42 5 km long from north to south and averages 5 9 km in width from east to west the catchment area of the lake is 2565 km2 there are 117 tributary inflows and one outflow river of the erhai basin the main inflow is the miju river with a mean annual discharge of 11 32 m3 s a secondary inflow is the boluojiang river with a mean annual discharge of 2 44 m3 s tertiary inflows are the luoshijiang river with a mean annual discharge of 1 49 m3 s and the yonganjiang river with a mean annual discharge of 0 82 m3 s all remaining tributaries have mean annual discharges of 0 5 m3 s the only outflowing river is the xier river with a mean annual discharge of 28 21 m3 s the theoretical water renewal time for such outflow is tr 3 33 years annual water level variation over 2000 2018 was 1 57 m which was controlled by the xierhe gate the average annual rainfall evaporation air temperature and wind speed of the erhai basin are 997 mm 1 245 mm 15 1 c and 2 6 m s respectively from 2004 to 2018 water samples were collected on a monthly basis from four sampling sites a depth of the water column 13 m b depth of the water column 21 5 m c depth of the water column 18 m d depth of the water column 9 m with two column depths 0 5 m below the water surface and 0 5 m above the bottom by the dali county environmental monitoring center who operated a routine water quality monitoring program three indicators were used for analysis and ce qual w2 model calibration and validation water transparency secchi disk depth sd surface water temperature swt and bottom water temperature bwt additionally vertical water temperature profiles were measured using a multi parameter water quality sonde ysi eds 6600 v2 brannum lane oh usa at site b on june 21 2017 and august 27 2017 3 methods 3 1 method description the parameters that affect hydrodynamics and or water temperature have clear physical meanings or relate to some process so successful calibration and validation of the model can be used to analyze the thermal structure in different season thoroughly further an analysis of the simulated results of modification of input parameters ensures that it is possible to identify the main process or factor that lead to the special thermal structure of lake erhai and simultaneously gives the opportunity to examine the simulated changes considering the impact of specific input parameters in order to identify the main process that lead to the special thermal structure of lake erhai we firstly analyzed the long term characteristic of swt bwt and main meteorological factors and then simulated the hydrodynamics process using ce qual w2 model on this basis main parameters that may influence thermal structure of lake erhai were calibrated using random sampling method finally analysis of the simulated results of modification of input parameters were conducted to identify the main process that influence special thermal structure of lake erhai 3 2 model setup the ce qual w2 model is suitable for relatively long and narrow waterbodies exhibiting longitudinal and vertical water quality gradients such as lake erhai which has an aspect ratio of 6 74 in addition because the main objective of this study was to explore the influences of various factors on the vertical thermal mixing of lake erhai ce qual w2 is suitable for this study the computational domain for ce qual w2 was constructed using a 5 m resolution bathymetric survey by the dali environmental protection bureau conducted in 2003 lake erhai domain was discretized into 85 segments 325 m to 845 m in length north to south fig 1b each segment was vertically discretized to 0 25 m thick layers the maximum depth consisted of 90 segments in the vertical direction the total number of active grid cells was 5348 at the elevation of the water surface of 1966 m the volumes of the model grid and the measured bathymetry were 27 67 108 m3 and 27 94 108 m3 and the areas of the model grid and the measured bathymetry were 240 96 km2 and 247 42 km2 respectively the volume and area errors were 0 97 and 2 61 respectively the grid of the model accurately reflected the water level volume area relationship and topographic characteristics of lake erhai fig 1b 3 3 boundary conditions the horizontal and surface boundary conditions in the model represent the external driving forces affecting the lake dynamics the boundary conditions for simulation of hydrodynamics using the ce qual w2 model included hydrological boundary conditions which consisted of tributary inflow rates associated temperature and outflow rates and meteorological surface boundary conditions tributary inflows and associated temperature data were taken from the results of the calibrated loading simulation program in c lspc model tech 2009 they consist of the hydrological data of five years from 2014 to 2018 the time step of the hydrological inflows and associated temperature data was 1 day some smaller tributaries were merged and generalized in the lspc model of the erhai catchment the tributaries were generalized from 117 to 63 the outflow boundary conditions included three outflows the main one was the xier river for which daily hydrological data were collected by the dali water conservancy bureau the second was water transferred from lake erhai to binchuan county and the third was water drawn from lake erhai for drinking water supply atmospheric boundary conditions included hourly data of air temperature dew point temperature wind speed and direction cloud cover solar radiation and precipitation meteorological data including hourly data of air temperature wind speed and direction relative humidity and precipitation were taken from the dali meteorological station mt in fig 1a which is a chinese national meteorological basic station the station is located 700 m offshore 100 18 n 25 7 e at an elevation of 1990 5 m we calculated the dew point temperature based on an empirical formula using air temperature and relative humidity xu et al 2016 hourly data of cloud cover and solar radiation were obtained from the tengchong meteorological station which is located 180 km north of lake erhai 98 3 n 24 59 e 3 4 model calibration method 3 4 1 latin hypercube sampling latin hypercube sampling lhs is a stratified sampling method introduced by mckay et al 2000 that provides an efficient approach for sampling variables from their multivariate distributions the application of lhs to calibrate the ce qual w2 model in this study can be summarized into two steps of stratified sampling and evaluation of the model the first step is that k variables to be calibrated x 1 x 2 xk are divided into n equally probable intervals one value is selected at random from each interval the n values obtained for each variable are then paired with each other which finally results in n combinations of k variables the number of sample n is a key factor influencing the accuracy of lhs however there are no firm criteria or rules available for choosing n mckay 1988 suggested that a number of simulation runs n equal to twice the number of the parameters calibrated k might provide a good balance of accuracy and computational cost for model runs iman and helton 1988 indicated that a choice of n equal to 4 3 times the number of the parameters calibrated k usually gave satisfactory results some studies used greater values of n to achieve the optimal realization for analyzing the model parameters and simulation results aalderink et al 1996 li et al 2015 xu et al 2005 li et al 2015 found that the sample mean and variance stabilized well after 150 simulation runs for 10 variables of the efdc hydrodynamic model aalderink et al 1996 used 50 simulation runs of the duflow model to analyze the input uncertainty xu et al 2005 applied the lhs method to geostatistical modeling to evaluate the uncertainty of spatial models using a sampling number of 50 based on the previous research and model calculation costs in this study a sampling number of 50 times the number of parameters calibrated was taken after sampling each sample set was supplied to the model as input to create a sequence of model simulation results water level wl swt and bwt were chosen as the hydrodynamic output targets for the calibration assessments the absolute mean error ame and root mean square error rmse indices were used to assess the agreement between simulation results and observed data 3 4 2 model parameters to be calibrated based on the previous studies and literature on the ce qual w2 hydrodynamic model afshar et al 2011 boegman et al 2008 bonalumi et al 2012 cole 2000 noori et al 2015 wells 2019 the main parameters related to hydrodynamic processes include longitudinal eddy viscosity ax longitudinal eddy diffusivity dx fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta light extinction coefficient for pure water named exh2o in ce qual w2 but we use the common notation kd the wind sheltering coefficient wsc sediment temperature tsed and coefficient of bottom heat exchange cbhe ax and dx mainly specify dispersion of momentum heat and constituents in the longitudinal axis and have little effect on vertical heat dispersion previous studies indicated that the default values of these two parameters can accurately reproduce the thermal regimes of reservoirs cole 2000 in this study we used the default values of these two parameters the wind sheltering coefficient is a parameter to specify the effect of sheltering on wind speed which was used to multiply observed wind speed measurements to decrease the effective wind reaching the lake surface previous studies have shown that a smaller lake area is associated with a greater sheltering effect especially for lakes with areas of less than 1 km2 markfort et al 2010 cole 2000 indicated that absence of meteorological data especially wind data collected at the water body site was the largest contributor to errors between measured and computed temperatures in this study the area of lake erhai is 247 42 km2 and the data of wind speed and wind direction were obtained from the dali meteorological station which is located 700 m offshore thus we used the default value of wsc which is 1 0 the light extinction coefficient kd is an important parameter that affects the vertical exchange of heat and directly determines the ability of short wave solar radiation to penetrate the water layer fenocchi et al 2017 a smaller light extinction coefficient is associated with greater short wave solar radiation penetration ability and greater mixing depth therefore proper calibration of the light extinction coefficient is essential to simulate thermal structure especially vertical stratification and mixing because the model constructed in this study only simulated the hydrodynamic processes the light extinction coefficient of pure water was used in the model to comprehensively characterize the light extinction coefficient of water the suggested default value of kd is 0 45 m 1 when only temperature is being simulated wells 2019 some studies based on parameter calibration used lower light extinction coefficients for the deep lake maggiore lake area 213 km2 maximum water depth 370 m sd 7 24 2 96 m and the one dimensional vl tf model a calibrated light extinction coefficient equal to 0 185 m 1 was reported by fenocchi et al 2017 according to the standard linear model used to relate the light extinction coefficient and sd proposed by poole and atkins 1929 and some more accurate non linear relations between sd and the light extinction coefficient tilzer 1988 sd is negatively correlated with the light extinction coefficient in this study the mean measured sd from 2004 to 2018 was 2 02 m in lake erhai which is a higher light extinction coefficient than that of lake maggiore moreover as hocking and straškraba pointed out 1999 the dependence of the thermal structure on the light extinction coefficient is highest at 0 5 m 1 because above this value the sunlight is absorbed near the surface combining the above factors we applied a value range of 0 3 0 5 m 1 in the calibration the fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta represents solar radiation absorbed at the surface the suggested default value of beta is 0 45 and the value range in previous studies is 0 25 0 7 wells 2019a the relationship between beta and the light extinction coefficient studied in 29 lakes and reservoirs showed a positive correlation as below beta 0 265 ln λ 0 614 in which λ is the light extinction coefficient of water williams et al 1981 we applied this relationship to calculate beta based on the light extinction coefficient during sampling and simulation sediment temperature tsed and the coefficient of bottom heat exchange cbhe represent the heat exchange at the ground water interface generally tsed is estimated from the average annual air temperature at the study site wells 2019b based on the average annual air temperature records of the dali meteorological station in the period of 2014 to 2017 the value of tsed was applied as 14 8 c the default value of cbhe is 0 3 and we applied a value range of 0 3 1 0 in the calibration the values value ranges of parameters discussed above for temperature simulation and calibration in lake erhai by the ce qual w2 model are shown in table 1 4 results 4 1 characteristics of water temperature first we analyzed the seasonal variations of swt bwt temperature difference between surface water temperature and bottom water temperature dwt wd daily air temperature at and wind speed ws from 2004 to 2018 fig 2 a among the four monitoring stations the multi year averages of swt bwt and dwt at station a were 18 5 4 6 c 17 6 4 6 c and 0 86 0 62 c respectively the multi year averages of swt bwt and dwt at station b were 18 5 4 2 c 17 6 4 4 c and 0 89 0 74 c respectively the multi year average values of swt bwt and dwt at station c were 17 0 4 4 c 16 3 4 4 c and 0 66 0 56 c respectively and the multi year average values of swt bwt and dwt at station d were 16 3 4 2 c 15 7 4 2 c and 0 68 0 58 c respectively the average dwt values of the four monitoring stations were less than 1 c in addition station b had the greatest water depth as well as the deepest basin of lake erhai from 2004 to 2018 monitoring station b had a maximum water depth of 21 85 m a minimum water depth of 19 35 m and an average water depth of 20 92 0 5 m thus the shallow and deep water areas of the entire lake showed obvious mixing of the water column during the annual change of dwt the numbers of observations of dwt greater than 2 c at monitoring stations a b c and d were 8 times 9 times 6 times and 6 times respectively the maximum value of dwt was observed at monitoring station b on december 5 2012 on that day dwt at swt bwt and ws were 4 7 c 8 4 c 15 5 c 10 8 c and 1 7 m s respectively and the water depth was 21 35 m fig 2b shows the dwt statistics of four monitoring stations in different seasons the results show that the dwt values of monitoring station a in spring summer autumn and winter were 0 94 0 81 c 0 87 0 52 c 0 81 0 51 c and 0 89 0 70 c respectively the dwt values of monitoring station b in spring summer autumn and winter were 1 08 0 78 c 0 76 0 52 c 0 75 0 32 c and 1 25 1 46 c respectively the dwt values of monitoring station c in spring summer autumn and winter were 0 65 0 5 c 0 80 0 69 c 0 54 0 41 c and 0 63 0 66 c respectively and the dwt values of monitoring station d in spring summer autumn and winter were 0 72 0 67 c 0 53 0 41 c 0 70 0 50 c and 0 77 0 73 c respectively 4 2 calibration of water balance and surface water temperature to explore the dominant factors of the vertical water temperature distribution characteristics of lake erhai the bathymetry and boundary conditions should accurately represent lake erhai which indicates that the main hydrodynamic processes and surface water temperature must be calibrated as described above there are three main parameters to be calibrated including kd beta and cbhe of which beta is calculated based on an empirical formula between kd and beta therefore the number of simulation runs was 100 the minimum and maximum time step of the model simulation were adapted to be 10 s and 30 s respectively based on the observed daily water level data we conducted a calibration of the water balance of lake erhai the daily water level diagram of measurements and results simulated by the erhai ce qual w2 model under 100 sets of parameters is shown in fig 3 a the results indicate that the water levels simulated by the ce qual w2 model accurately reproduced the process of water level decline caused by decreased incoming water and large irrigation water consumption in winter and spring and the process of rising water level caused by runoff input in summer and autumn the rmse and ame of the 100 sets of parameters are 0 084 0 0019 m and 0 069 0 0018 m respectively the difference of water level simulated by the ce qual w2 model among the 100 sets of parameters was very small and the main reason for that difference was the difference of the parameter beta which represents solar radiation absorbed at the surface i e when this parameter is larger the short wave radiation absorbed by the surface water is greater which causes the surface water temperature and evaporation to increase fig 4 accurate water balance simulation laid the foundation for the simulation of the thermodynamic process of lake erhai because segment 31 where monitoring station b is located is at the deepest part of lake erhai and the middle of the water body it can comprehensively represent the horizontal and vertical thermodynamic processes in lake erhai therefore the observed data of monitoring station b were mainly used to analyze the agreement between the observed data and simulated results of the ce qual w2 model as the water level has a certain amplitude during a given year the surface active grid changes with the change of the water level and the surface water temperature was measured at a depth of 0 5 m underwater therefore the simulated result of surface water was not a fixed grid in segment 31 but a third active grid the monthly observed data and daily simulated results of surface water temperature of segment 31 from 2014 to 2017 are shown in fig 3b these results show that the 100 sets of parameters can accurately simulate the seasonal dynamic change of swt from january to august the swt of lake erhai rises sharply with the coaction of radiant heat energy and atmospheric heat energy the rmse and ame of the 100 sets of parameters were 1 22 0 046 c and 0 95 0 029 c respectively there was no significant difference in the simulation results between the parameter sets swt is the result of water gas heat exchange and balance under the combined effects of internal and external factors such as solar radiation atmospheric reverse radiation wind and latent heat of evaporation the wl and swt simulation results showed that the ce qual w2 model constructed in this study can accurately reflect the process of heat exchange between lake erhai and the atmosphere in addition it showed that the meteorological boundary conditions such as air temperature and wind speed in the model and the boundary conditions of inflow and outflow were reliable and accurate 4 3 calibration of bottom water temperature the monthly observed data and daily simulation results of bwt at segment 31 from 2014 to 2017 are illustrated in fig 3c compared with the accurate simulation results of swt the 100 sets of parameters failed to simulate the dynamic change process of the bwt of lake erhai bwt simulation values of each parameter group in summer were much lower than the observed data the rmse and ame of the 100 sets of parameters were 5 95 0 46 c and 4 70 0 38 c respectively and the rmse and ame of the best five bwt simulation results were 5 21 0 038 c and 4 08 0 037 c the values for kd beta and cbhe were 0 31 0 0087 m 1 0 30 0 0074 and 0 606 0 11 respectively fig 3d and 3e show the vertical water temperature profile of the simulated results of 100 sets of parameters and observed data of segment 31 in summer june 21 2017 and august 27 2017 the measured data showed a small temperature drop from the surface to the bottom and there was no thermocline in summer the observation of lake erhai by zhu also showed water column mixing in different seasons zhu et al 2017 however the 100 sets of parameters failed to accurately simulate the characteristics of the uniform vertical distribution of water temperature in lake erhai the simulation results of the 100 sets of parameters showed that lake erhai should become stratified in summer the differences are mainly in the bwt and the depths of the epilimnion and metalimnion moreover we plotted seasonal variation of vertical water temperature in segment 31 which was the results of the best bwt simulation parameter set fig 3f under the existing meteorological and inflow boundaries and the parameter set most conducive to the vertical conduction of heat the ce qual w2 simulation results of the deepest central region of lake erhai were typically monomictic in january the temperature of the water column is basically uniform and there is no temperature gradient in the vertical direction as the temperature rises starting in march there is a slight vertical temperature gradient the vertical temperature stratification is stable until october the digestion process of the stratification then becomes obvious in november and the digestion process is basically completed by december the deep lakes on the yungui plateau such as chenghai lake yangzonghai lake and lugu lake which are in the same subtropical monsoon climate zone as lake erhai are warm monomictic lakes the ce qual w2 model in this study can accurately simulate the seasonal changes of water level and swt and the simulation results of vertical water temperature variation are similar to the characteristics of other lakes that present typical warm monomictic processes the simulation results imply that there should be some other important factors that lead to the formation of the particular thermal structure in lake erhai the region of lake erhai located is one of the high temperature hydrothermal systems with magmatic heat sources which is a major part of the mediterranean himalayas geothermal belt chang et al 2021 liao 2018 according to the investigation of fan et al 2015 there are at least 61 hot springs distributed in erhai watershed we speculate that there should be a significant process of heat energy input from the bottom to the water column caused by geothermal heat at the bottom of lake erhai in fact deep mixing induced by heat flux from bottom has been observed in lake katanuma which is a volcanic lake in japan shikano et al 2004 moreover theoretical analysis based on multiple lakes modeling showed that sediments not only serve as seasonal heat storage but also add significant thermal inertia to the water column and apply significant impacts on the thermal structure of lakes fang and stefan 1996 parameters representing sediment water heat exchange are tsed and cbhe the average annual air temperature 14 8 c was used as tsed in the calculation to explore and verify the influence of sediment water heat conduction on the thermal structure of lake erhai tsed was treated as a variable to recalibrate the ce qual w2 model in this study the lower limit of tsed was the annual average temperature 14 8 c and the upper limit was set to 30 c the number of simulation runs was 150 the relationship between 150 sets of parameters and the agreement of the observed data and simulated results of bwt which was represented by the rmse are illustrated in fig 5 a although the relationships between parameters and the rmse are nonlinear in the ce qual w2 model the increase of the tsed value significantly reduced the rmse value of bwt the rmse and ame of the 150 sets of parameters were 4 10 1 51 c and 3 17 1 18 c respectively and only when the tsed was greater than 24 c was the rmse less than 2 c the simulated bwt variation of best five sets of parameters and observed data are shown in fig 5b the rmse and ame of the best five bwt simulation results were 1 35 0 022 c and 1 08 0 019 c respectively in which kd beta tsed and cbhe were 0 33 0 017 m 1 0 32 0 014 29 6 0 37 and 0 88 0 047 respectively each set among the five sets of parameters could reproduce the bwt accurately 4 4 verification of ce qual w2 model to check the robustness of the calibrated ce qual w2 model the model was verified using observed daily water level data and monthly surface water and bottom water temperature data from 2018 the rmse and ame for monitoring station b in the swt validation simulation were 1 27 c and 1 16 c respectively and those in the bwt validation simulation were 1 27 c and 1 06 c respectively in comparison with the calibration values the rmse and ame of swt were slightly higher and those of bwt were slightly lower 5 discussion 5 1 calibration of erhai ce qual w2 model in this study a ce qual w2 was established to identify the decisive process that leads to the specific thermal structure of lake erhai based on a combination of literature values expert knowledge and evaluation of the boundary data used the main parameters to be calibrated in the ce qual w2 model of lake erhai were the extinction coefficient kd and beta which affect the energy transfer and vertical water temperature profile in the water column the simulation results of swt and wl were in good agreement with the measured data and the rmses for swt and wl were close to or lower than those obtained in other recent studies the model also captured the observed seasonal dynamics of swt and wl however the simulation results of bwt were underestimated compared with observed data we analyzed the seasonal variation of the water temperature profile of the best simulation of bwt in the deep basin of lake erhai and found that lake erhai should be a monomictic lake like other deep lakes on the yunnan plateau wind speed and light penetration are thought to be the main factors affecting temperature stratification in lakes to identify the main factor affecting the thermal structure of lake erhai and incorporate ecological understanding of this important process in the recalibration of the erhai ce qual w2 model comparison of the temperature stratification wind speed and light penetration between lake erhai and lake chenghai was conducted lake chenghai is a deep lake lake area 75 8 km2 maximum depth 35 1 m average depth 25 7 m located about 90 km northeast of lake erhai lake chenghai is a typical warm monomictic lake in which the average upper boundary depth of stratification in summer is 15 03 2 58 m zhou et al 2020 the average wind speed in summer june to october over lake chenghai 2 2 m s is slightly larger than that over lake erhai 2 1 m s the ability of light to penetrate the water column declines with increases of water turbidity and water coloration which can be represented by sd sd in summer in lake chenghai 1 56 0 38 m from 2016 to 2017 kaidi et al 2019 is slightly smaller than that of lake erhai 1 61 0 30 m from 2014 to 2018 therefore based on comprehensive consideration of wind speed light penetrating ability and the simulation result of the erhai ce qual w2 model some important underlying process should be in play to induce the distinct thermal structure of lake erhai we hypothesize that geothermal heat exists at the bottom of lake erhai which would transfer heat from the bottom into the water column the erhai ce qual w2 model was recalibrated by tuning the parameter representing heat exchange at the ground water interface tesd as the main parameters of kd beta tsed and cbhe were 0 33 0 017 m 1 0 32 0 014 29 6 0 37 c and 0 88 0 047 respectively the erhai ce qual w2 model can reproduce the seasonal variation of bwt accurately the observed data of swt and bwt during the past 15 years and the erhai ce qual w2 model simulation results presented in this study suggest that the most probable causes for the holomixis of lake erhai are related to geothermal heat transfer from the bottom to the water column 5 2 effects of wind speed and tributary inflows temperature on the thermal structure of erhai lake our analysis showed that heat flux from sediment to water column may play an important role to form the special thermal structure of erhai lake in order to check the robustness of this results we conducted a series of scenarios by changing wind speed and tributary inflows temperature based on our fist calibrated model with the parameters of calibrated values in tab 1 to evaluate the effects of wind speed and or tributary inflows temperature on the thermal structure of erhai lake in these scenarios wind speed was increased by a multiplier of 1 2 with a step of 0 2 and tributary inflows temperature was increased by an additional 0 10 c with a step of 2 c to illustrate stability of the entire water column sahoo et al 2016 but not local stability a widely used the schmidt stability st see supplement schmidt stability equation for the equation idso 1973 read et al 2011 schmidt 1928 was adapted to measure lake resistance to mixing simulated vertical water temperature profiles in segment 31 of different scenarios were used to calculate st the values of st in summer from may to august of different scenarios were compared in fig 6 the results clearly showed that the st decreased with the increase of wind speed however the effect of tributary inflows temperature was very weak moreover with the wind speed increased to 2 0 times of the observed data the st was close to the mean summer st 44 j m2 derived from the recalibrated erhai ce qual w2 model results these scenarios results suggested two critical points first heat fluxes from the tributary inflows are not that influential in forming the thermal structure of lake at least for lake erhai with a residence time greater than three years in fact even in some lakes with short residence time heat fluxes from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget and may only expose a local but not entire effect on the thermal structure of lake munar et al 2019 råman vinnå et al 2017 for example heat fluxes from river inflows are only 5 3 of the effective surface heat flux in lake mirm which is a shallow lake with a residence time of 180 days da silva et al 2019 munar et al 2019 second wind speed has direct and important control on lake thermal structure however for lake erhai an increase of 2 0 times of observed wind speed would be required to prevent the establishment of the thermal stratification typical in summer which is quite inconceivable in fact the daily mean and means of the daily maximum wind speed are 2 35 and 6 58 m s according to the 30 years 1989 2018 of long term meteorological dataset which is provided by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn the historical observed daily mean and means of the daily maximum wind speed are far less than the 2 0 times of the observed wind speed scenario in which the daily mean and means of the daily maximum wind speed are 4 08 and 10 72 m s respectively in the other word such high wind speed has never been recorded in lake erhai 5 3 heat budget of erhai lake our analysis signified that heat from sediment but not external energy from wind and or tributary inflows is the most likely candidate for the special thermal structure of lake erhai to elucidate the energy including external and internal energy required to mix entire water column of lake erhai we quantified two heat budget metrics from simulated vertical water temperature profiles in segment 31of our fist calibrated model with the parameters of calibrated values in tab 1 the st and the birgean work see supplement birgean work equation for the equation birge 1916 idso 1973 of which the birgean work bw is a stability index that quantifies the external energy needed to build up a given thermal stratification in a lake birge 1916 kjensmo 1994 accordingly the sum of st and bw gives an estimation of the energy to keep a lake isothermal during stratified conditions and a heat budget ratio hbr st bw bw can represent the ratio between the amount of energy to maintain homoiothermal conditions in a lake and the actual energy supplied to build up the stratification in summer kjensmo 1994 the daily average values of st and bw showed a short spring mixing period in which a low st value close to zero and followed by a stable summer stratification period fig 7 a the stratification period begins in april and the hbr peaked during this period the summer stratification period had an mean hbr value of 1 12 which demonstrated that an increase of 12 energy input to lake erhai was be needed to prevent the establishment of the simulated typical thermal stratification in the other word except the external energy including the work of wind the effective surface heat flux and heat fluxes from tributary river inflows an additional 12 energy that most likely contributed by heat flux from sediment induce the thermal mixing of lake erhai 5 4 implication for phytoplankton composition and growth it has been increasingly recognized that underwater light gradient and thermal structure which can influence access to nutrient resources are main factors affecting phytoplankton vertical distribution including phytoplankton composition and biomass peak depths in lakes longhi and beisner 2009 in a holomixis lake or a stratified lake with deeper thermocline depth it remains possible that resuspension of deep water directly to the surface and or the exposure of a larger segment of sediments to warmer epilimnetic water which could lead to a dynamic contact between water and sediment and a redistribution of nutrients in lakes weithoff et al 2000 as a consequence the vertical distribution of nutrients in water column could be uniform and light but not nutrients is the limiting factor for phytoplankton in epilimnetion water diehl 2002 models predicted and mesocosm experiments have proved that total epilimnetic phytoplankton biomass responded unimodally to increasing mixed layer depth and after certain depth the phytoplankton biomass decreased with increasing depth owing to the light limitation diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 in the case of lake erhai as a deep holomixis and eutrophic lake with a large mixed layer depth and high nutrient concentration the particular thermal structure could induce the uniform distribution of nutrients in the water column high concentration of dissolved oxygen in the deep layer of water column and that the phytoplankton dynamics may be mainly driven by light but not nutrients monitoring data of the vertical profiles conducted by zhu et al 2017 founded that the distribution of total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and dissolved oxygen do in the water column was uniform and that the bottom of lake erhai was aerobic in all seasons wang et al 2020 proved that light is the key factors driving seasonal congruence of taxonomic and functional diversity of phytoplankton in lake erhai 6 conclusions based on the historical observed data and hydrodynamic simulation our study aimed to determine the main process inducing the particular thermal structure of lake erhai which is deep enough to form summer stratification but is holomictic we used a well established hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 to explore the main process inducing the formation of thermal holomixis in lake erhai the extinction coefficient kd and the fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta were calibrated as the main parameters the simulation results showed that our model performed well in reproducing the water level surface water temperature and their seasonal dynamic processes in lake erhai but the bottom water temperature was not reproduced well the results also indicated that lake erhai should be monomictic like other deep lakes on the yunnan plateau the erhai ce qual w2 model was recalibrated considering the process of bottom water heat exchange which is represented by the parameter tsed in the ce qual w2 model the simulation results showed that only when the tsed was greater than 24 c could the rmse be less than 2 c and with similar values of kd and beta to those used in the first calibration the model could reproduce the bottom water temperature well when the tsed value was 29 6 0 37 c which was much greater than the value estimated from the average annual air temperature 14 8 c used in the first calibration further analysis based on 36 scenarios simulated showed that heat fluxes from the tributary inflows have weak effect on the thermal structure of lake erhai and an increase of 2 0 times of observed wind speed would be required to prevent the establishment of the thermal stratification typical in summer the results presented in this study showed that without the geothermal heat transfer from the bottom to the water column the bottom water temperature of lake erhai would be lower than observed and an additional 12 heat flux from sediment plus the actual external energy supplies sum of the work of wind the effective surface heat flux and heat fluxes from tributary river inflows are required to mix the entire water column of lake erhai the most likely process inducing the holomixis of lake erhai is geothermal heat transfer funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 41961019 credit authorship

4065,the thermal structure of a lake is strongly associated its hydrodynamics and climatic conditions and is an important basis to understand the physical chemical and ecological processes of the lake lake erhai 100 05 100 17 n and 25 36 25 58 e is a large and deep lake in yunnan province located on the yunnan guizhou plateau of southwest china some deep lakes located in areas adjacent to lake erhai with similar climatic conditions and water depths are warm monomictic lakes however the historical data of the surface water temperature and bottom water temperature for the past 15 years 2004 2018 showed small differences 1 c however ours and some other studies on the vertical water temperature profile showed mixing of the entire water column in different seasons we have applied a well established hydrodynamics model ce qual w2 to explore the main process that induces the particular thermal structure of lake erhai model calibration was conducted twice once with the extinction coefficient kd and fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta as the main calibrated parameters and the other considering the process of bottom water heat exchange represented by the sediment temperature tsed parameter in the ce qual w2 model the simulation results showed that the model can reproduce water level and surface water temperature accurately with the first calibration tsed is 14 8 c however only when the tsed is greater than 24 c the rmse can be less than 2 c the model reproduces the bottom water temperature well when the tsed value was 29 6 0 37 c moreover a series of scenarios were conducted to quantify the effect of wind speed and or tributary inflows temperature on the thermal structure of lake erhai and two stability indices schmidt stability birgean work were calculated to quantify the energy required for stratification and mixing these results demonstrated that the most likely process to establish the holomixis of lake erhai is geothermal heat transfer from sediment to water column and an additional 12 heat flux from sediment plus the actual external energy supplies from sediment are required to mix the entire water column of lake erhai in summer keywords thermal mixing lake erhai ce qual w2 geothermal heat 1 introduction most deep lakes especially in temperate regions can experience thermal stratification and cyclic changes within a year during warm seasons the surface waters are heated and have lower density than the deep waters which forms the metalimnion that can decrease the vertical diffusion rate of dissolved substances and cause hydrochemical differentiation of the water column into an oxic epilimnion and an anoxic hypolimninon thus thermal structure especially the mixing duration and stability of stratification can have various abiotic effects with consequences for biological production bueche and vetter 2014 generally lake stratification imposes a heterogeneous abiotic environment e g density temperature nutrient dissolved oxygen and light availability in the vertical water column with the potential to influence the vertical distribution and taxonomic composition of phytoplankton reynolds 1984 multilake observational whole lake manipulated and model simulated studies have supported the critical role of thermal structure especially epilimnion depth and thermocline depth which can alter the nutrients light ratio of nutrient and light and as well as their distribution in stratified water column and or mixed water column for phytoplankton dynamics diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 longhi and beisner 2009 weithoff et al 2000 for example a whole lake manipulated studies in lake lac croche proved that an increase in thermocline depth promoted phytoplankton production attributable mainly to increases in chlorophytes the assessment and analysis of the thermal structure vertical stratification and mixing dynamics of lakes is a necessary basis to understand the evolution of their tropic and ecological statuses fenocchi et al 2017 at a macroscopic scale as the very slow diffusive heat transport on a molecular level and shielded of deeper layers from the solar radiation weather conditions set up the thermal structure of lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 in the same climate zone the difference of the epilimnion thickness for different lakes is mainly determined by lake size and water clarity read et al 2014 rimmer et al 2011 rueda et al 2009 shikano et al 2004 the effect of lake size on the epilimnion thickness reflects the differential effect of wind induced mixing in small vs large lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 read et al 2014 wind stress at the lake surface is considered as a much more efficient heat transport by the kinetic energy and as a decisive factor for epilimnion thickness in nearly all lakes patalas 1984 for example boegman et al 2008 found that surface wind speeds 6 m s are sufficient to vertically mix the water column in lake erie simulation results for lake pääjärvi and lake valkea mustajärvi showed that the thermal stratification of a large lake is more susceptible to wind speed juhani and aija riitta 2011 factors such as colored dissolved organic matter cdom concentration the amount of suspended particles and phytoplankton concentration which affect water clarity and light penetration in water column cam affect epilimnion thickness especially in small lakes or lakes with extremely weak winds heiskanen et al 2015 hocking and straškraba 1999 in addition to the weather conditions lake size and water clarity heat transfer between bottom and water can play an important role affect lake thermal structure in some special lakes for example in some crater lakes the volcanic heat supply from the lake bottom also affects thermal stratification and causes deep mixing with a small water temperature difference between the epilimnion and hypolimnion during the stratification period crawford and collier 1997 shikano et al 2004 different methods have been proposed to study the thermal structure of lakes including monitoring a combination of monitoring and statistical methods davies colley 1988 rimmer et al 2011 shikano et al 2004 and advanced mechanistic models based on momentum equations boegman et al 2008 bueche and vetter 2014 noori et al 2015 because of the dynamic variation and compound factors influencing the thermal structure of lakes monitoring or a combination of monitoring and statistical methods is useful to investigate these phenomena but cannot easily identify the dominant process driving the variation of the thermal structure of a lake mechanistic models for assessing surface water temperature rise and vertical water temperature stratification in lakes have been widely applied dong et al 2020 mechanistic models once properly validated can be used to assess the effects of different scenarios and are a source of information on the driving processes and global dynamics of the studied systems they have been applied as an analytical tool to identify the main processes and mechanisms inducing variations of the thermal structure of lakes fenocchi et al 2017 hocking and straškraba 1999 read et al 2014 rimmer et al 2011 schwefel et al 2016 to understand thermal structure dynamics and to predict the thermal responses of lakes to climate change for example heiskanen et al 2015 used two one dimensional models lake and flake in lake kuivajärvi to evaluate the effects of water clarity on lake stratification bueche and vetter 2014 applied the one dimensional hydrodynamic lake model dynamic reservoir simulation model to evaluate the effect of climate change on annual stratification cycle of lake ammersee lake erhai is one of the plateau lakes of the yunnan plateau yp it is an eutrophic lake with concentration of chlorophyll a of 13 33 μg l and with a peak value exceeding 30 μg l wang et al 2020 observed data of surface water temperature swt and bottom water temperature bwt in the past 15 years and several measurements of vertical water temperatures profiles zhu et al 2017 showed entire water column mixing in different season in lake erhai however some deep lakes in yunnan plateau such as lake chenghai and lake yangzonghai located in areas adjacent to lake erhai with similar climatic conditions and similar water depths are both warm monomictic lakes lu et al 2017 yuan et al 2014 moreover according to a widely used empirical regression relating epilimnion thickness with lake area zepi 4 6a 0 205 in which zepi is the thickness of the epilimnion and a is the area of the lake surface in the deep basin of lake erhai in mid summer the mixing depth should be 14 8 m and there should be at least two layers in summer the epilimnion and thermocline therefore the cause of the holomixis of lake erhai is an interesting problem and also important to understand the physical chemical and ecological processes in this lake especially the phytoplankton dynamics in this study we applied the hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 wells 2019a which has been tested extensively in previous studies including detailed validations across a spectrum of lake contexts and proven to efficiently reproduce the thermal regimes of lakes cole 2000 to identify the main process that induce the special thermal structure of lake erhai 2 study area and data lake erhai is located in the yunnan guizhou plateau southwest china at 100 05 100 17 n and 25 36 25 58 e as shown in fig 1 at a surface elevation of 1966 m lake erhai has a surface area of 247 42 km2 a volume of 29 59 108 m3 a maximum depth of 21 3 m and an average depth of 10 8 m lake erhai is 42 5 km long from north to south and averages 5 9 km in width from east to west the catchment area of the lake is 2565 km2 there are 117 tributary inflows and one outflow river of the erhai basin the main inflow is the miju river with a mean annual discharge of 11 32 m3 s a secondary inflow is the boluojiang river with a mean annual discharge of 2 44 m3 s tertiary inflows are the luoshijiang river with a mean annual discharge of 1 49 m3 s and the yonganjiang river with a mean annual discharge of 0 82 m3 s all remaining tributaries have mean annual discharges of 0 5 m3 s the only outflowing river is the xier river with a mean annual discharge of 28 21 m3 s the theoretical water renewal time for such outflow is tr 3 33 years annual water level variation over 2000 2018 was 1 57 m which was controlled by the xierhe gate the average annual rainfall evaporation air temperature and wind speed of the erhai basin are 997 mm 1 245 mm 15 1 c and 2 6 m s respectively from 2004 to 2018 water samples were collected on a monthly basis from four sampling sites a depth of the water column 13 m b depth of the water column 21 5 m c depth of the water column 18 m d depth of the water column 9 m with two column depths 0 5 m below the water surface and 0 5 m above the bottom by the dali county environmental monitoring center who operated a routine water quality monitoring program three indicators were used for analysis and ce qual w2 model calibration and validation water transparency secchi disk depth sd surface water temperature swt and bottom water temperature bwt additionally vertical water temperature profiles were measured using a multi parameter water quality sonde ysi eds 6600 v2 brannum lane oh usa at site b on june 21 2017 and august 27 2017 3 methods 3 1 method description the parameters that affect hydrodynamics and or water temperature have clear physical meanings or relate to some process so successful calibration and validation of the model can be used to analyze the thermal structure in different season thoroughly further an analysis of the simulated results of modification of input parameters ensures that it is possible to identify the main process or factor that lead to the special thermal structure of lake erhai and simultaneously gives the opportunity to examine the simulated changes considering the impact of specific input parameters in order to identify the main process that lead to the special thermal structure of lake erhai we firstly analyzed the long term characteristic of swt bwt and main meteorological factors and then simulated the hydrodynamics process using ce qual w2 model on this basis main parameters that may influence thermal structure of lake erhai were calibrated using random sampling method finally analysis of the simulated results of modification of input parameters were conducted to identify the main process that influence special thermal structure of lake erhai 3 2 model setup the ce qual w2 model is suitable for relatively long and narrow waterbodies exhibiting longitudinal and vertical water quality gradients such as lake erhai which has an aspect ratio of 6 74 in addition because the main objective of this study was to explore the influences of various factors on the vertical thermal mixing of lake erhai ce qual w2 is suitable for this study the computational domain for ce qual w2 was constructed using a 5 m resolution bathymetric survey by the dali environmental protection bureau conducted in 2003 lake erhai domain was discretized into 85 segments 325 m to 845 m in length north to south fig 1b each segment was vertically discretized to 0 25 m thick layers the maximum depth consisted of 90 segments in the vertical direction the total number of active grid cells was 5348 at the elevation of the water surface of 1966 m the volumes of the model grid and the measured bathymetry were 27 67 108 m3 and 27 94 108 m3 and the areas of the model grid and the measured bathymetry were 240 96 km2 and 247 42 km2 respectively the volume and area errors were 0 97 and 2 61 respectively the grid of the model accurately reflected the water level volume area relationship and topographic characteristics of lake erhai fig 1b 3 3 boundary conditions the horizontal and surface boundary conditions in the model represent the external driving forces affecting the lake dynamics the boundary conditions for simulation of hydrodynamics using the ce qual w2 model included hydrological boundary conditions which consisted of tributary inflow rates associated temperature and outflow rates and meteorological surface boundary conditions tributary inflows and associated temperature data were taken from the results of the calibrated loading simulation program in c lspc model tech 2009 they consist of the hydrological data of five years from 2014 to 2018 the time step of the hydrological inflows and associated temperature data was 1 day some smaller tributaries were merged and generalized in the lspc model of the erhai catchment the tributaries were generalized from 117 to 63 the outflow boundary conditions included three outflows the main one was the xier river for which daily hydrological data were collected by the dali water conservancy bureau the second was water transferred from lake erhai to binchuan county and the third was water drawn from lake erhai for drinking water supply atmospheric boundary conditions included hourly data of air temperature dew point temperature wind speed and direction cloud cover solar radiation and precipitation meteorological data including hourly data of air temperature wind speed and direction relative humidity and precipitation were taken from the dali meteorological station mt in fig 1a which is a chinese national meteorological basic station the station is located 700 m offshore 100 18 n 25 7 e at an elevation of 1990 5 m we calculated the dew point temperature based on an empirical formula using air temperature and relative humidity xu et al 2016 hourly data of cloud cover and solar radiation were obtained from the tengchong meteorological station which is located 180 km north of lake erhai 98 3 n 24 59 e 3 4 model calibration method 3 4 1 latin hypercube sampling latin hypercube sampling lhs is a stratified sampling method introduced by mckay et al 2000 that provides an efficient approach for sampling variables from their multivariate distributions the application of lhs to calibrate the ce qual w2 model in this study can be summarized into two steps of stratified sampling and evaluation of the model the first step is that k variables to be calibrated x 1 x 2 xk are divided into n equally probable intervals one value is selected at random from each interval the n values obtained for each variable are then paired with each other which finally results in n combinations of k variables the number of sample n is a key factor influencing the accuracy of lhs however there are no firm criteria or rules available for choosing n mckay 1988 suggested that a number of simulation runs n equal to twice the number of the parameters calibrated k might provide a good balance of accuracy and computational cost for model runs iman and helton 1988 indicated that a choice of n equal to 4 3 times the number of the parameters calibrated k usually gave satisfactory results some studies used greater values of n to achieve the optimal realization for analyzing the model parameters and simulation results aalderink et al 1996 li et al 2015 xu et al 2005 li et al 2015 found that the sample mean and variance stabilized well after 150 simulation runs for 10 variables of the efdc hydrodynamic model aalderink et al 1996 used 50 simulation runs of the duflow model to analyze the input uncertainty xu et al 2005 applied the lhs method to geostatistical modeling to evaluate the uncertainty of spatial models using a sampling number of 50 based on the previous research and model calculation costs in this study a sampling number of 50 times the number of parameters calibrated was taken after sampling each sample set was supplied to the model as input to create a sequence of model simulation results water level wl swt and bwt were chosen as the hydrodynamic output targets for the calibration assessments the absolute mean error ame and root mean square error rmse indices were used to assess the agreement between simulation results and observed data 3 4 2 model parameters to be calibrated based on the previous studies and literature on the ce qual w2 hydrodynamic model afshar et al 2011 boegman et al 2008 bonalumi et al 2012 cole 2000 noori et al 2015 wells 2019 the main parameters related to hydrodynamic processes include longitudinal eddy viscosity ax longitudinal eddy diffusivity dx fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta light extinction coefficient for pure water named exh2o in ce qual w2 but we use the common notation kd the wind sheltering coefficient wsc sediment temperature tsed and coefficient of bottom heat exchange cbhe ax and dx mainly specify dispersion of momentum heat and constituents in the longitudinal axis and have little effect on vertical heat dispersion previous studies indicated that the default values of these two parameters can accurately reproduce the thermal regimes of reservoirs cole 2000 in this study we used the default values of these two parameters the wind sheltering coefficient is a parameter to specify the effect of sheltering on wind speed which was used to multiply observed wind speed measurements to decrease the effective wind reaching the lake surface previous studies have shown that a smaller lake area is associated with a greater sheltering effect especially for lakes with areas of less than 1 km2 markfort et al 2010 cole 2000 indicated that absence of meteorological data especially wind data collected at the water body site was the largest contributor to errors between measured and computed temperatures in this study the area of lake erhai is 247 42 km2 and the data of wind speed and wind direction were obtained from the dali meteorological station which is located 700 m offshore thus we used the default value of wsc which is 1 0 the light extinction coefficient kd is an important parameter that affects the vertical exchange of heat and directly determines the ability of short wave solar radiation to penetrate the water layer fenocchi et al 2017 a smaller light extinction coefficient is associated with greater short wave solar radiation penetration ability and greater mixing depth therefore proper calibration of the light extinction coefficient is essential to simulate thermal structure especially vertical stratification and mixing because the model constructed in this study only simulated the hydrodynamic processes the light extinction coefficient of pure water was used in the model to comprehensively characterize the light extinction coefficient of water the suggested default value of kd is 0 45 m 1 when only temperature is being simulated wells 2019 some studies based on parameter calibration used lower light extinction coefficients for the deep lake maggiore lake area 213 km2 maximum water depth 370 m sd 7 24 2 96 m and the one dimensional vl tf model a calibrated light extinction coefficient equal to 0 185 m 1 was reported by fenocchi et al 2017 according to the standard linear model used to relate the light extinction coefficient and sd proposed by poole and atkins 1929 and some more accurate non linear relations between sd and the light extinction coefficient tilzer 1988 sd is negatively correlated with the light extinction coefficient in this study the mean measured sd from 2004 to 2018 was 2 02 m in lake erhai which is a higher light extinction coefficient than that of lake maggiore moreover as hocking and straškraba pointed out 1999 the dependence of the thermal structure on the light extinction coefficient is highest at 0 5 m 1 because above this value the sunlight is absorbed near the surface combining the above factors we applied a value range of 0 3 0 5 m 1 in the calibration the fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta represents solar radiation absorbed at the surface the suggested default value of beta is 0 45 and the value range in previous studies is 0 25 0 7 wells 2019a the relationship between beta and the light extinction coefficient studied in 29 lakes and reservoirs showed a positive correlation as below beta 0 265 ln λ 0 614 in which λ is the light extinction coefficient of water williams et al 1981 we applied this relationship to calculate beta based on the light extinction coefficient during sampling and simulation sediment temperature tsed and the coefficient of bottom heat exchange cbhe represent the heat exchange at the ground water interface generally tsed is estimated from the average annual air temperature at the study site wells 2019b based on the average annual air temperature records of the dali meteorological station in the period of 2014 to 2017 the value of tsed was applied as 14 8 c the default value of cbhe is 0 3 and we applied a value range of 0 3 1 0 in the calibration the values value ranges of parameters discussed above for temperature simulation and calibration in lake erhai by the ce qual w2 model are shown in table 1 4 results 4 1 characteristics of water temperature first we analyzed the seasonal variations of swt bwt temperature difference between surface water temperature and bottom water temperature dwt wd daily air temperature at and wind speed ws from 2004 to 2018 fig 2 a among the four monitoring stations the multi year averages of swt bwt and dwt at station a were 18 5 4 6 c 17 6 4 6 c and 0 86 0 62 c respectively the multi year averages of swt bwt and dwt at station b were 18 5 4

swt bwt and dwt at station d were 16 3 4 2 c 15 7 4 2 c and 0 68 0 58 c respectively the average dwt values of the four monitoring stations were less than 1 c in addition station b had the greatest water depth as well as the deepest basin of lake erhai from 2004 to 2018 monitoring station b had a maximum water depth of 21 85 m a minimum water depth of 19 35 m and an average water depth of 20 92 0 5 m thus the shallow and deep water areas of the entire lake showed obvious mixing of the water column during the annual change of dwt the numbers of observations of dwt greater than 2 c at monitoring stations a b c and d were 8 times 9 times 6 times and 6 times respectively the maximum value of dwt was observed at monitoring station b on december 5 2012 on that day dwt at swt bwt and ws were 4 7 c 8 4 c 15 5 c 10 8 c and 1 7 m s respectively and the water depth was 21 35 m fig 2b shows the dwt statistics of four monitoring stations in different seasons the results show that the dwt values of monitoring station a in spring summer autumn and winter were 0 94 0 81 c 0 87 0 52 c 0 81 0 51 c and 0 89 0 70 c respectively the dwt values of monitoring station b in spring summer autumn and winter were 1 08 0 78 c 0 76 0 52 c 0 75 0 32 c and 1 25 1 46 c respectively the dwt values of monitoring station c in spring summer autumn and winter were 0 65 0 5 c 0 80 0 69 c 0 54 0 41 c and 0 63 0 66 c respectively and the dwt values of monitoring station d in spring summer autumn and winter were 0 72 0 67 c 0 53 0 41 c 0 70 0 50 c and 0 77 0 73 c respectively 4 2 calibration of water balance and surface water temperature to explore the dominant factors of the vertical water temperature distribution characteristics of lake erhai the bathymetry and boundary conditions should accurately represent lake erhai which indicates that the main hydrodynamic processes and surface water temperature must be calibrated as described above there are three main parameters to be calibrated including kd beta and cbhe of which beta is calculated based on an empirical formula between kd and beta therefore the number of simulation runs was 100 the minimum and maximum time step of the model simulation were adapted to be 10 s and 30 s respectively based on the observed daily water level data we conducted a calibration of the water balance of lake erhai the daily water level diagram of measurements and results simulated by the erhai ce qual w2 model under 100 sets of parameters is shown in fig 3 a the results indicate that the water levels simulated by the ce qual w2 model accurately reproduced the process of water level decline caused by decreased incoming water and large irrigation water consumption in winter and spring and the process of rising water level caused by runoff input in summer and autumn the rmse and ame of the 100 sets of parameters are 0 084 0 0019 m and 0 069 0 0018 m respectively the difference of water level simulated by the ce qual w2 model among the 100 sets of parameters was very small and the main reason for that difference was the difference of the parameter beta which represents solar radiation absorbed at the surface i e when this parameter is larger the short wave radiation absorbed by the surface water is greater which causes the surface water temperature and evaporation to increase fig 4 accurate water balance simulation laid the foundation for the simulation of the thermodynamic process of lake erhai because segment 31 where monitoring station b is located is at the deepest part of lake erhai and the middle of the water body it can comprehensively represent the horizontal and vertical thermodynamic processes in lake erhai therefore the observed data of monitoring station b were mainly used to analyze the agreement between the observed data and simulated results of the ce qual w2 model as the water level has a certain amplitude during a given year the surface active grid changes with the change of the water level and the surface water temperature was measured at a depth of 0 5 m underwater therefore the simulated result of surface water was not a fixed grid in segment 31 but a third active grid the monthly observed data and daily simulated results of surface water temperature of segment 31 from 2014 to 2017 are shown in fig 3b these results show that the 100 sets of parameters can accurately simulate the seasonal dynamic change of swt from january to august the swt of lake erhai rises sharply with the coaction of radiant heat energy and atmospheric heat energy the rmse and ame of the 100 sets of parameters were 1 22 0 046 c and 0 95 0 029 c respectively there was no significant difference in the simulation results between the parameter sets swt is the result of water gas heat exchange and balance under the combined effects of internal and external factors such as solar radiation atmospheric reverse radiation wind and latent heat of evaporation the wl and swt simulation results showed that the ce qual w2 model constructed in this study can accurately reflect the process of heat exchange between lake erhai and the atmosphere in addition it showed that the meteorological boundary conditions such as air temperature and wind speed in the model and the boundary conditions of inflow and outflow were reliable and accurate 4 3 calibration of bottom water temperature the monthly observed data and daily simulation results of bwt at segment 31 from 2014 to 2017 are illustrated in fig 3c compared with the accurate simulation results of swt the 100 sets of parameters failed to simulate the dynamic change process of the bwt of lake erhai bwt simulation values of each parameter group in summer were much lower than the observed data the rmse and ame of the 100 sets of parameters were 5 95 0 46 c and 4 70 0 38 c respectively and the rmse and ame of the best five bwt simulation results were 5 21 0 038 c and 4 08 0 037 c the values for kd beta and cbhe were 0 31 0 0087 m 1 0 30 0 0074 and 0 606 0 11 respectively fig 3d and 3e show the vertical water temperature profile of the simulated results of 100 sets of parameters and observed data of segment 31 in summer june 21 2017 and august 27 2017 the measured data showed a small temperature drop from the surface to the bottom and there was no thermocline in summer the observation of lake erhai by zhu also showed water column mixing in different seasons zhu et al 2017 however the 100 sets of parameters failed to accurately simulate the characteristics of the uniform vertical distribution of water temperature in lake erhai the simulation results of the 100 sets of parameters showed that lake erhai should become stratified in summer the differences are mainly in the bwt and the depths of the epilimnion and metalimnion moreover we plotted seasonal variation of vertical water temperature in segment 31 which was the results of the best bwt simulation parameter set fig 3f under the existing meteorological and inflow boundaries and the parameter set most conducive to the vertical conduction of heat the ce qual w2 simulation results of the deepest central region of lake erhai were typically monomictic in january the temperature of the water column is basically uniform and there is no temperature gradient in the vertical direction as the temperature rises starting in march there is a slight vertical temperature gradient the vertical temperature stratification is stable until october the digestion process of the stratification then becomes obvious in november and the digestion process is basically completed by december the deep lakes on the yungui plateau such as chenghai lake yangzonghai lake and lugu lake which are in the same subtropical monsoon climate zone as lake erhai are warm monomictic lakes the ce qual w2 model in this study can accurately simulate the seasonal changes of water level and swt and the simulation results of vertical water temperature variation are similar to the characteristics of other lakes that present typical warm monomictic processes the simulation results imply that there should be some other important factors that lead to the formation of the particular thermal structure in lake erhai the region of lake erhai located is one of the high temperature hydrothermal systems with magmatic heat sources which is a major part of the mediterranean himalayas geothermal belt chang et al 2021 liao 2018 according to the investigation of fan et al 2015 there are at least 61 hot springs distributed in erhai watershed we speculate that there should be a significant process of heat energy input from the bottom to the water column caused by geothermal heat at the bottom of lake erhai in fact deep mixing induced by heat flux from bottom has been observed in lake katanuma which is a volcanic lake in japan shikano et al 2004 moreover theoretical analysis based on multiple lakes modeling showed that sediments not only serve as seasonal heat storage but also add significant thermal inertia to the water column and apply significant impacts on the thermal structure of lakes fang and stefan 1996 parameters representing sediment water heat exchange are tsed and cbhe the average annual air temperature 14 8 c was used as tsed in the calculation to explore and verify the influence of sediment water heat conduction on the thermal structure of lake erhai tsed was treated as a variable to recalibrate the ce qual w2 model in this study the lower limit of tsed was the annual average temperature 14 8 c and the upper limit was set to 30 c the number of simulation runs was 150 the relationship between 150 sets of parameters and the agreement of the observed data and simulated results of bwt which was represented by the rmse are illustrated in fig 5 a although the relationships between parameters and the rmse are nonlinear in the ce qual w2 model the increase of the tsed value significantly reduced the rmse value of bwt the rmse and ame of the 150 sets of parameters were 4 10 1 51 c and 3 17 1 18 c respectively and only when the tsed was greater than 24 c was the rmse less than 2 c the simulated bwt variation of best five sets of parameters and observed data are shown in fig 5b the rmse and ame of the best five bwt simulation results were 1 35 0 022 c and 1 08 0 019 c respectively in which kd beta tsed and cbhe were 0 33 0 017 m 1 0 32 0 014 29 6 0 37 and 0 88 0 047 respectively each set among the five sets of parameters could reproduce the bwt accurately 4 4 verification of ce qual w2 model to check the robustness of the calibrated ce qual w2 model the model was verified using observed daily water level data and monthly surface water and bottom water temperature data from 2018 the rmse and ame for monitoring station b in the swt validation simulation were 1 27 c and 1 16 c respectively and those in the bwt validation simulation were 1 27 c and 1 06 c respectively in comparison with the calibration values the rmse and ame of swt were slightly higher and those of bwt were slightly lower 5 discussion 5 1 calibration of erhai ce qual w2 model in this study a ce qual w2 was established to identify the decisive process that leads to the specific thermal structure of lake erhai based on a combination of literature values expert knowledge and evaluation of the boundary data used the main parameters to be calibrated in the ce qual w2 model of lake erhai were the extinction coefficient kd and beta which affect the energy transfer and vertical water temperature profile in the water column the simulation results of swt and wl were in good agreement with the measured data and the rmses for swt and wl were close to or lower than those obtained in other recent studies the model also captured the observed seasonal dynamics of swt and wl however the simulation results of bwt were underestimated compared with observed data we analyzed the seasonal variation of the water temperature profile of the best simulation of bwt in the deep basin of lake erhai and found that lake erhai should be a monomictic lake like other deep lakes on the yunnan plateau wind speed and light penetration are thought to be the main factors affecting temperature stratification in lakes to identify the main factor affecting the thermal structure of lake erhai and incorporate ecological understanding of this important process in the recalibration of the erhai ce qual w2 model comparison of the temperature stratification wind speed and light penetration between lake erhai and lake chenghai was conducted lake chenghai is a deep lake lake area 75 8 km2 maximum depth 35 1 m average depth 25 7 m located about 90 km northeast of lake erhai lake chenghai is a typical warm monomictic lake in which the average upper boundary depth of stratification in summer is 15 03 2 58 m zhou et al 2020 the average wind speed in summer june to october over lake chenghai 2 2 m s is slightly larger than that over lake erhai 2 1 m s the ability of light to penetrate the water column declines with increases of water turbidity and water coloration which can be represented by sd sd in summer in lake chenghai 1 56 0 38 m from 2016 to 2017 kaidi et al 2019 is slightly smaller than that of lake erhai 1 61 0 30 m from 2014 to 2018 therefore based on comprehensive consideration of wind speed light penetrating ability and the simulation result of the erhai ce qual w2 model some important underlying process should be in play to induce the distinct thermal structure of lake erhai we hypothesize that geothermal heat exists at the bottom of lake erhai which would transfer heat from the bottom into the water column the erhai ce qual w2 model was recalibrated by tuning the parameter representing heat exchange at the ground water interface tesd as the main parameters of kd beta tsed and cbhe were 0 33 0 017 m 1 0 32 0 014 29 6 0 37 c and 0 88 0 047 respectively the erhai ce qual w2 model can reproduce the seasonal variation of bwt accurately the observed data of swt and bwt during the past 15 years and the erhai ce qual w2 model simulation results presented in this study suggest that the most probable causes for the holomixis of lake erhai are related to geothermal heat transfer from the bottom to the water column 5 2 effects of wind speed and tributary inflows temperature on the thermal structure of erhai lake our analysis showed that heat flux from sediment to water column may play an important role to form the special thermal structure of erhai lake in order to check the robustness of this results we conducted a series of scenarios by changing wind speed and tributary inflows temperature based on our fist calibrated model with the parameters of calibrated values in tab 1 to evaluate the effects of wind speed and or tributary inflows temperature on the thermal structure of erhai lake in these scenarios wind speed was increased by a multiplier of 1 2 with a step of 0 2 and tributary inflows temperature was increased by an additional 0 10 c with a step of 2 c to illustrate stability of the entire water column sahoo et al 2016 but not local stability a widely used the schmidt stability st see supplement schmidt stability equation for the equation idso 1973 read et al 2011 schmidt 1928 was adapted to measure lake resistance to mixing simulated vertical water temperature profiles in segment 31 of different scenarios were used to calculate st the values of st in summer from may to august of different scenarios were compared in fig 6 the results clearly showed that the st decreased with the increase of wind speed however the effect of tributary inflows temperature was very weak moreover with the wind speed increased to 2 0 times of the observed data the st was close to the mean summer st 44 j m2 derived from the recalibrated erhai ce qual w2 model results these scenarios results suggested two critical points first heat fluxes from the tributary inflows are not that influential in forming the thermal structure of lake at least for lake erhai with a residence time greater than three years in fact even in some lakes with short residence time heat fluxes from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget and may only expose a local but not entire effect on the thermal structure of lake munar et al 2019 råman vinnå et al 2017 for example heat fluxes from river inflows are only 5 3 of the effective surface heat flux in lake mirm which is a shallow lake with a residence time of 180 days da silva et al 2019 munar et al 2019 second wind speed has direct and important control on lake thermal structure however for lake erhai an increase of 2 0 times of observed wind speed would be required to prevent the establishment of the thermal stratification typical in summer which is quite inconceivable in fact the daily mean and means of the daily maximum wind speed are 2 35 and 6 58 m s according to the 30 years 1989 2018 of long term meteorological dataset which is provided by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn the historical observed daily mean and means of the daily maximum wind speed are far less than the 2 0 times of the observed wind speed scenario in which the daily mean and means of the daily maximum wind speed are 4 08 and 10 72 m s respectively in the other word such high wind speed has never been recorded in lake erhai 5 3 heat budget of erhai lake our analysis signified that heat from sediment but not external energy from wind and or tributary inflows is the most likely candidate for the special thermal structure of lake erhai to elucidate the energy including external and internal energy required to mix entire water column of lake erhai we quantified two heat budget metrics from simulated vertical water temperature profiles in segment 31of our fist calibrated model with the parameters of calibrated values in tab 1 the st and the birgean work see supplement birgean work equation for the equation birge 1916 idso 1973 of which the birgean work bw is a stability index that quantifies the external energy needed to build up a given thermal stratification in a lake birge 1916 kjensmo 1994 accordingly the sum of st and bw gives an estimation of the energy to keep a lake isothermal during stratified conditions and a heat budget ratio hbr st bw bw can represent the ratio between the amount of energy to maintain homoiothermal conditions in a lake and the actual energy supplied to build up the stratification in summer kjensmo 1994 the daily average values of st and bw showed a short spring mixing period in which a low st value close to zero and followed by a stable summer stratification period fig 7 a the stratification period begins in april and the hbr peaked during this period the summer stratification period had an mean hbr value of 1 12 which demonstrated that an increase of 12 energy input to lake erhai was be needed to prevent the establishment of the simulated typical thermal stratification in the other word except the external energy including the work of wind the effective surface heat flux and heat fluxes from tributary river inflows an additional 12 energy that most likely contributed by heat flux from sediment induce the thermal mixing of lake erhai 5 4 implication for phytoplankton composition and growth it has been increasingly recognized that underwater light gradient and thermal structure which can influence access to nutrient resources are main factors affecting phytoplankton vertical distribution including phytoplankton composition and biomass peak depths in lakes longhi and beisner 2009 in a holomixis lake or a stratified lake with deeper thermocline depth it remains possible that resuspension of deep water directly to the surface and or the exposure of a larger segment of sediments to warmer epilimnetic water which could lead to a dynamic contact between water and sediment and a redistribution of nutrients in lakes weithoff et al 2000 as a consequence the vertical distribution of nutrients in water column could be uniform and light but not nutrients is the limiting factor for phytoplankton in epilimnetion water diehl 2002 models predicted and mesocosm experiments have proved that total epilimnetic phytoplankton biomass responded unimodally to increasing mixed layer depth and after certain depth the phytoplankton biomass decreased with increasing depth owing to the light limitation diehl 2002 diehl et al 2002 in the case of lake erhai as a deep holomixis and eutrophic lake with a large mixed layer depth and high nutrient concentration the particular thermal structure could induce the uniform distribution of nutrients in the water column high concentration of dissolved oxygen in the deep layer of water column and that the phytoplankton dynamics may be mainly driven by light but not nutrients monitoring data of the vertical profiles conducted by zhu et al 2017 founded that the distribution of total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and dissolved oxygen do in the water column was uniform and that the bottom of lake erhai was aerobic in all seasons wang et al 2020 proved that light is the key factors driving seasonal congruence of taxonomic and functional diversity of phytoplankton in lake erhai 6 conclusions based on the historical observed data and hydrodynamic simulation our study aimed to determine the main process inducing the particular thermal structure of lake erhai which is deep enough to form summer stratification but is holomictic we used a well established hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 to explore the main process inducing the formation of thermal holomixis in lake erhai the extinction coefficient kd and the fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta were calibrated as the main parameters the simulation results showed that our model performed well in reproducing the water level surface water temperature and their seasonal dynamic processes in lake erhai but the bottom water temperature was not reproduced well the results also indicated that lake erhai should be monomictic like other deep lakes on the yunnan plateau the erhai ce qual w2 model was recalibrated considering the process of bottom water heat exchange which is represented by the parameter tsed in the ce qual w2 model the simulation results showed that only when the tsed was greater than 24 c could the rmse be less than 2 c and with similar values of kd and beta to those used in the first calibration the model could reproduce the bottom water temperature well when the tsed value was 29 6 0 37 c which was much greater than the value estimated from the average annual air temperature 14 8 c used in the first calibration further analysis based on 36 scenarios simulated showed that heat fluxes from the tributary inflows have weak effect on the thermal structure of lake erhai and an increase of 2 0 times of observed wind speed would be required to prevent the establishment of the thermal stratification typical in summer the results presented in this study showed that without the geothermal heat transfer from the bottom to the water column the bottom water temperature of lake erhai would be lower than observed and an additional 12 heat flux from sediment plus the actual external energy supplies sum of the work of wind the effective surface heat flux and heat fluxes from tributary river inflows are required to mix the entire water column of lake erhai the most likely process inducing the holomixis of lake erhai is geothermal heat transfer funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 41961019 credit authorship

4066,the propagation of meteorological drought in the hydrological cycle not only leads to the deficits of surface soil moisture which results in agricultural drought but also probably affects groundwater to trigger groundwater drought improving the understanding about the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts is necessary to lessen the risks resulted from them moreover the distinction of the correlation and propagation over the basins with different climate conditions is not yet sufficiently understood as a case study of the humid and arid semi arid basins in china the standardized precipitation index the standardized soil moisture index and groundwater drought index based on grace gravity recovery and climate experiment are used to characterize meteorological agricultural and groundwater drought respectively over the yangtze river basin with a humid climate condition and yellow river basin with an arid semi arid climate condition the spearman rank correlation coefficient is applied to investigate the correlation and propagation among the above three types of drought in the two basins the results indicated that 1 the meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the yangtze river basin and the meteorological and agricultural droughts in the yellow river basin are decreasing from april 2002 to march 2020 while the groundwater drought in the yellow river basin is aggravating in recent years 2 there is a strong link between meteorological and agricultural droughts and the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in summer and autumn is shorter than that in winter and spring in the two basins when comparing the propagation time in the two selected basins it is longer in the yangtze river basin 3 groundwater extraction may be the main factor in the aggravation of groundwater drought in the two basins which is different from the contributors to agricultural drought which is mainly the propagation of meteorological drought keywords meteorological drought agricultural drought groundwater drought drought propagation climate condition 1 introduction drought is one of the major and serious natural hazards with the characteristics of high frequency long duration and a wide range of influences hao and singh 2015 mishra and singh 2011 vicente serrano et al 2010 the damages and losses caused by drought in the fields of economy and environment are severe e g crop losses degradation and desertification urban water supply shortages forest fires etc huang et al 2017 in general drought is related to the variables of the hydrological cycle and could be classified into corresponding four types meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought mainly refers to streamflow drought and groundwater drought mishra and singh 2010 the combined effects of these types of droughts on society develop socio economic drought pathak and dodamani 2021 some studies categorized streamflow drought and groundwater drought as hydrological drought which is ambiguous in the specific study about streamflow drought or groundwater drought bloomfield et al 2015 van loon 2015 van loon and laaha 2015 most recent studies pointed out that groundwater drought is a distinctive class of drought which is the result of the decrease in groundwater recharge han et al 2019 li and rodell 2015 mishra and singh 2010 therefore the groundwater drought is regarded as a distinctive class of drought in this study in order to distinguish it from the general hydrological drought namely streamflow drought different types of droughts are inter related through interactions within the water cycle van loon and laaha 2015 therefore investigating the correlation and propagation among different types of droughts is of great significance for drought warning and disaster control there are a few studies investigating the mechanisms of drought propagation in recent years however most of them are concentrated on the linkage between meteorological and agricultural droughts behrang manesh et al 2019 huang et al 2015 li et al 2020b or meteorological and streamflow droughts ding et al 2021 guo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 as noted by mishra and singh 2010 that groundwater drought has not been formally included in the classification of droughts in most previous studies although mishra and singh 2010 proposed that groundwater drought should be considered as a distinctive type of drought studies focused on groundwater drought and especially the association between groundwater drought and other types of drought are less than the studies about other types of drought feng et al 2020 hellwig et al 2020 soleimani motlagh et al 2017 to date the limited studies involved groundwater drought propagation mostly focused on the linkage between groundwater drought and one other type of drought which mainly is meteorological drought han et al 2021 han et al 2019 liu et al 2016 wossenyeleh et al 2021 and they do not consider the difference of drought propagation under different climate conditions as we know soil plays an important role in the process of infiltration therefore the occurrence of agricultural drought probably reduces the recharge of groundwater which may trigger groundwater drought therefore analyzing the linkage among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts is supposed to attract our attention additionally ding et al 2021 indicated that drought propagation is expected to show different strengths in different climate regions hence it is of great importance to figure out the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts over the basins with different climate conditions which is critical to reduce the risks resulted from droughts one reason for limiting investigation about groundwater drought in most regions is the scarcity of systematic and high resolution groundwater observations han et al 2021 han et al 2019 traditional groundwater monitoring is mostly based on groundwater wells however it is rarely available due to the cost associated with drilling and maintaining monitoring wells moreover the regions where groundwater measurements are available often without digitized and centralized datasets or are withheld from the public due to political considerations feng et al 2013 li et al 2019 in addition well observations are often limited in spatial coverage and may have discontinuous and or short records making them unsuitable for drought monitoring with the rapid development of earth observation based on remote sensing technology the original groundwater monitoring method based on well can be improved to achieve large scale groundwater assessment at the regional scale gravity recovery and climate experiment grace time variable gravity observation satellite provides a new and valuable way to fill the gap in data availability and groundwater monitoring tapley et al 2004 groundwater storage anomaly gwsa derived from grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa has been gradually used to evaluate groundwater drought in recent years thomas et al 2017 developed a groundwater drought index based on grace gwsa namely ggdi grace groundwater drought index for groundwater drought monitoring over the central valley of california they found that ggdi is a powerful tool to capture characteristics of groundwater drought but drought propagation was not involved in their study han et al 2019 came up with a drought severity index based on grace gwsa namely gwsa dsi gwsa drought severity index and found that the groundwater drought in the pearl river basin can be effectively identified by the gwsa dsi they also investigated the linkage between meteorological and groundwater droughts in the pearl river basin based on the gwsa dsi in this study the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts and their distinction over the basins with different climate conditions are analyzed in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin the yangtze river basin belongs to the humid climate condition according to its abundant precipitation which could reach or 800 mm per year huang et al 2021 xue et al 2017 yang et al 2020 and is one of the basins with the richest water reserves in china but under the influence of climate change and human activities droughts and associated hazards have occurred more frequently in the basin sun et al 2018 the yellow river basin belongs to the arid semi arid climate condition according to its insufficient precipitation which is approximately and even less than 400 mm per year in the southeast part of basin and less than 200 mm per year in the northwest part of basin huang et al 2021 xue et al 2017 yang et al 2020 the agricultural irrigation in the basin depends greatly on groundwater while the basin has experienced serious groundwater depletion lin et al 2019 moreover the intensifying human activities in the basin could also change the hydrological processes and consequently impact drought propagation ma et al 2019 a case study in the uk found that human activities especially intensive groundwater use can change the duration and severity of groundwater drought under natural conditions wendt et al 2020 however the linkage between different types of droughts is seldomly studied in the two basins especially in the yangtze river basin the studies about drought propagation in the yellow river basin focus on the propagation from meteorological to streamflow drought omer et al 2020 wang et al 2020b to the best of our knowledge studies on identifying the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts have not been carried out in the yangtze river basin or yellow river basin besides no investigations have been conducted on analyzing the distinction of the correlation and propagation in the two basins therefore to fill this gap this study is intended to explore the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts furthermore our study is also aimed to reveal the distinction of the correlation and propagation in the two basins with different climate conditions namely the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin the primary objectives of this study are 1 to identify the characteristics of meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin 2 to explore correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the two selected basins 3 to clarify the distinction and its corresponding factors of the correlation and propagation among the three types of droughts over the two basins the following sections are organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data used in this study section 3 presents the adopted methodology results are presented in section 4 discussion is presented in section 5 and conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin are the two largest basins in china the yangtze river the longest river in china originates from the tanggula range in western china and finally discharges to the east china sea the river is about 6 300 km long and spreading over 1 800 000 km2 of the basin area fig 1 a the yellow river is the second longest river in china with a length of 5 464 km fig 1 b it originates in tibet plateau in western china and ultimately flows to the bo sea with an estimated recharge area of about 795 000 km2 fig 2 depicts the seasonal cycles of gwsa precipitation soil moisture from april 2002 to march 2020 in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin the average monthly gwsa in the yangtze river basin ranges from 2 88 to 34 49 mm fig 2 a while it ranges from 39 26 to 26 71 mm in the yellow river basin fig 2 b which is much lower than that in the yangtze river basin the average monthly precipitation in the yangtze river basin ranges from 22 97 to 168 72 mm and mostly occurs during may to august fig 2 a and it is lower in the yellow river basin which ranges from 2 88 to 93 86 mm and mostly occurs during june to september fig 2 b the average monthly soil moisture in the yangtze river basin ranges from 0 25 to 0 30 m3 m3 and the high soil moisture can be observed during june to september fig 2 a and it ranges from 0 11 to 0 24 m3 m3 and the high soil moisture can be observed during july to october in the yellow river basin fig 2 b 2 2 data 2 2 1 in situ precipitation observations daily in situ precipitation observations

drought in this study 2 3 soil moisture 2 3 1 reanalysis soil moisture reanalysis soil moisture provides an alternative source for soil moisture observations over large spatial and long temporal

situ soil moisture are quite consistent in china chen and yuan 2020 shi et al 2011 wang and li 2020 due to unavailability of in situ soil moisture observations for this study the 0 5 cm daily soil moisture from cldas from january 2017 to march 2020 is aggregated into monthly scale and applied as a reference to evaluate the reanalysis soil moisture 2 4 water storage anomaly 2 4 1 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace there are mainly two approaches to derive the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa by using grace data the spherical harmonic coefficients shc solution based on grace level 2 gravity field and the mass concentration functions mascon solution based on grace level 1b data sh solution is easy to be realized but the mass variation obtained by sh has an obvious strip and high frequency error due to the observation error of grace and the error in the process of parameterizing the earth s gravity field swenson and wahr 2006 compared with sh solution mascon solution reduced leakage errors and removed glacial isostatic adjustment with no need for north south striping and filtering scanlon et al 2016 grace mascon solution has been proved that it can capture the variations of terrestrial water and groundwater storage in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin lin et al 2020 liu et al 2020 mo et al 2016 sun et al 2018 among them liu et al 2020 pointed out that the trend of groundwater storage in the central yangtze river basin derived from grace mascon solution has a good correlation with that of baseflow in the basin and for the yellow river basin lin et al 2019 found that the declining pattern of groundwater in the yellow river basin is captured by grace mascon solution in this study the latest version of grace rl06 mascon solution released by the center for space research at the university of texas csr from april 2002 to march 2020 is used to derive the twsa which in turn to derive the gwsa with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 1 month http www2 csr utexas edu grace the linear interpolation method is applied to fill the missing data due to technical issues lin et al 2019 2 4 2 global land data assimilation system gldas global land data assimilation system gldas developed by nasa and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa adopts data assimilation to combine satellite and in situ observation data to generate surface state and fluxes variates rodell et al 2004 gldas contains four land surface models namely noah mosaic community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model compared with other models gldas noah has the advantages of high spatial resolution and stable driving field and it has the highest spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 which is consistent with grace rl06 csr mascon solutions therefore this study adopts gldas noah model l4 monthly v2 1 product http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings from april 2002 to march 2020 for grace verification and gwsa estimation it should be noted that given the resolutions of these datasets range from 0 0625 0 0625 to 0 5 0 625 the grid scale of grace namely 0 25 0 25 is utilized as the resolution for the following analysis the inverse distance weighting idw algorithm is used in this study to rescale the spatial resolution of datasets it is regarded as one of the standard spatial interpolation procedures in geographic information science gocic and trajkovic 2014 shepard 1968 3 methodology as mentioned above this study aims to explore the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts and their distinction over the basins with different climate conditions firstly monthly reanalysis soil moisture and twsa obtained from grace from april 2002 to march 2020 are evaluated for their accuracy secondly grace and gldas are combined for the retrieval of gwsa thirdly the drought indices including the standardized precipitation index spi standardized soil moisture index ssi and groundwater drought index based on grace are calculated to identify the meteorological agricultural and groundwater drought respectively at monthly scale finally the spearman rank correlation coefficient is used to quantify the correlation and propagation among the droughts 3 1 evaluation indices the pearson correlation coefficient r the relative bias bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse are applied to evaluate the accuracy of the reanalysis soil moisture r and the root mean square error rmse between the twsa derived from grace and gldas are used to verify the accuracy of twsa retrieved from grace 1 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 bias i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 100 ubrmse 1 n n i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y i x i 2 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x i and y i represent the time series of reference data and evaluated data respectively x and y represent the mean value of the two data respectively 3 2 bias correction as described in section 4 1 1 soil moisture derived from era5 and merra2 is relatively higher than that from cldas which is regarded as the reference soil moisture in this study hence bias correction is used to reduce the differences between soil moisture from reanalysis products and cldas the process of bias correction is described as follows s m bias j s m reanalysis j s m cldas j s m reanalysis b i a s c o r r e c t e d i j s m reanalysis i j s m bias j where i is the year ranging from 2002 to 2020 j is the month ranging from january to december s m reanalysis j and s m cldas j represent the mean value of reanalysis and cldas soil moisture in month j respectively s m bias j denotes the average monthly soil moisture bias between reanalysis and cldas in month j 3 3 retrieval of groundwater storage change the grace twsa mainly includes groundwater storage anomaly gwsa soil moisture storage anomaly smsa snow water equivalent anomaly swea and canopy water storage anomaly cwsa eq 7 therefore the anomaly in satellite based gwsa namely gwsa can be determined equation 8 as follows twsa g w s a s m s a s w a s w e a gwsa t w s a s m s a s w a s w e a where smsa swa and swea are obtained from gldas noah 3 4 drought indices 3 4 1 standardized precipitation index spi and standardized soil moisture index ssi the spi mckee et al 1993 and ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 which are based on the precipitation and soil moisture respectively are widely utilized across the world to describe the meteorological drought e g wu et al 2017 and agricultural drought e g xu et al 2018 respectively both short term and long term drought can be identified based on these indices importantly the fundamental advantage of spi and ssi is that they can capture the drought features at various time scales 1 3 6 or 12 months etc hayes et al 1999 the spi and ssi used accumulation periods of 1 to 24 months are calculated in this study the 1 month drought index is used for the description of short term drought the accumulation periods used in this study span sub seasonal multi seasonal and multi annual time scales the 24 month scale is used in this study for it is the time scale broadly applied to investigate drought propagation and most studies have shown that propagation time between different types of droughts is less than 24 months han et al 2019 huang et al 2015 xu et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 spi and ssi rely on a representative parametric probability distribution function however a parametric distribution function may not fit the data especially in large spatial scale studies farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 furthermore the minimum period to obtain an accurate estimation of drought conditions is 30 years when using a parametric probability distribution function rad et al 2017 to overcome the above limitations farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 proposed a nonparametric framework namely standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat considering the relatively short study period 04 2000 03 2020 sdat is selected to calculate spi and ssi in this study the standardized index si can be calculated as follows si t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 i f 0 p 0 5 t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 i f 0 5 p 1 where c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802583 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 and p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 t ln 1 p 2 ln 1 1 p 2 where n is the sample size i denotes the ascending order of non zero precipitation data and p x i is the corresponding empirical probability 3 4 2 groundwater drought index based on grace the groundwater drought index based on grace referred to as dsi proposed by han et al 2019 is utilized in this study to identify groundwater drought in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin compared with ggdi proposed by thomas et al 2017 the dsi is simpler to calculate and retained the seasonal characteristics of drought therefore dsi is adopted in this study to identify groundwater drought the dsi is defined as follows ds i i j gws a i j gws a j σ j where i is the year ranging from 2002 to 2015 j is the month ranging from january to december gws a j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of groundwater storage anomaly in month j respectively moreover the dsi is a dimensionless quantity the drought classification based on the dsi and spi ssi is shown in table 1 han et al 2019 hao and aghakouchak 2013 mckee et al 1993 3 5 quantification of the correlation and propagation among the three types of droughts the correlation between different types of droughts could be simplified into a mathematical linkage between corresponding drought indices xu et al 2021 as far as we know a few previous studies focused on the linear relationship in the field of drought propagation barker et al 2016 li et al 2020a vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 wu et al 2018 and some studies proposed that the linkage between different types of droughts is nonlinear fang et al 2020 wu et al 2017 spearman rank correlation coefficient rs is used in this study to quantify the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts it is a method used to assess the monotonic relationship between the two variables whether linear or nonlinear hauke and kossowski 2011 so it can comprehensively reveal the relationship between different types of droughts compared with the traditional pearson linear correlation coefficient han et al 2021 wu et al 2017 the spearman rank correlation coefficient can be calculated as follows r s cov r g x r g y σ r g x σ r g y where x and y are the rank time series of two types of drought indices respectively for example when quantifying the relationship between agricultural and meteorological droughts x is the rank time series of ssi 1 1 month ssi and y is rank time series of spi n n is the time scale of spi from 1 to n month cov r g x r g y is the covariance of the rank variables σ r g x and σ r g y are the standard deviations of the rank variables the time scale with the highest correlation coefficient would be regarded as drought propagation time xu et al 2019 4 results 4 1 evaluation of reanalysis soil moisture and twsa from grace 4 1 1 evaluation of reanalysis soil moisture the performance of the reanalysis soil moisture is evaluated both at the basin scale and grid scale generally at the basin scale both era5 and merra2 overestimate the soil moisture fig 3 the soil moisture derived from era5 ranging from 0 35 to 0 41 m3 m3 and from 0 23 to 0 34 m3 m3 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively and soil moisture derived from merra2 ranging from 0 30 to 0 35 m3 m3 and from 0 20 to 0 26 m3 m3 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively they are both higher than that derived from gldas which ranges from 0 24 to 0 34 m3 m3 and from 0 12 to 0 26 m3 m3 from february 2017 to march 2020 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively the bias corrected era5 and merra2 soil moisture in the yangtze river basin range from 0 25 to 0 32 m3 m3 and from 0 26 to 0 31 m3 m3 respectively fig 3 a and in the yellow river basin they range from 0 11 to 0 28 m3 m3 and from 0 12 to 0 25 m3 m3 respectively fig 3 b the bias corrected era5 and merra2 soil moisture are close to the variations of the cldas soil moisture in the two basins however the bias corrected merra2 shows a better capability to represent the temporal variability of surface soil moisture although the bias and ubrmse of bias corrected era5 and merra2 are similar the r of bias corrected merra2 is higher than that of bias corrected era5 table 1 the r between bias corrected merra2 and cldas reaches 0 60 and 0 91 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively while the r between bias corrected era5 and cldas is 0 53 and 0 88 in the yellow river basin respectively table 2 the spatial distribution of statistical indices used to evaluate reanalysis soil moisture at the grid scale is exhibited in fig 4 for yangtze river basin and fig 5 for yellow river basin in general bias corrected merra2 performs better than bias corrected era5 although the spatial distributions of bias for bias corrected era5 and bias corrected merra2 are similar the distributions of r and ubrmse for two reanalysis soil moisture are quite different the proportion of grid with relatively high r 0 6 is larger in two basins for bias corrected merra2 than that for bias corrected era5 for bias corrected merra2 there are 88 00 and 92 43 grids with relatively high r in the yangtze river basin fig 4 d and yellow river basin fig 5 d respectively however for bias corrected era5 there are 84 25 and 86 50 grids with relatively high r in the yangtze river basin fig 4 c and yellow river basin fig 5 c respectively the proportion of grid with relatively low ubrmse 0 04 m3 m3 is larger in two basins for bias corrected merra2 than that for bias corrected era5 for bias corrected merra2 there are 89 08 and 93 68 grids with relatively low ubrmse in the yangtze river basin fig 4 l and yellow river basin fig 5 l respectively for bias corrected era5 there are 86 21 and 88 61 grids with relatively low ubrmse in the yangtze river basin fig 4 k and yellow river basin fig 5 k respectively in summary the bias corrected merra2 performs better in both basins with the lowest bias and ubrmse values as well as the highest r therefore bias corrected merra2 soil moisture is selected to investigate the variations of soil moisture and the evolution of agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin 4 1 2 verification of twsa from grace it is crucial to verify the accuracy of twsa terrestrial water storage anomaly retrieved from grace before it is adopted for further analysis including the drought identification and correlation and propagation among droughts cao et al 2015 wang et al 2020a accordingly the gldas land surface model is used for the verification of grace wang et al 2020a it mainly evaluates the consistency of seasonal fluctuations and the closeness of variations of twsa from grace and gldas and based on which verifies the accuracy of grace twsa as displayed in fig 6 the variations of monthly twsa derived from grace and gldas show obvious seasonal fluctuations and agree with each other relatively well the peaks and valleys of twsa derived from grace and gldas in the yangtze river basin both occur from july to august and from december to february respectively fig 6 a the peaks and valleys of twsa derived from grace and gldas in the yellow river basin both occur from september to october and from may to june respectively fig 6 b however the range of twsa is quite different in recent years in the two basins the twsa derived from grace ranging from 3 57 to 12 31 cm is quite higher than that derived from gldas which ranges from 5 41 to 6 11 cm from june 2010 to june 2017 in the yangtze river basin fig 6 a the twsa derived from grace ranging from 11 79 to 0 85 cm is quite lower than that derived from gldas which ranges from 3 42 to 3 49 cm from april 2008 to june 2017 in the yellow river basin fig 6 b the differences between twsa derived from grace and gldas may be due to the water storages derived from grace are the sum of surface water and groundwater storages while those derived from gldas do not contain groundwater rodell et al 2004 the growing differences of twsa derived from grace and gldas in recent years in the yangtze river basin may be because of the increase of groundwater chao et al 2020 also pointed out that the increase of twsa derived from grace from 2003 to 2015 in the yangtze river basin is mainly due to the increase of groundwater the relatively low twsa derived from grace in recent years in the yellow river basin is probably because of the decrease of groundwater in the basin lin et al 2019 indicated that the groundwater in the yellow river basin decreased significantly from 2010 to 2016 the two statistical indices namely r and rmse are used to quantify the difference between twsa derived from grace and gldas fig 7 the values of r are 0 81 and 0 59 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively and the values of rmse are 2 46 and 3 66 cm in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively generally the relatively high r 0 50 and low rmse 6 00 cm imply that the twsa derived from grace and gldas are quite consistent the spatial distribution of statistical indices used to verify the twsa derived from grace is illustrated in fig 8 in general most regions of the yangtze river basin show a relatively high correlation between twsa obtained from grace and gldas as shown in fig 8 a 59 36 grids exhibit good agreement between twsa obtained from grace and gldas r 0 60 in the yangtze river basin however there are 29 56 grids with relatively high r in the yellow river basin fig 8 b as mentioned above the obvious decrease of groundwater may be the reason for the low correlation in the yellow river basin relatively small values of rmse 6 cm are observed in most regions of the two basins the proportion of the grid with lower rmse is 84 08 and 81 18 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively fig 8 c d the relatively high correlations observed of twsa between grace and gldas confirm that twsa derived from grace is reliable and could be used for further analysis about drought identification in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin grace data contains a 11 month gap july 2017 may 2018 between grace and grace fo it breaks the continuity of the dataset and limits its further application to achieve continuous and long term monitoring of groundwater drought it is necessary to complete the grace data therefore in this study four classical interpolations are used to bridge the gap in grace twsa the comparison of twsa based on the four methods during the testing period which is from july 2016 to june 2017 at basin scale is exhibited in fig 9 it can be found that the linear and pchip interpolations perform similarly and twsa based on linear fit grace data well over the testing period in yangtze river basin fig 9 a moreover compared with the other methods linear interpolation achieves better performance over the entire period and the testing period with the highest r values which is 0 99 during the entire period and 0 93 during the testing period it also gets the lowest rmse values which is 0 62 cm during the entire period and 2 42 cm during the testing period and the lowest bias which is 9 29 during the entire period and 46 08 during the testing period table 3 and table 4 on the other hand pchip interpolation performs better in the yellow river basin with the highest r and lowest rmse and bias during the entire and testing periods table 4 therefore linear interpolation and pchip interpolation are accepted to bridge the gap in grace data in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively 4 2 characteristics of meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts fig 10 shows the temporal variations of three drought indices namely spi ssi and dsi in the two basins the spatial distributions of annual average drought indices in the two basins are shown in fig 11 for the yangtze river basin spi ssi and dsi all show an upward trend fig 10 a b c which indicates the decrease of meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts from april 2002 to march 2020 the increasing gwsa is the main reason for the decrease of groundwater drought the growing differences between grace and gldas twsa in recent years also reveal the increase of gwsa in the basin fig 10 b shows that the severe agricultural drought mainly occurred in 06 2006 07 2008 09 2009 10 2010 02 2011 06 2012 and 07 2013 06 2014 moreover it can be seen that several severe meteorological droughts outbreak before the occurrence and during the development of severe agricultural droughts in addition the trends of ssi and dsi in the yangtze river basin are similar fig 10 b c which indicates the links might exist among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the basin besides the spatial distributions of spi and ssi are similar to each other fig 11 a b the relatively low values of spi and ssi are observed in the southwest and southeast parts of the basin some relatively low values of dsi are also found in the southeast part of the basin fig 11 c generally a lack of precipitation for a long time would lead to the meteorological drought and the meteorological drought could propagate through the hydrological cycle resulting in soil moisture and groundwater depletion and then lead to agricultural and groundwater drought related studies also disclosed a similar argument e g han et al 2019 however it should be noted that there are almost no severe meteorological and agricultural droughts during the period from 2002 to 2003 with the severe groundwater drought in the basin fig 10 a b c nevertheless the relatively low values of dsi can also be observed in the north part of the basin while with relatively high values of spi and ssi hence it is necessary to further figure out whether there is a correlation among the three types of droughts in the basin and quantify it similar to the yangtze river basin the spi and ssi both show an upward trend which indicates the meteorological and agricultural droughts are on the decline and several severe meteorological droughts occurred before the occurrence and during the development of severe agricultural droughts in the yellow river basin fig 10 d e as shown in fig 11 d e the spatial distributions of spi and ssi are similar the relatively low values of spi and ssi are observed in the northwest and southwest parts of the basin and the relatively high value of spi and ssi both are observed in the middle of the basin despite some relatively low values of ssi in the southeast part of the basin with relatively high values of spi fig 11 d e for the dsi in the yellow river basin it shows a downward trend which indicates the groundwater droughts are increasing fig 10 f the declining gwsa is the main reason for the increase of groundwater drought the growing gap between gldas and grace twsa in recent years also reveal the decrease of gwsa in the basin in contrast to the decrease of meteorological and agricultural droughts groundwater droughts are aggravating in the yellow river basin from 2002 to 2020 especially after 2016 only two agricultural droughts occurred in the basin while the groundwater drought occurred frequently fig 10 f besides the relatively low values of dsi are mostly observed in the middle and east parts of the basin with relatively high values of spi and ssi fig 11 f it suggests the weak link between groundwater drought and the other two types of droughts in the yellow river basin therefore it can be seen the links among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts are different in basins with different climate conditions to further verify the capability of dsi to characterize groundwater drought in the two selected basins the method applied in han et al 2019 which compares the annual groundwater resources in the study area with the annual average dsi based on its monthly series is used in this study fig 12 it is found that the correlation between annual groundwater resources and annual average dsi in the yangtze river basin is strong r 0 86 with p 0 01 while the correlation in the yellow river basin is poor r 0 33 with p 0 18 some studies also pointed out that the relatively low consistency between groundwater storage derived from grace and groundwater resources published in the water resources bulletin exist in some basins and it could be explained that groundwater storage derived from grace usually represents the change of mass in the entire depth of aquifer which probably does not coincide with the depth of aquifer in the water resources bulletin yin et al 2017a combined with the verification of grace in section 4 1 2 the dsi is proved that it has the capability to characterize groundwater drought 4 3 correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts to further analyze the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts and their distinction over the basins with different climate conditions the correlation coefficients of spi ssi ssi dsi and spi dsi which respectively represent the correlation between meteorological and agricultural droughts agricultural and groundwater droughts meteorological and groundwater droughts are calculated in the two selected basins 4 3 1 correlation and propagation among the three types of droughts in the yangtze river basin fig 13 shows the correlation coefficients of spi ssi ssi dsi and spi dsi in the yangtze river basin the highest correlations are found in spi ssi fig 13 a which indicates the precipitation is the major factor impacting the surface soil moisture in the basin furthermore it can be seen that the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin has a noticeably seasonal pattern the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought is generally shorter in summer and autumn than that in winter and spring fig 13 a the propagation time is 1 to 5 months during july to november 7 to 10 months during march to june and 17 to 19 months during december to february it is similar to the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the south part of china which is 1 to 2 months in summer and autumn and 2 to 7 months in winter and spring in some previous studies e g xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 the relatively fast response to meteorological drought in summer and autumn largely owes to the high rainfall in these seasons fig 2 a in terms of ssi dsi and spi dsi high correlation coefficients rs 0 60 are concentrated in summer autumn and spring fig 13 b c there might be a relatively direct influence of precipitation and soil moisture on groundwater in summer autumn and spring due to the concentration of precipitation and soil moisture in these seasons fig 2 a which is also found by han et al 2019 in addition as shown in fig 13 b c that the correlation between meteorological and groundwater droughts is relatively weaker than that between agricultural and groundwater droughts for ssi dsi there are 6 months with relatively high correlation coefficient fig 13 b for spi dsi there are 5 months with relatively high correlation coefficient fig 13 c and the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought which is 11 months in summer 2 months in autumn 5 months in winter and 7 months in spring is longer than that from agricultural to groundwater drought which is 4 months in summer 1 month in autumn 5 months in winter and 7 months in spring this might be because the soil is a medium of communication between precipitation and groundwater and the influence of precipitation on groundwater resources is realized by controlling the process of soil moisture seepage green et al 2011 besides the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought in the basin is similar to that in other humid basins in china e g the pearl river basin of which the propagation time is 7 months in spring and 10 months in summer han et al 2019 the relatively weak correlations of ssi dsi and spi dsi imply that the meteorological and agricultural drought propagation through the hydrologic cycle might not be the only and dominant factor triggering the groundwater drought to further investigate the changes of propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin and the influence of meteorological and agricultural drought on groundwater drought during the period that groundwater drought occurred frequently the dynamic changes of the propagation time of spi ssi ssi dsi and spi dsi are analyzed by using the sliding window method 3 and 5 years we slipped obviously during the periods of severe agricultural drought which are 06 2006 07 2008 09 2009 10 2010 02 2011 06 2012 and 07 2013 06 2014 there is a tight link between meteorological drought and agricultural drought 3 and 5 years sliding window rs 0 7 fig 14 a the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought corresponding to the 3 year sliding window is mainly concentrated in 5 21 months and the propagation time corresponding to the 5 year sliding window is mainly concentrated in 5 10 months fig 14 a therefore the change of drought propagation time corresponding to different sliding windows indicates that the propagation time of meteorological to agricultural drought is dynamic on the other hand unlike the strong link between meteorological and agricultural drought during the period of frequent groundwater drought which is 2002 to 2009 the correlation coefficients of ssi dsi which are 0 12 to 0 29 from 2002 to 2007 and 0 31 to 0 60 from 2008 to 2009 and spi dsi which are 0 19 to 0 13 from 2002 to 2006 and 0 24 to 0 69 from 2007 to 2009 are relatively low fig 14 b c it suggests the deficits of precipitation and soil moisture could affect groundwater storage to a certain extent but they may be not the main contributors to the groundwater droughts from 2002 to 2009 in the yangtze river basin as shown in fig 15 a b c the correlations of spi ssi are stronger than those of ssi dsi and spi dsi the correlation coefficients of spi ssi at grid scale vary between 0 29 and 0 92 and there are 91 89 grids with relatively high correlation coefficient rs 0 60 in the yangtze river basin fig 15 a the propagation time is mainly concentrated in 5 13 months and there are 80 05 grids with the propagation time between 1 and 12 months fig 15 d it further suggests the tight link between meteorological and agricultural droughts and the direct and obvious impact of precipitation on soil moisture in the basin the correlation coefficients of ssi dsi and spi dsi vary between 0 15 and 0 68 and between 0 19 and 0 71 respectively and the spi dsi shows the weakest correlation with almost 96 59 grids with rs lower than 0 6 fig 15 c however there are 94 52 grids with rs lower than 0 6 in the spatial distribution of correlation of ssi dsi fig 15 b it also indicates the impact of the deficits of soil moisture on shortage of groundwater storage is stronger than that of deficits of precipitation however it is still limited in the basin 4 3 2 correlation and propagation among the three types of droughts in the yellow river basin similar to that in the yangtze river basin the correlation coefficients of spi ssi in the yellow river basin are highest compared with those of ssi dsi and spi dsi and the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yellow river basin also has a noticeably seasonal pattern which is shorter in summer and autumn than that in winter and spring fig 16 a the propagation time is 2 to 6 months during july to november and 7 to 9 months during december to june it is similar to the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the wei river basin a sub basin of the yellow river basin which is 3 to 8 months in summer and autumn and 6 to 8 months in winter and spring huang et al 2015 compared with the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yellow river basin the propagation time in the yangtze river basin is longer additionally different from those in the yangtze river basin it could be found from fig 16 b c that the correlations of ssi dsi and spi dsi are negative in the yellow river basin suggesting that meteorological and agricultural drought may not be the driving factor inducing groundwater drought in the basin as shown in fig 17 a during the period of severe agricultural drought which is 07 2002 03 2003 03 2006 02 2007 11 2010 08 2011 09 2013 03 2014 and 06 2015 10 2015 there is a tight link between meteorological and agricultural droughts 3 and 5 years sliding window rs 0 7 it is similar to that in the yangtze river basin the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought corresponding to the 3 year sliding window is mainly concentrated in 2 9 months 2013 2016 12 23 months and the propagation time corresponding to the 5 year sliding window is mainly concentrated in 4 9 months fig 17 a it can be found that the response time of soil moisture to the change of precipitation in the yellow river basin is generally shorter than that in the yangtze river basin from 2002 to 2012 it should be noted that during the period of severe groundwater drought which is 2015 to 2020 the correlation coefficients of ssi dsi and spi dsi are mostly negative fig 17 b c it further indicates the groundwater drought in the yellow river basin may be induced by other factors rather than the variation of precipitation and soil moisture for instance lin et al 2019 2020 indicated that groundwater depletion in the yellow river basin from 2003 to 2016 was mainly contributed by anthropogenic factors similar to the yangtze river basin the strongest correlation is found in spi ssi in the yellow river basin fig 18 a b c the correlation coefficients of spi ssi at grid scale vary between 0 46 and 0 91 and there are 88 61 grids with relatively high correlation coefficient rs 0 60 in the yellow river basin fig 18 a the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought is mainly concentrated in 4 10 months and there are 81 04 grids with the propagation time between 4 and 10 months fig 18 d it further indicates the shorter propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yellow river basin compared with that in the yangtze river basin at grid scale in addition fig 18 b c exhibits the weak linkage between groundwater drought and meteorological agricultural drought in the yellow river basin at grid scale the correlation coefficients of ssi dsi and spi dsi vary between 0 67 and 0 39 and between 0 26 and 0 47 respectively fig 18 b c the negative correlations of ssi dsi and spi dsi are found in 84 46 and 76 10 grids respectively fig 18 b c it reveals the weak impact of the deficits of precipitation and soil moisture on the shortage of groundwater storage in the yellow river basin 5 discussion as mentioned in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 there is a strong link between meteorological and agricultural droughts while the link between groundwater drought and meteorological agricultural drought is weak in two basins especially in the yellow river basin therefore to further discuss the distinction and its corresponding factors of the propagation relationship among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts over the basins with different climate conditions is essential considering that the meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts explored in this study are based on precipitation soil moisture and gwsa respectively the relationship among these variables is analyzed on the other hand because of human activities the impact of natural factors e g the deficits of precipitation and soil moisture on the groundwater may be changed ma et al 2019 wendt et al 2020 some studies pointed out that anthropogenic factors play an important role in groundwater depletion wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2019 particularly li et al 2014 found that the influence of groundwater exploitation on the changes of groundwater storage is larger than that of climatic factors such as precipitation and temperature therefore the impact of human activities on the groundwater drought in the two selected basins is also discussed in this study 5 1 impact of natural factors on the propagation relationship among the three types of droughts the strong correlation between meteorological and agricultural droughts in the two selected basins may be because there is a tight link between precipitation and soil moisture in the two basins it can be found in fig 19 that the monthly precipitation and soil moisture in the two basins from april 2002 to march 2020 show similar seasonal fluctuations the peaks of precipitation and soil moisture in the yangtze river basin both occur from june to july and the valleys of precipitation and soil moisture both occur from december to february fig 19 a the peaks of precipitation and soil moisture in the yellow river basin both occur from july to september and the valleys of precipitation and soil moisture both occur from december to february fig 19 b as displayed in fig 20 the spatial distributions of precipitation and soil moisture in the two basins are similar the relatively high values of precipitation and soil moisture are found in similar regions both in the two basins they are distributed in the central and southeast parts of the yangtze river basin fig 20 a b and the southeast part of the yellow river basin fig 20 d e the relatively low values of precipitation and soil moisture are both located in the northwest part of the yangtze river basin fig 20 a b and the northwest part of the yellow river basin fig 20 d e moreover the correlation coefficients between monthly precipitation and soil moisture are high in the two basins the r are 0 78 and 0 76 in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin respectively it suggests that the surface soil moisture is sensitive to the variation of precipitation from the statistical perspective therefore an agricultural drought is likely to be triggered when there is a deficit in precipitation some related studies also revealed the similar strong correlation between meteorological and agricultural droughts huang et al 2015 li et al 2020b xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however it should be noted that the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin is generally longer than that in the yellow river basin as mentioned in section 4 3 2 it probably is because the soil moisture is relatively high over humid basin where the occurrence of meteorological drought would not rapidly result in the reduction of soil moisture to trigger the agricultural drought zhou et al 2021 as noted by zhou et al 2021 the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought is generally shorter under drier conditions in china it can be known from sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 that the correlation between groundwater drought and meteorological agricultural drought is weak in the two selected basins especially in the yellow river basin the weak correlation is also exhibited between groundwater and precipitation soil moisture in the two basins especially in the yellow river basin the r between groundwater and precipitation are 0 19 and 0 03 in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin respectively the r between groundwater and soil moisture are 0 36 and 0 08 in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin respectively as shown in fig 19 b unlike the slightly downward trend of precipitation and upward trend of soil moisture the gwsa in the yellow river basin shows an obvious downward trend it further confirms that the growing differences between gldas and grace twsa in the yellow river basin in recent years are mainly because of the decrease of gwsa moreover the relatively low values of gwsa in the yellow river basin are found in the southeast of the basin while these regions are with relatively high values of precipitation and soil moisture fig 20 f it also indicates the weak linkage between groundwater and precipitation soil moisture at grid scale the quite high precipitation and soil moisture may still do not alleviate the decline in groundwater storage 5 2 effect of anthropogenic factors on groundwater drought groundwater in the yangtze river basin is the main source of domestic water supply for many rural areas and some factories and mines also rely on the withdrawal of groundwater chen 2020 to further analyze the impact of groundwater withdrawal on groundwater drought the annual groundwater consumption is collected from the yangtze river water resources bulletin http www cjw gov cn only the data from 2003 to 2019 is collected due to some constraints as shown in fig 21 the annual groundwater consumption in the yangtze river basin from 2003 to 2014 ranges from 4 75 to 4 74 mm groundwater consumption per unit area and is relatively high compared with that from 2015 to 2019 which ranges from 3 32 to 3 98 mm it could be seen in fig 12 c that groundwater drought mainly occurs from 2002 to 2009 as shown in fig 22 the annual reservoir storage in the yangtze river basin increases sharply from 92 38 km3 in 2006 to 202 78 km3 in 2017 and annual average gwsa increases significantly from 2009 to 2019 the gwsa ranges from 1 29 to 0 40 cm during 2003 to 2009 and from 1 99 to 4 57 cm during 2010 to 2019 the increase of gwsa from 2010 to the present also explains the differences between grace and gldas twsa in this period fig 8 a the leakage from reservoirs can recharge the groundwater zhang et al 2012 which might be the reason for the decrease of groundwater drought during 2010 to 2014 despite high groundwater consumption during this period besides the reservoir storage is relatively low during 2003 to 2009 which ranges from 81 84 to 128 48 km3 compared with that during 2010 to 2019 which ranges from 132 56 to 207 78 km3 therefore the groundwater drought from 2003 to 2009 is probably due to the low volume of reservoir storage during this period which could not offset the amount of groundwater extracted the annual groundwater consumption from 2003 to 2019 in the yellow river basin is obtained from the yellow river water resources bulletin http www yrcc gov cn as shown in fig 23 a the annual groundwater extraction by human activities is maintained at a stable and relatively high level of about 11 4 mm from 2003 to 2019 the extraction exerts considerable pressure on groundwater furthermore groundwater consumption is divided into different sectors in the yellow river basin water resources bulletin the uses of groundwater in the basin mainly include agriculture industry domestic ffl forestry fishery and livestock public and eco environment fig 23 a shows that agricultural irrigation is the main contributor to groundwater consumption in the yellow river basin especially from 2003 to 2011 the groundwater consumption for agriculture is significantly higher than that for the total other sectors water conservation and water saving practices have been applied in the irrigation regions along the yellow river basin to reduce the amount of water used for agricultural irrigation to alleviate groundwater depletion zhang et al 2019 unfortunately the reduction of irrigation failed to reverse the groundwater storage decline the annual groundwater consumption for agricultural irrigation is more than 5 mm from 2003 to 2019 moreover compared with agricultural irrigation the industrial domestic ffl public and eco environment withdrawals notably increase which is due to the economic development in the basin yin et al 2017b the groundwater consumption for the other five sectors increases from 4 87 mm during 2003 to 2011 to 5 79 mm during 2012 to 2019 the industrial sector is the primary consumption in the other five sectors fig 23 b additionally groundwater consumption for other five sectors have a slightly positive trend during the period fig 23 b therefore with stable groundwater withdrawals in recent years groundwater storages continue to decline and consequently groundwater droughts occur it further explains the declining groundwater storage in the basin in recent years as mention in section 4 1 2 the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts are based on in situ precipitation reanalysis soil moisture and grace based groundwater although the reanalysis product provides long term and continuous soil moisture and grace provides a new and valuable way to monitor the anomaly of groundwater storage there are still some limitations because of the lack of in situ soil moisture observations in the study area cldas soil moisture is used as the reference soil moisture in this study it is revealed in the evaluation of reanalysis soil moisture that reanalysis soil moisture generally overestimates the cldas soil moisture in the two basins the bias correction is used to reduce the differences between reanalysis and cldas however it is inevitable that the reanalysis soil moisture after bias correction would be more similar to the variation characteristics of cldas soil moisture during 02 2017 present which probably has an impact on the identification of agricultural drought from 04 2002 to 01 2017 similarly in situ groundwater observations are lacking in this study thus other methods are used in this study to verify the reliability of grace including the verification of grace twsa by comparing grace and gldas twsa and the evaluation of the accuracy of grace based dsi to characterize groundwater drought by comparing groundwater resources published in water resource bulletin and dsi but in the future we hope well observations can be accessed in addition as a case study in the humid and arid semi arid basins this study preliminarily investigates the distinction and its corresponding factors of the propagation relationship among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the yangtze river basin with a humid climate condition and the yellow river basin with an arid semi arid climate condition it should be noted that there may be other factors affecting the drought propagation relationship over basins with different climate conditions such as teleconnection factors land cover and land use han et al 2021 han et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 therefore a more comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the drought propagation relationship over the basins with different climate conditions is to be further investigated in the future 6 conclusions understanding the propagation relationship and their distinction among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts over the basins with different climate conditions is important for effective drought warning and prevention the spi ssi and dsi were used to define the meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts respectively in the yangtze river basin which is a humid basin and yellow river basin which is an arid semi arid basin the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts from april 2002 to march 2020 over the two selected basins with different climate conditions were explored and quantified and the distinction and its corresponding factors of the propagation relationship among the three types of droughts were analyzed the primary conclusions are as follows 1 the meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the yangtze river basin are decreasing from april 2002 to march 2020 the meteorological and agricultural droughts mainly occur in the southwest and southeast parts of the basin the groundwater droughts mainly occur in the north and southeast parts of the basin the meteorological and agricultural droughts in the yellow river basin are decreasing from april 2002 to march 2020 while the groundwater drought in the basin is aggravating in recent years the meteorological and agricultural droughts mainly occur in the northwest and southwest parts of the basin the groundwater droughts mostly occur in the middle and east parts of the basin 2 there is a tight link between meteorological and agricultural droughts in the two basins the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the two basins has a noticeably seasonal pattern which is shorter in summer and autumn than that in winter and spring when comparing the propagation time on the two basins it is longer in the yangtze river basin which is a humid basin however the link between groundwater drought and meteorological agricultural drought is weak in the two basins especially in the yellow river basin 3 the sensitivity of surface soil moisture to the variation of precipitation in the two basins mainly explains why an agricultural drought is likely to be triggered when meteorological drought occurs the weak linkage between groundwater and precipitation soil moisture in the two basins confirms the limited impact of meteorological agricultural drought on the groundwater drought the groundwater droughts from 2002 to 2009 in the yangtze river basin are mainly due to the high groundwater consumption and low volume of reservoir storage during this period for the yellow river basin the declining but still relatively high groundwater consumption for agriculture and the increasing groundwater consumption in other sectors industry domestic ffl public and eco environment maintained the total groundwater consumption at a stable and high level and exerted considerable pressure on groundwater it probably is the main contributor to the worse groundwater drought in the yellow river basin from 2015 to 2020 7 data availability statement in situ precipitation observations are provided by china meteorological administration cma from https data cma cn era5

4066,the propagation of meteorological drought in the hydrological cycle not only leads to the deficits of surface soil moisture which results in agricultural drought but also probably affects groundwater to trigger groundwater drought improving the understanding about the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts is necessary to lessen the risks resulted from them moreover the distinction of the correlation and propagation over the basins with different climate conditions is not yet sufficiently understood as a case study of the humid and arid semi arid basins in china the standardized precipitation index the standardized soil moisture index and groundwater drought index based on grace gravity recovery and climate experiment are used to characterize meteorological agricultural and groundwater drought respectively over the yangtze river basin with a humid climate condition and yellow river basin with an arid semi arid climate condition the spearman rank correlation coefficient is applied to investigate the correlation and propagation among the above three types of drought in the two basins the results indicated that 1 the meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the yangtze river basin and the meteorological and agricultural droughts in the yellow river basin are decreasing from april 2002 to march 2020 while the groundwater drought in the yellow river basin is aggravating in recent years 2 there is a strong link between meteorological and agricultural droughts and the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in summer and autumn is shorter than that in winter and spring in the two basins when comparing the propagation time in the two selected basins it is longer in the yangtze river basin 3 groundwater extraction may be the main factor in the aggravation of groundwater drought in the two basins which is different from the contributors to agricultural drought which is mainly the propagation of meteorological drought keywords meteorological drought agricultural drought groundwater drought drought propagation climate condition 1 introduction drought is one of the major and serious natural hazards with the characteristics of high frequency long duration and a wide range of influences hao and singh 2015 mishra and singh 2011 vicente serrano et al 2010 the damages and losses caused by drought in the fields of economy and environment are severe e g crop losses degradation and desertification urban water supply shortages forest fires etc huang et al 2017 in general drought is related to the variables of the hydrological cycle and could be classified into corresponding four types meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought mainly refers to streamflow drought and groundwater drought mishra and singh 2010 the combined effects of these types of droughts on society develop socio economic drought pathak and dodamani 2021 some studies categorized streamflow drought and groundwater drought as hydrological drought which is ambiguous in the specific study about streamflow drought or groundwater drought bloomfield et al 2015 van loon 2015 van loon and laaha 2015 most recent studies pointed out that groundwater drought is a distinctive class of drought which is the result of the decrease in groundwater recharge han et al 2019 li and rodell 2015 mishra and singh 2010 therefore the groundwater drought is regarded as a distinctive class of drought in this study in order to distinguish it from the general hydrological drought namely streamflow drought different types of droughts are inter related through interactions within the water cycle van loon and laaha 2015 therefore investigating the correlation and propagation among different types of droughts is of great significance for drought warning and disaster control there are a few studies investigating the mechanisms of drought propagation in recent years however most of them are concentrated on the linkage between meteorological and agricultural droughts behrang manesh et al 2019 huang et al 2015 li et al 2020b or meteorological and streamflow droughts ding et al 2021 guo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 as noted by mishra and singh 2010 that groundwater drought has not been formally included in the classification of droughts in most previous studies although mishra and singh 2010 proposed that groundwater drought should be considered as a distinctive type of drought studies focused on groundwater drought and especially the association between groundwater drought and other types of drought are less than the studies about other types of drought feng et al 2020 hellwig et al 2020 soleimani motlagh et al 2017 to date the limited studies involved groundwater drought propagation mostly focused on the linkage between groundwater drought and one other type of drought which mainly is meteorological drought han et al 2021 han et al 2019 liu et al 2016 wossenyeleh et al 2021 and they do not consider the difference of drought propagation under different climate conditions as we know soil plays an important role in the process of infiltration therefore the occurrence of agricultural drought probably reduces the recharge of groundwater which may trigger groundwater drought therefore analyzing the linkage among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts is supposed to attract our attention additionally ding et al 2021 indicated that drought propagation is expected to show different strengths in different climate regions hence it is of great importance to figure out the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts over the basins with different climate conditions which is critical to reduce the risks resulted from droughts one reason for limiting investigation about groundwater drought in most regions is the scarcity of systematic and high resolution groundwater observations han et al 2021 han et al 2019 traditional groundwater monitoring is mostly based on groundwater wells however it is rarely available due to the cost associated with drilling and maintaining monitoring wells moreover the regions where groundwater measurements are available often without digitized and centralized datasets or are withheld from the public due to political considerations feng et al 2013 li et al 2019 in addition well observations are often limited in spatial coverage and may have discontinuous and or short records making them unsuitable for drought monitoring with the rapid development of earth observation based on remote sensing technology the original groundwater monitoring method based on well can be improved to achieve large scale groundwater assessment at the regional scale gravity recovery and climate experiment grace time variable gravity observation satellite provides a new and valuable way to fill the gap in data availability and groundwater monitoring tapley et al 2004 groundwater storage anomaly gwsa derived from grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa has been gradually used to evaluate groundwater drought in recent years thomas et al 2017 developed a groundwater drought index based on grace gwsa namely ggdi grace groundwater drought index for groundwater drought monitoring over the central valley of california they found that ggdi is a powerful tool to capture characteristics of groundwater drought but drought propagation was not involved in their study han et al 2019 came up with a drought severity index based on grace gwsa namely gwsa dsi gwsa drought severity index and found that the groundwater drought in the pearl river basin can be effectively identified by the gwsa dsi they also investigated the linkage between meteorological and groundwater droughts in the pearl river basin based on the gwsa dsi in this study the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts and their distinction over the basins with different climate conditions are analyzed in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin the yangtze river basin belongs to the humid climate condition according to its abundant precipitation which could reach or 800 mm per year huang et al 2021 xue et al 2017 yang et al 2020 and is one of the basins with the richest water reserves in china but under the influence of climate change and human activities droughts and associated hazards have occurred more frequently in the basin sun et al 2018 the yellow river basin belongs to the arid semi arid climate condition according to its insufficient precipitation which is approximately and even less than 400 mm per year in the southeast part of basin and less than 200 mm per year in the northwest part of basin huang et al 2021 xue et al 2017 yang et al 2020 the agricultural irrigation in the basin depends greatly on groundwater while the basin has experienced serious groundwater depletion lin et al 2019 moreover the intensifying human activities in the basin could also change the hydrological processes and consequently impact drought propagation ma et al 2019 a case study in the uk found that human activities especially intensive groundwater use can change the duration and severity of groundwater drought under natural conditions wendt et al 2020 however the linkage between different types of droughts is seldomly studied in the two basins especially in the yangtze river basin the studies about drought propagation in the yellow river basin focus on the propagation from meteorological to streamflow drought omer et al 2020 wang et al 2020b to the best of our knowledge studies on identifying the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts have not been carried out in the yangtze river basin or yellow river basin besides no investigations have been conducted on analyzing the distinction of the correlation and propagation in the two basins therefore to fill this gap this study is intended to explore the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts furthermore our study is also aimed to reveal the distinction of the correlation and propagation in the two basins with different climate conditions namely the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin the primary objectives of this study are 1 to identify the characteristics of meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin 2 to explore correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the two selected basins 3 to clarify the distinction and its corresponding factors of the correlation and propagation among the three types of droughts over the two basins the following sections are organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data used in this study section 3 presents the adopted methodology results are presented in section 4 discussion is presented in section 5 and conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin are the two largest basins in china the yangtze river the longest river in china originates from the tanggula range in western china and finally discharges to the east china sea the river is about 6 300 km long and spreading over 1 800 000 km2 of the basin area fig 1 a the yellow river is the second longest river in china with a length of 5 464 km fig 1 b it originates in tibet plateau in western china and ultimately flows to the bo sea with an estimated recharge area of about 795 000 km2 fig 2 depicts the seasonal cycles of gwsa precipitation soil moisture from april 2002 to march 2020 in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin the average monthly gwsa in the yangtze river basin ranges from 2 88 to 34 49 mm fig 2 a while it ranges from 39 26 to 26 71 mm in the yellow river basin fig 2 b which is much lower than that in the yangtze river basin the average monthly precipitation in the yangtze river basin ranges from 22 97 to 168 72 mm and mostly occurs during may to august fig 2 a and it is lower in the yellow river basin which ranges from 2 88 to 93 86 mm and mostly occurs during june to september fig 2 b the average monthly soil moisture in the yangtze river basin ranges from 0 25 to 0 30 m3 m3 and the high soil moisture can be observed during june to september fig 2 a and it ranges from 0 11 to 0 24 m3 m3 and the high soil moisture can be observed during july to october in the yellow river basin fig 2 b 2 2 data 2 2 1 in situ precipitation observations daily in situ precipitation observations used in this study are obtained from 283 and 143 meteorological stations in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively provided by the china meteorological administration cma from april 2000 to march 2020 https data cma cn the meteorological stations in two basins are illustrated in fig 1 the daily precipitation is aggregated into monthly scale to investigate meteorological drought in this study 2 3 soil moisture 2 3 1 reanalysis soil moisture reanalysis soil moisture provides an alternative source for soil moisture observations over large spatial and long temporal

situ soil moisture are quite consistent in china chen and yuan 2020 shi et al 2011 wang and li 2020 due to unavailability of in situ soil moisture observations for this study the 0 5 cm daily soil moisture from cldas from january 2017 to march 2020 is aggregated into monthly scale and applied as a reference to evaluate the reanalysis soil moisture 2 4 water storage anomaly 2 4 1 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace there are mainly two approaches to derive the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa by using grace data the spherical harmonic coefficients shc solution based on grace level 2 gravity field and the mass concentration functions mascon solution based on grace level 1b data sh solution is easy to be realized but the mass variation obtained by sh has an obvious strip and high frequency error due to the observation error of grace and the error in the process of parameterizing the earth s gravity field swenson and wahr 2006 compared with sh solution mascon solution reduced leakage errors and removed glacial isostatic adjustment with no need for north south striping and filtering scanlon et al 2016 grace mascon solution has been proved that it can capture the variations of terrestrial water and groundwater storage in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin lin et al 2020 liu et al 2020 mo et al 2016 sun et al 2018 among them liu et al 2020 pointed out that the trend of groundwater storage in the central yangtze river basin derived from grace mascon solution has a good correlation with that of baseflow in the basin and for the yellow river basin lin et al 2019 found that the declining pattern of groundwater in the yellow river basin is captured by grace mascon solution in this study the latest version of grace rl06 mascon solution released by the center for space research at the university of texas csr from april 2002 to march 2020 is used to derive the twsa which in turn to derive the gwsa with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 1 month http www2 csr utexas edu grace the linear interpolation method is applied to fill the missing data due to technical issues lin et al 2019 2 4 2 global land data assimilation system gldas global land data assimilation system gldas developed by nasa and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa adopts data assimilation to combine satellite and in situ observation data to generate surface state and fluxes variates rodell et al 2004 gldas contains four land surface models namely noah mosaic community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model compared with other models gldas noah has the advantages of high spatial resolution and stable driving field and it has the highest spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 which is consistent with grace rl06 csr mascon solutions therefore this study adopts gldas noah model l4 monthly v2 1 product http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings from april 2002 to march 2020 for grace verification and gwsa estimation it should be noted that given the resolutions of these datasets range from 0 0625 0 0625 to 0 5 0 625 the grid scale of grace namely 0 25 0 25 is utilized as the resolution for the following analysis the inverse distance weighting idw algorithm is used in this study to rescale the spatial resolution of datasets it is regarded as one of the standard spatial interpolation procedures in geographic information science gocic and trajkovic 2014 shepard 1968 3 methodology as mentioned above this study aims to explore the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts and their distinction over the basins with different climate conditions firstly monthly reanalysis soil moisture and twsa obtained from grace from april 2002 to march 2020 are evaluated for their accuracy secondly grace and gldas are combined for the retrieval of gwsa thirdly the drought indices including the standardized precipitation index spi standardized soil moisture index ssi and groundwater drought index based on grace are calculated to identify the meteorological agricultural and groundwater drought respectively at monthly scale finally the spearman rank correlation coefficient is used to quantify the correlation and propagation among the droughts 3 1 evaluation indices the pearson correlation coefficient r the relative bias bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse are applied to evaluate the accuracy of the reanalysis soil moisture r and the root mean square error rmse between the twsa derived from grace and gldas are used to verify the accuracy of twsa retrieved from grace 1 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 bias i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 100 ubrmse 1 n

respectively 3 2 bias correction as described in section 4 1 1 soil moisture derived from era5 and merra2 is relatively higher than that from cldas which is regarded as the reference soil moisture in this study hence bias correction is used to reduce the differences between soil moisture from reanalysis products and cldas the process of bias correction is described as follows s m bias j s m reanalysis j s m cldas j s m reanalysis b i a s c o r r e c t e d i j s m reanalysis i j s m bias j where i is the year ranging from 2002 to 2020 j is the month ranging from january to december s m reanalysis j and s m cldas j represent the mean value of reanalysis and cldas soil moisture in month j respectively s m bias j denotes the average monthly soil moisture bias between reanalysis and cldas in month j 3 3 retrieval of groundwater storage change the grace twsa mainly includes groundwater storage anomaly gwsa soil moisture storage anomaly smsa snow water equivalent anomaly swea and canopy water storage anomaly cwsa eq 7 therefore the anomaly in satellite based gwsa namely gwsa can be determined equation 8 as follows twsa g w s a s m s a s w a s w e a gwsa t w s a s m s a s w a s w e a where smsa swa and swea are obtained from gldas noah 3 4 drought indices 3 4 1 standardized precipitation index spi and standardized soil moisture index ssi the spi mckee et al 1993 and ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 which are based on the precipitation and soil moisture respectively are widely utilized across the world to describe the meteorological drought e g wu et al 2017 and agricultural drought e g xu et al 2018 respectively both short term and long term drought can be identified based on these indices importantly the fundamental advantage of spi and ssi is that they can capture the drought features at various time scales 1 3 6 or 12 months etc hayes et al 1999 the spi and ssi used accumulation periods of 1 to 24 months are calculated in this study the 1 month drought index is used for the description of short term drought the accumulation periods used in this study span sub seasonal multi seasonal and multi annual time scales the 24 month scale is used in this study for it is the time scale broadly applied to investigate drought propagation and most studies have shown that propagation time between different types of droughts is less than 24 months han et al 2019 huang et al 2015 xu et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 spi and ssi rely on a representative parametric probability distribution function however a parametric distribution function may not fit the data especially in large spatial scale studies farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 furthermore the minimum period to obtain an accurate estimation of drought conditions is 30 years when using a parametric probability distribution function rad et al 2017 to overcome the above limitations farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 proposed a nonparametric framework namely standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat considering the relatively short study period 04 2000 03 2020 sdat is selected to calculate spi and ssi in this study the standardized index si can be calculated as follows si t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 i f 0 p 0 5 t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 i f 0 5 p 1 where c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802583 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 and p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 t ln 1 p 2 ln 1 1 p 2 where n is the sample size i denotes the ascending order of non zero precipitation data and p x i is the corresponding empirical probability 3 4 2 groundwater drought index based on grace the groundwater drought index based on grace referred to as dsi proposed by han et al 2019 is utilized in this study to identify groundwater drought in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin compared with ggdi proposed by thomas et al 2017 the dsi is simpler to calculate and retained the seasonal characteristics of drought therefore dsi is adopted in this study to identify groundwater drought the dsi is defined as follows ds i i j gws a i j gws a j σ j where i is the year ranging from 2002 to 2015 j is the month ranging from january to december gws a j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of groundwater storage anomaly in month j respectively moreover the dsi is a dimensionless quantity the drought classification based on the dsi and spi ssi is shown in table 1 han et al 2019 hao and aghakouchak 2013 mckee et al 1993 3 5 quantification of the correlation and propagation among the three types of droughts the correlation between different types of droughts could be simplified into a mathematical linkage between corresponding drought indices xu et al 2021 as far as we know a few previous studies focused on the linear relationship in the field of drought propagation barker et al 2016 li et al 2020a vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 wu et al 2018 and some studies proposed that the linkage between different types of droughts is nonlinear fang et al 2020 wu et al 2017 spearman rank correlation coefficient rs is used in this study to quantify the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts it is a method used to assess the monotonic relationship between the two variables whether linear or nonlinear hauke and kossowski 2011 so it can comprehensively reveal the relationship between different types of droughts compared with the traditional pearson linear correlation coefficient han et al 2021 wu et al 2017 the spearman rank correlation coefficient can be calculated as follows r s cov r g x r g y σ r g x σ r g y where x and y are the rank time series of two types of drought indices respectively for example when quantifying the relationship between agricultural and meteorological droughts x is the rank time series of ssi 1 1 month ssi and y is rank time series of spi n n is the time scale of spi from 1 to n month cov r g x r g y is the covariance of the rank variables σ r g x and σ r g y are the standard deviations of the rank variables the time scale with the highest correlation coefficient would be regarded as drought propagation time xu et al 2019 4 results 4 1 evaluation of reanalysis soil moisture and twsa from grace 4 1 1 evaluation of reanalysis soil moisture the performance of the reanalysis soil moisture is evaluated both at the basin scale and grid scale generally at the basin scale both era5 and merra2 overestimate the soil moisture fig 3 the soil moisture derived from era5 ranging from 0 35 to 0 41 m3 m3 and from 0 23 to 0 34 m3 m3 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively and soil moisture derived from merra2 ranging from 0 30 to 0 35 m3 m3 and from 0 20 to 0 26 m3 m3 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively they are both higher than that derived from gldas which ranges from 0 24 to 0 34 m3 m3 and from 0 12 to 0 26 m3 m3 from february 2017 to march 2020 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively the bias corrected era5 and merra2 soil moisture in the yangtze river basin range from 0 25 to 0 32 m3 m3 and from 0 26 to 0 31 m3 m3 respectively fig 3 a and in the yellow river basin they range from 0 11 to 0 28 m3 m3 and from 0 12 to 0 25 m3 m3 respectively fig 3 b the bias corrected era5 and merra2 soil moisture are close to the variations of the cldas soil moisture in the two basins however the bias corrected merra2 shows a better capability to represent the temporal variability of surface soil moisture although the bias and ubrmse of bias corrected era5 and merra2 are similar the r of bias corrected merra2 is higher than that of bias corrected era5 table 1 the r between bias corrected merra2 and cldas reaches 0 60 and 0 91 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively while the r between bias corrected era5 and cldas is 0 53 and 0 88 in the yellow river basin respectively table 2 the spatial distribution of statistical indices used to evaluate reanalysis soil moisture at the grid scale is exhibited in fig 4 for yangtze river basin and fig 5 for yellow river basin in general bias corrected merra2 performs better than bias corrected era5 although the spatial distributions of bias for bias corrected era5 and bias corrected merra2 are similar the distributions of r and ubrmse for two reanalysis soil moisture are quite different the proportion of grid with relatively high r 0 6 is larger in two basins for bias corrected merra2 than that for bias corrected era5 for bias corrected merra2 there are 88 00 and 92 43 grids with relatively high r in the yangtze river basin fig 4 d and yellow river basin fig 5 d respectively however for bias corrected era5 there are 84 25 and 86 50 grids with relatively high r in the yangtze river basin fig 4 c and yellow river basin fig 5 c respectively the proportion of grid with relatively low ubrmse 0 04 m3 m3 is larger in two basins for bias corrected merra2 than that for bias corrected era5 for bias corrected merra2 there are 89 08 and 93 68 grids with relatively low ubrmse in the yangtze river basin fig 4 l and yellow river basin fig 5 l respectively for bias corrected era5 there are 86 21 and 88 61 grids with relatively low ubrmse in the yangtze river basin fig 4 k and yellow river basin fig 5 k respectively in summary the bias corrected merra2 performs better in both basins with the lowest bias and ubrmse values as well as the highest r therefore bias corrected merra2 soil moisture is selected to investigate the variations of soil moisture and the evolution of agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin 4 1 2 verification of twsa from grace it is crucial to verify the accuracy of twsa terrestrial water storage anomaly retrieved from grace before it is adopted for further analysis including the drought identification and correlation and propagation among droughts cao et al 2015 wang et al 2020a accordingly the gldas land surface model is used for the verification of grace wang et al 2020a it mainly evaluates the consistency of seasonal fluctuations and the closeness of variations of twsa from grace and gldas and based on which verifies the accuracy of grace twsa as displayed in fig 6 the variations of monthly twsa derived from grace and gldas show obvious seasonal fluctuations and agree with each other relatively well the peaks and valleys of twsa derived from grace and gldas in the yangtze river basin both occur from july to august and from december to february respectively fig 6 a the peaks and valleys of twsa derived from grace and gldas in the yellow river basin both occur from september to october and from may to june respectively fig 6 b however the range of twsa is quite different in recent years in the two basins the twsa derived from grace ranging from 3 57 to 12 31 cm is quite higher than that derived from gldas which ranges from 5 41 to 6 11 cm from june 2010 to june 2017 in the yangtze river basin fig 6 a the twsa derived from grace ranging from 11 79 to 0 85 cm is quite lower than that derived from gldas which ranges from 3 42 to 3 49 cm from april 2008 to june 2017 in the yellow river basin fig 6 b the differences between twsa derived from grace and gldas may be due to the water storages derived from grace are the sum of surface water and groundwater storages while those derived from gldas do not contain groundwater rodell et al 2004 the growing differences of twsa derived from grace and gldas in recent years in the yangtze river basin may be because of the increase of groundwater chao et al 2020 also pointed out that the increase of twsa derived from grace from 2003 to 2015 in the yangtze river basin is mainly due to the increase of groundwater the relatively low twsa derived from grace in recent years in the yellow river basin is probably because of the decrease of groundwater in the basin lin et al 2019 indicated that the groundwater in the yellow river basin decreased significantly from 2010 to 2016 the two statistical indices namely r and rmse are used to quantify the difference between twsa derived from grace and gldas fig 7 the values of r are 0 81 and 0 59 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively and the values of rmse are 2 46 and 3 66 cm in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively generally the relatively high r 0 50 and low rmse 6 00 cm imply that the twsa derived from grace and gldas are quite consistent the spatial distribution of statistical indices used to verify the twsa derived from grace is illustrated in fig 8 in general most regions of the yangtze river basin show a relatively high correlation between twsa obtained from grace and gldas as shown in fig 8 a 59 36 grids exhibit good agreement between twsa obtained from grace and gldas r 0 60 in the yangtze river basin however there are 29 56 grids with relatively high r in the yellow river basin fig 8 b as mentioned above the obvious decrease of groundwater may be the reason for the low correlation in the yellow river basin relatively small values of rmse 6 cm are observed in most regions of the two basins the proportion of the grid with lower rmse is 84 08 and 81 18 in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively fig 8 c d the relatively high correlations observed of twsa between grace and gldas confirm that twsa derived from grace is reliable and could be used for further analysis about drought identification in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin grace data contains a 11 month gap july 2017 may 2018 between grace and grace fo it breaks the continuity of the dataset and limits its further application to achieve continuous and long term monitoring of groundwater drought it is necessary to complete the grace data therefore in this study four classical interpolations are used to bridge the gap in grace twsa the comparison of twsa based on the four methods during the testing period which is from july 2016 to june 2017 at basin scale is exhibited in fig 9 it can be found that the linear and pchip interpolations perform similarly and twsa based on linear fit grace data well over the testing period in yangtze river basin fig 9 a moreover compared with the other methods linear interpolation achieves better performance over the entire period and the testing period with the highest r values which is 0 99 during the entire period and 0 93 during the testing period it also gets the lowest rmse values which is 0 62 cm during the entire period and 2 42 cm during the testing period and the lowest bias which is 9 29 during the entire period and 46 08 during the testing period table 3 and table 4 on the other hand pchip interpolation performs better in the yellow river basin with the highest r and lowest rmse and bias during the entire and testing periods table 4 therefore linear interpolation and pchip interpolation are accepted to bridge the gap in grace data in the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin respectively 4 2 characteristics of meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts fig 10 shows the temporal variations of three drought indices namely spi ssi and dsi in the two basins the spatial distributions of annual average drought indices in the two basins are shown in fig 11 for the yangtze river basin spi ssi and dsi all show an upward trend fig 10 a b c which indicates the decrease of meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts from april 2002 to march 2020 the increasing gwsa is the main reason for the decrease of groundwater drought the growing differences between grace and gldas twsa in recent years also reveal the increase of gwsa in the basin fig 10 b shows that the severe agricultural drought mainly occurred in 06 2006 07 2008 09 2009 10 2010 02 2011 06 2012 and 07 2013 06 2014 moreover it can be seen that several severe meteorological droughts outbreak before the occurrence and during the development of severe agricultural droughts in addition the trends of ssi and dsi in the yangtze river basin are similar fig 10 b c which indicates the links might exist among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the basin besides the spatial distributions of spi and ssi are similar to each other fig 11 a b the relatively low values of spi and ssi are observed in the southwest and southeast parts of the basin some relatively low values of dsi are also found in the southeast part of the basin fig 11 c generally a lack of precipitation for a long time would lead to the meteorological drought and the meteorological drought could propagate through the hydrological cycle resulting in soil moisture and groundwater depletion and then lead to agricultural and groundwater drought related studies also disclosed a similar argument e g han et al 2019 however it should be noted that there are almost no severe meteorological and agricultural droughts during the period from 2002 to 2003 with the severe groundwater drought in the basin fig 10 a b c nevertheless the relatively low values of dsi can also be observed in the north part of the basin while with relatively high values of spi and ssi hence it is necessary to further figure out whether there is a correlation among the three types of droughts in the basin and quantify it similar to the yangtze river basin the spi and ssi both show an upward trend which indicates the meteorological and agricultural droughts are on the decline and several severe meteorological droughts occurred before the occurrence and during the development of severe agricultural droughts in the yellow river basin fig 10 d e as shown in fig 11 d e the spatial distributions of spi and ssi are similar the relatively low values of spi and ssi are observed in the northwest and southwest parts of the basin and the relatively high value of spi and ssi both are observed in the middle of the basin despite some relatively low values of ssi in the southeast part of the basin with relatively high values of spi fig 11 d e for the dsi in the yellow river basin it shows a downward trend which indicates the groundwater droughts are increasing fig 10 f the declining gwsa is the main reason for the increase of groundwater drought the growing gap between gldas and grace twsa in recent years also reveal the decrease of gwsa in the basin in contrast to the decrease of meteorological and agricultural droughts groundwater droughts are aggravating in the yellow river basin from 2002 to 2020 especially after 2016 only two agricultural droughts occurred in the basin while the groundwater drought occurred frequently fig 10 f besides the relatively low values of dsi are mostly observed in the middle and east parts of the basin with relatively high values of spi and ssi fig 11 f it suggests the weak link between groundwater drought and the other two types of droughts in the yellow river basin therefore it can be seen the links among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts are different in basins with different climate conditions to further verify the capability of dsi to characterize groundwater drought in the two selected basins the method applied in han et al 2019 which compares the annual groundwater resources in the study area with the annual average dsi based on its monthly series is used in this study fig 12 it is found that the correlation between annual groundwater resources and annual average dsi in the yangtze river basin is strong r 0 86 with p 0 01 while the correlation in the yellow river basin is poor r 0 33 with p 0 18 some studies also pointed out that the relatively low consistency between groundwater storage derived from grace and groundwater resources published in the water resources bulletin exist in some basins and it could be explained that groundwater storage derived from grace usually represents the change of mass in the entire depth of aquifer which probably does not coincide with the depth of aquifer in the water resources bulletin yin et al 2017a combined with the verification of grace in section 4 1 2 the dsi is proved that it has the capability to characterize groundwater drought 4 3 correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts to further analyze the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts and their distinction over the basins with different climate conditions the correlation coefficients of spi ssi ssi dsi and spi dsi which respectively represent the correlation between meteorological and agricultural droughts agricultural and groundwater droughts meteorological and groundwater droughts are calculated in the two selected basins 4 3 1 correlation and propagation among the three types of droughts in the yangtze river basin fig 13 shows the correlation coefficients of spi ssi ssi dsi and spi dsi in the yangtze river basin the highest correlations are found in spi ssi fig 13 a which indicates the precipitation is the major factor impacting the surface soil moisture in the basin furthermore it can be seen that the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin has a noticeably seasonal pattern the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought is generally shorter in summer and autumn than that in winter and spring fig 13 a the propagation time is 1 to 5 months during july to november 7 to 10 months during march to june and 17 to 19 months during december to february it is similar to the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the south part of china which is 1 to 2 months in summer and autumn and 2 to 7 months in winter and spring in some previous studies e g xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 the relatively fast response to meteorological drought in summer and autumn largely owes to the high rainfall in these seasons fig 2 a in terms of ssi dsi and spi dsi high correlation coefficients rs 0 60 are concentrated in summer autumn and spring fig 13 b c there might be a relatively direct influence of precipitation and soil moisture on groundwater in summer autumn and spring due to the concentration of precipitation and soil moisture in these seasons fig 2 a which is also found by han et al 2019 in addition as shown in fig 13 b c that the correlation between meteorological and groundwater droughts is relatively weaker than that between agricultural and groundwater droughts for ssi dsi there are 6 months with relatively high correlation coefficient fig 13 b for spi dsi there are 5 months with relatively high correlation coefficient fig 13 c and the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought which is 11 months in summer 2 months in autumn 5 months in winter and 7 months in spring is longer than that from agricultural to groundwater drought which is 4 months in summer 1 month in autumn 5 months in winter and 7 months in spring this might be because the soil is a medium of communication between precipitation and groundwater and the influence of precipitation on groundwater resources is realized by controlling the process of soil moisture seepage green et al 2011 besides the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought in the basin is similar to that in other humid basins in china e g the pearl river basin of which the propagation time is 7 months in spring and 10 months in summer han et al 2019 the relatively weak correlations of ssi dsi and spi dsi imply that the meteorological and agricultural drought propagation through the hydrologic cycle might not be the only and dominant factor triggering the groundwater drought to further investigate the changes of propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin and the influence of meteorological and agricultural drought on groundwater drought during the period that groundwater drought occurred frequently the dynamic changes of the propagation time of spi ssi ssi dsi and spi dsi are analyzed by using the sliding window method 3 and 5 years we slipped obviously during the periods of severe agricultural drought which are 06 2006 07 2008 09 2009 10 2010 02 2011 06 2012 and 07 2013 06 2014 there is a tight link between meteorological drought and agricultural drought 3 and 5 years sliding window rs 0 7 fig 14 a the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought corresponding to the 3 year sliding window is mainly concentrated in 5 21 months and the propagation time corresponding to the 5 year sliding window is mainly concentrated in 5 10 months fig 14 a therefore the change of drought propagation time corresponding to different sliding windows indicates that the propagation time of meteorological to agricultural drought is dynamic on the other hand unlike the strong link between meteorological and agricultural drought during the period of frequent groundwater drought which is 2002 to 2009 the correlation coefficients of ssi dsi which are 0 12 to 0 29 from 2002 to 2007 and 0 31 to 0 60 from 2008 to 2009 and spi dsi which are 0 19 to 0 13 from 2002 to 2006 and 0 24 to 0 69 from 2007 to 2009 are relatively low fig 14 b c it suggests the deficits of precipitation and soil moisture could affect groundwater storage to a certain extent but they may be not the main contributors to the groundwater droughts from 2002 to 2009 in the yangtze river basin as shown in fig 15 a b c the correlations of spi ssi are stronger than those of ssi dsi and spi dsi the correlation coefficients of spi ssi at grid scale vary between 0 29 and 0 92 and there are 91 89 grids with relatively high correlation coefficient rs 0 60 in the yangtze river basin fig 15 a the propagation time is mainly concentrated in 5 13 months and there are 80 05 grids with the propagation time between 1 and 12 months fig 15 d it further suggests the tight link between meteorological and agricultural droughts and the direct and obvious impact of precipitation on soil moisture in the basin the correlation coefficients of ssi dsi and spi dsi vary between 0 15 and 0 68 and between 0 19 and 0 71 respectively and the spi dsi shows the weakest correlation with almost 96 59 grids with rs lower than 0 6 fig 15 c however there are 94 52 grids with rs lower than 0 6 in the spatial distribution of correlation of ssi dsi fig 15 b it also indicates the impact of the deficits of soil moisture on shortage of groundwater storage is stronger than that of deficits of precipitation however it is still limited in the basin 4 3 2 correlation and propagation among the three types of droughts in the yellow river basin similar to that in the yangtze river basin the correlation coefficients of spi ssi in the yellow river basin are highest compared with those of ssi dsi and spi dsi and the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yellow river basin also has a noticeably seasonal pattern which is shorter in summer and autumn than that in winter and spring fig 16 a the propagation time is 2 to 6 months during july to november and 7 to 9 months during december to june it is similar to the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the wei river basin a sub basin of the yellow river basin which is 3 to 8 months in summer and autumn and 6 to 8 months in winter and spring huang et al 2015 compared with the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yellow river basin the propagation time in the yangtze river basin is longer additionally different from those in the yangtze river basin it could be found from fig 16 b c that the correlations of ssi dsi and spi dsi are negative in the yellow river basin suggesting that meteorological and agricultural drought may not be the driving factor inducing groundwater drought in the basin as shown in fig 17 a during the period of severe agricultural drought which is 07 2002 03 2003 03 2006 02 2007 11 2010 08 2011 09 2013 03 2014 and 06 2015 10 2015 there is a tight link between meteorological and agricultural droughts 3 and 5 years sliding window rs 0 7 it is similar to that in the yangtze river basin the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought corresponding to the 3 year sliding window is mainly concentrated in 2 9 months 2013 2016 12 23 months and the propagation time corresponding to the 5 year sliding window is mainly concentrated in 4 9 months fig 17 a it can be found that the response time of soil moisture to the change of precipitation in the yellow river basin is generally shorter than that in the yangtze river basin from 2002 to 2012 it should be noted that during the period of severe groundwater drought which is 2015 to 2020 the correlation coefficients of ssi dsi and spi dsi are mostly negative fig 17 b c it further indicates the groundwater drought in the yellow river basin may be induced by other factors rather than the variation of precipitation and soil moisture for instance lin et al 2019 2020 indicated that groundwater depletion in the yellow river basin from 2003 to 2016 was mainly contributed by anthropogenic factors similar to the yangtze river basin the strongest correlation is found in spi ssi in the yellow river basin fig 18 a b c the correlation coefficients of spi ssi at grid scale vary between 0 46 and 0 91 and there are 88 61 grids with relatively high correlation coefficient rs 0 60 in the yellow river basin fig 18 a the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought is mainly concentrated in 4 10 months and there are 81 04 grids with the propagation time between 4 and 10 months fig 18 d it further indicates the shorter propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yellow river basin compared with that in the yangtze river basin at grid scale in addition fig 18 b c exhibits the weak linkage between groundwater drought and meteorological agricultural drought in the yellow river basin at grid scale the correlation coefficients of ssi dsi and spi dsi vary between 0 67 and 0 39 and between 0 26 and 0 47 respectively fig 18 b c the negative correlations of ssi dsi and spi dsi are found in 84 46 and 76 10 grids respectively fig 18 b c it reveals the weak impact of the deficits of precipitation and soil moisture on the shortage of groundwater storage in the yellow river basin 5 discussion as mentioned in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 there is a strong link between meteorological and agricultural droughts while the link between groundwater drought and meteorological agricultural drought is weak in two basins especially in the yellow river basin therefore to further discuss the distinction and its corresponding factors of the propagation relationship among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts over the basins with different climate conditions is essential considering that the meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts explored in this study are based on precipitation soil moisture and gwsa respectively the relationship among these variables is analyzed on the other hand because of human activities the impact of natural factors e g the deficits of precipitation and soil moisture on the groundwater may be changed ma et al 2019 wendt et al 2020 some studies pointed out that anthropogenic factors play an important role in groundwater depletion wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2019 particularly li et al 2014 found that the influence of groundwater exploitation on the changes of groundwater storage is larger than that of climatic factors such as precipitation and temperature therefore the impact of human activities on the groundwater drought in the two selected basins is also discussed in this study 5 1 impact of natural factors on the propagation relationship among the three types of droughts the strong correlation between meteorological and agricultural droughts in the two selected basins may be because there is a tight link between precipitation and soil moisture in the two basins it can be found in fig 19 that the monthly precipitation and soil moisture in the two basins from april 2002 to march 2020 show similar seasonal fluctuations the peaks of precipitation and soil moisture in the yangtze river basin both occur from june to july and the valleys of precipitation and soil moisture both occur from december to february fig 19 a the peaks of precipitation and soil moisture in the yellow river basin both occur from july to september and the valleys of precipitation and soil moisture both occur from december to february fig 19 b as displayed in fig 20 the spatial distributions of precipitation and soil moisture in the two basins are similar the relatively high values of precipitation and soil moisture are found in similar regions both in the two basins they are distributed in the central and southeast parts of the yangtze river basin fig 20 a b and the southeast part of the yellow river basin fig 20 d e the relatively low values of precipitation and soil moisture are both located in the northwest part of the yangtze river basin fig 20 a b and the northwest part of the yellow river basin fig 20 d e moreover the correlation coefficients between monthly precipitation and soil moisture are high in the two basins the r are 0 78 and 0 76 in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin respectively it suggests that the surface soil moisture is sensitive to the variation of precipitation from the statistical perspective therefore an agricultural drought is likely to be triggered when there is a deficit in precipitation some related studies also revealed the similar strong correlation between meteorological and agricultural droughts huang et al 2015 li et al 2020b xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however it should be noted that the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin is generally longer than that in the yellow river basin as mentioned in section 4 3 2 it probably is because the soil moisture is relatively high over humid basin where the occurrence of meteorological drought would not rapidly result in the reduction of soil moisture to trigger the agricultural drought zhou et al 2021 as noted by zhou et al 2021 the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought is generally shorter under drier conditions in china it can be known from sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 that the correlation between groundwater drought and meteorological agricultural drought is weak in the two selected basins especially in the yellow river basin the weak correlation is also exhibited between groundwater and precipitation soil moisture in the two basins especially in the yellow river basin the r between groundwater and precipitation are 0 19 and 0 03 in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin respectively the r between groundwater and soil moisture are 0 36 and 0 08 in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin respectively as shown in fig 19 b unlike the slightly downward trend of precipitation and upward trend of soil moisture the gwsa in the yellow river basin shows an obvious downward trend it further confirms that the growing differences between gldas and grace twsa in the yellow river basin in recent years are mainly because of the decrease of gwsa moreover the relatively low values of gwsa in the yellow river basin are found in the southeast of the basin while these regions are with relatively high values of precipitation and soil moisture fig 20 f it also indicates the weak linkage between groundwater and precipitation soil moisture at grid scale the quite high precipitation and soil moisture may still do not alleviate the decline in groundwater storage 5 2 effect of anthropogenic factors on groundwater drought groundwater in the yangtze river basin is the main source of domestic water supply for many rural areas and some factories and mines also rely on the withdrawal of groundwater chen 2020 to further analyze the impact of groundwater withdrawal on groundwater drought the annual groundwater consumption is collected from the yangtze river water resources bulletin http www cjw gov cn only the data from 2003 to 2019 is collected due to some constraints as shown in fig 21 the annual groundwater consumption in the yangtze river basin from 2003 to 2014 ranges from 4 75 to 4 74 mm groundwater consumption per unit area and is relatively high compared with that from 2015 to 2019 which ranges from 3 32 to 3 98 mm it could be seen in fig 12 c that groundwater drought mainly occurs from 2002 to 2009 as shown in fig 22 the annual reservoir storage in the yangtze river basin increases sharply from 92 38 km3 in 2006 to 202 78 km3 in 2017 and annual average gwsa increases significantly from 2009 to 2019 the gwsa ranges from 1 29 to 0 40 cm during 2003 to 2009 and from 1 99 to 4 57 cm during 2010 to 2019 the increase of gwsa from 2010 to the present also explains the differences between grace and gldas twsa in this period fig 8 a the leakage from reservoirs can recharge the groundwater zhang et al 2012 which might be the reason for the decrease of groundwater drought during 2010 to 2014 despite high groundwater consumption during this period besides the reservoir storage is relatively low during 2003 to 2009 which ranges from 81 84 to 128 48 km3 compared with that during 2010 to 2019 which ranges from 132 56 to 207 78 km3 therefore the groundwater drought from 2003 to 2009 is probably due to the low volume of reservoir storage during this period which could not offset the amount of groundwater extracted the annual groundwater consumption from 2003 to 2019 in the yellow river basin is obtained from the yellow river water resources bulletin http www yrcc gov cn as shown in fig 23 a the annual groundwater extraction by human activities is maintained at a stable and relatively high level of about 11 4 mm from 2003 to 2019 the extraction exerts considerable pressure on groundwater furthermore groundwater consumption is divided into different sectors in the yellow river basin water resources bulletin the uses of groundwater in the basin mainly include agriculture industry domestic ffl forestry fishery and livestock public and eco environment fig 23 a shows that agricultural irrigation is the main contributor to groundwater consumption in the yellow river basin especially from 2003 to 2011 the groundwater consumption for agriculture is significantly higher than that for the total other sectors water conservation and water saving practices have been applied in the irrigation regions along the yellow river basin to reduce the amount of water used for agricultural irrigation to alleviate groundwater depletion zhang et al 2019 unfortunately the reduction of irrigation failed to reverse the groundwater storage decline the annual groundwater consumption for agricultural irrigation is more than 5 mm from 2003 to 2019 moreover compared with agricultural irrigation the industrial domestic ffl public and eco environment withdrawals notably increase which is due to the economic development in the basin yin et al 2017b the groundwater consumption for the other five sectors increases from 4 87 mm during 2003 to 2011 to 5 79 mm during 2012 to 2019 the industrial sector is the primary consumption in the other five sectors fig 23 b additionally groundwater consumption for other five sectors have a slightly positive trend during the period fig 23 b therefore with stable groundwater withdrawals in recent years groundwater storages continue to decline and consequently groundwater droughts occur it further explains the declining groundwater storage in the basin in recent years as mention in section 4 1 2 the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts are based on in situ precipitation reanalysis soil moisture and grace based groundwater although the reanalysis product provides long term and continuous soil moisture and grace provides a new and valuable way to monitor the anomaly of groundwater storage there are still some limitations because of the lack of in situ soil moisture observations in the study area cldas soil moisture is used as the reference soil moisture in this study it is revealed in the evaluation of reanalysis soil moisture that reanalysis soil moisture generally overestimates the cldas soil moisture in the two basins the bias correction is used to reduce the differences between reanalysis and cldas however it is inevitable that the reanalysis soil moisture after bias correction would be more similar to the variation characteristics of cldas soil moisture during 02 2017 present which probably has an impact on the identification of agricultural drought from 04 2002 to 01 2017 similarly in situ groundwater observations are lacking in this study thus other methods are used in this study to verify the reliability of grace including the verification of grace twsa by comparing grace and gldas twsa and the evaluation of the accuracy of grace based dsi to characterize groundwater drought by comparing groundwater resources published in water resource bulletin and dsi but in the future we hope well observations can be accessed in addition as a case study in the humid and arid semi arid basins this study preliminarily investigates the distinction and its corresponding factors of the propagation relationship among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the yangtze river basin with a humid climate condition and the yellow river basin with an arid semi arid climate condition it should be noted that there may be other factors affecting the drought propagation relationship over basins with different climate conditions such as teleconnection factors land cover and land use han et al 2021 han et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 therefore a more comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the drought propagation relationship over the basins with different climate conditions is to be further investigated in the future 6 conclusions understanding the propagation relationship and their distinction among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts over the basins with different climate conditions is important for effective drought warning and prevention the spi ssi and dsi were used to define the meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts respectively in the yangtze river basin which is a humid basin and yellow river basin which is an arid semi arid basin the correlation and propagation among meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts from april 2002 to march 2020 over the two selected basins with different climate conditions were explored and quantified and the distinction and its corresponding factors of the propagation relationship among the three types of droughts were analyzed the primary conclusions are as follows 1 the meteorological agricultural and groundwater droughts in the yangtze river basin are decreasing from april 2002 to march 2020 the meteorological and agricultural droughts mainly occur in the southwest and southeast parts of the basin the groundwater droughts mainly occur in the north and southeast parts of the basin the meteorological and agricultural droughts in the yellow river basin are decreasing from april 2002 to march 2020 while the groundwater drought in the basin is aggravating in recent years the meteorological and agricultural droughts mainly occur in the northwest and southwest parts of the basin the groundwater droughts mostly occur in the middle and east parts of the basin 2 there is a tight link between meteorological and agricultural droughts in the two basins the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the two basins has a noticeably seasonal pattern which is shorter in summer and autumn than that in winter and spring when comparing the propagation time on the two basins it is longer in the yangtze river basin which is a humid basin however the link between groundwater drought and meteorological agricultural drought is weak in the two basins especially in the yellow river basin 3 the sensitivity of surface soil moisture to the variation of precipitation in the two basins mainly explains why an agricultural drought is likely to be triggered when meteorological drought occurs the weak linkage between groundwater and precipitation soil moisture in the two basins confirms the limited impact of meteorological agricultural drought on the groundwater drought the groundwater droughts from 2002 to 2009 in the yangtze river basin are mainly due to the high groundwater consumption and low volume of reservoir storage during this period for the yellow river basin the declining but still relatively high groundwater consumption for agriculture and the increasing groundwater consumption in other sectors industry domestic ffl public and eco environment maintained the total groundwater consumption at a stable and high level and exerted considerable pressure on groundwater it probably is the main contributor to the worse groundwater drought in the yellow river basin from 2015 to 2020 7 data availability statement in situ precipitation observations are provided by china meteorological administration cma from https data cma cn era5

4067,losing streams are widespread in arid and semi arid regions exploring the evolutional states of losing stream groundwater systems is of great significance to understand the exchanges of water mass and energy in stream aquifer systems this study is devoted to investigate the evolutional process of infiltration flux pressure head and flow states of a seasonally losing stream groundwater system with the semi permeable streambeds missing or without clogging the paper constructs a new theoretical framework for the evolutional states of the system in particular it focuses on investigating the transition among different evolutional states including disconnected state transitional state negative pressure connected state and positive pressure connected state and the critical conditions of transition between connected and disconnected states the critical conditions associated with disconnection or connection are that 1 the zero flux zone starts to disappear 2 the unsaturated zone starts to disappear and 3 the negative pressure zone starts to disappear analytical solutions of those critical conditions are proposed the evolutional process of stream leakage is characterized into two stages the first stage corresponds to the disconnected and transitional states in which the seepage fluxes decrease with time the second stage corresponds to the fully connected state in which the seepage flux decreases rapidly again as time developing finally the influence of various controlling parameters on the critical conditions is analyzed the critical time tcri 1 and critical depth zcri 1 of changing from the disconnected state to the transitional state have nonlinear correlations with saturated hydraulic conductivity ks pore size distribution index λ and flux at the base of the unconfined aquifer q the critical time tcri 2 and the critical depth zcri 2 of changing from the transitional state to the negative pressure connected state and the critical time tcri

introduction the stream groundwater system is one of the key parts of a hydrologic cycle and it involves dynamic and complex exchanges of water mass and energy between two entities streams and groundwater boano et al 2014 constantz 2016 brunner et al 2017 the stream groundwater interaction has profound impacts on a number of issues such as water resource exploitation and management stream system ecological protection and restoration stream bank management etc theis 1941 edwards 1998 osman and bruen 2002 hancock and boulton 2005 boulton et al 2010 wang et al 2011 lawrence et al 2013 boano et al 2014 xian et al 2019 gaining a better understanding of the evolutional characteristics of the stream groundwater system under various climatic and hydrological stresses thus becomes one of the most important tasks in hydrological research the evolution of the stream groundwater system is a complex hydrological process involving many factors such as the hydraulic characteristics of streambed sediments and underlying aquifers the relative elevation of stream stage and water table and stream hydrodynamic conditions brunner et al 2009a b wang et al 2011 lackey et al 2015 jin et al 2017 in the case of a stream fully penetrating the underlying aquifer if the water table is higher than the stream stage the groundwater will be discharged into the stream as base flow the gaining stream osman and bruen 2002 wang et al 2007 otherwise the groundwater will be recharged from the stream the losing stream losing streams are common features in arid and semi arid regions sophocleous et al 1988 braaten and gates 2003 vázquez suñé et al 2007 lamontagne et al 2013 in the case of a stream partially penetrating the underlying aquifer the relative elevation of the stream stage and the water table not only affects the evolution of the recharge and discharge relationship in the stream groundwater system but also affects the evolution of the infiltration pattern in the system as the water table declines the flow state between the stream and groundwater gradually evolves from saturated flow fully connected state to partially saturated flow transitional state and eventually to fully unsaturated flow disconnected state fox and durnford 2003 brunner et al 2009a when the water table rises the seepage pattern between the stream and groundwater will be reversed hu et al 2016 jin et al 2017 if the water table is slightly lower than the bottom of the stream there is a saturation zone between the stream and groundwater and the stream groundwater system is in a fully connected state if the water table is considerably below the bottom of the stream variation of the water table position will not noticeably alter the infiltration rate and this state is called the disconnected state between the above two states there is a transitional state such a state classification for a stream aquifer system is essential to investigate the impact of water table changes on the infiltration flux and flow state the semi permeable streambed is a layer composing of fine sand silt clay or biofilm and it is another important factor of concern affecting the hydraulic connection in a stream aquifer system based on whether there is a semi permeable streambed streams are divided into clogged stream and unclogged streams peterson and wilson 1988 osman and bruen 2002 fox and durnford 2003 xie et al 2014 morel seytoux et al 2016 the semi permeable streambeds are usually found in low energy streams goldschneider et al 2007 streams with fast moving water may not develop the semi permeable streambeds peterson and wilson 1988 xie et al 2014 prior studies show that three possible states of connection transitional and complete disconnection are also possible for a stream aquifer system without a semi permeable streambed reisenauer 1963 wang et al 2011 xie et al 2014 wang et al 2016 jin et al 2017 reisenauer 1963 employed a variably saturated finite difference model simulating the distribution of water content and pressure head in a homogeneous soil beneath an unlined irrigation canal under steady state condition and he showed that an unsaturated zone emerged below the stream xie et al 2014 used numerical simulations to show that a stream aquifer system without the semi permeable streambed can evolve from a fully connected state to a disconnected state wang et al 2011 established a stream aquifer ditch sandbox model to experimentally confirm that a stream aquifer system without a semi permeable streambed can evolve from a fully connected state to a disconnected state the focus of above mentioned investigations is on the evolution of a stream groundwater system caused by regional water table declining with an initially fully connected state such investigations have a number of issues that need our attention firstly water flux between the stream and groundwater is assumed to exist all the time brunner et al 2009a b wang et al 2011 this implies that the stream always holds water and can be treated as a prescribed head or dirichlet boundary condition quichimbo et al 2020 for seasonal streams there will be a period during which the stream channel dries up completely and cannot be described as a prescribed head boundary therefore one cannot use the theoretical framework based on the assumption that water flux between the stream and groundwater always exist for studying the evolutional process of the losing stream groundwater system composed of seasonal streams secondly the above mentioned investigations have adopted a quasi steady state approach meaning that the regional water table changes in a stepwise fashion and the system is assumed to be in a quasi steady state condition at each step wang et al 2011 xie et al 2014 such a quasi steady state treatment is certainly different from reality brunner et al 2009b which is transient and dynamically involving all the time thirdly quantifiable criteria for system state in previous investigations need to be further developed for example the disconnected state is defined as the infiltration rate approximating a constant value and changes of the water table no longer significantly affecting the infiltration rate brunner et al 2009a however there are no criteria for quantifying the manner of approximating a constant value and it is also ambiguous to tell if the changes of water table significantly affect the infiltration or not see section 7 1 compared with the prior theoretical framework this study will construct a new theoretical framework to clarify the evolutional process of the seasonally losing stream groundwater systems without semi permeable stream beds the characteristics of this framework are as follows 1 it captures a more comprehensive system evolutional process from unsaturated hydrostatic equilibrium state to saturated connected state 2 it focuses on the dynamic and continuous evolutional process of the system 3 it analyzes the water migration process within the system and pays great attention to the evolutional process of system state variables such as infiltration flux pressure head and flow states 4 it establishes quantifiable criteria for system states to achieve this goal firstly this paper analyzes the limitations of the prior theoretical framework secondly by analyzing the evolutional process of the system the evolutional states of the system are divided and the critical conditions of the system evolution are constructed and then different evolutional state models and critical state equations are constructed according to the characteristics of system evolutional state and the solutions of evolutional state model and critical state model are obtained the parameter inversion model is constructed to calibrate the parameters in the analytical solutions to test the robustness of the solutions the obtained solutions are compared with high resolution numerical solutions for a number of representative cases finally parameter sensitivity analysis method is used to analyze the characteristics of system evolutional states the general sketch of the paper is shown as fig 1 2 problem description to facilitate the description the regional saturation zone and regional capillary unsaturation zone are defined as shown in fig 2 a the regional saturation zone refers to the traditional unconfined aquifer zone with a positive pressure head zone and the zone above the water table where the pressure head is negative but its magnitude is greater than the magnitude of the air entry pressure head despite of different signs of pressure head those two zones have one thing in common the sediment is fully saturated and the seepage process conforms to the saturated darcy flow the regional capillary unsaturation zone refers to the zone above the regional saturation zone where the water content changes caused by the regional saturation zone shifting and the pressure head is negative and smaller than the air entry pressure head or the magnitude of the negative pressure head is greater than the magnitude of the air entry pressure head the pressure head at the top boundary of regional saturation zone is equal to the air entry pressure head and the top boundary of regional saturation zone is called the regional air entry plane rap the regional saturation zone has no other source or sink terms except for the stream leakage recharge from the top and possible leakage recharge through a semi permeable layer from the bottom if there is no stream leakage recharge or no water in stream regional saturation zone can expand upward if there is sufficiently strong bottom leakage causing regional capillary unsaturation zone to move upward if such a process lasts for a sufficiently long time it is possible for regional saturation zone to reach the bottom of the stream to recharge the stream which may become ponded if there is no sufficiently strong bottom leakage regional saturation zone may not move up considerably and will still be separated from the bottom of the stream thus the zone between the upper boundary of regional saturation zone i e rap and the bottom of the stream is not affected and will retain its initial water content and this zone will remain as a zero flux zone if there is stream leakage recharge within a certain period after the stream leakage occurs the water content in sediment right below the bottom of the stream will be affected by the stream leakage such a zone is above the zero flux zone with the initial unaffected water content below the zero flux zone with the initial water content however there may be another zone whose water content will be altered by the shifting of the underneath regional saturation zone if there is considerable upward bottom leakage at the base of regional saturation zone since there is a zero flux zone separating the overlying zone affected by stream leakage recharge and the underlying zone affected by the bottom leakage at the base of regional saturation zone the influences of stream leakage and regional saturation zone variation are disconnected and independent from each other in order to facilitate the construction of the theoretical framework of the evolutional process of the seasonally losing stream groundwater system several points are notable firstly regional saturation zone variation is caused by the bottom recharge or discharge at the base of the unconfined aquifer the bottom recharge or discharge is possible if the stream is located in a regional discharge or recharge zone if the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer is less than the hydraulic head in the underlying aquifer then the unconfined aquifer will be recharged by the underlying aquifer driving by an upward hydraulic gradient rai et al 2006 otherwise the unconfined aquifer will discharge to the underlying aquifer driving by a downward hydraulic gradient secondly the initial state of the system is assumed to be in a hydrostatic condition meaning that there is no vertical flux in the system of concern at this state for a seasonally losing stream under the interplay of gravity and capillary force the stream water seeps into the underlying sediments and forms an inverted saturated zone specifically the inverted saturated zone includes a zone below the bottom of the stream but above the inverted water table iwt and an inverted capillary zone icz below iwt and above the plane of air entry pressure being called as the inverted air entry pressure plane iap below the inverted saturated zone is an inverted capillary unsaturation zone where the water content changes caused by the inverted saturated zone shifting as can be seen in fig 2a when the seasonally losing stream is disconnected from the underneath groundwater the inverted saturated zone the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional saturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone can coexist with a zero flux zone in between it is evident that for such a disconnected state fig 2a there is no water exchange between the inverted saturated zone the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional saturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone in other words the stream and groundwater are in a complete disconnected state as the stream leakage continues with time the inverted saturated zone and the inverted capillary unsaturation zone will continue to expand downward if there is bottom recharge at the base of the regional saturation zone simultaneously the regional saturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone will also continue to expand upward when the lower boundary of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the top boundary of the regional capillary unsaturation zone start to merge or the zero flux zone disappears the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone are connected forming a uniform unsaturated zone with changing water content called the capillary unsaturation zone because the zero flux zone does not exist anymore in this state the seasonally losing stream groundwater system evolves from a completely disconnected state into a new state signaling the start of the transitional state fig 2b as the stream leakage and or bottom recharge at the base of the unconfined aquifer further continue with time the inverted saturated zone the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and or the regional saturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone will continue to expand further and get closer with each other with time this is the transitional state fig 2c if stream leakage recharge and or the bottom recharge at the base of the unconfined aquifer keep going the inverted capillary unsaturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone will disappear iap and rap will merge into one air entry head plane and the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone start to merge signaling the end of the transitional state and the beginning of the fully connected state fig 2d for this state a fully saturated seepage zone is formed between the stream and the regional saturation zone fig 2e at the early state of such a fully connected state there is still a connected negative pressure zone between iwt and the regional water table rwt thus this early fully connected state is also called the negative pressure connected state fig 2e if stream leakage recharge and or bottom recharge continue further with time the negative pressure zone between iwt and rwt will eventually disappear or iwt and rwt merge into one water table fig 2f signaling the start of a positive pressure connected state fig 2g 3 theory 3 1 models for different evolutional states for some streams the size of sediments may be decreasing downstream this is because larger particles will be deposited first in the upper portion of a stream and finer particles will be gradually deposited along the streamflow direction if considering the particle size changes along the streamflow direction then one must use a three dimensional 3d approach to deal with the problem which is much more complicated and has not been done yet such complexity of streambed has not been considered in this study but it is a very interesting subject to investigate in the future when the scale of interest is much smaller than the scale of considerable particle size change along the streamflow direction the change of particle size along the streamflow direction can be considered to be secondary and the 3d stream groundwater interaction problem may be simplified to a two dimensional 2d problem brunner et al 2009a b wang et al 2011 xie et al 2014 wang et al 2016 according to section 2 the critical point of the system state transition is that the characteristic boundary starts to merge for example when the system changes from the disconnected state to the transitional state the lower boundary of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the top boundary of the regional capillary unsaturation zone start to merge when the system changes from the transitional state to the negative pressure connected state iap and rap start to merge when the system changes from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state iwt and rwt start to merge the relative positions of the front points of these characteristic boundaries determine whether the characteristic boundaries merge or not thus reflecting the transform of the system state for the 2d axisymmetric stream groundwater system profile the geometric and physical properties of the stream and sediment are symmetric about the vertical plane across the stream channel center the z axis on this axis the vertical velocity of water motion is the maximum and the horizontal component is zero therefore the front points of these characteristic boundaries move vertically along the vertical axes across the stream channel center capturing the moving of the front points of these characteristic boundaries on this axis can easily judge the evolution state of the system then the problem can be further simplified to a one dimensional 1d problem that is only the vertical flow is considered in this study we assume a seasonally losing stream with a constant stream stage at wet season and without water at dry season and the underlying sediment is homogeneous with a thickness of d 1 the pressure head at the top boundary of the regional saturation zone is the air entry pressure head ha and the initial thickness of the regional saturation zone is l 0 if the dry season lasts long enough and the lateral flow of groundwater is ignored the infiltration in sediment will eventually reach the hydrostatic state the end of the dry season is set as the initial time of the seasonally losing stream groundwater system atthismoment thesystemisin hydrostaticstate the constant stream stage d 0 is applied instantaneously to simulate the evolution of the system at wet season fig 3 a under the interplay of stream stage gravity and capillary force the inverted saturated zone and the inverted capillary unsaturation zone will be formed underneath the bottom of the stream and continue to expand downward the base of regional saturation zone is set to be a constant flux q 1 where a positive q 1 represents upward vertical flow recharge and a negative q 1 represents downward vertical flow discharge when a positive q 1is presented rap and the regional capillary unsaturation zone move upward based on the system evolutional process described in section 2 several critical moments can be captured as following 1 the zero flux zone starts to disappear which is the critical moment of transition from the disconnected state to the transitional state at this moment the lower boundary of inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the top boundary of regional capillary unsaturation zone merge joining together and becoming one interface the critical depth for the merging of the lower boundary of inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the top boundary of regional capillary unsaturation zone is denoted as zcri 1 and the corresponding critical time is denoted as tcri 1 fig 3b 2 the unsaturated zone with water content θ being smaller than saturated water content θs and pressure head h being smaller than air entry pressure head h a starts to disappear which is the critical moment of transition from the transitional state to the fully connected state at this moment iap and rap merge the critical depth for the merging of iap and rap is denoted as zcri 2 and the corresponding critical time is denoted as tcri 2 fig 3c 3 the negative pressure saturated zone starts to disappear which is the critical moment of transition from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state at this moment iwt and rwt merge the critical depth for the merging of iwt and rwt is denoted as zcri 3 and the corresponding critical time is denoted as tcri 3 fig 3d for the stream groundwater system without a semi permeable streambed shown in fig 3 one can either use a fully coupled saturated unsaturated modeling approach or a decoupled saturated modeling and unsaturated modeling approach with some continuity conditions maintained at the interface of the saturated and unsaturated zones the advantage of the fully coupled saturated unsaturated modeling approach is that the stream groundwater system is considered as an integrated system due to the highly nonlinear nature of the fully coupled saturated unsaturated flow system analytical modeling is nearly impossible to obtain and numerical simulation has to be utilized this section however will adopt the decoupled saturated modeling and unsaturated modeling approach to search for analytic solutions which have a number of advantages in terms of gaining physical insights and conducting system analysis as well as carrying out inverse modeling or parameter estimation for the sake of comparison we will also report the numerical simulation of a fully coupled saturated unsaturated flow system in section 4 and demonstrate the difference of numerical simulation and analytical solutions of this section in section 5 the conceptual model fig 3b describes the critical moment between the disconnected state and the transitional state in the disconnected state the sediment can be divided into three zones as the inverted saturated zone the unsaturated zone and the regional saturation zone respectively the flow in those zones can be described by mathematical models shown as eqs 1 3 respectively 1a z k s h z 0 z iha z 0 t 0 1b h z t t 0 z z i h a 0 z i h a 0 d 0

infiltration strength of rap w 2 in eq 6 the parameter inversion model is shown in section s3 in supporting materials 3 2 3 conditions from the disconnected state to the transitional state the critical condition for the evolution of the seasonally losing stream groundwater system from the disconnected state to the transitional state is that the zero flux zone starts to disappear which can be described by eq 7 7a q z z c r i 1 k s h z z z c r i 1 0 7b q z z z c r i 1 z k s h z z z c r i 1 0 7c q t z z c r i 1 t k s h z z z c r i 1 0 obviously due to the nonlinear characteristics of eq 2 the critical moment tcri 1 and the hydraulic head profile at the critical moment are difficult to obtain analytically however we can use a finite difference approximation to deal with the critical condition and transform eq 7 to q i j 0 q i 1 j 0 q i 1 j 0 and q i j 1 0 qi j is the flux at the i th space nodes and the j th time nodes cm s qi 1 j is the flux at the i 1 th space nodes and the j

and eq 6a the analytical solution for the hydraulic head profile in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone can be obtained 3 2 4 conditions from the transitional state to the fully connected state the critical condition for the evolution of the seasonally losing stream groundwater system from the transitional state to the fully connected state is when the unsaturated zone starts to disappear or the saturated zone starts to connect shown as fig 3c and eq 8 8 z c r t 2 z iha d 1 l 0 l t according to eq 8 and considering eqs 5b and 6b the critical moment and critical position from the transitional state to the fully connected state can be written as eq 9a and eq 9b respectively while by substituting eq 8 into eq 5a the hydraulic head profile in inverted saturated zone can be written as eq 9c and by substituting eq 6b into eq 6a and considering the time being tcrt 2 the hydraulic head profile in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone can be written as eq 9d respectively 9a t c r t 2 μ rha d 1 l 0 z iha t t c r t 2 k s w 2 q 1 k s w 2 9b z iha t t c r t 2 k s w 1 d 0 h a k s ln k s w 1 d 0 h a k s z iha t t c r t 2 k s w 1 d 0 h a k s

from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state the conceptual model shown as fig 3d describes the critical moment where the seasonally losing stream groundwater system evolves from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state the corresponding critical condition can be described as eq 10 10 z c r t 3 z iwt z rwt where z iwt and z rwt are the elevations of iwt and rwt respectively 4 numerical simulation of the fully coupled saturated unsaturated flow system this section will capture the evolutional characteristics of the seasonally stream groundwater system and test the robustness of the proposed critical conditions and analytical solutions in section 3 hydrogeosphere hgs hgs user manual 2015 is used to simulate the 1d constant head infiltration process and then according to the critical conditions described in section 3 2 the seasonally losing stream groundwater system will be divided into different stages to capture the characteristics of those states there are a number of reasons to conduct the numerical simulations here firstly as there are no other experimental data and former analytical solutions that are comparable to the analytical works of this study numerical modeling provides a certain degree of assurance on the developed solutions secondly numerical model can deal with complex boundary and initial conditions and media heterogeneity flexibly thirdly numerical models such as hgs have not been employed conventionally to deal with the dynamic losing stream groundwater systems that involve two different kinds of water tables one is iwt and the other is rwt during the disconnected and transitional states and multiple states of evolution thus we are curious to see whether or not the hgs model can perform reasonably well for a losing stream groundwater system and it is compared with the analytical solution in this study in the hgs model the soil layer thickness is set to be 500 cm the reference surface is the bottom of the stream and the initial hydraulic head is computed using the hydrostatic condition the upper boundary is the constant head boundary with a hydraulic head d 0 of 40 cm the lower boundary is the constant flux boundary with a recharge flux q 1 of 0 1 cm hr the initial regional saturation zone thickness l 0 is 50 cm the brooks corey model hgs user manual 2015 is used to determine the water retention data and relative permeability coefficient kr as shown in eq 11 and eq 12 respectively 11 s w s wr 1 s wr h a h λ f o r h h a 1 f o r h h a 12 k r k s s e 2 λ l p 2 where λ is the pore size distribution index dimensionless h is the pressure head cm lp is the pore connectivity parameter assumed equaling to 2 0 in brooks and corey 1964 and se is often called an effective saturation given by se sw swr 1 swr with sw being the water saturation dimensionless and sw r being the residual water saturation dimensionless two floridian soils mulat fine sand and mulat fine sandy loam were used carlisle et al 1989 tested the water retention data of the soils and the physical parameters are shown in table 1 nachabe 2002 the sw h and kr se functions will determine the profiles of water content and pressure head distribution thus both of them will affect the critical time and critical depth of the system evolutional states the detailed sensitivity analysis of parameters associated with the sw h and kr se functions will be discussed in section 6 since the lower boundary of the model is set as a recharge condition with a constant upward flux the losing stream of the simulated stream groundwater system will eventually transform to a gaining stream therefore above simulation will be terminated at the moment when the losing stream is changed to a gaining stream for the mulat fine sandy loam it is 52 9 hr for the mulat fine sand such a moment is 25 6 hr after the start of simulation one may also compare the hgs numerical model results with the developed analytical solutions in several ways for instance for a set of given input parameter values one can use hgs to compute the hydraulic heads and conditions of transition among different states and compare the results with those obtained using the proposed solution to see if they agree with each other or not in another way one can compute the hydraulic heads using hgs based on the given input parameters and then substitute the computed hydraulic heads into the inverse model developed based on the analytical solutions see section s3 in supporting materials and to see if the inverted parameter values agree with the original input parameter values in the hgs model 5 results the unique features associated with the disconnected state the transitional state and the fully connected state are the zero flux zone the unsaturated flow zone and the fully saturated flow zone respectively thus the infiltration flux profile is used to capture the zero flux zone to show the evolutional process of the disconnected state and the pressure head profile is used to show the evolutional process of the transitional and fully connected states in addition the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream is one of the incentive conditions of losing stream groundwater system evolutional process the change of infiltration flux will change the system evolutional process thus it will also be discussed in this section 5 1 infiltration flux profile during the disconnected state fig 4 shows the evolution of infiltration flux below the bottom of the stream with space and time for the disconnected state at the beginning of this state the system has the largest capillary force and the greatest hydraulic gradient in the sediments adjacent to the bottom of the stream so the infiltration flux is the largest during the disconnected state saturated vertical flows occur in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone while unsaturated vertical flows occur in the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone in the inverted capillary unsaturation zone under the interplay of capillary force and gravity a certain portion of water is stored in the pore space and the remaining part flows downward according to the inversed capillary water force balance theory the capillary force generated at the meniscus at the end of capillary water may be in the same direction as gravity or in the opposite direction against the gravity depending on the curvature of the meniscus see fig s1 in supporting materials this phenomenon indicates that the capillary force generated at the meniscus at the end of capillary water can either enhance downward flow or suppress downward flow when the upward capillary force is less than gravity the combined capillary force and gravity cause the overall downward flow when the upward capillary force equals gravity the force is in equilibrium when the capillary force and gravity reach a dynamic equilibrium all the water will be stored in the pore space and downward flow ceases to exist in the regional capillary unsaturation zone some water is stored in the pore space and the other flows upward when the capillary force and gravity reaches a dynamic equilibrium all the water will be stored in the pore space and upward flow disappears the zone between the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone is a zero flux zone that is not affected by the stream leakage and the water fluctuation in the regional saturation zone the range of the zero flux zone gradually decreases with time as an example for the mulat fine sandy loam the critical moment tcri 1 of transition from the disconnected state to the transitional state is 33 hr and zcri 1 is 282 cm for the mulat fine sand the critical time tcri 1 is 13 98 hr and the zcri 1 is 316 cm as shown in table 2 5 2 pressure head profile during the transitional state and fully connected state fig 5 shows the evolution of pressure head with time and space for the transitional and fully connected states one can see that the evolutional process of flow states and pressure heads show three different stages in stage 1 saturated flow and unsaturated flow occur simultaneously on the profile in stage 2 only saturated flow occurs but pressure heads can be positive or negative in stage 3 only saturated flow occurs on the profile and pressure heads are positive stage 1 is a transitional state of the system evolving from the disconnected state to the fully connected state for the mulat fine sandy loam the critical time tcri 2 at which the system evolves from the transitional state to the fully connected state is 52 32 hr and the critical elevation zcri 2 is 344 58 cm for the mulat fine sand the critical time tcri 2 is 25 38 hr and the critical elevation zcri 2 is 393 cm stage 2 is the negative pressure connected state the duration of this state is relatively short being about 0 03 hr for the mulat fine sandy loam and about 0 006 hr for the mulat fine sand stage 3 is the positive pressure connected state and the associated specific values for this stage are shown in table 2 fig 6 shows the evolution of iap and rap and comparison of the analytical and numerical solutions fig 6 shows that the elevation of iap decreases with time in a nonlinear manner and the elevation of rap increases with time in a nonlinear manner as well the moment when iap and rap intersect is the critical time tcri 2 of the transitional state evolving to the fully connected state to evaluate the analytical solution the parameter inversion model in section s3 in supporting materials is used for the mulat fine sandy loam the observation point is buried at the elevation of 10 cm and 19 cm in the inverted saturated zone and 410 cm and 420 cm in the regional saturation zone the start time t 0 of inversion is 0 6 hr and the end time of inversion is 30 hr for the mulat fine sand the observation point is buried at the elevation of 20 cm and 30 cm in the inverted saturated zone and 421 cm and 430 cm in the regional saturation zone the start time t 0 of inversion is 0 6 hr and the end time of inversion is 15 hr table 3 shows the parameter estimation results it can be found that except for the relative errors of l t0 which are more than 5 the relative errors of other parameters between the input parameter values in hgs and estimated parameter values using the analytical model are all less than 5 substituting the estimated parameter values in table 3 into eqs 5b and 6b respectively the curves of iap and the regional saturation zone with time estimated by the analytical solution can be obtained shown as the red lines in fig 6 it can be found that the analytical solution agrees with the numerical solution satisfactorily substituting the estimated parameter values in table 3 into eq 9 the critical time tcri 2 and the critical elevation zcri 2 can be estimated by eq 9 the relative errors of the critical time tcri 2 and the critical elevation zcri 2 estimated using hgs and the analytical solution are respectively 16 29 and 1 92 for the mulat fine sandy loam and are respectively 10 67 and 3 43 for the mulat fine sand as shown in table 2 the different tcri 2 and zcri 2 values obtained using these two models hgs versus analytical model are due to different degrees of generalization of these two physical models the hgs model considers saturated unsaturated flow while the analytical model eqs 1 and 3 considers saturated flow only meanwhile to obtain the analytical solution of eqs 5 and 6 the specific yield and the infiltration strength are assumed to be constant to represent their temporally averaged values 5 3 evolutional characteristics of the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream fig 7 shows the evolution of the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream with time in general the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream decreases using tcri 2 as the critical moment the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream is divided into two stages the first stage includes the disconnected state and transitional state in the disconnected state the stream leakage flux shows a nonlinear decreasing trend especially at the early stage the stream recharges the underneath sediment with a large leakage rate the main reason is that the pressure head at the lower boundary of the inverted saturated zone under the bottom of the stream is always maintained at ha see fig 5 and the flow path is shorter at the early stage of stream leakage see fig 6 thus a larger hydraulic gradient is generated in the inverted saturated zone causing a larger leakage flux another explanation is that during the early time both capillary and gravity force cause downward flow below the stream by increasing the water content of the sediments over time the capillary force is diminished and this reduces the infiltration rate as time develops the flow path in the inverted saturated zone becomes longer thus the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream decreases and the decreasing rate of the infiltration flux also drops in the transitional stage the variation trend of the stream leakage flux with time is close to linear when time reaches tcri 2 the saturated zone is connected and the evolutional process of stream leakage enters the second stage at the second stage the flow is saturated and the seepage flux decreases rapidly again as time developing in fig 7 qlc is the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream estimated using the analytical solution it can be seen that the infiltration flux estimated using the analytical solution agrees nicely with the flux estimated with hgs in the disconnected and transitional states 6 sensitivity analysis to estimate the impacts of various controlling parameters on the critical times the single factor sensitivity analysis brunner et al 2009a is conducted and the parameters of concern are d 0 q l 0 ks λ ha θs and θr θr is residual water content cm3 cm3 d 0 and q determine the potential recharge from the upper and lower boundaries to the sediment within the system l 0 determines the initial water head profile in sediment within the system ks λ ha θs and θr determine the physical properties of sediments within the system all these factors will affect the water migration process in the system and then affect the system evolutional process the mulat fine sandy loam and the physical model are used to conduct sensitivity analysis the base case simulation uses d 0 40 cm l 0 50 cm q 0 1 cm hr ks 0 62 cm hr λ 1 36 ha 39 1 cm θs 0 309 and θr 0 136 we use the base case as a reference and only change one parameter at one time with the others being their base values as the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is dependent on the moisture content thus when sensitivity analysis of ks is carried out using the single factor analysis method the soil water characteristic curve and relative permeability coefficient relationship are assumed to be fixed or independent of ks however coarse grain materials may show higher saturated hydraulic conductivity but lower unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for relatively lower water content or drier condition than the finer grains in another word when the ks varies over several orders of magnitude covering coarse grain materials and fine grain materials it will be difficult to keep the shape of the soil water characteristic curve and the relative permeability soil moisture curve remaining the same to remedy this problem to a certain degree the range of ks value discussed in the sensitivity analysis varies only within one order of magnitude in general ks varying in the range of one order of magnitude usually does not result in significant changes in lithology for example the ks range of clayey sand is 0 36 cm hr 7 2 cm hr the ks range of sandy loam is 0 36 cm hr 3 6 cm hr mao et al 2009 it should be emphasized that such a sensitivity analysis is based on the presumption that the shape of the soil water characteristic curve and the relative permeability soil moisture curve remaining more or less the same if such a presumption is found to be invalid in actual applications then the result of sensitivity analysis of ks should not be used five different levels are set for each parameter so 33 times numerical simulations of the fully coupled saturated unsaturated flow system are performed according to the simulation results the critical time and critical space positions of the same parameter with different levels are captured to analyze the sensitivity of the parameters 6 1 sensitivity analysis of tcri1 and zcri1 fig 8 shows the impacts of various controlling parameters on tcri 1 as shown as fig 8 tcri 1 has a linear negative correlation with d 0 l 0 and θr a linear positive correlation with θs and ha a power law relationship with ks a quadratic relationship with λ and a nonlinear relationship with q the increase of the stream stage d 0 means that there is a greater pressure head at the bottom of the stream which stimulates the development of the infiltration process in the sediments under the bottom of the stream and promotes the downward development of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone with a faster rate making the zero flux zone between the lower boundary of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and top boundary of the regional capillary unsaturation zone disappearing with a faster rate that is tcri 1 decreases with the increase of d 0 shown as fig 8a with the increase of the initial depth of the regional saturation zone l 0 the initial elevation difference between the bottom of the stream and the regional saturation zone decreases the initial vertical range of the zero flux zone is shortened and the zero flux zone disappears with a faster rate that is tcri 1 decreases with increasing l 0 shown as fig 8b the increase of θr means the decrease of the maximum water storage space θs θr in the sediments thus reducing the water storage space in the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and increasing the downward migration rate of water at the same time the increase of θr reduces the water storage space in the regional capillary unsaturation zone as well thus increases the upward migration rate of water causing the zero flux zone to disappear with a faster rate that is tcri 1 decreases with increasing θr shown as fig 8c the increase of θs means that the maximum water storage space θs θr in sediments increases thus it has the opposite effect as the increase of θr consequently a greater θs value causes the zero flux zone to disappear with a slower rate that is tcri 1 increases with increasing θs as shown in fig 8d the increase of ha or the decrease of the absolute value of ha means that the capillary force in the sediment is reduced and the moisture absorption capacity is weakened thus the downward migration of water slows down resulting in that the zero flux zone disappears with a slower rate that is tcri 1 increases with increasing ha as shown in fig 8e the increase of ks means that the infiltration capacity in sediments is enhanced thus a greater ks value will lead to the zero flux zone to disappear with a faster rate that is tcri 1 decreases with increasing ks shown as fig 8f λ reflects the uniformity of pore size distribution and a larger λ value implies a more uniform pore size distribution in the soil xie 2015 it can be seen from fig 8g that the zero flux zone increases firstly and then decreases with increasing λ the q value reflects the recharge if q is positive or discharge if q is negative conditions at the base of the regional aquifer a positive or negative q value will cause the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone and the shrinking of the zero flux zone the positive q causes the upward expansion of regional capillary unsaturation zone thus is a wetting process the negative q causes the upward and downward expansion of regional capillary unsaturation zone thus is a drying process see fig s2 in supporting materials if q is equal to 0 the regional saturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone will not change with time and the reduction of the zero flux zone between the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone depends only on the expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone therefore tcri 1 is the largest with q being equal to 0 fig 9 shows the impacts of various controlling parameters on zcri 1 one can see from this figure that zcri 1 has a linear negative correlation with d 0 and ha a linear positive correlation with l0 a logarithmic relationship with ks and λ and a nonlinear relationship with q zcri 1 appears to be independent of θs and θr as can be seen from fig 9 with the stream stage d 0 increasing a larger hydraulic gradient exists in sediments under the bottom of the stream therefore the inverted capillary unsaturation zone develops downward with a faster rate and the zero flux range is shortened as the stream groundwater system is in a disconnected state the expansion rate of the regional capillary unsaturation zone is independent of the stream stage d 0 at the same time the critical time tcri 1 is decreasing shown as fig 8a this means that when the critical moment tcri 1 is reached the elevation of the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone becomes smaller so zcri 1 decreases with increasing d 0 as shown as fig 9a the increase in ha or the decrease in the absolute value of ha means that the capillary force in sediments is reduced and the moisture absorption capacity is weakened thus the gravity drainage capacity is dominating which enlarges the range of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone developing downward and suppress the range of the regional capillary unsaturation zone developing upward therefore zcri 1 decreases with increasing ha shown as fig 9b with the increase of the initial depth of the regional saturation zone l 0 the initial elevation difference between the bottom of the stream and the regional saturation zone decreases the initial range of the zero flux zone is shortened and the elevation when the zero flux zone disappears is increased that is zcri 1 increases with increasing l 0 shown as fig 9c the increase of ks means that the infiltration capacity of sediments is improved thus a greater ks value implies that the water of stream leakage migrates downward with a faster rate and the water recharged from the base of the regional saturation zone migrates upward faster as well for a constant positive q value the downward expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone is along the same direction as the gravity force which promotes the downward expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone to a certain degree on the other hand the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone is against the direction of gravity force which will inevitably suppress the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone to a certain degree therefore comparing with the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone the downward expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone is dominating that is zcri 1 decreases with increasing ks shown as fig 9d with increasing λ the pore size distribution becomes more uniform which promotes the downward expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone that is zcri 1 decreases with increasing λ however with increasing λ the decreasing rate of zcri1 shows a decreasing trend as shown in fig 9e if q is equal to 0 the reduction of the zero flux zone between the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone depends only on the expansion of inverted capillary unsaturation zone therefore zcri 1 is the smallest with q being equal to 0 as shown in fig 9f it is also interesting to see that zcri 1 is independent of θs and θr as shown in fig 9g and fig 9h 6 2 sensitivity analysis of tcri2 tcri3 and zcri2 fig 10 shows the impacts of various controlling parameters on tcri2 and tcri 3 it can be seen from fig 10 that tcri 3 is slightly larger than tcri 2 that is because after a short period of time the negative pressure connected state evolves into the positive pressure connected state it can also be found that tcri 3 and tcri 2 have similar trends in terms of sensitivity to parameters tcri 3 or tcri 2 has a linear negative correlation with d 0 l 0 q and θr a linear positive correlation with θs and ha a power law relationship with ks and a quadratic function relationship with λ a greater stream stage d 0 which causes a greater hydraulic gradient will eventually drive the inverted saturated zone developing downward with a faster rate as a result the unsaturated zone diminishes within a shorter period so that tcri 2 decreases with increasing d 0 on the other hand the increase of d 0 will also promote the rapid development of the seepage process in the fully connected state which makes the negative pressure connected state evolving into the positive pressure connected state within a shorter period of time so tcri 3 decreases with increasing d 0 as shown in fig 10a the increase of the initial depth of the regional saturation zone l 0 shortens the initial range of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap and consequently shortens the lifespan of the unsaturated zone during the evolutional process in another word tcri 2 decreases with increasing l 0 meanwhile due to decreasing tcri 2 the time required for the connected saturated zone to appear will be shortened as well and the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is reduced so tcri 3 decreases with increasing l 0 as shown in fig 10b if q changes from discharge across the base of rap negative q values to recharge across the base of rap positive q values the thickness of regional saturation zone changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend with time and the unsaturated zone will disappear with a faster rate thus tcri 2 decreases as increasing q meanwhile the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is reduced as well therefore tcri 3 decreases as increasing q as shown in fig 10c the increase of θr will reduce the water storage space between iap and rap and will increase the drainage rate below iap and the seepage rate above rap therefore the unsaturated zone disappears with a faster rate or tcri 2 decreases with increasing θr meanwhile the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is reduced as well meaning that tcri 3 decreases with increasing θr as shown in fig 10d the increase of θs has an opposite effect as θr therefore tcri 2 increases with increasing θs and tcri 3 increases with increasing θs as shown in fig 10e with increasing ha the moisture absorption capacity is weakened this will slow down the downward flux below iap and the upward flux above the regional saturation zone as a result the unsaturated zone between iap and rap disappears with a slower rate thus tcri 2 increases with increasing ha meanwhile the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is delayed so tcri 3 increases with increasing ha as shown in fig 10f the increase of ks enhances the infiltration capacity in sediments thus water migrates downward with a faster rate below iap and migrates upward with a faster rate above rap causing the unsaturated zone between iap and rap to be shortened with a faster rate thus tcri 2 decreases with increasing ks meanwhile the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is reduced as well thus tcri 3 decreases with increasing ks as shown in fig 10g the increase of λ will cause the moisture absorption capacity to be weakened delaying the infiltration process in the unsaturated zone and extending the existence duration of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap thus tcri 2 increases with increasing λ and the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is delayed thus tcri 3 increases with increasing λ as shown in fig 10 h fig 11 shows the impacts of the various controlling parameters on zcri 2 it can be seen from fig 11 that zcri 2 has a linear negative correlation with d 0 and ha a linear positive correlation with l 0 and q a logarithmic relationship with ks and λ and independent with θr and θs the increase of d 0 will cause a larger infiltration flux thus will shorten the range of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap therefore zcri 2 decreases with increasing d 0 as shown in fig 11a a greater ha value meaning a smaller magnitude of ha value implies a weaker moisture absorption capacity thus making the iap developing downward to a lower elevation and the rap developing upward to a higher elevation so zcri 2 decreases with increasing ha as shown in fig 11b the increase of l 0 will shorten the initial vertical range of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap thus zcri 2 increases with increasing l 0 as shown in fig 11c as q changes from a negative value to a positive value the elevation of rap changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend with time therefore the position of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap shifts upward or zcri 2 increases with increasing q as shown in fig 11d the increase of λ will make the gravity force to become the dominating factor for driving infiltration flux in respect to the capillary force thus will promote downward development of the inverted saturated zone and suppress upward development of the regional saturation zone therefore the position at which the unsaturated zone disappears will become lower thus zcri 2 decreases with increasing λ as shown in fig 11e similarly zcri 2 decreases with increasing ks as well as shown in fig 11f zcri 2 is independent of θs and θr as can be seen in fig 11 g h near the tcri 3 moment the relationship between the pressure head h and the elevation z rapidly changes to a curve that is approximately parallel to the z axis thus it is not meaningful to analyze the impacts of various controlling parameters on zcri 3 7 discussion 7 1 comparison of the new classification of the connected state to the conventional classification the conventional classification of the connected state is constructed based on the conceptual model of a perennial stream groundwater system before when the regional water table declines the system evolutional process is divided into three states brunner et al 2009a 1 a fully connected state in which the flux between the surface water body and the groundwater is proportional to the head difference between stream stage and regional water table 2 a transitional state in which the flux between the surface water body and the groundwater is no longer a linear function of the head difference between stream stage and regional water table 3 a disconnected state in which the flux is approaching a constant value and the variation of the regional water table does not affect the flux significantly in this classification brunner et al 2009a a fully connected fully saturated state will only occur if the pressure is greater than zero from the bottom of the stream to rwt otherwise the system will be in a transitional or disconnected state when the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a is applied to the system shown in fig 5 we can only provide the critical moment between the fully connected state and the transitional state as shown in the red dotted line between stage 2 and stage 3 in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 7 that the leakage flux at the bottom of the stream approximates a constant over a long period of time for the mulat fine sandy loam it is about 8 h to the 52 h fig 7a for the mulat fine sand it is about 5 h to 25 h fig 7b when comparing the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a with the classification of this paper one can found that 1 the fully connected state of the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a is only the positive pressure connected state of this paper the fully connected state defined in this paper also includes a negative pressure connected state the pressure head is from the air entry head to 0 2 the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a cannot identify the critical moment between the transitional state and the disconnected state this is because the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a focus on investigating the evolutional characteristics of leakage flux at the bottom of the stream instead of analyzing the water migration process within the system as shown in fig 7 when the stream leakage flux gradually approaches a constant the system evolves from the disconnected state with a zero flux zone shown as the left side of the red curve in fig 7 to the transitional state without a zero flux zone shown as the right side of the red curve in fig 7 however such detailed system convolution is not revealed in the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a the theoretical significances of those critical conditions lie not only in the criterion for determining whether there is water exchange between the stream and regional saturation zone but also in the criterion for determining whether there is material and energy transfer between the stream and regional saturation zone depending on hydrodynamic conditions 7 2 the innovations and limitations of the study the paper constructs a new theoretical framework to clarify the evolutional process of the seasonally losing stream groundwater systems without semi permeable stream beds the innovative contributions of this study can be briefly summarized as follows 1 this theoretical framework is based on a more comprehensive description of the process of water migration in the system in this process the evolutional process of the system flow state is followed by unsaturated hydrostatic equilibrium state saturated unsaturated seepage state saturated seepage state with negative pressure and saturated connected state with positive pressure 2 the system evolutional process is investigated based on the dynamic and continuous perspective the system states include disconnected state transitional state negative pressure connected state and positive pressure connected state in sequence with the progress of time 3 the system evolutional process is analyzed with simultaneous consideration of state variables of the seepage process in the system and the evolution of the flow state furthermore the evolutional state and critical conditions of the system change from one state to another state are redefined quantifiable critical condition is proposed and the criterion of system evolutional state is constructed 4 the controlling parameters on the critical time and critical depth in the system is comprehensively analyzed the limitations of this paper are also summarized as follows 1 the theoretical framework constructed is based on an idealized physical model such as stream channel is relatively straight and the streambed sediment properties do not change dramatically along the stream channel the geometric and physical properties of the stream and sediment is symmetric about the vertical plane cutting down across the stream channel center etc the idealized 2d stream groundwater system should be expanded to 3d setup considering more realistic field conditions in the future 2 the control parameters of the system are simplified for example it is assumed that stream stage and sediment bottom recharge discharge are time independent sediments are homogeneous this treatment helps us focus on the system evolutional process driven by the main factors such as the difference between the stream stage and the groundwater level in the system however in a real world setting the stream stage and the recharge discharge of sediment bottom are time dependent and the streambed sediment can be highly heterogeneous and changes along the stream channel therefore the future studies should explore the variation of the evolutional state of the system under the coupling effect of time dependent stream stage and sediment bottom recharge discharge with other variable controlling factors such as heterogeneous sediments asymmetric streams etc 3 this study is limited to the vertical evolutional process of the stream aquifer system future works should also take into account the process of horizontal seepage perpendicular to the stream channel and longitudinal seepage along the stream flow channel 4 the focus of this paper is on water flow and the related evolutional state in the stream aquifer system chemical and heat exchange between stream and the subsurface environment are also active in many stream aquifer system and their evolutional state should also be investigated in the future using this study as a foundation 8 summary and conclusions this study focuses on investigating a seasonally losing stream groundwater system without the semi permeable streambed by simulating the complete evolution from disconnected states to fully connected state and it constructs a new theoretical framework for such evolutional processes the primary conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the seasonally losing stream groundwater system without the semi permeable streambed evolutional states are divided into a disconnected state a transitional state and two fully connected states negative pressure connected state and positive pressure connected state 2 the unique features associated with the disconnected state the transitional state and the fully connected state are the zero flux zone the unsaturated flow zone and the fully saturated flow zone respectively in the disconnected state the flow in the inverted saturated zone the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional saturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone are independent from each other in the transitional state the unsaturated flow zone and the saturated flow zone coexist in the system the fully connected state can be divided into a negative pressure connected state and a positive pressure connected state 3 the critical conditions from the disconnected state to the transitional state and from the transitional state to the negative pressure connected state are the zero flux zone starting to disappear and the unsaturated zone starting to disappear respectively the critical condition from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is that the negative pressure zone starts to disappear 4 the new theoretical framework redefines the evolutional states and critical conditions of the system the new classification extends the range of fully connected state including the positive pressure connected state and the negative pressure connected state and can identify the critical moments between the transitional state and disconnected state in particular the theoretical significance of the latter lies not only in the criterion for determining whether there is water exchange between the stream and regional saturation zone but also in the criterion for determining whether there is material and energy transfer between the stream and regional saturation zone depending on hydrodynamic conditions 5 the analytical solutions of the seepage process in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone are proposed and the corresponding parameter inversion models are constructed the analytical solutions are tested with numerically simulated results using hgs based on the developed analytical solutions the infiltration process in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone can be accurately described 6 the criteria are developed for critical conditions from the disconnected state to the fully connected state compared with the numerical solution the critical condition of the analytic solution more intuitively reflects the physical relationship between the variables in the system and the critical moment and critical position 7 the evolutional process of stream leakage flux is captured taking tcri 2 as the critical time the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream is divided into two stages the first stage corresponds to the disconnected and the transitional states in which the stream recharges to the sediments and the infiltration flux decreases with time the second stage corresponds to the fully connected state in which the seepage flux decreases with time with a greater rate 8 influence of various controlling parameters on the critical conditions are thoroughly analyzed tcri 1 has linear correlations with d 0 l 0 θr ha and θs nonlinear correlations with ks λ and q tcri 2 and tcri 3 have somewhat similar sensitivities to parameters both of them have linear correlations with d 0 l0 q θr θs and ha nonlinear correlations with ks and λ zcri 1 has linear correlations with d 0 ha and l0 nonlinear correlations with ks λ and q zcri 2 has linear correlations with d 0 ha l0 and q nonlinear correlations with ks and λ zcri 1 and zcri 2 are independent of θs and θr the new theoretical framework provides the basis for better management of a seasonally losing stream groundwater system declaration of competing

4067,losing streams are widespread in arid and semi arid regions exploring the evolutional states of losing stream groundwater systems is of great significance to understand the exchanges of water mass and energy in stream aquifer systems this study is devoted to investigate the evolutional process of infiltration flux pressure head and flow states of a seasonally losing stream groundwater system with the semi permeable streambeds missing or without clogging the paper constructs a new theoretical framework for the evolutional states of the system in particular it focuses on investigating the transition among different evolutional states including disconnected state transitional state negative pressure connected state and positive pressure connected state and the critical conditions of transition between connected and disconnected states the critical conditions associated with disconnection or connection are that 1 the zero flux zone starts to disappear 2 the unsaturated zone starts to disappear and 3 the negative pressure zone starts to disappear analytical solutions of those critical conditions are proposed the evolutional process of stream leakage is characterized into two stages the first stage corresponds to the disconnected and transitional states in which the seepage fluxes decrease with time the second stage corresponds to the fully connected state in which the seepage flux decreases rapidly again as time developing finally the influence of various controlling parameters on the critical conditions is analyzed the critical time tcri 1 and critical depth zcri 1 of changing from the disconnected state to the transitional state have nonlinear correlations with saturated hydraulic conductivity ks pore size distribution index λ and flux at the base of the unconfined aquifer q the critical time tcri 2 and the critical depth zcri 2 of changing from the transitional state to the negative pressure connected state and the critical time tcri 3 of changing from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state all have nonlinear correlations with ks and λ zcri 1 and zcri 2 are independent of saturated water content θs and residual water content θr an innovative physical interpretation is given to system evolutional states and quantifiable criteria for those evolutional states are proposed the findings of

introduction the stream groundwater system is one of the key parts of a hydrologic cycle and it involves dynamic and complex exchanges of water mass and energy between two entities streams and groundwater boano et al 2014 constantz 2016 brunner et al 2017 the stream groundwater interaction has profound impacts on a number of issues such as water resource exploitation and management stream system ecological protection and restoration stream bank management etc theis 1941 edwards 1998 osman and bruen 2002 hancock and boulton 2005 boulton et al 2010 wang et al 2011 lawrence et al 2013 boano et al 2014 xian et al 2019 gaining a better understanding of the evolutional characteristics of the stream groundwater system under various climatic and hydrological stresses thus becomes one of the most important tasks in hydrological research the evolution of the stream groundwater system is a complex hydrological process involving many factors such as the hydraulic characteristics of streambed sediments and underlying aquifers the relative elevation of stream stage and water table and stream hydrodynamic conditions brunner et al 2009a b wang et al 2011 lackey et al 2015 jin et al 2017 in the case of a stream fully penetrating the underlying aquifer if the water table is higher than the stream stage the groundwater will be discharged into the stream as base flow the gaining stream osman and bruen 2002 wang et al 2007 otherwise the groundwater will be recharged from the stream the losing stream losing streams are common features in arid and semi arid regions sophocleous et al 1988 braaten and gates 2003 vázquez suñé et al 2007 lamontagne et al 2013 in the case of a stream partially penetrating the underlying aquifer the relative elevation of the stream stage and the water table not only affects the evolution of the recharge and discharge relationship in the stream groundwater system but also affects the evolution of the infiltration pattern in the system as the water table declines the flow state between the stream and groundwater gradually evolves from saturated flow fully connected state to partially saturated flow transitional state and eventually to fully unsaturated flow disconnected state fox and durnford 2003 brunner et al 2009a when the water table rises the seepage pattern between the stream and groundwater will be reversed hu et al 2016 jin et al 2017 if the water table is slightly lower than the bottom of the stream there is a saturation zone between the stream and groundwater and the stream groundwater system is in a fully connected state if the water table is considerably below the bottom of the stream variation of the water table position will not noticeably alter the infiltration rate and this state is called the disconnected state between the above two states there is a transitional state such a state classification for a stream aquifer system is essential to investigate the impact of water table changes on the infiltration flux and flow state the semi permeable streambed is a layer composing of fine sand silt clay or biofilm and it is another important factor of concern affecting the hydraulic connection in a stream aquifer system based on whether there is a semi permeable streambed streams are divided into clogged stream and unclogged streams peterson and wilson 1988 osman and bruen 2002 fox and durnford 2003 xie et al 2014 morel seytoux et al 2016 the semi permeable streambeds are usually found in low energy streams goldschneider et al 2007 streams with fast moving water may not develop the semi permeable streambeds peterson and wilson 1988 xie et al 2014 prior studies show that three possible states of connection transitional and complete disconnection are also possible for a stream aquifer system without a semi permeable streambed reisenauer 1963 wang et al 2011 xie et al 2014 wang et al 2016 jin et al 2017 reisenauer 1963 employed a variably saturated finite difference model simulating the distribution of water content and pressure head in a homogeneous soil beneath an unlined irrigation canal under steady state condition and he showed that an unsaturated zone emerged below the stream xie et al 2014 used numerical simulations to show that a stream aquifer system without the semi permeable streambed can evolve from a fully connected state to a disconnected state wang et al 2011 established a stream aquifer ditch sandbox model to experimentally confirm that a stream aquifer system without a semi permeable streambed can evolve from a fully connected state to a disconnected state the focus of above mentioned investigations is on the evolution of a stream groundwater system caused by regional water table declining with an initially fully connected state such investigations have a number of issues that need our attention firstly water flux between the stream and groundwater is assumed to exist all the time brunner et al 2009a b wang et al 2011 this implies that the stream always holds water and can be treated as a prescribed head or dirichlet boundary condition quichimbo et al 2020 for seasonal streams there will be a period during which the stream channel dries up completely and cannot be described as a prescribed head boundary therefore one cannot use the theoretical framework based on the assumption that water flux between the stream and groundwater always exist for studying the evolutional process of the losing stream groundwater system composed of seasonal streams secondly the above mentioned investigations have adopted a quasi steady state approach meaning that the regional water table changes in a stepwise fashion and the system is assumed to be in a quasi steady state condition at each step wang et al 2011 xie et al 2014 such a quasi steady state treatment is certainly different from reality brunner et al 2009b which is transient and dynamically involving all the time thirdly quantifiable criteria for system state in previous investigations need to be further developed for example the disconnected state is defined as the infiltration rate approximating a constant value and changes of the water table no longer significantly affecting the infiltration rate brunner et al 2009a however there are no criteria for quantifying the manner of approximating a constant value and it is also ambiguous to tell if the changes of water table significantly affect the infiltration or not see section 7 1 compared with the prior theoretical framework this study will construct a new theoretical framework to clarify the evolutional process of the seasonally losing stream groundwater systems without semi permeable stream beds the characteristics of this framework are as follows 1 it captures a more comprehensive system evolutional process from unsaturated hydrostatic equilibrium state to saturated connected state 2 it focuses on the dynamic and continuous evolutional process of the system 3 it analyzes the water migration process within the system and pays great attention to the evolutional process of system state variables such as infiltration flux pressure head and flow states 4 it establishes quantifiable criteria for system states to achieve this goal firstly this paper analyzes the limitations of the prior theoretical framework secondly by analyzing the evolutional process of the system the evolutional states of the system are divided and the critical conditions of the system evolution are constructed and then different evolutional state models and critical state equations are constructed according to the characteristics of system evolutional state and the solutions of evolutional state model and critical state model are obtained the parameter inversion model is constructed to calibrate the parameters in the analytical solutions to test the robustness of the solutions the obtained solutions are compared with high resolution numerical solutions for a number of representative cases finally parameter sensitivity analysis method is used to analyze the characteristics of system evolutional states the general sketch of the paper is shown as fig 1 2 problem description to facilitate the description the regional saturation zone and regional capillary unsaturation zone are defined as shown in fig 2 a the regional saturation zone refers to the traditional unconfined aquifer zone with a positive pressure head zone and the zone above the water table where the pressure head is negative but its magnitude is greater than the magnitude of the air entry pressure head despite of different signs of pressure head those two zones have one thing in common the sediment is fully saturated and the seepage process conforms to the saturated darcy flow the regional capillary unsaturation zone refers to the zone above the regional saturation zone where the water content changes caused by the regional saturation zone shifting and the pressure head is negative and smaller than the air entry pressure head or the magnitude of the negative pressure head is greater than the magnitude of the air entry pressure head the pressure head at the top boundary of regional saturation zone is equal to the air entry pressure head and the top boundary of regional saturation zone is called the regional air entry plane rap the regional saturation zone has no other source or sink terms except for the stream leakage recharge from the top and possible leakage recharge through a semi permeable layer from the bottom if there is no stream leakage recharge or no water in stream regional saturation zone can expand upward if there is sufficiently strong bottom leakage causing regional capillary unsaturation zone to move upward if such a process lasts for a sufficiently long time it is possible for regional saturation zone to reach the bottom of the stream to recharge the stream which may become ponded if there is no sufficiently strong bottom leakage regional saturation zone may not move up considerably and will still be separated from the bottom of the stream thus the zone between the upper boundary of regional saturation zone i e rap and the bottom of the stream is not affected and will retain its initial water content and this zone will remain as a zero flux zone if there is stream leakage recharge within a certain period after the stream leakage occurs the water content in sediment right below the bottom of the stream will be affected by the stream leakage such a zone is above the zero flux zone with the initial unaffected water content below the zero flux zone with the initial water content however there may be another zone whose water content will be altered by the shifting of the underneath regional saturation zone if there is considerable upward bottom leakage at the base of regional saturation zone since there is a zero flux zone separating the overlying zone affected by stream leakage recharge and the underlying zone affected by the bottom leakage at the base of regional saturation zone the influences of stream leakage and regional saturation zone variation are disconnected and independent from each other in order to facilitate the construction of the theoretical framework of the evolutional process of the seasonally losing stream groundwater system several points are notable firstly regional saturation zone variation is caused by the bottom recharge or discharge at the base of the unconfined aquifer the bottom recharge or discharge is possible if the stream is located in a regional discharge or recharge zone if the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer is less than the hydraulic head in the underlying aquifer then the unconfined aquifer will be recharged by the underlying aquifer driving by an upward hydraulic gradient rai et al 2006 otherwise the unconfined aquifer will discharge to the underlying aquifer driving by a downward hydraulic gradient secondly the initial state of the system is assumed to be in a hydrostatic condition meaning that there is no vertical flux in the system of concern at this state for a seasonally losing stream under the interplay of gravity and capillary force the stream water seeps into the underlying sediments and forms an inverted saturated zone specifically the inverted saturated zone includes a zone below the bottom of the stream but above the inverted water table iwt and an inverted capillary zone icz below iwt and above the plane of air entry pressure being called as the inverted air entry pressure plane iap below the inverted saturated zone is an inverted capillary unsaturation zone where the water content changes caused by the inverted saturated zone shifting as can be seen in fig 2a when the seasonally losing stream is disconnected from the underneath groundwater the inverted saturated zone the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional saturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone can coexist with a zero flux zone in between it is evident that for such a disconnected state fig 2a there is no water exchange between the inverted saturated zone the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional saturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone in other words the stream and groundwater are in a complete disconnected state as the stream leakage continues with time the inverted saturated zone and the inverted capillary unsaturation zone will continue to expand downward if there is bottom recharge at the base of the regional saturation zone simultaneously the regional saturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone will also continue to expand upward when the lower boundary of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the top boundary of the regional capillary unsaturation zone start to merge or the zero flux zone disappears the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone are connected forming a uniform unsaturated zone with changing water content called the capillary unsaturation zone because the zero flux zone does not exist anymore in this state the seasonally losing stream groundwater system evolves from a completely disconnected state into a new state signaling the start of the transitional state fig 2b as the stream leakage and or bottom recharge at the base of the unconfined aquifer further continue with time the inverted saturated zone the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and or the regional saturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone will continue to expand further and get closer with each other with time this is the transitional state fig 2c if stream leakage recharge and or the bottom recharge at the base of the unconfined aquifer keep going the inverted capillary unsaturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone will disappear iap and rap will merge into one air entry head plane and the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone start to merge signaling the end of the transitional state and the beginning of the fully connected state fig 2d for this state a fully saturated seepage zone is formed between the stream and the regional saturation zone fig 2e at the early state of such a fully connected state there is still a connected negative pressure zone between iwt and the regional water table rwt thus this early fully connected state is also called the negative pressure connected state fig 2e if stream leakage recharge and or bottom recharge continue further with time the negative pressure zone between iwt and rwt will eventually disappear or iwt and rwt merge into one water table fig 2f signaling the start of a positive pressure connected state fig 2g 3 theory 3 1 models for different evolutional states for some streams the size of sediments may be decreasing downstream this is because larger particles will be deposited first in the upper portion of a stream and finer particles will be gradually deposited along the streamflow direction if considering the particle size changes along the streamflow direction then one must use a three dimensional 3d approach to deal with the problem which is much more complicated and has not been done yet such complexity of streambed has not been considered in this study but it is a very interesting subject to investigate in the future when the scale of interest is much smaller than the scale of considerable particle size change along the streamflow direction the change of particle size along the streamflow direction can be considered to be secondary and the 3d stream groundwater interaction problem may be simplified to a two dimensional 2d problem brunner et al 2009a b wang et al 2011 xie et al 2014 wang et al 2016 according to section 2 the critical point of the system state transition is that the characteristic boundary starts to merge for example when the system changes from the disconnected state to the transitional state the lower boundary of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the top boundary of the regional capillary unsaturation zone start to merge when the system changes from the transitional state to the negative pressure connected state iap and rap start to merge when the system changes from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state iwt and rwt start to merge the relative positions of the front points of these characteristic boundaries determine whether the characteristic boundaries merge or not thus reflecting the transform of the system state for the 2d axisymmetric stream groundwater system profile the geometric and physical properties of the stream and sediment are symmetric about the vertical plane across the stream channel center the z axis on this axis the vertical velocity of water motion is the maximum and the horizontal component is zero therefore the front points of these characteristic boundaries move vertically along the vertical axes across the stream channel center capturing the moving of the front points of these characteristic boundaries on this axis can easily judge the evolution state of the system then the problem can be further simplified to a one dimensional 1d problem that is only the vertical flow is considered in this study we assume a seasonally losing stream with a constant stream stage at wet season and without water at dry season and the underlying sediment is homogeneous with a thickness of d 1 the pressure head at the top boundary of the regional saturation zone is the air entry pressure head ha and the initial thickness of the regional saturation zone is l 0 if the dry season lasts long enough and the lateral flow of groundwater is ignored the infiltration in sediment will eventually reach the hydrostatic state the end of the dry season is set as the initial time of the seasonally losing stream groundwater system atthismoment thesystemisin hydrostaticstate the constant stream stage d 0 is applied instantaneously to simulate the evolution of the system at wet season fig 3 a under the interplay of stream stage gravity and capillary force the inverted saturated zone and the inverted capillary unsaturation zone will be formed underneath the bottom of the stream and continue to expand downward the base of regional saturation zone is set to be a constant flux q 1 where a positive q 1 represents upward vertical flow recharge and a negative q 1 represents downward vertical flow discharge when a positive q 1is presented rap and the regional capillary unsaturation zone move upward based on the system evolutional process described in section 2 several critical moments can be captured as following 1 the zero flux zone starts to disappear which is the critical moment of transition from the disconnected state to the transitional state at this moment the lower boundary of inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the top boundary of regional capillary unsaturation zone merge joining together and becoming one interface the critical depth for the merging of the lower boundary of inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the top boundary of regional capillary unsaturation zone is denoted as zcri 1 and the corresponding critical time is denoted as tcri 1 fig 3b 2 the unsaturated zone with water content θ being smaller than saturated water content θs and pressure head h being smaller than air entry pressure head h a starts to disappear which is the critical moment of transition from the transitional state to the fully connected state at this moment iap and rap merge the critical depth for the merging of iap and rap is denoted as zcri 2 and the corresponding critical time is denoted as tcri 2 fig 3c 3 the negative pressure saturated zone starts to disappear which is the critical moment of transition from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state at this moment iwt and rwt merge the critical depth for the merging of iwt and rwt is denoted as zcri 3 and the corresponding critical time is denoted as tcri 3 fig 3d for the stream groundwater system without a semi permeable streambed shown in fig 3 one can either use a fully coupled saturated unsaturated modeling approach or a decoupled saturated modeling and unsaturated modeling approach with some continuity conditions maintained at the interface of the saturated and unsaturated zones the advantage of the fully coupled saturated unsaturated modeling approach is that the stream groundwater system is considered as an integrated system due to the highly nonlinear nature of the fully coupled saturated unsaturated flow system analytical modeling is nearly impossible to obtain and numerical simulation has to be utilized this section however will adopt the decoupled saturated modeling and unsaturated modeling approach to search for analytic solutions which have a number of advantages in terms of gaining physical insights and conducting system analysis as well as carrying out inverse modeling or parameter estimation for the sake of comparison we will also report the numerical simulation of a fully coupled saturated unsaturated flow system in section 4 and demonstrate the difference of numerical simulation and analytical solutions of this section in section 5 the conceptual model fig 3b describes the critical moment between the disconnected state and the transitional state in the disconnected state the sediment can be divided into three zones as the inverted saturated zone the unsaturated zone and the regional saturation zone respectively the flow in those zones can be described by mathematical models shown as eqs 1 3 respectively 1a z k s h z 0 z iha z 0 t 0 1b h z t t 0 z z i h a 0 z i h a 0 d 0

infiltration strength of rap w 2 in eq 6 the parameter inversion model is shown in section s3 in supporting materials 3 2 3 conditions from the disconnected state to the transitional state the critical condition for the evolution of the seasonally losing stream groundwater system from the disconnected state to the transitional state is that the zero flux zone starts to disappear which can be described by eq 7 7a q z z c r i 1 k s h z z z c r i 1 0 7b q z z z c r i 1 z k s h z z z c r i 1 0 7c q t z z c r i 1 t k s h z z z c r i 1 0 obviously due to the nonlinear characteristics of eq 2 the critical moment tcri 1 and the hydraulic head profile at the critical moment are difficult to obtain analytically however we can use a finite difference approximation to deal with the critical condition and transform eq 7 to q i j 0 q i 1 j 0 q i 1 j 0 and q i j 1 0 qi j is the flux at the i th space nodes and the j th time nodes cm s qi 1 j is the flux at the i 1 th space nodes and the j

and eq 6a the analytical solution for the hydraulic head profile in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone can be obtained 3 2 4 conditions from the transitional state to the fully connected state the critical condition for the evolution of the seasonally losing stream groundwater system from the transitional state to the fully connected state is when the unsaturated zone starts to disappear or the saturated zone starts to connect shown as fig 3c and eq 8 8 z c r t 2 z iha d 1 l 0 l t according to eq 8 and considering eqs 5b and 6b the critical moment and critical position from the transitional state to the fully connected state can be written as eq 9a and eq 9b respectively while by substituting eq 8 into eq 5a the hydraulic head profile in inverted saturated zone can be written as eq 9c and by substituting eq 6b into eq 6a and considering the time being tcrt 2 the hydraulic head profile in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone can be written as eq 9d respectively 9a t c r t 2 μ rha d 1 l 0 z iha t t c r t 2 k s w 2 q 1 k s w 2 9b z iha t t c r t 2 k s w 1 d 0 h a k s ln k s w 1 d 0 h a k s z iha t t c r t 2 k s w 1 d 0 h a k s

from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state the conceptual model shown as fig 3d describes the critical moment where the seasonally losing stream groundwater system evolves from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state the corresponding critical condition can be described as eq 10 10 z c r t 3 z iwt z rwt where z iwt and z rwt are the elevations of iwt and rwt respectively 4 numerical simulation of the fully coupled saturated unsaturated flow system this section will capture the evolutional characteristics of the seasonally stream groundwater system and test the robustness of the proposed critical conditions and analytical solutions in section 3 hydrogeosphere hgs hgs user manual 2015 is used to simulate the 1d constant head infiltration process and then according to the critical conditions described in section 3 2 the seasonally losing stream groundwater system will be divided into different stages to capture the characteristics of those states there are a number of reasons to conduct the numerical simulations here firstly as there are no other experimental data and former analytical solutions that are comparable to the analytical works of this study numerical modeling provides a certain degree of assurance on the developed solutions secondly numerical model can deal with complex boundary and initial conditions and media heterogeneity flexibly thirdly numerical models such as hgs have not been employed conventionally to deal with the dynamic losing stream groundwater systems that involve two different kinds of water tables one is iwt and the other is rwt during the disconnected and transitional states and multiple states of evolution thus we are curious to see whether or not the hgs model can perform reasonably well for a losing stream groundwater system and it is compared with the analytical solution in this study in the hgs model the soil layer thickness is set to be 500 cm the reference surface is the bottom of the stream and the initial hydraulic head is computed using the hydrostatic condition the upper boundary is the constant head boundary with a hydraulic head d 0 of 40 cm the lower boundary is the constant flux boundary with a recharge flux q 1 of 0 1 cm hr the initial regional saturation zone thickness l 0 is 50 cm the brooks corey model hgs user manual 2015 is used to determine the water retention data and relative permeability coefficient kr as shown in eq 11 and eq 12 respectively 11 s w s wr 1 s wr h a h λ f o r h h a 1 f o r h h a 12 k r k s s e 2 λ l p 2 where λ is the pore size distribution index dimensionless h is the pressure head cm lp is the pore connectivity parameter assumed equaling to 2 0 in brooks and corey 1964 and se is often called an effective saturation given by se sw swr 1 swr with sw being the water saturation dimensionless and sw r being the residual water saturation dimensionless two floridian soils mulat fine sand and mulat fine sandy loam were used carlisle et al 1989 tested the water retention data of the soils and the physical parameters are shown in table 1 nachabe 2002 the sw h and kr se functions will determine the profiles of water content and pressure head distribution thus both of them will affect the critical time and critical depth of the system evolutional states the detailed sensitivity analysis of parameters associated with the sw h and kr se functions will be discussed in section 6 since the lower boundary of the model is set as a recharge condition with a constant upward flux the losing stream of the simulated stream groundwater system will eventually transform to a gaining stream therefore above simulation will be terminated at the moment when the losing stream is changed to a gaining stream for the mulat fine sandy loam it is 52 9 hr for the mulat fine sand such a moment is 25 6 hr after the start of simulation one may also compare the hgs numerical model results with the developed analytical solutions in several ways for instance for a set of given input parameter values one can use hgs to compute the hydraulic heads and conditions of transition among different states and compare the results with those obtained using the proposed solution to see if they agree with each other or not in another way one can compute the hydraulic heads using hgs based on the given input parameters and then substitute the computed hydraulic heads into the inverse model developed based on the analytical solutions see section s3 in supporting materials and to see if the inverted parameter values agree with the original input parameter values in the hgs model 5 results the unique features associated with the disconnected state the transitional state and the fully connected state are the zero flux zone the unsaturated flow zone and the fully saturated flow zone respectively thus the infiltration flux profile is used to capture the zero flux zone to show the evolutional process of the disconnected state and the pressure head profile is used to show the evolutional process of the transitional and fully connected states in addition the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream is one of the incentive conditions of losing stream groundwater system evolutional process the change of infiltration flux will change the system evolutional process thus it will also be discussed in this section 5 1 infiltration flux profile during the disconnected state fig 4 shows the evolution of infiltration flux below the bottom of the stream with space and time for the disconnected state at the beginning of this state the system has the largest capillary force and the greatest hydraulic gradient in the sediments adjacent to the bottom of the stream so the infiltration flux is the largest during the disconnected state saturated vertical flows occur in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone while unsaturated vertical flows occur in the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone in the inverted capillary unsaturation zone under the interplay of capillary force and gravity a certain portion of water is stored in the pore space and the remaining part flows downward according to the inversed capillary water force balance theory the capillary force generated at the meniscus at the end of capillary water may be in the same direction as gravity or in the opposite direction against the gravity depending on the curvature of the meniscus see fig s1 in supporting materials this phenomenon indicates that the capillary force generated at the meniscus at the end of capillary water can either enhance downward flow or suppress downward flow when the upward capillary force is less than gravity the combined capillary force and gravity cause the overall downward flow when the upward capillary force equals gravity the force is in equilibrium when the capillary force and gravity reach a dynamic equilibrium all the water will be stored in the pore space and downward flow ceases to exist in the regional capillary unsaturation zone some water is stored in the pore space and the other flows upward when the capillary force and gravity reaches a dynamic equilibrium all the water will be stored in the pore space and upward flow disappears the zone between the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone is a zero flux zone that is not affected by the stream leakage and the water fluctuation in the regional saturation zone the range of the zero flux zone gradually decreases with time as an example for the mulat fine sandy loam the critical moment tcri 1 of transition from the disconnected state to the transitional state is 33 hr and zcri 1 is 282 cm for the mulat fine sand the critical time tcri 1 is 13 98 hr and the zcri 1 is 316 cm as shown in table 2 5 2 pressure head profile during the transitional state and fully connected state fig 5 shows the evolution of pressure head with time and space for the transitional and fully connected states one can see that the evolutional process of flow states and pressure heads show three different stages in stage 1 saturated flow and unsaturated flow occur simultaneously on the profile in stage 2 only saturated flow occurs but pressure heads can be positive or negative in stage 3 only saturated flow occurs on the profile and pressure heads are positive stage 1 is a transitional state of the system evolving from the disconnected state to the fully connected state for the mulat fine sandy loam the critical time tcri 2 at which the system evolves from the transitional state to the fully connected state is 52 32 hr and the critical elevation zcri 2 is 344 58 cm for the mulat fine sand the critical time tcri 2 is 25 38 hr and the critical elevation zcri 2 is 393 cm stage 2 is the negative pressure connected state the duration of this state is relatively short being about 0 03 hr for the mulat fine sandy loam and about 0 006 hr for the mulat fine sand stage 3 is the positive pressure connected state and the associated specific values for this stage are shown in table 2 fig 6 shows the evolution of iap and rap and comparison of the analytical and numerical solutions fig 6 shows that the elevation of iap decreases with time in a nonlinear manner and the elevation of rap increases with time in a nonlinear manner as well the moment when iap and rap intersect is the critical time tcri 2 of the transitional state evolving to the fully connected state to evaluate the analytical solution the parameter inversion model in section s3 in supporting materials is used for the mulat fine sandy loam the observation point is buried at the elevation of 10 cm and 19 cm in the inverted saturated zone and 410 cm and 420 cm in the regional saturation zone the start time t 0 of inversion is 0 6 hr and the end time of inversion is 30 hr for the mulat fine sand the observation point is buried at the elevation of 20 cm and 30 cm in the inverted saturated zone and 421 cm and 430 cm in the regional saturation zone the start time t 0 of inversion is 0 6 hr and the end time of inversion is 15 hr table 3 shows the parameter estimation results it can be found that except for the relative errors of l t0 which are more than 5 the relative errors of other parameters between the input parameter values in hgs and estimated parameter values using the analytical model are all less than 5 substituting the estimated parameter values in table 3 into eqs 5b and 6b respectively the curves of iap and the regional saturation zone with time estimated by the analytical solution can be obtained shown as the red lines in fig 6 it can be found that the analytical solution agrees with the numerical solution satisfactorily substituting the estimated parameter values in table 3 into eq 9 the critical time tcri 2 and the critical elevation zcri 2 can be estimated by eq 9 the relative errors of the critical time tcri 2 and the critical elevation zcri 2 estimated using hgs and the analytical solution are respectively 16 29 and 1 92 for the mulat fine sandy loam and are respectively 10 67 and 3 43 for the mulat fine sand as shown in table 2 the different tcri 2 and zcri 2 values obtained using these two models hgs versus analytical model are due to different degrees of generalization of these two physical models the hgs model considers saturated unsaturated flow while the analytical model eqs 1 and 3 considers saturated flow only meanwhile to obtain the analytical solution of eqs 5 and 6 the specific yield and the infiltration strength are assumed to be constant to represent their temporally averaged values 5 3 evolutional characteristics of the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream fig 7 shows the evolution of the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream with time in general the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream decreases using tcri 2 as the critical moment the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream is divided into two stages the first stage includes the disconnected state and transitional state in the disconnected state the stream leakage flux shows a nonlinear decreasing trend especially at the early stage the stream recharges the underneath sediment with a large leakage rate the main reason is that the pressure head at the lower boundary of the inverted saturated zone under the bottom of the stream is always maintained at ha see fig 5 and the flow path is shorter at the early stage of stream leakage see fig 6 thus a larger hydraulic gradient is generated in the inverted saturated zone causing a larger leakage flux another explanation is that during the early time both capillary and gravity force cause downward flow below the stream by increasing the water content of the sediments over time the capillary force is diminished and this reduces the infiltration rate as time develops the flow path in the inverted saturated zone becomes longer thus the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream decreases and the decreasing rate of the infiltration flux also drops in the transitional stage the variation trend of the stream leakage flux with time is close to linear when time reaches tcri 2 the saturated zone is connected and the evolutional process of stream leakage enters the second stage at the second stage the flow is saturated and the seepage flux decreases rapidly again as time developing in fig 7 qlc is the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream estimated using the analytical solution it can be seen that the infiltration flux estimated using the analytical solution agrees nicely with the flux estimated with hgs in the disconnected and transitional states 6 sensitivity analysis to estimate the impacts of various controlling parameters on the critical times the single factor sensitivity analysis brunner et al 2009a is conducted and the parameters of concern are d 0 q l 0 ks λ ha θs and θr θr is residual water content cm3 cm3 d 0 and q determine the potential recharge from the upper and lower boundaries to the sediment within the system l 0 determines the initial water head profile in sediment within the system ks λ ha θs and θr determine the physical properties of sediments within the system all these factors will affect the water migration process in the system and then affect the system evolutional process the mulat fine sandy loam and the physical model are used to conduct sensitivity analysis the base case simulation uses d 0 40 cm l 0 50 cm q 0 1 cm hr ks 0 62 cm hr λ 1 36 ha 39 1 cm θs 0 309 and θr 0 136 we use the base case as a reference and only change one parameter at one time with the others being their base values as the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is dependent on the moisture content thus when sensitivity analysis of ks is carried out using the single factor analysis method the soil water characteristic curve and relative permeability coefficient relationship are assumed to be fixed or independent of ks however coarse grain materials may show higher saturated hydraulic conductivity but lower unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for relatively lower water content or drier condition than the finer grains in another word when the ks varies over several orders of magnitude covering coarse grain materials and fine grain materials it will be difficult to keep the shape of the soil water characteristic curve and the relative permeability soil moisture curve remaining the same to remedy this problem to a certain degree the range of ks value discussed in the sensitivity analysis varies only within one order of magnitude in general ks varying in the range of one order of magnitude usually does not result in significant changes in lithology for example the ks range of clayey sand is 0 36 cm hr 7 2 cm hr the ks range of sandy loam is 0 36 cm hr 3 6 cm hr mao et al 2009 it should be emphasized that such a sensitivity analysis is based on the presumption that the shape of the soil water characteristic curve and the relative permeability soil moisture curve remaining more or less the same if such a presumption is found to be invalid in actual applications then the result of sensitivity analysis of ks should not be used five different levels are set for each parameter so 33 times numerical simulations of the fully coupled saturated unsaturated flow system are performed according to the simulation results the critical time and critical space positions of the same parameter with different levels are captured to analyze the sensitivity of the parameters 6 1 sensitivity analysis of tcri1 and zcri1 fig 8 shows the impacts of various controlling parameters on tcri 1 as shown as fig 8 tcri 1 has a linear negative correlation with d 0 l 0 and θr a linear positive correlation with θs and ha a power law relationship with ks a quadratic relationship with λ and a nonlinear relationship with q the increase of the stream stage d 0 means that there is a greater pressure head at the bottom of the stream which stimulates the development of the infiltration process in the sediments under the bottom of the stream and promotes the downward development of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone with a faster rate making the zero flux zone between the lower boundary of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and top boundary of the regional capillary unsaturation zone disappearing with a faster rate that is tcri 1 decreases with the increase of d 0 shown as fig 8a with the increase of the initial depth of the regional saturation zone l 0 the initial elevation difference between the bottom of the stream and the regional saturation zone decreases the initial vertical range of the zero flux zone is shortened and the zero flux zone disappears with a faster rate that is tcri 1 decreases with increasing l 0 shown as fig 8b the increase of θr means the decrease of the maximum water storage space θs θr in the sediments thus reducing the water storage space in the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and increasing the downward migration rate of water at the same time the increase of θr reduces the water storage space in the regional capillary unsaturation zone as well thus increases the upward migration rate of water causing the zero flux zone to disappear with a faster rate that is tcri 1 decreases with increasing θr shown as fig 8c the increase of θs means that the maximum water storage space θs θr in sediments increases thus it has the opposite effect as the increase of θr consequently a greater θs value causes the zero flux zone to disappear with a slower rate that is tcri 1 increases with increasing θs as shown in fig 8d the increase of ha or the decrease of the absolute value of ha means that the capillary force in the sediment is reduced and the moisture absorption capacity is weakened thus the downward migration of water slows down resulting in that the zero flux zone disappears with a slower rate that is tcri 1 increases with increasing ha as shown in fig 8e the increase of ks means that the infiltration capacity in sediments is enhanced thus a greater ks value will lead to the zero flux zone to disappear with a faster rate that is tcri 1 decreases with increasing ks shown as fig 8f λ reflects the uniformity of pore size distribution and a larger λ value implies a more uniform pore size distribution in the soil xie 2015 it can be seen from fig 8g that the zero flux zone increases firstly and then decreases with increasing λ the q value reflects the recharge if q is positive or discharge if q is negative conditions at the base of the regional aquifer a positive or negative q value will cause the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone and the shrinking of the zero flux zone the positive q causes the upward expansion of regional capillary unsaturation zone thus is a wetting process the negative q causes the upward and downward expansion of regional capillary unsaturation zone thus is a drying process see fig s2 in supporting materials if q is equal to 0 the regional saturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone will not change with time and the reduction of the zero flux zone between the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone depends only on the expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone therefore tcri 1 is the largest with q being equal to 0 fig 9 shows the impacts of various controlling parameters on zcri 1 one can see from this figure that zcri 1 has a linear negative correlation with d 0 and ha a linear positive correlation with l0 a logarithmic relationship with ks and λ and a nonlinear relationship with q zcri 1 appears to be independent of θs and θr as can be seen from fig 9 with the stream stage d 0 increasing a larger hydraulic gradient exists in sediments under the bottom of the stream therefore the inverted capillary unsaturation zone develops downward with a faster rate and the zero flux range is shortened as the stream groundwater system is in a disconnected state the expansion rate of the regional capillary unsaturation zone is independent of the stream stage d 0 at the same time the critical time tcri 1 is decreasing shown as fig 8a this means that when the critical moment tcri 1 is reached the elevation of the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone becomes smaller so zcri 1 decreases with increasing d 0 as shown as fig 9a the increase in ha or the decrease in the absolute value of ha means that the capillary force in sediments is reduced and the moisture absorption capacity is weakened thus the gravity drainage capacity is dominating which enlarges the range of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone developing downward and suppress the range of the regional capillary unsaturation zone developing upward therefore zcri 1 decreases with increasing ha shown as fig 9b with the increase of the initial depth of the regional saturation zone l 0 the initial elevation difference between the bottom of the stream and the regional saturation zone decreases the initial range of the zero flux zone is shortened and the elevation when the zero flux zone disappears is increased that is zcri 1 increases with increasing l 0 shown as fig 9c the increase of ks means that the infiltration capacity of sediments is improved thus a greater ks value implies that the water of stream leakage migrates downward with a faster rate and the water recharged from the base of the regional saturation zone migrates upward faster as well for a constant positive q value the downward expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone is along the same direction as the gravity force which promotes the downward expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone to a certain degree on the other hand the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone is against the direction of gravity force which will inevitably suppress the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone to a certain degree therefore comparing with the upward expansion of the regional capillary unsaturation zone the downward expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone is dominating that is zcri 1 decreases with increasing ks shown as fig 9d with increasing λ the pore size distribution becomes more uniform which promotes the downward expansion of the inverted capillary unsaturation zone that is zcri 1 decreases with increasing λ however with increasing λ the decreasing rate of zcri1 shows a decreasing trend as shown in fig 9e if q is equal to 0 the reduction of the zero flux zone between the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional capillary unsaturation zone depends only on the expansion of inverted capillary unsaturation zone therefore zcri 1 is the smallest with q being equal to 0 as shown in fig 9f it is also interesting to see that zcri 1 is independent of θs and θr as shown in fig 9g and fig 9h 6 2 sensitivity analysis of tcri2 tcri3 and zcri2 fig 10 shows the impacts of various controlling parameters on tcri2 and tcri 3 it can be seen from fig 10 that tcri 3 is slightly larger than tcri 2 that is because after a short period of time the negative pressure connected state evolves into the positive pressure connected state it can also be found that tcri 3 and tcri 2 have similar trends in terms of sensitivity to parameters tcri 3 or tcri 2 has a linear negative correlation with d 0 l 0 q and θr a linear positive correlation with θs and ha a power law relationship with ks and a quadratic function relationship with λ a greater stream stage d 0 which causes a greater hydraulic gradient will eventually drive the inverted saturated zone developing downward with a faster rate as a result the unsaturated zone diminishes within a shorter period so that tcri 2 decreases with increasing d 0 on the other hand the increase of d 0 will also promote the rapid development of the seepage process in the fully connected state which makes the negative pressure connected state evolving into the positive pressure connected state within a shorter period of time so tcri 3 decreases with increasing d 0 as shown in fig 10a the increase of the initial depth of the regional saturation zone l 0 shortens the initial range of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap and consequently shortens the lifespan of the unsaturated zone during the evolutional process in another word tcri 2 decreases with increasing l 0 meanwhile due to decreasing tcri 2 the time required for the connected saturated zone to appear will be shortened as well and the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is reduced so tcri 3 decreases with increasing l 0 as shown in fig 10b if q changes from discharge across the base of rap negative q values to recharge across the base of rap positive q values the thickness of regional saturation zone changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend with time and the unsaturated zone will disappear with a faster rate thus tcri 2 decreases as increasing q meanwhile the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is reduced as well therefore tcri 3 decreases as increasing q as shown in fig 10c the increase of θr will reduce the water storage space between iap and rap and will increase the drainage rate below iap and the seepage rate above rap therefore the unsaturated zone disappears with a faster rate or tcri 2 decreases with increasing θr meanwhile the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is reduced as well meaning that tcri 3 decreases with increasing θr as shown in fig 10d the increase of θs has an opposite effect as θr therefore tcri 2 increases with increasing θs and tcri 3 increases with increasing θs as shown in fig 10e with increasing ha the moisture absorption capacity is weakened this will slow down the downward flux below iap and the upward flux above the regional saturation zone as a result the unsaturated zone between iap and rap disappears with a slower rate thus tcri 2 increases with increasing ha meanwhile the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is delayed so tcri 3 increases with increasing ha as shown in fig 10f the increase of ks enhances the infiltration capacity in sediments thus water migrates downward with a faster rate below iap and migrates upward with a faster rate above rap causing the unsaturated zone between iap and rap to be shortened with a faster rate thus tcri 2 decreases with increasing ks meanwhile the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is reduced as well thus tcri 3 decreases with increasing ks as shown in fig 10g the increase of λ will cause the moisture absorption capacity to be weakened delaying the infiltration process in the unsaturated zone and extending the existence duration of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap thus tcri 2 increases with increasing λ and the critical time for the evolution of the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is delayed thus tcri 3 increases with increasing λ as shown in fig 10 h fig 11 shows the impacts of the various controlling parameters on zcri 2 it can be seen from fig 11 that zcri 2 has a linear negative correlation with d 0 and ha a linear positive correlation with l 0 and q a logarithmic relationship with ks and λ and independent with θr and θs the increase of d 0 will cause a larger infiltration flux thus will shorten the range of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap therefore zcri 2 decreases with increasing d 0 as shown in fig 11a a greater ha value meaning a smaller magnitude of ha value implies a weaker moisture absorption capacity thus making the iap developing downward to a lower elevation and the rap developing upward to a higher elevation so zcri 2 decreases with increasing ha as shown in fig 11b the increase of l 0 will shorten the initial vertical range of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap thus zcri 2 increases with increasing l 0 as shown in fig 11c as q changes from a negative value to a positive value the elevation of rap changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend with time therefore the position of the unsaturated zone between iap and rap shifts upward or zcri 2 increases with increasing q as shown in fig 11d the increase of λ will make the gravity force to become the dominating factor for driving infiltration flux in respect to the capillary force thus will promote downward development of the inverted saturated zone and suppress upward development of the regional saturation zone therefore the position at which the unsaturated zone disappears will become lower thus zcri 2 decreases with increasing λ as shown in fig 11e similarly zcri 2 decreases with increasing ks as well as shown in fig 11f zcri 2 is independent of θs and θr as can be seen in fig 11 g h near the tcri 3 moment the relationship between the pressure head h and the elevation z rapidly changes to a curve that is approximately parallel to the z axis thus it is not meaningful to analyze the impacts of various controlling parameters on zcri 3 7 discussion 7 1 comparison of the new classification of the connected state to the conventional classification the conventional classification of the connected state is constructed based on the conceptual model of a perennial stream groundwater system before when the regional water table declines the system evolutional process is divided into three states brunner et al 2009a 1 a fully connected state in which the flux between the surface water body and the groundwater is proportional to the head difference between stream stage and regional water table 2 a transitional state in which the flux between the surface water body and the groundwater is no longer a linear function of the head difference between stream stage and regional water table 3 a disconnected state in which the flux is approaching a constant value and the variation of the regional water table does not affect the flux significantly in this classification brunner et al 2009a a fully connected fully saturated state will only occur if the pressure is greater than zero from the bottom of the stream to rwt otherwise the system will be in a transitional or disconnected state when the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a is applied to the system shown in fig 5 we can only provide the critical moment between the fully connected state and the transitional state as shown in the red dotted line between stage 2 and stage 3 in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 7 that the leakage flux at the bottom of the stream approximates a constant over a long period of time for the mulat fine sandy loam it is about 8 h to the 52 h fig 7a for the mulat fine sand it is about 5 h to 25 h fig 7b when comparing the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a with the classification of this paper one can found that 1 the fully connected state of the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a is only the positive pressure connected state of this paper the fully connected state defined in this paper also includes a negative pressure connected state the pressure head is from the air entry head to 0 2 the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a cannot identify the critical moment between the transitional state and the disconnected state this is because the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a focus on investigating the evolutional characteristics of leakage flux at the bottom of the stream instead of analyzing the water migration process within the system as shown in fig 7 when the stream leakage flux gradually approaches a constant the system evolves from the disconnected state with a zero flux zone shown as the left side of the red curve in fig 7 to the transitional state without a zero flux zone shown as the right side of the red curve in fig 7 however such detailed system convolution is not revealed in the conventional classification of the connected state brunner et al 2009a the theoretical significances of those critical conditions lie not only in the criterion for determining whether there is water exchange between the stream and regional saturation zone but also in the criterion for determining whether there is material and energy transfer between the stream and regional saturation zone depending on hydrodynamic conditions 7 2 the innovations and limitations of the study the paper constructs a new theoretical framework to clarify the evolutional process of the seasonally losing stream groundwater systems without semi permeable stream beds the innovative contributions of this study can be briefly summarized as follows 1 this theoretical framework is based on a more comprehensive description of the process of water migration in the system in this process the evolutional process of the system flow state is followed by unsaturated hydrostatic equilibrium state saturated unsaturated seepage state saturated seepage state with negative pressure and saturated connected state with positive pressure 2 the system evolutional process is investigated based on the dynamic and continuous perspective the system states include disconnected state transitional state negative pressure connected state and positive pressure connected state in sequence with the progress of time 3 the system evolutional process is analyzed with simultaneous consideration of state variables of the seepage process in the system and the evolution of the flow state furthermore the evolutional state and critical conditions of the system change from one state to another state are redefined quantifiable critical condition is proposed and the criterion of system evolutional state is constructed 4 the controlling parameters on the critical time and critical depth in the system is comprehensively analyzed the limitations of this paper are also summarized as follows 1 the theoretical framework constructed is based on an idealized physical model such as stream channel is relatively straight and the streambed sediment properties do not change dramatically along the stream channel the geometric and physical properties of the stream and sediment is symmetric about the vertical plane cutting down across the stream channel center etc the idealized 2d stream groundwater system should be expanded to 3d setup considering more realistic field conditions in the future 2 the control parameters of the system are simplified for example it is assumed that stream stage and sediment bottom recharge discharge are time independent sediments are homogeneous this treatment helps us focus on the system evolutional process driven by the main factors such as the difference between the stream stage and the groundwater level in the system however in a real world setting the stream stage and the recharge discharge of sediment bottom are time dependent and the streambed sediment can be highly heterogeneous and changes along the stream channel therefore the future studies should explore the variation of the evolutional state of the system under the coupling effect of time dependent stream stage and sediment bottom recharge discharge with other variable controlling factors such as heterogeneous sediments asymmetric streams etc 3 this study is limited to the vertical evolutional process of the stream aquifer system future works should also take into account the process of horizontal seepage perpendicular to the stream channel and longitudinal seepage along the stream flow channel 4 the focus of this paper is on water flow and the related evolutional state in the stream aquifer system chemical and heat exchange between stream and the subsurface environment are also active in many stream aquifer system and their evolutional state should also be investigated in the future using this study as a foundation 8 summary and conclusions this study focuses on investigating a seasonally losing stream groundwater system without the semi permeable streambed by simulating the complete evolution from disconnected states to fully connected state and it constructs a new theoretical framework for such evolutional processes the primary conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the seasonally losing stream groundwater system without the semi permeable streambed evolutional states are divided into a disconnected state a transitional state and two fully connected states negative pressure connected state and positive pressure connected state 2 the unique features associated with the disconnected state the transitional state and the fully connected state are the zero flux zone the unsaturated flow zone and the fully saturated flow zone respectively in the disconnected state the flow in the inverted saturated zone the inverted capillary unsaturation zone and the regional saturation zone the regional capillary unsaturation zone are independent from each other in the transitional state the unsaturated flow zone and the saturated flow zone coexist in the system the fully connected state can be divided into a negative pressure connected state and a positive pressure connected state 3 the critical conditions from the disconnected state to the transitional state and from the transitional state to the negative pressure connected state are the zero flux zone starting to disappear and the unsaturated zone starting to disappear respectively the critical condition from the negative pressure connected state to the positive pressure connected state is that the negative pressure zone starts to disappear 4 the new theoretical framework redefines the evolutional states and critical conditions of the system the new classification extends the range of fully connected state including the positive pressure connected state and the negative pressure connected state and can identify the critical moments between the transitional state and disconnected state in particular the theoretical significance of the latter lies not only in the criterion for determining whether there is water exchange between the stream and regional saturation zone but also in the criterion for determining whether there is material and energy transfer between the stream and regional saturation zone depending on hydrodynamic conditions 5 the analytical solutions of the seepage process in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone are proposed and the corresponding parameter inversion models are constructed the analytical solutions are tested with numerically simulated results using hgs based on the developed analytical solutions the infiltration process in the inverted saturated zone and the regional saturation zone can be accurately described 6 the criteria are developed for critical conditions from the disconnected state to the fully connected state compared with the numerical solution the critical condition of the analytic solution more intuitively reflects the physical relationship between the variables in the system and the critical moment and critical position 7 the evolutional process of stream leakage flux is captured taking tcri 2 as the critical time the infiltration flux at the bottom of the stream is divided into two stages the first stage corresponds to the disconnected and the transitional states in which the stream recharges to the sediments and the infiltration flux decreases with time the second stage corresponds to the fully connected state in which the seepage flux decreases with time with a greater rate 8 influence of various controlling parameters on the critical conditions are thoroughly analyzed tcri 1 has linear correlations with d 0 l 0 θr ha and θs nonlinear correlations with ks λ and q tcri 2 and tcri 3 have somewhat similar sensitivities to parameters both of them have linear correlations with d 0 l0 q θr θs and ha nonlinear correlations with ks and λ zcri 1 has linear correlations with d 0 ha and l0 nonlinear correlations with ks λ and q zcri 2 has linear correlations with d 0 ha l0 and q nonlinear correlations with ks and λ zcri 1 and zcri 2 are independent of θs and θr the new theoretical framework provides the basis for better management of a seasonally losing stream groundwater system declaration of competing

4068,high water consumption in large irrigation districts has resulted in large river water diversion and serious water use conflicts in the yellow river basin yrb the excessive water applied is also a cause of the dual problems of soil salinity and water logging in the upper yrb which further negatively impacts crop yields this study is aimed at modeling and analyzing the agro ecohydrological processes and water use performance in large irrigation districts of the yrb the hetao irrigation district hetao a super large irrigation district located in the upper yrb was selected as a typical research area a watershed hydrological model swat ag with enhanced capacity for simulating regional agro ecohydrological processes was adopted in this study we simulated the agro ecohydrological processes in hetao and analyzed the regional characteristics of depth to groundwater table soil moisture and salt content evapotranspiration and crop yield water accounting was further carried out to interpret water cycle processes and evaluate water use performance in hetao results indicated that hetao was characterized by shallow depth to groundwater table high soil moisture and high evapotranspiration for farmland there was a decreasing trend for both soil moisture and evapotranspiration from the upper to lower regions in hetao but this decreasing trend was not found for natural land further results showed soil salt content has strong spatial variations with land use type crops and shallow groundwater environments correspondingly crop yields presented a decreasing trend from the upper to lower regions of hetao with large spatial variabilities closely related to the spatial distribution of soil water and salt conditions across hetao it was worth noting that the regional water use efficiency was relatively low in hetao especially with large proportions of non beneficial water consumption to total water consumption overall this study provided a thorough understanding of agro ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics and the current situation of irrigation water use issues in the whole hetao district and further provided valuable insights in improving water use and management in large irrigation districts of the upper yrb keywords agro ecohydrological modeling water use performance crop yields shallow groundwater arid climate 1 introduction high water consumption is one of the critical issues in arid irrigation districts however high water consumption in arid irrigation districts may cause water use conflict between upstream and downstream areas this conflict has become a great concern and it is common throughout the world such as in the colorado river basin in the united states the murray darling basin in australia and the yellow river basin yrb in china chen et al 2003 cong et al 2009 haddeland et al 2006 molle et al 2010 thoms and sheldon 2000 tian et al 2019 yang et al 2004 as a typical example yrb is known for its important role in the social economic development of china in yrb there are two large irrigation districts called hetao and qingtongxia located in its arid upper region lanzhou toudaoguai reach fig 1 a both of these irrigation districts have become the most dominant water users in yrb based on yellow river water resources bulletins published by the yellow river water conservancy commission yrcc during the years of 2010 2015 surface water diversion in the lanzhou toudaoguai reach accounted for about 39 of total surface water diversion from the yellow river 15 5 billion m3 out of 40 2 billion m3 and agricultural irrigation water in the lanzhou toudaoguai reach amounted to 13 0 billion m3 however due to the high water consumption in the upper yrb the lower yrb has faced severe water issues of continuously decreasing discharge and even discontinuous flow chen et al 2003 cong et al 2009 piao et al 2010 tian et al 2019 yang et al 2004 these issues have severely restricted sustainable development especially the yrb ecosystem therefore the situation highlights the importance of water savings for these large irrigation districts in the upper yrb to achieve this goal it is critically important to assess water use performance in these irrigation districts at the cost of high water consumption irrigation districts are able to maintain crop yields under the arid climatic conditions however if water management is improper irrigation districts may face the problems of waterlogging and soil salinization these problems may have an impact on crop yields and they have attracted much attention from water management authorities that intend to improve water use efficiency and crop yields as well as attention from hydrologists that aim at understanding of agro hydrological processes and their coupling in arid agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater morway et al 2013 singh 2016 singh et al 2010 tavakoli kivi et al 2019 this is especially true for those irrigation districts with inefficient irrigation practices and inadequate drainage where the regional groundwater is overall shallow due to the percolation of irrigated fields and the seepage of canals the shallow groundwater then results in waterlogging problems for low lying areas in addition the shallow groundwater also contributes to salt build up through upward water flux under the arid climatic condition resulting in a severe problem of secondary soil salinity these problems eventually have an impact on crop yields therefore to confront these problems a thorough understanding of agro ecohydrological processes is important which raises the particular concern of modeling and analyzing the agro ecohydrological processes in such irrigation districts models are powerful and efficient tools for quantifying hydrological processes and there have been numerous studies of modeling and quantifying regional hydrological processes using various models e g mike she vic swat topkapi modflow swatmod which mainly focus on either regional runoff generation variation or regional groundwater flow processes arnold et al 1998 ciarapica and todini 2002 kim et al 2008 liang et al 1994 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 refsgaard 1997 however model development for modeling regional agro ecohydrological processes and their couplings e g coupling hydrological processes and crop growth yield is still at an early stage while related modeling studies are also relatively rare siad et al 2019 furthermore it is also challenging to conduct regional modeling studies in irrigation districts under conditions of shallow groundwater and arid climate samimi et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge most regional hydrological modeling studies have over simplified the hydrological processes regarding agricultural effects e g effects from canal ditch system and agronomic practices and the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum besides these oversimplifications it is worth noting that few previous regional hydrological modeling studies considered the soil salinity problem and its role in hydrological processes however soil salinity is of great concern for agricultural watersheds due to its influence on crop water use and productivity minhas et al 2020 singh 2016 wichelns and qadir 2015 xiong et al 2021 as a result it seems to be far from reasonable for these previous studies to simulate the agro ecohydrological processes in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater therefore the main objective of this study is to model and analyze the agro ecohydrological processes and water use performance of the irrigation districts with shallow groundwater and arid climate in the upper yrb a typical agricultural watershed hetao was selected as the study area the swat ag model was adopted due to its capacity for simulating agro ecohydrological processes in agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater which was evaluated in our small scale modeling case study xiong et al 2019 this study expanded our previous study to a larger area and a more complex irrigation and drainage system the specific objectives are 1 to simulate the agro ecohydrological processes of an arid irrigation district with shallow groundwater 2 to show the regional characteristics of agro ecohydrological processes in such an irrigation district considering the spatially heterogeneous land use pattern crop pattern irrigation soil type groundwater table etc 3 to analyze the water use performance in hetao and its subdistricts overall this study provided an understanding of agro ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics and the current situation of irrigation water use in the whole hetao district further provided insights in improving water use and management in large irrigation districts of the upper yrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hetao a part of wuliangsuhai basin is a super large irrigated agricultural watershed located in the upper yrb with arid climatic conditions fig 1a known as one of the three largest irrigation districts of china hetao is one of the most dominant water users in the yrb in recent years about 48 6 108 m3 water was annually diverted for hetao from the yellow river according to the records during the years of 1990 2015 from bayannaoer water resources bulletin published by the hetao irrigation district administration bureau the total area of hetao is around 1 12 mha of which about 60 is irrigated farmland according to the meteorological records during the years 1981 2010 http data cma cn the mean annual evaporation 20 cm pan is larger than 2200 mm but the mean annual precipitation is only about 140 220 mm with a decreasing trend from east to west most rainfall occurs in may september accounting for more than 85 of the annual precipitation the mean annual temperature is around 8 c with the lowest and highest monthly average temperature values being 10 c in january and 24 c in july respectively hetao is a south west to north east tilting flat plain the ground slope in hetao is 1 5000 1 8000 from west to east and 1 4000 to 1 8000 from south to north the ground elevation ranges from 1000 to 1100 m above sea level due to the flat topography a dense network of canals and ditches was built in hetao to support irrigation and enhance drainage fig 2 a the main canal is located in southern hetao it diverts and allocates water flows from west to east alongside the yellow river the main ditch is located in northern hetao and it flows from west to east until wuliangsu lake where it then drains into the yellow river in addition there are also 13 secondary canals and 12 secondary ditches flowing from south west to north east based on these main and secondary canals and ditches hetao was divided into 5 subdistricts for water management from west to east the 5 subdistricts are referred to as wulanbuhe jiefangzha yongji yichang and wulate fig 1b moreover for each subdistrict the lower order canals and ditches were built for regulating water allocation and drainage fig 2a in hetao basin irrigation irrigation applied with forming a flat basin is the major irrigation method with the major water resources from the yellow river water from the yellow river is diverted 6 times during the crop growing season i e from may to september whereas the sixth water diversion named autumn irrigation starts after harvest the autumn irrigation is mainly for the purposes of salt leaching pest prevention and increasing soil water content which supports crop growth in the early stage of the next year 2 2 swat ag model the original swat model was developed for predicting the impact of management practices on hydrological processes and related processes in complex watersheds with varying slopes soils and land use conditions arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 however the swat model is far from sufficient to be applied in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater tables due to soil salinity dynamics and its impacts on crop growth are ignored and the interactions among surface water soil water groundwater and vegetation are over simplified liu et al 2010 luo et al 2008 sophocleous and perkins 2000 xiong et al 2019 therefore swat ag was proposed by xiong et al 2019 with significant modifications based on the swat framework swat ag is a semi distributed hydrological model with enhanced capacity for simulating regional agro ecohydrological processes the swat ag model inherits the capabilities e g hydrological modeling and assessment and the advantages e g modeling robustness effectiveness and comprehensiveness of swat it is based on a water balance based mechanism and adopts the framework of subbasin and hru hydrological response unit division thus it is efficient and robust in handling regional modeling with complex environmental conditions in particular swat ag incorporates novel significant functions including 1 the simulation of capillary rise effects 2 the simulation of soil salt movement and salt stress on plant growth and 3 the simulation of groundwater dynamics with a water balance based module for shallow aquifers i e involving canal seepage and ditch drainage calculation these enable swat ag to capture the complex interactions among agroecosystem processes e g plant growth soil water salt dynamic and fluctuation of depth to groundwater table especially for arid climatic and shallow groundwater environments additional description of swat ag can be found in xiong et al 2019 in addition we found that the flood routing module of swat and swat ag was not directly applicable to agricultural watersheds like hetao because flow in channels i e ditches is significantly interfered with by water management in swat and swat ag flood routing uses two optional modules i e the variable storage and the muskingum routing method neitsch et al 2011 and they adopt constant parameters taking the muskingum routing method as an example the equations contain constant parameter sets x f 1 and f 2 as follows v s k x q in 1 x q out k f 1 k f f 2 k 0 1 f where v s is the storage volume m3 q in is the inflow rate m3 s q out is the discharge rate m3 s k is the storage time constant for the reach s x is the weighting factor f 1 and f 2 are weighting coefficients input by the user k f is the storage time constant calculated for the reach segment with bankfull flows s k 0 1 f is the storage time constant calculated for the reach segment with one tenth of bankfull flows s however in hetao due to the non uniform landscapes pumping stations were built at the end of the drainage ditches to improve drainage and the flow pattern significantly varied with different operation situations of the pumping stations therefore it may not be reasonable to adopt constant parameters in flood routing as a result we modified the swat ag model to adopt variable parameters in the muskingum routing method allowing it to adopt different parameter sets x f 1 and f 2 corresponding to different flow patterns specifically the flow rate was distinguished by using a flow rate threshold q th with different parameter sets x f 1 and f 2 for the high and normal flow rate conditions respectively 2 3 model set up 2 3 1 data preparation soil water content and soil salinity were obtained with soil samples collected in years of 2015 and 2016 huang et al 2018 the soil sampling was carried out based on two sets of sampling points one set with 213 points provided data sampled at the beginning of may the other set with 68 points provided data sampled every month from may to september fig 1b theses soil samples were collected every 10 cm in the top 0 20 cm layer and at 20 cm increments below the top layer until the 100 cm depth soil water content was measured using the oven drying method and converted to volumetric water content and the soil bulk density at the depth of 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm was measured using stainless steel rings the soil salt content ssc g kg 1 was determined from the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract using the calculation method suggested by xu et al 2013 groundwater data were collected from the hetao irrigation district administration bureau hidab including observations of depth to groundwater table and total dissolved solids which were obtained from a total of 260 monitoring wells installed in hetao fig 1b for the years of 2015 and 2016 190 of them were available with monitoring of depth to groundwater table for every 5 days for average of depth to groundwater table during the period from may to september both the mean and standard deviation were 2 3 m additionally 93 of the wells also monitored water quality every 1 2 months fig 1b for average of total dissolved solids during the period from may to september the mean and standard deviation were 3 6 g l and 4 3 g l respectively hydrogeological data were obtained from a total of 111 drill holes across hetao fig 1b there is a surficial holocene aquifer to a depth of 1 8 76 2 m with specific yield being 0 01 0 49 the flow rate records of ditches were provided by hidab with a total of 15 ditch gauge stations fig 1b among these stations 10 of them monitored outflow rates of no 1 10 secondary ditches and provided monthly flow rate records in years 2015 and 2016 for the monthly outflow rate of these secondary ditches their average peaked at about 2 1 m3 s in may and it declined to about 1 3 m3 s and less than 1 m3 s for june july and august september respectively in addition there are another 5 gauge stations along the main ditch located in northern hetao h huangji p peijiaqiao l liufenqiao s shagaibulong x xishanzui wherein s and x gauge stations provided daily flow records according to the records from the s gauge station the outflow rate of the main ditch reached as high as 50 m3 s at the end of may and it averaged about 20 m3 s during the period from may to september the digital elevation model dem at 90 m spatial resolution was available from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm the soil map on a 1 1 000 000 scale was obtained from the harmonized world soil database fig 2d hwsd nachtergaele et al 2009 the land use data set was provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn crop pattern data regarding the distribution of sunflower maize and wheat fig 2c were provided by wen et al 2019 they are the dominant crops and accounted for more than 85 of the total farmland of hetao in recent years wen et al 2019 the meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model meng 2016 data regarding agricultural management practices were collected from an on site survey and hidab involving the data of planting and harvesting soil surface mulching information and irrigation regimes i e amount and timing of irrigation 2 3 2 watershed delineation data processing and model initialization watershed delineation was performed in two different ways for hetao and the mountain regions in northern wuliangsuhai basin respectively afterwards the two delineation results were integrated into the overall watershed delineation of the whole study area fig 2b for hetao as a flat plain its watershed delineation was performed manually based on the distribution of canals and ditches so as to reasonably describe the hydrological processes dominated by water management infrastructure in hetao for watershed delineation of hetao ditches were used to serve as predefined streams while canals served as boundaries of subbasins moreover watershed delineation of the mountain region in north of hetao was performed in an automated way in arcswat as a result the study area was divided into 214 subbasins as shown in fig 2b then these sub basins were further divided into hrus based on combination of land use crop pattern soil type and land slope as a result there were 7347 hrus generated for the year 2015 with the numbers of hrus being 6221 and 1126 for hetao and mountain regions respectively there were 7333 hrus generated for the year 2016 with the numbers of hrus being 6215 and 1118 for hetao and mountain regions respectively various agricultural management practices involving irrigation planting mulching and harvesting were considered the effects of nitrogen phosphorus stress were ignored because the applied fertilization is usually excessive in hetao the corresponding management schedules are presented in table 1 the initial pattern of soil water salt conditions were obtained from interpolation of sampling points data meanwhile the initial patterns of depth to groundwater table and groundwater quality were obtained from interpolation of monitoring well data the initial values of soil parameters were obtained from the hwsd dataset and our previous studies ren et al 2017 ren et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 the parameters for capillary rise were obtained from hsiao et al 2009 parameters to quantify plant growth of specific species were initialized as suggested by hao et al 2015 the initial values for salinity stress parameters were determined according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 and ren et al 2016 the groundwater parameters were obtained according to xu et al 2010 and on site survey of drill holes to derive a reasonable antecedent condition of model state variables the swat ag model was initialized by inputting the spatial data of soil water content soil salt content and depth to groundwater table instead of applying a model spin up this is because the current swat and swat ag models are not able to capture the soil freeze thaw process and it may underestimate the soil water content during winter thus a model spin up may cause unreasonable antecedent conditions especially soil water content further influencing the simulation of agro hydrological processes e g crop growth soil water dynamic and groundwater fluctuation 2 4 model calibration and validation the swat ag model was calibrated and validated using observations in years 2015 and 2016 respectively the datasets included observed flow rate observation of depth to groundwater table and remote sensing actual evapotranspiration et from yu et al 2019 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup swat calibration uncertainty procedures abbaspour and johnson 2004 was used to conduct the sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation a more detailed description of the sufi2 algorithm and its application with swat can be found in abbaspour et al 2007 the initial ranges of parameters were determined based on relevant previous literature especially those using swat and those in hetao luan et al 2018 ren et al 2016 ren et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 xue and ren 2017 afterwards parameters were calibrated using 3 steps 1 parameters were calibrated with flow rate observations using swat cup 2 parameters were calibrated with depth to groundwater table soil water content soil salt content and evapotranspiration observations this was accomplished by repeatedly performing a trial and error procedure 3 repeating steps 1 and 2 until the results of calibration are satisfied during the above procedures multiple statistical evaluation criteria were employed including nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse root mean square error rmse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr coefficient of determination r 2 and mean relative error mre moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 for the criteria nse 1 represents a perfect fit and smaller nse indicates poor performance rmse 0 indicates a perfect fit to the data and smaller rmse means better performance rsr 0 means optimal fit and smaller rsr means better performance r 2 1 means optimal fit and smaller r 2 indicates poor performance mre 0 indicates a perfect fit to the data and smaller absolute mre value means better performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization and performance 3 1 1 model parametrization the calibrated parameters are listed in table 2 and table a 1 in hetao the runoff potential is low with the curve number values being relatively low ranging from 18 to 55 for the flows in hetao a major contribution is the open ditch drainage where the depth to drain is 1 5 3 m and the drainage spacing is 150 500 m the flows route to the main channels i e main secondary and tertiary ditches while the related parameters are different between high level and low level ditches the designed discharge of high level ditches is high where ditch width is 30 m ditch depth is 3 m manning s n value is 0 02 and slope along the ditches is 0 00008 the designed discharge of low level ditches is low where the ditch width is 14 m ditch depth is 1 5 m manning s n value is 0 035 and slope along the ditches is 0 00012 additionally note that flow pattern significantly varied with high and normal flow rate conditions where the muskingum weighting factors of the bankfull flows are 0 5 and 0 2 for high and normal flow rate conditions respectively moreover salt tolerance parameters vary with crop types where sunflower is most salt tolerant a value of 10 5 ds m 1 for the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract above which salt stress happens ect while maize and wheat are moderately salt tolerant values of ect being lower than 6 ds m 1 3 1 2 model performance results showed an overall good model performance during calibration year 2015 and validation year 2016 periods as well as during an additional validation period years 2013 2014 the results showed that swat ag captured well the agro hydrological processes i e flow rate depth to groundwater table evapotranspiration and soil water and salt during the calibration and validation periods results showed that the observations of flow rate matched well with the simulations table 3 fig 3 compares simulated flow rates and observed ones for 14 gauged stations in hetao and there is a good agreement between simulations and observations table 3 and table a 2 for daily flow rate nse values were larger than 0 66 r 2 values were larger than 0 7 and rsr values were less than 0 6 for monthly flow rate nse and r 2 values were larger than 0 45 and rsr values were less than 0 75 in addition for depth to groundwater table the simulations were also consistent with the observations during the periods of calibration and validation table 3 the monthly results of simulated and observed depth to groundwater table in hetao are shown in fig 4 overall results and detailed results of model performance evaluation are shown in table 3 and table a 3 respectively the overall results showed very good model performance table 3 nse values were larger than 0 7 r 2 values were larger than 0 75 and rsr values were less than 0 6 this is also confirmed by the detailed results table a 3 while it only showed an acceptable model performance in wulanbuhe and wulate which may be related to the complex water management in these subdistricts wulanbuhe has been carrying out an ecological water supplement project in recent years with water being directly diverted into water bodies for maintaining groundwater levels additionally in wulate a proportion of irrigated areas has been shifting to using groundwater which lowered the groundwater table in some areas furthermore during the additional validation period years 2013 2014 for both flow rate and depth to groundwater table results also showed an overall good agreement between simulations and observations table a 4 fig a 1 compares the simulated flow rates and observed ones for 14 gauge stations in hetao in years 2013 2014 as can be seen simulations matched well with observations in most cases while it showed a relatively poor agreement for no 1 and 6 7 ditches this discrepancy may be attributed to engineering projects because hetao has been implementing projects of ditch renovation during recent years additionally the monthly results of simulated and observed depth to groundwater table in hetao in years 2013 2014 are shown in fig a 2 it also showed an overall good model performance for hetao while there was only an acceptable model performance for wulanbuhe and wulate the simulated et was in acceptable agreement with the remote sensing et fig 5 table a 5 in most subdistricts of hetao jiefangzha yongji and yichang the mre values were lower than 15 and the rmse values lower than 90 mm i e 0 6 mm d additionally the values of mre and rmse were 16 and 112 mm in wulate and that values were 22 and 123 mm in wulanbuhe however it should be noted that remote sensing et data had a coarse resolution 250 1000 m and such resolution may not be sufficient to provide field scale et results such resolution may cause mixed pixel problems i e one pixel often covers different kinds of land cover types zhang et al 2018 which is evident in hetao due to the fragmented land use and crop patterns ren et al 2019b moreover the spatial distributions of the simulated and observed soil water content soil salt content and depth to groundwater table the averages during the period from may to september 2015 are provided in fig 6 results showed that there was good agreement between the simulated and observed variables therefore all of the above analysis indicated that the swat ag model was well calibrated and validated and can be used to describe the complicated agro ecohydrological processes and perform water use evaluation in hetao 3 2 characteristics of regional agro ecohydrological processes and crop yields 3 2 1 characteristics of depth to groundwater table in our study we calculated the average depth to groundwater table gwda during the period from may to september in 2015 the mean and standard deviation of gwda for each subdistrict are presented in table 4 the results showed that the gwda values in hetao were overall shallow with the mean values fluctuating between 1 3 m and 2 m among the subdistricts of hetao the gwda values were the highest around 2 m in yongji followed by jiefangzha yichang and wulate with values of about 1 6 m while the gwda values in wulanbuhe were the lowest about 1 3 m in addition the gwda in natural land was close to that in farmland with the difference being less than 0 3 m to further analyze the spatial characteristics of gwda across hetao the gwda was classified as shallow 1 5 m reasonable 1 5 2 0 m and deep 2 0 m according to previous studies with respect to the growth response of natural vegetation and crops to varied groundwater conditions in hetao ren et al 2017 ren et al 2018a xiong et al 2021 as shown in fig 6c in most areas of hetao the gwda values were in the shallow or reasonable range the areas with shallow gwda values 1 5 m accounted for 36 of the total area of hetao which were located in southern wulanbuhe northwestern jierfangzha and western wulate as well as dispersed in southern yichang in addition the areas with reasonable gwda values 1 5 2 0 m accounted for about half of the total area of hetao which were located in northern wulanbuhe southeastern jiefangzha northern yongji and eastern wulate as well as dispersed in the center and north of yichang in some areas the gwda values were in the deep range 2 0 m which were located in southern yongji and dispersed in the north of the main ditch 3 2 2 characteristics of soil moisture the average soil water content swca in the soil depth of 0 100 cm during the period from may to september was calculated with the mean and standard deviation of swca for each subdistrict shown in table 4 the swca was overall higher in farmland for the upper hetao than that in the lower hetao with mean values about 0 30 cm3 cm3 and 0 25 cm3 cm3 in the upper and lower hetao respectively note that the difference between the upper and lower regions was more significant for sunflower compared to maize and the mean values in the lower hetao decreased to 0 23 cm3 cm3 and 0 26 cm3 cm3 for sunflower and maize respectively this was attributed to the differences in irrigation regimes across hetao the irrigation amount decreased from the upper to lower regions of hetao and was especially significant for sunflower however for natural land the swca differences between the upper and lower hetao were insignificant and the swca values were relatively close among different subdistricts fluctuating between 0 23 and 0 26 cm3 cm3 the spatial distribution of swca is presented in fig 6a the results showed that swca values have strong spatial variability in each subdistrict compared with the distributions of gwda fig 6c and swca fig 6a it was evident that depth to groundwater table was an important factor affecting the soil water content across hetao the areas with low gwda often have relatively high swca such as the northwestern jiefangzha northern yongji and central yichang whereas the areas with low swca values coincide with areas with high gwda such as the southern yongji and northern yichang however note that this relationship between swca and gwda was insignificant in some local areas such as the central wulanbuhe this is because central wulanbuhe is a desert for which the soil water holding capacity was very low 3 2 3 characteristics of soil salinity the average soil salt content ssca in the soil depth of 0 100 cm during the period from may to september in 2015 was also analyzed the mean and standard deviation of the ssca for each subdistrict are shown in table 4 the ssca varied significantly with land use types and crops overall the ssca values of natural land were much higher than that of farmland with 3 7 g kg and 1 4 g kg for natural land and farmland respectively in addition a significant difference in ssca values was also found for different crops the ssca for sunflower was higher than that for maize with the mean values of 1 9 g kg and 1 0 g kg for sunflower and maize respectively the difference of ssca among land use types and crops was likely to originate in human intervention in hetao farmland with slightly saline soil or non saline soil is often planted with salt sensitive crops like maize while that with moderately saline soil is planted with salt tolerant crops like sunflower additionally the significant variation of ssca with land use types and crops was in line with the results of ren et al 2019a the spatial distribution of ssca is shown in fig 6b strong spatial variability of ssca values was found which seems to be related to the spatially varied gwda comparing the spatial distribution of ssca with the distribution of gwda fig 6bc it was evident that the areas with high ssca values were identical to the areas with shallow groundwater such as northwestern jiefangzha and southern yichang in contrast the areas with low ssca values were identical to the areas with deep groundwater being especially evident in southern yongji this may be because deep groundwater contributes to reducing salt accumulation in the soil profile and promoting salt leaching in irrigated fields additionally the relationship between soil salinity and gwda was also supported by a previous study in a typical sub irrigation district in hetao ren et al 2019a furthermore for an interpretation of relationship between soil salinity and gwda we obtained the simulated soil salt accumulation sscacc for soil depth of 0 100 cm during the period from may to september and its spatial distribution is shown in fig a 3a with positive values indicating soil salt accumulation while negative values indicating soil salt leaching as can be seen there was an overall soil salt accumulation trend across hetao with sscacc in most areas ranging from 0 to 0 4 g kg this overall trend of soil salt accumulation was also found in observations of our 68 soil sampling points where the average and standard deviation of salt accumulation in soil depth of 0 100 cm were 0 22 g kg and 0 50 g kg respectively additionally note that some areas showed a relatively significant soil salt accumulation trend sscacc 0 4 g kg which was likely related to the over shallow gwda condition e g in northwestern jiefangzha and the southern yichang 3 2 4 evapotranspiration across hetao the cumulative actual evapotranspiration et total precipitation and total irrigation during the period from may to september in 2015 were also analyzed the mean and standard deviation of et total precipitation and total irrigation for each subdistrict are shown in table 4 the results showed that et values varied significantly with land use types the et values for farmland reached a mean value of about 510 mm while those for natural land were only about 250 mm except for water bodies however note that the et values for both farmland and natural land were much higher than the recharge from total precipitation and total irrigation with mean values about 80 mm and 240 mm for total precipitation and total irrigation respectively this difference between the et values for natural land and farmland was also estimated in previous studies at both the field and regional scale with these et results being close to the simulated et in this study bai et al 2017 ren et al 2016 yu et al 2019 in addition results also showed that there was an overall decreasing trend for et values for farmland from the upper to lower regions of hetao the mean values for both sunflower and maize reached more than 550 mm in upper hetao while in lower hetao they decreased to about 450 mm and 520 mm for sunflower and maize respectively this may be attributed to the difference of irrigation regimes and soil water conditions across hetao as mentioned before the irrigation amount and farmland average soil water content decreased from the upper to lower regions of hetao with the decreasing trend being especially significant for sunflower further this decreasing trend of et for farmland across hetao was also confirmed by data from previous studies yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 however the decreasing trend was not found for et of natural lands results showed their et values were similar among the subdistricts of hetao except for wulanbuhe with a relatively low et due to the large desert areas in this subdistrict this phenomenon was also observed by zhang et al 2019 to further analyze the spatial characteristics of et the spatial distribution of et values are presented in fig 7 b results show that there was large spatial variability of et across hetao the spatial variability of et was mainly related to the fragmented land cover types and partly affected by soil water and salinity conditions by comparing the spatial distributions of et swca and ssca fig 7b fig 6a and b it was evident that areas with high et values were identical to areas with high swca and low ssca values such as northeastern jiefangzha and northern yongji this was because the high soil water content provided sufficient water supply for evapotranspiration while the low soil salt content implied only a slight salt stress or even no salt stress in contrast results showed that the areas with low et were identical to the areas with low swca and or high ssca such as the western jiefangzha southern yichang and the edge of wulate 3 2 5 crop yields crop production is the primary purpose of irrigation districts the crop yields of maize and sunflower in 2015 were simulated with their mean and standard deviation for each subdistrict shown in table 4 results show that crop yields varied among subdistricts reflecting the influence from different irrigation regimes among subdistricts for sunflower the irrigation amount sharply decreased from upper to lower regions of hetao with the total irrigation amount changing from 405 mm to 125 mm accordingly sunflower yields also decreased from more than 3 t ha to about 2 5 t ha these results were in agreement with the data from bayannur statistical yearbook where the average of sunflower yields in the lower region i e wulate is only 2 7 t ha while values were 3 2 3 8 t ha in upper regions i e yichang yongji jiefangzha wulanbuhe additionally for maize there was also a decrease of irrigation amount from upper to lower regions of hetao with the total irrigation amount decreasing from more than 200 mm to about 150 mm thus maize yields also decreased accordingly from more than 10 t ha to about 9 5 t ha this was also consistent with the data from the bayannur statistical yearbook where the average of maize yields decreased from 11 2 to 11 7 t ha in jiefangzha and yongji to 10 8 10 9 t ha in yichang and wulate the spatial distributions of crop yields for maize and sunflower in 2015 are presented in fig 7c results showed significant spatial variability of crop yields which was related to the spatial variations of soil water and salt conditions across hetao by comparing the spatial distributions of crop yields swca and ssca fig 7c fig 6a and b it was evident that the areas with high crop yields were identical to the areas with high swca and low ssca values such as northeast jiefangzha and northern yongji this was because high soil water content and low soil salt content implied sufficient water supply and mild or even no salinity stress results showed that the areas with low crop yields were identical to areas with low swca and or high ssca such as western jiefangzha edge of yichang and central wulate to assist with interpretation of soil water salt condition influence on crop growth the water and salt stress during the crop growing season were obtained fig a 3 shows the spatial distributions of average soil water stress factor swfa and average soil salt stress factor ssfa during the period from may to september in 2015 with low values indicating severe stress conditions as can be seen the low crop yields in western jiefagnzha and southern yichang were attributed to the severe salt stress conditions with ssfa values being 0 7 and 0 7 0 8 in western jiefagnzha and southern yichang respectively additionally it was found that the low crop yields in northern yichang and central wulate were caused by severe water stress conditions with swfa values being 0 7 0 8 and 0 6 0 7 in northern yichang and central wulate respectively 3 3 water use performance 3 3 1 water use efficiency water accounting during the crop growing season was carried out to evaluate water use performance in hetao with systematic analyses of hydrological processes and water balances the water accounting diagram provided the information related to water flows and fluxes among key specific domains e g groundwater unsaturated zone of farmland and natural lands canals ditches and the yellow river during the period from may to september 2015 fig 8 there was relatively high water use efficiency in hetao during the growing season this was because that groundwater domain received canal seepage and deep percolation from fields and then replenished the unsaturated zone through capillary rise finally the supplemental water provided by groundwater to the unsaturated zone was reused by crops resulting in a high water use efficiency in hetao this was consistent with findings of previous studies gao et al 2018 ren et al 2018b xiao et al 2021 however our results also showed that the water use during the growing period heavily depended on the antecedent soil water and groundwater storage recharged by irrigation in the non growing season i e large autumn irrigation after harvest in the previous year this implied that it may overestimate the water use efficiency if ignoring the part of soil water that recharged during the non growing season as shown in fig 8 for the whole hetao water consumption during the growing season amounted to 47 2 108 m3 involving 26 5 and 20 7 108 m3 for evapotranspiration from farmlands and natural lands respectively correspondingly water recharge amounted to 30 9 108 m3 involving 10 1 11 1 and 9 7 108 m3 for precipitation irrigation and canal seepage respectively for the difference between water consumption and recharge it accounted for more than 30 of the consumption during the growing season indicating a large dependence on antecedent soil water and groundwater storage that recharged during the non growing season in the previous year therefore it was necessary to consider the water recharge storage from non growing period irrigation and its contribution to crop growth in order to reasonably assess the water use performance in hetao based on this we proposed a more appropriate equation to calculate the regional water use efficiency rwue as follows 3 rwue et f a r m l a n d g s n w d gs p gs n w d ngs p ngs where subscript gs refers to the growing season from may to september in current year subscript ngs refers to the non growing season from october in the previous year to april in current year et farmland is the farmland evapotranspiration m3 nwd is the net water diversion from the yellow river m3 p is the total precipitation m3 the value of nwd was obtained from canal flow rate data provided by hidab with eq 3 the rwue of hetao with the value being only 0 40 is significantly lower than the value of 0 57 in a similar arid agricultural watershed in northeast china wu et al 2015 xu et al 2019 and far lower than the value of 0 7 0 9 in those areas with efficient irrigation technologies andrés and cuchí 2014 skhiri and dechmi 2012 this approach provided a better understanding of water use efficiency in hetao as compared with previous studies because the previous studies lack a systematic analysis of agro ecohydrological processes gao et al 2018 xue et al 2017 3 3 2 non beneficial water consumption the water accounting diagram shows a relatively large proportion of non beneficial water consumption to total water consumption fig 8 in hetao the non beneficial water consumption namely soil evaporation in natural land and farmland amounted to 23 7 108 m3 which accounted for about 47 of the total water consumption i e evapotranspiration and drainage and there was also a similar value of non beneficially water use fraction assessed with water accounting by sun et al 2016 additionally it should also be noted that evapotranspiration partitioning showed a relatively large proportion of soil evaporation to evapotranspiration especially that proportion in natural land was as high as 70 while the proportion in farmland was not that high the proportion being 35 these values were close to the evaporation evapotranspiration ratio calculated in ren et al 2016 and ren et al 2019b to further analyze non beneficial water consumption across hetao water accounting was further performed for each subdistrict of hetao fig 9 the proportion of soil evaporation to total water consumption pnbc and the proportion of soil evaporation to evapotranspiration e et were used as indicators of non beneficial water consumption as can be seen most subdistricts showed a high proportion of non beneficial water consumption among them the proportion of non beneficial water consumption in wulanbuhe was the highest with the values of pnbc and e et for natural land being as high as 65 and 87 respectively in contrast yongji had the lowest proportion of non beneficial water consumption where the value of pnbc was only 37 and value of e et for natural land was only 50 the proportions of non beneficial water consumption were close for jiefangzha yichang and wulate where the values of pnbc ranged from 42 to 52 and the values of natural land e et ranged from 65 to 77 3 4 contribution limitations and future work this study provided a thorough understanding of agro ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics and current irrigation water use issues in the whole hetao by extending to a regional scale this study is of more practical significance than previous modeling studies that were limited to a field scale ren et al 2016 ren et al 2017 ren et al 2018a additionally by capturing the agro ecohydrological processes and their couplings this study provides more explicit information of agro ecohydrological processes as compared with previous studies that adopted water balance sun et al 2016 xu et al 2010 and provides a more comprehensive assessment of water use as compared with the previous modeling works that only focused on a specific component of the hydrological system i e surface vadose zone and aquifer luan et al 2018 xu et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 therefore this study may contribute in providing valuable insights in improving water use and management in large irrigation districts of the upper yrb however it should be noted that the agro ecohydrological processes were simulated only for the growing season in this study this is because the current swat ag model was still not sufficient to characterize the freeze thaw cycles in the winter season the freeze thaw cycles dominated soil water salt dynamics during the non growing period and had significant effects on soil water salt and groundwater conditions in the initial growing season in hetao as well as in other irrigation districts in the upper yrb therefore in the future it would be beneficial to enhance the model capability with respect to freeze thaw cycles and then to adopt the model for analyzing the effect of irrigation on soil water salt dynamics during the non growing season as well as for assessing the water saving potential by reducing the irrigation applied during the non growing season this would enable hetao to fully tap water saving potential which is of great significance for addressing water resource issues in the yrb as well 4 conclusions this study was aimed at modeling and analyzing the regional agro ecohydrological processes and water use performance in the upper yellow river basin yrb a typical large irrigation district hetao was selected as the study area which was a dominant water user located in the arid upper yrb the watershed hydrological model swat ag improved for simulating agro ecohydrological processes in arid and shallow groundwater environments was adopted and systematically calibrated with abundant observed data surface water flow soil water salt content depth to groundwater table and et the calibrated model captured well the complicated agro ecohydrological processes in hetao the regional characteristics of depth to groundwater table soil water content soil salt content evapotranspiration and crop yields were analyzed and interpreted results showed that hetao was characterized by shallow groundwater high soil moisture and high evapotranspiration for farmland there was a decreasing trend for both soil moisture and evapotranspiration from the upper to lower regions of hetao but this decreasing trend was not found for natural land further we noted that the soil salt content varied significantly with land use types and crops and shallow groundwater environments correspondingly crop yields presented a decreasing trend from the upper to lower hetao with large spatial variabilities closely related to the spatial distributions of soil water and salt conditions across hetao the water use performance in hetao was systematically analyzed by performing water accounting results indicated that water use during the growing season heavily depended on the antecedent soil water and groundwater storage that recharged during the non growing season irrigation from the previous year by taking into consideration the water recharged during the non growing season a relatively low regional water use efficiency for hetao was estimated as compared with previous studies in addition results showed that in hetao non beneficial water consumption accounted for a relatively large proportion of total water consumption overall our study provided insight into the agro ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics as well as analyzed and offered a better understanding of water use performance in a large irrigation district in the upper yrb credit authorship contribution statement lvyang xiong conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing

4068,high water consumption in large irrigation districts has resulted in large river water diversion and serious water use conflicts in the yellow river basin yrb the excessive water applied is also a cause of the dual problems of soil salinity and water logging in the upper yrb which further negatively impacts crop yields this study is aimed at modeling and analyzing the agro ecohydrological processes and water use performance in large irrigation districts of the yrb the hetao irrigation district hetao a super large irrigation district located in the upper yrb was selected as a typical research area a watershed hydrological model swat ag with enhanced capacity for simulating regional agro ecohydrological processes was adopted in this study we simulated the agro ecohydrological processes in hetao and analyzed the regional characteristics of depth to groundwater table soil moisture and salt content evapotranspiration and crop yield water accounting was further carried out to interpret water cycle processes and evaluate water use performance in hetao results indicated that hetao was characterized by shallow depth to groundwater table high soil moisture and high evapotranspiration for farmland there was a decreasing trend for both soil moisture and evapotranspiration from the upper to lower regions in hetao but this decreasing trend was not found for natural land further results showed soil salt content has strong spatial variations with land use type crops and shallow groundwater environments correspondingly crop yields presented a decreasing trend from the upper to lower regions of hetao with large spatial variabilities closely related to the spatial distribution of soil water and salt conditions across hetao it was worth noting that the regional water use efficiency was relatively low in hetao especially with large proportions of non beneficial water consumption to total water consumption overall this study provided a thorough understanding of agro ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics and the current situation of irrigation water use issues in the whole hetao district and further provided valuable insights in improving water use and management in large irrigation districts of the upper yrb keywords agro ecohydrological modeling water use performance crop yields shallow groundwater arid climate 1 introduction high water consumption is one of the critical issues in arid irrigation districts however high water consumption in arid irrigation districts may cause water use conflict between upstream and downstream areas this conflict has become a great concern and it is common throughout the world such as in the colorado river basin in the united states the murray darling basin in australia and the yellow river basin yrb in china chen et al 2003 cong et al 2009 haddeland et al 2006 molle et al 2010 thoms and sheldon 2000 tian et al 2019 yang et al 2004 as a typical example yrb is known for its important role in the social economic development of china in yrb there are two large irrigation districts called hetao and qingtongxia located in its arid upper region lanzhou toudaoguai reach fig 1 a both of these irrigation districts have become the most dominant water users in yrb based on yellow river water resources bulletins published by the yellow river water conservancy commission yrcc during the years of 2010 2015 surface water diversion in the lanzhou toudaoguai reach accounted for about 39 of total surface water diversion from the yellow river 15 5 billion m3 out of 40 2 billion m3 and agricultural irrigation water in the lanzhou toudaoguai reach amounted to 13 0 billion m3 however due to the high water consumption in the upper yrb the lower yrb has faced severe water issues of continuously decreasing discharge and even discontinuous flow chen et al 2003 cong et al 2009 piao et al 2010 tian et al 2019 yang et al 2004 these issues have severely restricted sustainable development especially the yrb ecosystem therefore the situation highlights the importance of water savings for these large irrigation districts in the upper yrb to achieve this goal it is critically important to assess water use performance in these irrigation districts at the cost of high water consumption irrigation districts are able to maintain crop yields under the arid climatic conditions however if water management is improper irrigation districts may face the problems of waterlogging and soil salinization these problems may have an impact on crop yields and they have attracted much attention from water management authorities that intend to improve water use efficiency and crop yields as well as attention from hydrologists that aim at understanding of agro hydrological processes and their coupling in arid agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater morway et al 2013 singh 2016 singh et al 2010 tavakoli kivi et al 2019 this is especially true for those irrigation districts with inefficient irrigation practices and inadequate drainage where the regional groundwater is overall shallow due to the percolation of irrigated fields and the seepage of canals the shallow groundwater then results in waterlogging problems for low lying areas in addition the shallow groundwater also contributes to salt build up through upward water flux under the arid climatic condition resulting in a severe problem of secondary soil salinity these problems eventually have an impact on crop yields therefore to confront these problems a thorough understanding of agro ecohydrological processes is important which raises the particular concern of modeling and analyzing the agro ecohydrological processes in such irrigation districts models are powerful and efficient tools for quantifying hydrological processes and there have been numerous studies of modeling and quantifying regional hydrological processes using various models e g mike she vic swat topkapi modflow swatmod which mainly focus on either regional runoff generation variation or regional groundwater flow processes arnold et al 1998 ciarapica and todini 2002 kim et al 2008 liang et al 1994 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 refsgaard 1997 however model development for modeling regional agro ecohydrological processes and their couplings e g coupling hydrological processes and crop growth yield is still at an early stage while related modeling studies are also relatively rare siad et al 2019 furthermore it is also challenging to conduct regional modeling studies in irrigation districts under conditions of shallow groundwater and arid climate samimi et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge most regional hydrological modeling studies have over simplified the hydrological processes regarding agricultural effects e g effects from canal ditch system and agronomic practices and the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum besides these oversimplifications it is worth noting that few previous regional hydrological modeling studies considered the soil salinity problem and its role in hydrological processes however soil salinity is of great concern for agricultural watersheds due to its influence on crop water use and productivity minhas et al 2020 singh 2016 wichelns and qadir 2015 xiong et al 2021 as a result it seems to be far from reasonable for these previous studies to simulate the agro ecohydrological processes in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater therefore the main objective of this study is to model and analyze the agro ecohydrological processes and water use performance of the irrigation districts with shallow groundwater and arid climate in the upper yrb a typical agricultural watershed hetao was selected as the study area the swat ag model was adopted due to its capacity for simulating agro ecohydrological processes in agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater which was evaluated in our small scale modeling case study xiong et al 2019 this study expanded our previous study to a larger area and a more complex irrigation and drainage system the specific objectives are 1 to simulate the agro ecohydrological processes of an arid irrigation district with shallow groundwater 2 to show the regional characteristics of agro ecohydrological processes in such an irrigation district considering the spatially heterogeneous land use pattern crop pattern irrigation soil type groundwater table etc 3 to analyze the water use performance in hetao and its subdistricts overall this study provided an understanding of agro ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics and the current situation of irrigation water use in the whole hetao district further provided insights in improving water use and management in large irrigation districts of the upper yrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hetao a part of wuliangsuhai basin is a super large irrigated agricultural watershed located in the upper yrb with arid climatic conditions fig 1a known as one of the three largest irrigation districts of china hetao is one of the most dominant water users in the yrb in recent years about 48 6 108 m3 water was annually diverted for hetao from the yellow river according to the records during the years of 1990 2015 from bayannaoer water resources bulletin published by the hetao irrigation district administration bureau the total area of hetao is around 1 12 mha of which about 60 is irrigated farmland according to the meteorological records during the years 1981 2010 http data cma cn the mean annual evaporation 20 cm pan is larger than 2200 mm but the mean annual precipitation is only about 140 220 mm with a decreasing trend from east to west most rainfall occurs in may september accounting for more than 85 of the annual precipitation the mean annual temperature is around 8 c with the lowest and highest monthly average temperature values being 10 c in january and 24 c in july respectively hetao is a south west to north east tilting flat plain the ground slope in hetao is 1 5000 1 8000 from west to east and 1 4000 to 1 8000 from south to north the ground elevation ranges from 1000 to 1100 m above sea level due to the flat topography a dense network of canals and ditches was built in hetao to support irrigation and enhance drainage fig 2 a the main canal is located in southern hetao it diverts and allocates water flows from west to east alongside the yellow river the main ditch is located in northern hetao and it flows from west to east until wuliangsu lake where it then drains into the yellow river in addition there are also 13 secondary canals and 12 secondary ditches flowing from south west to north east based on these main and secondary canals and ditches hetao was divided into 5 subdistricts for water management from west to east the 5 subdistricts are referred to as wulanbuhe jiefangzha yongji yichang and wulate fig 1b moreover for each subdistrict the lower order canals and ditches were built for regulating water allocation and drainage fig 2a in hetao basin irrigation irrigation applied with forming a flat basin is the major irrigation method with the major water resources from the yellow river water from the yellow river is diverted 6 times during the crop growing season i e from may to september whereas the sixth water diversion named autumn irrigation starts after harvest the autumn irrigation is mainly for the purposes of salt leaching pest prevention and increasing soil water content which supports crop growth in the early stage of the next year 2 2 swat ag model the original swat model was developed for predicting the impact of management practices on hydrological processes and related processes in complex watersheds with varying slopes soils and land use conditions arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 however the swat model is far from sufficient to be applied in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater tables due to soil salinity dynamics and its impacts on crop growth are ignored and the interactions among surface water soil water groundwater and vegetation are over simplified liu et al 2010 luo et al 2008 sophocleous and perkins 2000 xiong et al 2019 therefore swat ag was proposed by xiong et al 2019 with significant modifications based on the swat framework swat ag is a semi distributed hydrological model with enhanced capacity for simulating regional agro ecohydrological processes the swat ag model inherits the capabilities e g hydrological modeling and assessment and the advantages e g modeling robustness effectiveness and comprehensiveness of swat it is based on a water balance based mechanism and adopts the framework of subbasin and hru hydrological response unit division thus it is efficient and robust in handling regional modeling with complex environmental conditions in particular swat ag incorporates novel significant functions including 1 the simulation of capillary rise effects 2 the simulation of soil salt movement and salt stress on plant growth and 3 the simulation of groundwater dynamics with a water balance based module for shallow aquifers i e involving canal seepage and ditch drainage calculation these enable swat ag to capture the complex interactions among agroecosystem processes e g plant growth soil water salt dynamic and fluctuation of depth to groundwater table especially for arid climatic and shallow groundwater environments additional description of swat ag can be found in xiong et al 2019 in addition we found that the flood routing module of swat and swat ag was not directly applicable to agricultural watersheds like hetao because flow in channels i e ditches is significantly interfered with by water management in swat and swat ag flood routing uses two optional modules i e the variable storage and the muskingum routing method neitsch et al 2011 and they adopt constant parameters taking the muskingum routing method as an example the equations contain constant parameter sets x f 1 and f 2 as follows v s k x q in 1 x q out k f 1 k f f 2 k 0 1 f where v s is the storage volume m3 q in is the inflow rate m3 s q out is the discharge rate m3 s k is the storage time constant for the reach s x is the weighting factor f 1 and f 2 are weighting coefficients input by the user k f is the storage time constant calculated for the reach segment with bankfull flows s k 0 1 f is the storage time constant calculated for the reach segment with one tenth of bankfull flows s however in hetao due to the non uniform landscapes pumping stations were built at the end of the drainage ditches to improve drainage and the flow pattern significantly varied with different operation situations of the pumping stations therefore it may not be reasonable to adopt constant parameters in flood routing as a result we modified the swat ag model to adopt variable parameters in the muskingum routing method allowing it to adopt different parameter sets x f 1 and f 2 corresponding to different flow patterns specifically the flow rate was distinguished by using a flow rate threshold q th with different parameter sets x f 1 and f 2 for the high and normal flow rate conditions respectively 2 3 model set up 2 3 1 data preparation soil water content and soil salinity were obtained with soil samples collected in years of 2015 and 2016 huang et al 2018 the soil sampling was carried out based on two sets of sampling points one set with 213 points provided data sampled at the beginning of may the other set with 68 points provided data sampled every month from may to september fig 1b theses soil samples were collected every 10 cm in the top 0 20 cm layer and at 20 cm increments below the top layer until the 100 cm depth soil water content was measured using the oven drying method and converted to volumetric water content and the soil bulk density at the depth of 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm was measured using stainless steel rings the soil salt content ssc g kg 1 was determined from the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract using the calculation method suggested by xu et al 2013 groundwater data were collected from the hetao irrigation district administration bureau hidab including observations of depth to groundwater table and total dissolved solids which were obtained from a total of 260 monitoring wells installed in hetao fig 1b for the years of 2015 and 2016 190 of them were available with monitoring of depth to groundwater table for every 5 days for average of depth to groundwater table during the period from may to september both the mean and standard deviation were 2 3 m additionally 93 of the wells also monitored water quality every 1 2 months fig 1b for average of total dissolved solids during the period from may to september the mean and standard deviation were 3 6 g l and 4 3 g l respectively hydrogeological data were obtained from a total of 111 drill holes across hetao fig 1b there is a surficial holocene aquifer to a depth of 1 8 76 2 m with specific yield being 0 01 0 49 the flow rate records of ditches were provided by hidab with a total of 15 ditch gauge stations fig 1b among these stations 10 of them monitored outflow rates of no 1 10 secondary ditches and provided monthly flow rate records in years 2015 and 2016 for the monthly outflow rate of these secondary ditches their average peaked at about 2 1 m3 s in may and it declined to about 1 3 m3 s and less than 1 m3 s for june july and august september respectively in addition there are another 5 gauge stations along the main ditch located in northern hetao h huangji p peijiaqiao l liufenqiao s shagaibulong x xishanzui wherein s and x gauge stations provided daily flow records according to the records from the s gauge station the outflow rate of the main ditch reached as high as 50 m3 s at the end of may and it averaged about 20 m3 s during the period from may to september the digital elevation model dem at 90 m spatial resolution was available from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm the soil map on a 1 1 000 000 scale was obtained from the harmonized world soil database fig 2d hwsd nachtergaele et al 2009 the land use data set was provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn crop pattern data regarding the distribution of sunflower maize and wheat fig 2c were provided by wen et al 2019 they are the dominant crops and accounted for more than 85 of the total farmland of hetao in recent years wen et al 2019 the meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model meng 2016 data regarding agricultural management practices were collected from an on site survey and hidab involving the data of planting and harvesting soil surface mulching information and irrigation regimes i e amount and timing of irrigation 2 3 2 watershed delineation data processing and model initialization watershed delineation was performed in two different ways for hetao and the mountain regions in northern wuliangsuhai basin respectively afterwards the two delineation results were integrated into the overall watershed delineation of the whole study area fig 2b for hetao as a flat plain its watershed delineation was performed manually based on the distribution of canals and ditches so as to reasonably describe the hydrological processes dominated by water management infrastructure in hetao for watershed delineation of hetao ditches were used to serve as predefined streams while canals served as boundaries of subbasins moreover watershed delineation of the mountain region in north of hetao was performed in an automated way in arcswat as a result the study area was divided into 214 subbasins as shown in fig 2b then these sub basins were further divided into hrus based on combination of land use crop pattern soil type and land slope as a result there were 7347 hrus generated for the year 2015 with the numbers of hrus being 6221 and 1126 for hetao and mountain regions respectively there were 7333 hrus generated for the year 2016 with the numbers of hrus being 6215 and 1118 for hetao and mountain regions respectively various agricultural management practices involving irrigation planting mulching and harvesting were considered the effects of nitrogen phosphorus stress were ignored because the applied fertilization is usually excessive in hetao the corresponding management schedules are presented in table 1 the initial pattern of soil water salt conditions were obtained from interpolation of sampling points data meanwhile the initial patterns of depth to groundwater table and groundwater quality were obtained from interpolation of monitoring well data the initial values of soil parameters were obtained from the hwsd dataset and our previous studies ren et al 2017 ren et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 the parameters for capillary rise were obtained from hsiao et al 2009 parameters to quantify plant growth of specific species were initialized as suggested by hao et al 2015 the initial values for salinity stress parameters were determined according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 and ren et al 2016 the groundwater parameters were obtained according to xu et al 2010 and on site survey of drill holes to derive a reasonable antecedent condition of model state variables the swat ag model was initialized by inputting the spatial data of soil water content soil salt content and depth to groundwater table instead of applying a model spin up this is because the current swat and swat ag models are not able to capture the soil freeze thaw process and it may underestimate the soil water content during winter thus a model spin up may cause unreasonable antecedent conditions especially soil water content further influencing the simulation of agro hydrological processes e g crop growth soil water dynamic and groundwater fluctuation 2 4 model calibration and validation the swat ag model was calibrated and validated using observations in years 2015 and 2016 respectively the datasets included observed flow rate observation of depth to groundwater table and remote sensing actual evapotranspiration et from yu et al 2019 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup swat calibration uncertainty procedures abbaspour and johnson 2004 was used to conduct the sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation a more detailed description of the sufi2 algorithm and its application with swat can be found in abbaspour et al 2007 the initial ranges of parameters were determined based on relevant previous literature especially those using swat and those in hetao luan et al 2018 ren et al 2016 ren et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 xue and ren 2017 afterwards parameters were calibrated using 3 steps 1 parameters were calibrated with flow rate observations using swat cup 2 parameters were calibrated with depth to groundwater table soil water content soil salt content and evapotranspiration observations this was accomplished by repeatedly performing a trial and error procedure 3 repeating steps 1 and 2 until the results of calibration are satisfied during the above procedures multiple statistical evaluation criteria were employed including nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse root mean square error rmse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr coefficient of determination r 2 and mean relative error mre moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 for the criteria nse 1 represents a perfect fit and smaller nse indicates poor performance rmse 0 indicates a perfect fit to the data and smaller rmse means better performance rsr 0 means optimal fit and smaller rsr means better performance r 2 1 means optimal fit and smaller r 2 indicates poor performance mre 0 indicates a perfect fit to the data and smaller absolute mre value means better performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization and performance 3 1 1 model parametrization the calibrated parameters are listed in table 2 and table a 1 in hetao the runoff potential is low with the curve number values being relatively low ranging from 18 to 55 for the flows in hetao a major contribution is the open ditch drainage where the depth to drain is 1 5 3 m and the drainage spacing is 150 500 m the flows route to the main channels i e main secondary and tertiary ditches while the related parameters are different between high level and low level ditches the designed discharge of high level ditches is high where ditch width is 30 m ditch depth is 3 m manning s n value is 0 02 and slope along the ditches is 0 00008 the designed discharge of low level ditches is low where the ditch width is 14 m ditch depth is 1 5 m manning s n value is 0 035 and slope along the ditches is 0 00012 additionally note that flow pattern significantly varied with high and normal flow rate conditions where the muskingum weighting factors of the bankfull flows are 0 5 and 0 2 for high and normal flow rate conditions respectively moreover salt tolerance parameters vary with crop types where sunflower is most salt tolerant a value of 10 5 ds m 1 for the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract above which salt stress happens ect while maize and wheat are moderately salt tolerant values of ect being lower than 6 ds m 1 3 1 2 model performance results showed an overall good model performance during calibration year 2015 and validation year 2016 periods as well as during an additional validation period years 2013 2014 the results showed that swat ag captured well the agro hydrological processes i e flow rate depth to groundwater table evapotranspiration and soil water and salt during the calibration and validation periods results showed that the observations of flow rate matched well with the simulations table 3 fig 3 compares simulated flow rates and observed ones for 14 gauged stations in hetao and there is a good agreement between simulations and observations table 3 and table a 2 for daily flow rate nse values were larger than 0 66 r 2 values were larger than 0 7 and rsr values were less than 0 6 for monthly flow rate nse and r 2 values were larger than 0 45 and rsr values were less than 0 75 in addition for depth to groundwater table the simulations were also consistent with the observations during the periods of calibration and validation table 3 the monthly results of simulated and observed depth to groundwater table in hetao are shown in fig 4 overall results and detailed results of model performance evaluation are shown in table 3 and table a 3 respectively the overall results showed very good model performance table 3 nse values were larger than 0 7 r 2 values were larger than 0 75 and rsr values were less than 0 6 this is also confirmed by the detailed results table a 3 while it only showed an acceptable model performance in wulanbuhe and wulate which may be related to the complex water management in these subdistricts wulanbuhe has been carrying out an ecological water supplement project in recent years with water being directly diverted into water bodies for maintaining groundwater levels additionally in wulate a proportion of irrigated areas has been shifting to using groundwater which lowered the groundwater table in some areas furthermore during the additional validation period years 2013 2014 for both flow rate and depth to groundwater table results also showed an overall good agreement between simulations and observations table a 4 fig a 1 compares the simulated flow rates and observed ones for 14 gauge stations in hetao in years 2013 2014 as can be seen simulations matched well with observations in most cases while it showed a relatively poor agreement for no 1 and 6 7 ditches this discrepancy may be attributed to engineering projects because hetao has been implementing projects of ditch renovation during recent years additionally the monthly results of simulated and observed depth to groundwater table in hetao in years 2013 2014 are shown in fig a 2 it also showed an overall good model performance for hetao while there was only an acceptable model performance for wulanbuhe and wulate the simulated et was in acceptable agreement with the remote sensing et fig 5 table a 5 in most subdistricts of hetao jiefangzha yongji and yichang the mre values were lower than 15 and the rmse values lower than 90 mm i e 0 6 mm d additionally the values of mre and rmse were 16 and 112 mm in wulate and that values were 22 and 123 mm in wulanbuhe however it should be noted that remote sensing et data had a coarse resolution 250 1000 m and such resolution may not be sufficient to provide field scale et results such resolution may cause mixed pixel problems i e one pixel often covers different kinds of land cover types zhang et al 2018 which is evident in hetao due to the fragmented land use and crop patterns ren et al 2019b moreover the spatial distributions of the simulated and observed soil water content soil salt content and depth to groundwater table the averages during the period from may to september 2015 are provided in fig 6 results showed that there was good agreement between the simulated and observed variables therefore all of the above analysis indicated that the swat ag model was well calibrated and validated and can be used to describe the complicated agro ecohydrological processes and perform water use evaluation in hetao 3 2 characteristics of regional agro ecohydrological processes and crop yields 3 2 1 characteristics of depth to groundwater table in our study we calculated the average depth to groundwater table gwda during the period from may to september in 2015 the mean and standard deviation of gwda for each subdistrict are presented in table 4 the results showed that the gwda values in hetao were overall shallow with the mean values fluctuating between 1 3 m and 2 m among the subdistricts of hetao the gwda values were the highest around 2 m in yongji followed by jiefangzha yichang and wulate with values of about 1 6 m while the gwda values in wulanbuhe were the lowest about 1 3 m in addition the gwda in natural land was close to that in farmland with the difference being less than 0 3 m to further analyze the spatial characteristics of gwda across hetao the gwda was classified as shallow 1 5 m reasonable 1 5 2 0 m and deep 2 0 m according to previous studies with respect to the growth response of natural vegetation and crops to varied groundwater conditions in hetao ren et al 2017 ren et al 2018a xiong et al 2021 as shown in fig 6c in most areas of hetao the gwda values were in the shallow or reasonable range the areas with shallow gwda values 1 5 m accounted for 36 of the total area of hetao which were located in southern wulanbuhe northwestern jierfangzha and western wulate as well as dispersed in southern yichang in addition the areas with reasonable gwda values 1 5 2 0 m accounted for about half of the total area of hetao which were located in northern wulanbuhe southeastern jiefangzha northern yongji and eastern wulate as well as dispersed in the center and north of yichang in some areas the gwda values were in the deep range 2 0 m which were located in southern yongji and dispersed in the north of the main ditch 3 2 2 characteristics of soil moisture the average soil water content swca in the soil depth of 0 100 cm during the period from may to september was calculated with the mean and standard deviation of swca for each subdistrict shown in table 4 the swca was overall higher in farmland for the upper hetao than that in the lower hetao with mean values about 0 30 cm3 cm3 and 0 25 cm3 cm3 in the upper and lower hetao respectively note that the difference between the upper and lower regions was more significant for sunflower compared to maize and the mean values in the lower hetao decreased to 0 23 cm3 cm3 and 0 26 cm3 cm3 for sunflower and maize respectively this was attributed to the differences in irrigation regimes across hetao the irrigation amount decreased from the upper to lower regions of hetao and was especially significant for sunflower however for natural land the swca differences between the upper and lower hetao were insignificant and the swca values were relatively close among different subdistricts fluctuating between 0 23 and 0 26 cm3 cm3 the spatial distribution of swca is presented in fig 6a the results showed that swca values have strong spatial variability in each subdistrict compared with the distributions of gwda fig 6c and swca fig 6a it was evident that depth to groundwater table was an important factor affecting the soil water content across hetao the areas with low gwda often have relatively high swca such as the northwestern jiefangzha northern yongji and central yichang whereas the areas with low swca values coincide with areas with high gwda such as the southern yongji and northern yichang however note that this relationship between swca and gwda was insignificant in some local areas such as the central wulanbuhe this is because central wulanbuhe is a desert for which the soil water holding capacity was very low 3 2 3 characteristics of soil salinity the average soil salt content ssca in the soil depth of 0 100 cm during the period from may to september in 2015 was also analyzed the mean and standard deviation of the ssca for each subdistrict are shown in table 4 the ssca varied significantly with land use types and crops overall the ssca values of natural land were much higher than that of farmland with 3 7 g kg and 1 4 g kg for natural land and farmland respectively in addition a significant difference in ssca values was also found for different crops the ssca for sunflower was higher than that for maize with the mean values of 1 9 g kg and 1 0 g kg for sunflower and maize respectively the difference of ssca among land use types and crops was likely to originate in human intervention in hetao farmland with slightly saline soil or non saline soil is often planted with salt sensitive crops like maize while that with moderately saline soil is planted with salt tolerant crops like sunflower additionally the significant variation of ssca with land use types and crops was in line with the results of ren et al 2019a the spatial distribution of ssca is shown in fig 6b strong spatial variability of ssca values was found which seems to be related to the spatially varied gwda comparing the spatial distribution of ssca with the distribution of gwda fig 6bc it was evident that the areas with high ssca values were identical to the areas with shallow groundwater such as northwestern jiefangzha and southern yichang in contrast the areas with low ssca values were identical to the areas with deep groundwater being especially evident in southern yongji this may be because deep groundwater contributes to reducing salt accumulation in the soil profile and promoting salt leaching in irrigated fields additionally the relationship between soil salinity and gwda was also supported by a previous study in a typical sub irrigation district in hetao ren et al 2019a furthermore for an interpretation of relationship between soil salinity and gwda we obtained the simulated soil salt accumulation sscacc for soil depth of 0 100 cm during the period from may to september and its spatial distribution is shown in fig a 3a with positive values indicating soil salt accumulation while negative values indicating soil salt leaching as can be seen there was an overall soil salt accumulation trend across hetao with sscacc in most areas ranging from 0 to 0 4 g kg this overall trend of soil salt accumulation was also found in observations of our 68 soil sampling points where the average and standard deviation of salt accumulation in soil depth of 0 100 cm were 0 22 g kg and 0 50 g kg respectively additionally note that some areas showed a relatively significant soil salt accumulation trend sscacc 0 4 g kg which was likely related to the over shallow gwda condition e g in northwestern jiefangzha and the southern yichang 3 2 4 evapotranspiration across hetao the cumulative actual evapotranspiration et total precipitation and total irrigation during the period from may to september in 2015 were also analyzed the mean and standard deviation of et total precipitation and total irrigation for each subdistrict are shown in table 4 the results showed that et values varied significantly with land use types the et values for farmland reached a mean value of about 510 mm while those for natural land were only about 250 mm except for water bodies however note that the et values for both farmland and natural land were much higher than the recharge from total precipitation and total irrigation with mean values about 80 mm and 240 mm for total precipitation and total irrigation respectively this difference between the et values for natural land and farmland was also estimated in previous studies at both the field and regional scale with these et results being close to the simulated et in this study bai et al 2017 ren et al 2016 yu et al 2019 in addition results also showed that there was an overall decreasing trend for et values for farmland from the upper to lower regions of hetao the mean values for both sunflower and maize reached more than 550 mm in upper hetao while in lower hetao they decreased to about 450 mm and 520 mm for sunflower and maize respectively this may be attributed to the difference of irrigation regimes and soil water conditions across hetao as mentioned before the irrigation amount and farmland average soil water content decreased from the upper to lower regions of hetao with the decreasing trend being especially significant for sunflower further this decreasing trend of et for farmland across hetao was also confirmed by data from previous studies yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 however the decreasing trend was not found for et of natural lands results showed their et values were similar among the subdistricts of hetao except for wulanbuhe with a relatively low et due to the large desert areas in this subdistrict this phenomenon was also observed by zhang et al 2019 to further analyze the spatial characteristics of et the spatial distribution of et values are presented in fig 7 b results show that there was large spatial variability of et across hetao the spatial variability of et was mainly related to the fragmented land cover types and partly affected by soil water and salinity conditions by comparing the spatial distributions of et swca and ssca fig 7b fig 6a and b it was evident that areas with high et values were identical to areas with high swca and low ssca values such as northeastern jiefangzha and northern yongji this was because the high soil water content provided sufficient water supply for evapotranspiration while the low soil salt content implied only a slight salt stress or even no salt stress in contrast results showed that the areas with low et were identical to the areas with low swca and or high ssca such as the western jiefangzha southern yichang and the edge of wulate 3 2 5 crop yields crop production is the primary purpose of irrigation districts the crop yields of maize and sunflower in 2015 were simulated with their mean and standard deviation for each subdistrict shown in table 4 results show that crop yields varied among subdistricts reflecting the influence from different irrigation regimes among subdistricts for sunflower the irrigation amount sharply decreased from upper to lower regions of hetao with the total irrigation amount changing from 405 mm to 125 mm accordingly sunflower yields also decreased from more than 3 t ha to about 2 5 t ha these results were in agreement with the data from bayannur statistical yearbook where the average of sunflower yields in the lower region i e wulate is only 2 7 t ha while values were 3 2 3 8 t ha in upper regions i e yichang yongji jiefangzha wulanbuhe additionally for maize there was also a decrease of irrigation amount from upper to lower regions of hetao with the total irrigation amount decreasing from more than 200 mm to about 150 mm thus maize yields also decreased accordingly from more than 10 t ha to about 9 5 t ha this was also consistent with the data from the bayannur statistical yearbook where the average of maize yields decreased from 11 2 to 11 7 t ha in jiefangzha and yongji to 10 8 10 9 t ha in yichang and wulate the spatial distributions of crop yields for maize and sunflower in 2015 are presented in fig 7c results showed significant spatial variability of crop yields which was related to the spatial variations of soil water and salt conditions across hetao by comparing the spatial distributions of crop yields swca and ssca fig 7c fig 6a and b it was evident that the areas with high crop yields were identical to the areas with high swca and low ssca values such as northeast jiefangzha and northern yongji this was because high soil water content and low soil salt content implied sufficient water supply and mild or even no salinity stress results showed that the areas with low crop yields were identical to areas with low swca and or high ssca such as western jiefangzha edge of yichang and central wulate to assist with interpretation of soil water salt condition influence on crop growth the water and salt stress during the crop growing season were obtained fig a 3 shows the spatial distributions of average soil water stress factor swfa and average soil salt stress factor ssfa during the period from may to september in 2015 with low values indicating severe stress conditions as can be seen the low crop yields in western jiefagnzha and southern yichang were attributed to the severe salt stress conditions with ssfa values being 0 7 and 0 7 0 8 in western jiefagnzha and southern yichang respectively additionally it was found that the low crop yields in northern yichang and central wulate were caused by severe water stress conditions with swfa values being 0 7 0 8 and 0 6 0 7 in northern yichang and central wulate respectively 3 3 water use performance 3 3 1 water use efficiency water accounting during the crop growing season was carried out to evaluate water use performance in hetao with systematic analyses of hydrological processes and water balances the water accounting diagram provided the information related to water flows and fluxes among key specific domains e g groundwater unsaturated zone of farmland and natural lands canals ditches and the yellow river during the period from may to september 2015 fig 8 there was relatively high water use efficiency in hetao during the growing season this was because that groundwater domain received canal seepage and deep percolation from fields and then replenished the unsaturated zone through capillary rise finally the supplemental water provided by groundwater to the unsaturated zone was reused by crops resulting in a high water use efficiency in hetao this was consistent with findings of previous studies gao et al 2018 ren et al 2018b xiao et al 2021 however our results also showed that the water use during the growing period heavily depended on the antecedent soil water and groundwater storage recharged by irrigation in the non growing season i e large autumn irrigation after harvest in the previous year this implied that it may overestimate the water use efficiency if ignoring the part of soil water that recharged during the non growing season as shown in fig 8 for the whole hetao water consumption during the growing season amounted to 47 2 108 m3 involving 26 5 and 20 7 108 m3 for evapotranspiration from farmlands and natural lands respectively correspondingly water recharge amounted to 30 9 108 m3 involving 10 1 11 1 and 9 7 108 m3 for precipitation irrigation and canal seepage respectively for the difference between water consumption and recharge it accounted for more than 30 of the consumption during the growing season indicating a large dependence on antecedent soil water and groundwater storage that recharged during the non growing season in the previous year therefore it was necessary to consider the water recharge storage from non growing period irrigation and its contribution to crop growth in order to reasonably assess the water use performance in hetao based on this we proposed a more appropriate equation to calculate the regional water use efficiency rwue as follows 3 rwue et f a r m l a n d g s n w d gs p gs n w d ngs p ngs where subscript gs refers to the growing season from may to september in current year subscript ngs refers to the non growing season from october in the previous year to april in current year et farmland is the farmland evapotranspiration m3 nwd is the net water diversion from the yellow river m3 p is the total precipitation m3 the value of nwd was obtained from canal flow rate data provided by hidab with eq 3 the rwue of hetao with the value being only 0 40 is significantly lower than the value of 0 57 in a similar arid agricultural watershed in northeast china wu et al 2015 xu et al 2019 and far lower than the value of 0 7 0 9 in those areas with efficient irrigation technologies andrés and cuchí 2014 skhiri and dechmi 2012 this approach provided a better understanding of water use efficiency in hetao as compared with previous studies because the previous studies lack a systematic analysis of agro ecohydrological processes gao et al 2018 xue et al 2017 3 3 2 non beneficial water consumption the water accounting diagram shows a relatively large proportion of non beneficial water consumption to total water consumption fig 8 in hetao the non beneficial water consumption namely soil evaporation in natural land and farmland amounted to 23 7 108 m3 which accounted for about 47 of the total water consumption i e evapotranspiration and drainage and there was also a similar value of non beneficially water use fraction assessed with water accounting by sun et al 2016 additionally it should also be noted that evapotranspiration partitioning showed a relatively large proportion of soil evaporation to evapotranspiration especially that proportion in natural land was as high as 70 while the proportion in farmland was not that high the proportion being 35 these values were close to the evaporation evapotranspiration ratio calculated in ren et al 2016 and ren et al 2019b to further analyze non beneficial water consumption across hetao water accounting was further performed for each subdistrict of hetao fig 9 the proportion of soil evaporation to total water consumption pnbc and the proportion of soil evaporation to evapotranspiration e et were used as indicators of non beneficial water consumption as can be seen most subdistricts showed a high proportion of non beneficial water consumption among them the proportion of non beneficial water consumption in wulanbuhe was the highest with the values of pnbc and e et for natural land being as high as 65 and 87 respectively in contrast yongji had the lowest proportion of non beneficial water consumption where the value of pnbc was only 37 and value of e et for natural land was only 50 the proportions of non beneficial water consumption were close for jiefangzha yichang and wulate where the values of pnbc ranged from 42 to 52 and the values of natural land e et ranged from 65 to 77 3 4 contribution limitations and future work this study provided a thorough understanding of agro ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics and current irrigation water use issues in the whole hetao by extending to a regional scale this study is of more practical significance than previous modeling studies that were limited to a field scale ren et al 2016 ren et al 2017 ren et al 2018a additionally by capturing the agro ecohydrological processes and their couplings this study provides more explicit information of agro ecohydrological processes as compared with previous studies that adopted water balance sun et al 2016 xu et al 2010 and provides a more comprehensive assessment of water use as compared with the previous modeling works that only focused on a specific component of the hydrological system i e surface vadose zone and aquifer luan et al 2018 xu et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 therefore this study may contribute in providing valuable insights in improving water use and management in large irrigation districts of the upper yrb however it should be noted that the agro ecohydrological processes were simulated only for the growing season in this study this is because the current swat ag model was still not sufficient to characterize the freeze thaw cycles in the winter season the freeze thaw cycles dominated soil water salt dynamics during the non growing period and had significant effects on soil water salt and groundwater conditions in the initial growing season in hetao as well as in other irrigation districts in the upper yrb therefore in the future it would be beneficial to enhance the model capability with respect to freeze thaw cycles and then to adopt the model for analyzing the effect of irrigation on soil water salt dynamics during the non growing season as well as for assessing the water saving potential by reducing the irrigation applied during the non growing season this would enable hetao to fully tap water saving potential which is of great significance for addressing water resource issues in the yrb as well 4 conclusions this study was aimed at modeling and analyzing the regional agro ecohydrological processes and water use performance in the upper yellow river basin yrb a typical large irrigation district hetao was selected as the study area which was a dominant water user located in the arid upper yrb the watershed hydrological model swat ag improved for simulating agro ecohydrological processes in arid and shallow groundwater environments was adopted and systematically calibrated with abundant observed data surface water flow soil water salt content depth to groundwater table and et the calibrated model captured well the complicated agro ecohydrological processes in hetao the regional characteristics of depth to groundwater table soil water content soil salt content evapotranspiration and crop yields were analyzed and interpreted results showed that hetao was characterized by shallow groundwater high soil moisture and high evapotranspiration for farmland there was a decreasing trend for both soil moisture and evapotranspiration from the upper to lower regions of hetao but this decreasing trend was not found for natural land further we noted that the soil salt content varied significantly with land use types and crops and shallow groundwater environments correspondingly crop yields presented a decreasing trend from the upper to lower hetao with large spatial variabilities closely related to the spatial distributions of soil water and salt conditions across hetao the water use performance in hetao was systematically analyzed by performing water accounting results indicated that water use during the growing season heavily depended on the antecedent soil water and groundwater storage that recharged during the non growing season irrigation from the previous year by taking into consideration the water recharged during the non growing season a relatively low regional water use efficiency for hetao was estimated as compared with previous studies in addition results showed that in hetao non beneficial water consumption accounted for a relatively large proportion of total water consumption overall our study provided insight into the agro ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics as well as analyzed and offered a better understanding of water use performance in a large irrigation district in the upper yrb credit authorship contribution statement lvyang xiong conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing

4069,this study used the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model to examine the moisture sources and pathways associated with warm season precipitation over the sichuan basin scb southwestern china with emphasis on the long term mean state and interannual variability four groups of moisture pathways were identified over the period 1981 2017 i e the southwesterly northeasterly northwesterly and westerly paths with respect to the long term mean state the southwesterly path made the largest moisture contribution 36 0 and in combination with the northeasterly path the importance of which has received little attention in previous studies provided 70 2 of the total moisture the indian ocean serves as the most important moisture source accounting for 36 3 of the total moisture in terms of interannual variability compared with dry years in wet years the moisture contributions from the southwesterly path and the indian ocean increase by 18 6 38 3 vs 32 3 and 20 71 38 38 vs 31 80 but the contributions from the other moisture pathways and other major sources decrease during the dry years the northeasterly path rather than the southwesterly path provides the most moisture 34 6 there are significant positive correlations between variations in runoff over the central and northern scb and the moisture contribution from the indian ocean which is associated with anomalous precipitation patterns over the scb induced by fluctuations in the moisture contributions from the indian ocean keywords warm season precipitation sichuan basin southwestern china interannual variability hysplit moisture pathways moisture sources 1 introduction lying in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the sichuan basin scb is located to the east of the tibetan plateau and north of the yunnan guizhou plateau fig 1 and has a high population density and prosperous economy the scb has a typical monsoon climate and warm season may september rainfall accounts for 70 of the total annual precipitation li et al 2016a during the warm seasons over the period 1981 2017 231 flooding events were recorded across china causing losses in excess of 247 billion and affecting more than 2 billion people and the scb experienced 36 1 83 of these events emergency disasters database http www emdat be due to the complex terrain of the scb the heavy rainfall and frequent flooding often trigger geological hazards such as debris flows and landslides which have been responsible for a significant number of fatalities and other damage zhou et al 2011 moreover the accumulated precipitation during the warm season shows obvious interannual variability and during years with excessive precipitation the likelihood of flooding increases easterling et al 2000 jiang et al 2017a as pointed out by xia et al 2021 in years with above average precipitation several of the main tributaries that enter the scb may suffer from floods simultaneously which leads to tremendous flooding in the upper reaches of the yangtze river for example in the middle of august 2020 precipitation amounts over the mintuo and jialing rivers in the scb were 3 1 times and 2 8 times respectively more than the average xia et al 2021 which resulted in economic losses of approximately 9 4 billion and affected 8 5 million people in southwestern china chinese ministry of emergency management https www mem gov cn xw yjglbgzdt 202101 t20210102 376288 shtml therefore it is of vital importance to study the mechanisms involved in warm season precipitation and its interannual variability over the scb if we are to improve the prediction and mitigation of heavy rainfall and floods generally precipitation over a certain region is generated from local moisture already present in the atmosphere local evaporation and long distance moisture transport brubaker et al 1993 among these sources moisture transport from outside the region is essential for the generation of intense precipitation trenberth 1999 which develops mostly during the warm season over southwestern china chen et al 2021 in addition local evaporation has potential impacts on precipitation formation by providing extra moisture and causing increased precipitation recycling pathak et al 2014 whereas the contribution from the preexisting moisture is negligible within the framework of the eulerian method earlier studies have revealed the intrinsic relationship between precipitation and atmospheric moisture by analyzing the column integrated moisture flux for the scb previous studies have found that warm season precipitation is supplied by three moisture channels and these are the southwesterly channel controlled by the indian summer monsoon from the bay of bengal the southeasterly channel controlled by the western pacific subtropical high from the south china sea and the western pacific ocean and the westerly channel controlled by the mid latitude westerlies from the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 moreover interannual variations in precipitation are influenced by moisture transport anomalies the anomalous anticyclones over the western north pacific and to the south of the tibetan plateau strengthen moisture transport to the scb which favors excessive rainfall there jiang et al 2017a the eulerian approach has been proved to be effective in diagnosing moisture flows from and to a target precipitation region however it can hardly provide information on where the moisture originates from and which moisture sources are more important because of the quick shift of wind fields sodemann et al 2008 to solve this problem the lagrangian method has been developed to identify the moisture pathways and to quantify the moisture contributions by generating trajectories along with specific humidity changes over recent decades regional to global scale lagrangian models castillo et al 2014 nieto et al 2019 sun and wang 2014 yang et al 2020 including the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit draxler and hess 1997 1998 the flexible particle dispersion model flexpart stohl and james 2004 2005 and the lagrangian analysis tool lagranto wernli and davies 1997 sprenger and wernli 2015 have been widely used to quantify moisture sources and their contributions to individual or multiple rainfall events meseguer ruiz et al 2020 rapolaki et al 2020 as well as to examine the seasonal interannual and interdecadal variability of accumulated rainfall jiang et al 2017b chu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 huang and cui 2015 analyzed the characteristics of the moisture transport associated with 70 heavy rainfall events over the scb during the summers of 2009 2013 and found that the indian ocean makes the greatest contribution to extreme precipitation over the scb in addition chen and xu 2016 studied the spatiotemporal structure of the moisture sources associated with 50 heavy intense precipitation events that occurred between 1980 and 2013 and found that the local and neighboring regions together with the south china sea were the key moisture sources for these torrential rainfall events over the scb until now however there have been few studies that used the lagrangian method to study the climatology and interannual variability of moisture transport associated with precipitation over the scb therefore it is desirable to investigate the moisture sources and pathways that supply precipitation over the scb in terms of the long term mean state and interannual variability by using the lagrangian method the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the data and methodology including the configuration of the backward simulations section 3 shows the moisture sources and pathways associated with warm season precipitation over the scb for the climatological mean state and its interannual variability finally a discussion and our concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 observed and reanalysis datasets we used observed daily precipitation data from the scb recorded at 121 stations red dots in fig 1 during the warm seasons may to september between 1981 and 2017 these data were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma we also used daily runoff data from the main gauge stations at beibei controlling 156 736 km2 and covering the period 1981 2012 fushun controlling 19 613 km2 and covering the period 1981 2007 and gaochang controlling 135 378 km2 and covering the period 1981 2015 which are situated on the jialing tuo and min rivers respectively see fig 1 the 6 hr era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 from 1981 to 2017 was used as the input data for the hysplit model this dataset has a horizontal resolution of 0 75 and 37 vertical pressure levels the variables used included terrestrial height geopotential height zonal and meridional wind vertical velocity and specific humidity 2 2 backward simulations with hysplit we used the hysplit model developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa air resources laboratory arl draxler and hess 1997 1998 to calculate the air parcel trajectories this model has been extensively used to track and forecast the release of radionuclides wildfire smoke windblown dust air pollution and moisture e g tichý et al 2017 chen and luo 2018 kalabokas et al 2020 kim et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in the model of the backwards trajectory the air parcel is set to move with the wind the movement of the air parcel is the integral of its position vector through space and time the final position of the air parcel p t δ t is calculated as the average velocity between the initial position p t and the first guess position p t δ t the first guess position is written as 1 p t δ t p t v p t δ t the final position is expressed as 2 p t δ t p t 0 5 v p t v p t δ t δ t where δ t is the time step 6 hr in this study we used the hysplit model to simulate the backward trajectories the target region was the scb as illustrated by the area inside the box in fig 1 and the simulations were carried out every 6 hr during the warm season may to september from 1981 to 2017 the air parcels were released from the objective region at five above ground levels agl of 500 1500 3000 5000 and 9000 m and 510 horizontal locations with a resolution of 0 5 in this way we obtained 11 548 440 backward trajectories each backward simulation lasted for 10 days 240 hr which is considered to be the retention time of moisture in the atmosphere eagleson 1970 trenberth 1998 the output of the hysplit model was recorded at 6 hr intervals and included the three dimensional position latitude longitude and agl and specific humidity of the air parcels 2 3 clustering of backward trajectories to identify the main moisture paths from the large number of backward trajectories we applied a clustering method using the curve clustering toolbox gaffney 2004 which has been used in several previous studies e g li et al 2016b chen and luo 2018 rapolaki et al 2020 in the clustering procedure the different number of clusters k have a corresponding in sample log likelihood value which is a goodness of fit metric for probabilistic models and is expressed as the log probability of the observed data see gaffney 2004 for details 2 4 calculation of moisture contribution to obtain a better understanding of moisture transport associated with precipitation over the scb we quantified the moisture contributions from different clusters of trajectories as well as from the individual moisture sources each air parcel tracked can undergo multiple cycles of moisture uptake evaporation and loss precipitation before arriving in the target region i e the scb the changes in the moisture content for an air parcel can be expressed as evaporation minus precipitation stohl and james 2004 2005 3 e a p a m δ q a δ t 4 δ q a q a q a δ t where e a and p a are the rates of moisture uptake evaporation and loss precipitation respectively along the trajectory at time a and m is the mass of the air parcels δ t is the time step of the backward tracking 6 hr in this study and δ q a represents the changes in specific humidity q from time a δ t to a that is when δ q a 0 the moisture content of the air parcel increases at time a since evaporation gain is larger than precipitation loss and vice versa 2 4 1 moisture contribution of each cluster the moisture contribution ratio of the cluster c to the total moisture released over the target area cr c can be expressed as follows 5 cr c 1 m δ q t 6 1 n δ q t 6 100 where δ q t 6 is the change in specific humidity q of a trajectory from time t 6 to t 0 m is the number of trajectories in the cluster c and n is the total number of trajectories 2 4 2 moisture contribution from each source considering the multiple cycles of evaporation gain and precipitation loss of each air parcel sodemann et al 2008 developed a comprehensive source attribution method which has been widely used e g sun and wang 2015 chen and luo 2018 peng et al 2020 to quantify the moisture contribution from each grid area the effective specific humidity change of air parcels at time a to the target area q a is used to calculate the moisture contribution from each grid area to the precipitation in the study region the details of this approach are as follows 1 if evaporation is less than or equal to precipitation e a p a 0 for the air parcel at time a q a is set to 0 2 when e a p a 0 q a is set temporarily to δ q a to calculate the final q a δ q b should be considered in the calculation and time b is any time after time a excluding the last 6 hr before reaching the study area if δ q b 0 is maintained q a equals to δ q a if δ q b 0 q a is decreasing by the following proportion 6 q a δ q a q b δ t q b where q b δ t and q b are the specific humidity of air parcels at time b δ t and time b respectively 3 the effective moisture contribution ratio of region i to the target area cr i can be expressed as follows 7 cr i q i q t 6 100 where q i is the sum of the effective specific humidity change for all air parcels over the region i while q t 6 is the total specific humidity of all air parcels over the last 6 hr before reaching the target region 3 results 3 1 warm season rainfall over the scb and the associated moisture transport fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the mean warm season precipitation over the period 1981 2017 overall averaged over the scb the mean total warm season precipitation was 806 7 mm with centers of maximum rainfall located over the western scb such as at ya an 29 59 n 103 00 e leshan 29 34 n 103 45 e and meishan 30 04 n 103 48 e where the total precipitation exceeded 1200 mm these features are generally consistent with previous studies zhu and yu 2003 moreover the warm season precipitation over the scb is characterized by significant interannual variability as indicated by the normalized time series of warm season precipitation averaged at 121 meteorological stations over the scb during the period 1981 2017 fig 2b where a positive negative value represents adequate inadequate rainfall in addition we found significant positive correlations between the total warm season precipitation over the scb and total runoff from the rivers jialing r 0 75 p 0 01 tuo r 0 76 p 0 01 and min r 0 61 p 0 01 fig 2b suggesting that flooding is closely related to warm season precipitation over interannual timescales based on the normalized precipitation values above 1 or below 1 standard deviations we classified six years with maximum above normal values as wet years 1981 1984 1985 1988 1998 and 2013 and six years with minimum below normal values as dry years 1994 1997 2001 2002 2006 and 2011 during the wet years increases in warm season precipitation were recorded consistently at all stations over the scb but increases of more than 400 mm relative to the dry years occurred mostly in the central and northern parts of the scb fig 2c the climatology of the column integrated atmospheric water vapor flux between may and september is shown in fig 3 a the primary moisture channel supplying precipitation over the scb was the southwest channel from the indian ocean and the indochina peninsula the moisture fluxes delivered by both the south from the maritime continent and southeast from the western north pacific channels were relatively weaker these features are similar to those described in previous studies zhou et al 2005 huang and cui 2015 chen and xu 2016 compared with dry years the southwesterly wind anomalies from the yunnan guizhou plateau significantly enhance moisture transport to the scb in wet years as reported by jiang et al 2007 and li et al 2010 which is favorable for rainfall over the scb fig 3b 3 2 climatology of moisture sources and paths to investigate the sources and paths associated with the moisture supply for warm season precipitation over the scb we used the concept of effective trajectory which is defined with a decrease in specific humidity during the last 6 hr before arrival in the target region i e the scb by definition the effective trajectories are those that contribute to rainfall over the scb we identified 3 922 028 effective trajectories which accounted for 34 0 of all trajectories we divided these trajectories into four groups using the clustering method outlined above the curve in fig 4 a shows diminishing returns in terms of improvement in fit beyond k 4 consequently this is a reasonable endpoint for the cluster analysis and hence the number of clusters that we used for the moisture trajectories was 4 fig 4b shows the distribution of the trajectory frequency and the four groups of moisture pathways for the scb between may and september black circles represent the mean position of the air parcels in each group of backward trajectories on the first 24 hr fourth 96 hr seventh 168 hr and tenth 240 hr day before the precipitation overall the four groups of pathways coincide with the high values of the trajectory frequency the average altitude and specific humidity within each group along the pathways during the 10 days of backward tracking are shown in fig 5 during the last 6 hr the altitude of the four group mean trajectories rises and the specific humidity decreases indicating intense moisture condensation with a strong ascending motion among all groups the southwesterly path group 3 from the bay of bengal was the most important moisture transport pathway accounting for 36 0 of the total moisture and 34 9 of the total trajectories this group of pathways is ocean originated and during the early period of the simulation 240 to 96 hr indicates the backward simulation it had the highest specific humidity fig 5 as it moved to the target region the altitude specific humidity increased decreased until about 24 hr indicating a large amount of moisture loss due to the influence of the topography along the pathways such as the indochina peninsula and the yunnan guizhou plateau furthermore it experienced moisture uptake over the scb during the last day before arriving at the target region fig 4b and 5 the northeasterly path group 2 ranked second in both trajectory contribution 34 2 and moisture contribution 26 5 however the importance of this group of pathways has rarely been stressed in previous studies along this path the air parcels maintained a high specific humidity over 9 g kg 1 and a low altitude below 2000 m with no large variability until the last 12 hr before reaching the target region fig 5 the remaining two groups of pathways i e the northwesterly group 1 and westerly group 4 paths together contributed less than a third 29 8 of the total moisture the altitude specific humidity was among the highest lowest of the four paths almost throughout the pathway especially the trajectories in group 4 for which the specific humidity was always 5 g kg 1 the moisture uptake for both of these groups occurred mainly near the qinghai tibet plateau and the scb within the last 4 days 96 to 6 hr fig s 4b and 5 fig 6 a shows the spatial distribution of the moisture contribution to warm season precipitation over the scb which is similar to that of the trajectory frequency in fig 4b and the differences can be attributed mainly to changes in specific humidity along the trajectories for instance the moisture contributions from the western arabian sea 0 02 over most regions and the western indian peninsula 0 001 over most regions are in sharp contrast and this can be attributed largely to the orographic precipitation caused by the western ghat over the western indian peninsula to identify the major moisture sources and their contributions we calculated the contributions from six moisture source regions as illustrated in fig 6a namely eurasia a the indian ocean b the south china sea c the sichuan basin d eastern china e and the western north pacific f the moisture contributions from the individual regions on climatological state are shown in fig 6b the indian ocean b is the most important moisture source accounting for 36 3 of the total moisture contribution high moisture contributions occur in the bay of bengal and indochina peninsula over the indian ocean region eastern china e and eurasia a make important moisture contributions to the target region supplying 21 2 and 15 7 respectively for eurasia high values are found over the qinghai tibet plateau especially to its south in addition the sichuan basin d contributes 13 3 of the moisture indicating that evaporation over the scb contributes to warm season precipitation within the region itself the south china sea c and western north pacific f contribute the least moisture to rainfall over the scb and account for only 8 6 and 3 9 respectively of the moisture contribution to the target region 3 3 interannual variability of moisture sources and paths fig 7 shows the differences in trajectory frequency and the four groups of moisture channels between wet and dry years compared with dry years the wet years show a significant increase in the frequency of southwesterly trajectories across the bay of bengal and indochina peninsula whereas there is a decrease in the frequency of northeasterly trajectories across eastern and northern china for the southwesterly path group 3 from the bay of bengal in wet years the corresponding moisture contribution and trajectory frequency increase by 18 6 38 3 vs 32 3 and 19 5 36 8 vs 30 8 respectively over the dry years in contrast the moisture contributions trajectory frequencies of the westerly path group 4 the northwesterly path group 1 and the northeasterly path group 2 decreased by 16 4 16 2 10 4 7 7 and 5 5 4 1 respectively however in contrast to the long term mean state during the dry years the northeasterly path group 2 instead of the southwesterly path group3 becomes the most important path in terms of moisture contribution 34 6 fig 7b which indicates the potential impacts of the northeasterly path on regulating warm season precipitation over the scb the composite differences in moisture contribution to the target region and the moisture contribution differences of the six source regions between wet and dry years are shown in fig 8 the spatial distribution of moisture contribution changes is mostly consistent with that of the trajectory frequency changes indicating that an increase in trajectory frequency may lead to an increased moisture contribution from a certain region compared with dry years during the wet years moisture contribution from the indian ocean b increases by 20 71 38 38 vs 31 80 and especially significantly from the bay of bengal and indochina peninsula consistent with the composite analysis there is a significant positive correlation r 0 53 p 0 01 between the time series of total warm season precipitation and the moisture contribution from the indian ocean b in contrast the moisture contributions from eastern china e eurasia a and the sichuan basin d decrease by 12 95 20 38 vs 23 41 14 40 14 17 vs 16 56 and 8 42 12 87 vs 14 05 respectively in addition compared with the above sources the changes in moisture contributions from the south china sea c and western north pacific f are almost negligible furthermore the interannual variability of runoff across the scb can be linked to changes in the moisture contributions from the various sources for example variations in runoff from the jialing river r 0 51 p 0 05 and the tuo river r 0 44 p 0 05 are closely correlated with moisture contribution from the indian ocean this is because when moisture contributions from the indian ocean are higher than normal excess warm season precipitation is observed over the central and northern scb where the jialing and tuo basins are located fig 9 a in contrast variations in runoff from the jialing are significantly negatively correlated r 0 53 p 0 05 with the moisture contribution from the scb because when the moisture contribution from the scb increases negative precipitation anomalies occur over the jialing basin fig 9b however variations in moisture contributions from the other four sources are poorly correlated with runoff across the scb to investigate the possible mechanisms behind the relationship between moisture contributions and the precipitation anomalies we regressed the column integrated moisture flux and the associated divergence onto the variations in moisture contributions from two sources i e the indian ocean and scb in years with an above normal moisture contribution from the indian ocean significant moisture convergence anomalies occur over central and northern parts of the scb associated with the increase in moisture transport from the indian ocean fig 10 a this leads to an increase in local precipitation fig 9a and increased runoff from the rivers jialing and tuo in contrast in years with an above normal moisture contribution from the sichuan basin there are significant moisture divergence anomalies over central and northern parts of the scb this leads to a reduction in moisture transport from the indian ocean fig 10b which significantly suppresses precipitation fig 9b and reduces runoff from the jialing river 4 discussion and conclusions in this study climatological moisture sources and pathways and their interannual variability associated with precipitation across the sichuan basin scb during the warm season may to september over the period 1981 2017 were investigated using the hysplit model our main findings are summarized below for the long term mean state over the period 1981 2017 the trajectories were clustered into four groups the southwesterly northeasterly northwesterly and westerly paths the southwesterly path from the indian ocean was the most important path and accounted for 34 9 of total trajectories and 36 0 of total moisture the northeasterly path across eastern china ranked second in both trajectory contribution 26 5 and moisture contribution 34 2 these two pathways combined to contribute more than 70 of all moisture regarding the moisture contribution from individual sources the indian ocean accounting for 36 3 of all moisture was the most important moisture source for precipitation over the scb in addition eastern china 21 2 eurasia 15 7 and the sichuan basin 13 3 also served as important moisture contributors regarding the interannual variability compared with dry years there were significant increases during wet years in the moisture contributions from the southwesterly path of 18 6 38 3 vs 32 3 and the indian ocean of 20 71 38 38 vs 31 80 in contrast the contributions from the other moisture pathways and major source areas were lower in the wet years than in the dry years in the wet years the southwesterly path ranked first for moisture contribution 38 3 whereas in the dry years the northeasterly path was most important 34 6 furthermore the yearly moisture contribution from the indian ocean was significantly positively correlated r 0 53 p 0 01 with total warm season precipitation over the scb further analysis revealed significant correlations between the variations in moisture contributions from the various sources and the fluctuations in runoff across the scb over interannual timescales a significant positive correlation was found between moisture contributions from the indian ocean and runoff from the jialing river r 0 51 p 0 05 and the tuo river r 0 44 p 0 05 which we interpreted as being related to the anomalous precipitation over the jialing and tuo basins associated with the variations in moisture contributions from the indian ocean in contrast we found a significant negative correlation r 0 53 p 0 05 between moisture contributions from the scb and runoff from the jialing river which we relate to anomalous precipitation over the jialing basin associated with variations in moisture contributions from the scb it should be mentioned that not all moisture can be attributed by using the moisture source attribution method sodemann et al 2008 one reason for this is the residence time of moisture in the atmosphere used for this study was 10 days it is known that the longer the backward tracking time the more moisture can be identified for precipitation over the target region however when the backward tracking time is beyond 10 days wind field errors can lead to large deviations of trajectories stohl and seibert 1998 the other is that 10 days before reaching the target area the air parcels are not assured to have a zero specific humidity and this part of the moisture is not attributed for this study the attributable moisture accounted for about 70 0 68 5 and 70 0 of all moisture for the long term mean state of the period 1981 2017 the selected wet years and the selected dry years respectively which is similar to the values reported in previous studies sodemann and zubler 2009 chen and luo 2018 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

4069,this study used the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model to examine the moisture sources and pathways associated with warm season precipitation over the sichuan basin scb southwestern china with emphasis on the long term mean state and interannual variability four groups of moisture pathways were identified over the period 1981 2017 i e the southwesterly northeasterly northwesterly and westerly paths with respect to the long term mean state the southwesterly path made the largest moisture contribution 36 0 and in combination with the northeasterly path the importance of which has received little attention in previous studies provided 70 2 of the total moisture the indian ocean serves as the most important moisture source accounting for 36 3 of the total moisture in terms of interannual variability compared with dry years in wet years the moisture contributions from the southwesterly path and the indian ocean increase by 18 6 38 3 vs 32 3 and 20 71 38 38 vs 31 80 but the contributions from the other moisture pathways and other major sources decrease during the dry years the northeasterly path rather than the southwesterly path provides the most moisture 34 6 there are significant positive correlations between variations in runoff over the central and northern scb and the moisture contribution from the indian ocean which is associated with anomalous precipitation patterns over the scb induced by fluctuations in the moisture contributions from the indian ocean keywords warm season precipitation sichuan basin southwestern china interannual variability hysplit moisture pathways moisture sources 1 introduction lying in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the sichuan basin scb is located to the east of the tibetan plateau and north of the yunnan guizhou plateau fig 1 and has a high population density and prosperous economy the scb has a typical monsoon climate and warm season may september rainfall accounts for 70 of the total annual precipitation li et al 2016a during the warm seasons over the period 1981 2017 231 flooding events were recorded across china causing losses in excess of 247 billion and affecting more than 2 billion people and the scb experienced 36 1 83 of these events emergency disasters database http www emdat be due to the complex terrain of the scb the heavy rainfall and frequent flooding often trigger geological hazards such as debris flows and landslides which have been responsible for a significant number of fatalities and other damage zhou et al 2011 moreover the accumulated precipitation during the warm season shows obvious interannual variability and during years with excessive precipitation the likelihood of flooding increases easterling et al 2000 jiang et al 2017a as pointed out by xia et al 2021 in years with above average precipitation several of the main tributaries that enter the scb may suffer from floods simultaneously which leads to tremendous flooding in the upper reaches of the yangtze river for example in the middle of august 2020 precipitation amounts over the mintuo and jialing rivers in the scb were 3 1 times and 2 8 times respectively more than the average xia et al 2021 which resulted in economic losses of approximately 9 4 billion and affected 8 5 million people in southwestern china chinese ministry of emergency management https www mem gov cn xw yjglbgzdt 202101 t20210102 376288 shtml therefore it is of vital importance to study the mechanisms involved in warm season precipitation and its interannual variability over the scb if we are to improve the prediction and mitigation of heavy rainfall and floods generally precipitation over a certain region is generated from local moisture already present in the atmosphere local evaporation and long distance moisture transport brubaker et al 1993 among these sources moisture transport from outside the region is essential for the generation of intense precipitation trenberth 1999 which develops mostly during the warm season over southwestern china chen et al 2021 in addition local evaporation has potential impacts on precipitation formation by providing extra moisture and causing increased precipitation recycling pathak et al 2014 whereas the contribution from the preexisting moisture is negligible within the framework of the eulerian method earlier studies have revealed the intrinsic relationship between precipitation and atmospheric moisture by analyzing the column integrated moisture flux for the scb previous studies have found that warm season precipitation is supplied by three moisture channels and these are the southwesterly channel controlled by the indian summer monsoon from the bay of bengal the southeasterly channel controlled by the western pacific subtropical high from the south china sea and the western pacific ocean and the westerly channel controlled by the mid latitude westerlies from the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 moreover interannual variations in precipitation are influenced by moisture transport anomalies the anomalous anticyclones over the western north pacific and to the south of the tibetan plateau strengthen moisture transport to the scb which favors excessive rainfall there jiang et al 2017a the eulerian approach has been proved to be effective in diagnosing moisture flows from and to a target precipitation region however it can hardly provide information on where the moisture originates from and which moisture sources are more important because of the quick shift of wind fields sodemann et al 2008 to solve this problem the lagrangian method has been developed to identify the moisture pathways and to quantify the moisture contributions by generating trajectories along with specific humidity changes over recent decades regional to global scale lagrangian models castillo et al 2014 nieto et al 2019 sun and wang 2014 yang et al 2020 including the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit draxler and hess 1997 1998 the flexible particle dispersion model flexpart stohl and james 2004 2005 and the lagrangian analysis tool lagranto wernli and davies 1997 sprenger and wernli 2015 have been widely used to quantify moisture sources and their contributions to individual or multiple rainfall events meseguer ruiz et al 2020 rapolaki et al 2020 as well as to examine the seasonal interannual and interdecadal variability of accumulated rainfall jiang et al 2017b chu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 huang and cui 2015 analyzed the characteristics of the moisture transport associated with 70 heavy rainfall events over the scb during the summers of 2009 2013 and found that the indian ocean makes the greatest contribution to extreme precipitation over the scb in addition chen and xu 2016 studied the spatiotemporal structure of the moisture sources associated with 50 heavy intense precipitation events that occurred between 1980 and 2013 and found that the local and neighboring regions together with the south china sea were the key moisture sources for these torrential rainfall events over the scb until now however there have been few studies that used the lagrangian method to study the climatology and interannual variability of moisture transport associated with precipitation over the scb therefore it is desirable to investigate the moisture sources and pathways that supply precipitation over the scb in terms of the long term mean state and interannual variability by using the lagrangian method the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the data and methodology including the configuration of the backward simulations section 3 shows the moisture sources and pathways associated with warm season precipitation over the scb for the climatological mean state and its interannual variability finally a discussion and our concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 observed and reanalysis datasets we used observed daily precipitation data from the scb recorded at 121 stations red dots in fig 1 during the warm seasons may to september between 1981 and 2017 these data were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma we also used daily runoff data from the main gauge stations at beibei controlling 156 736 km2 and covering the period 1981 2012 fushun controlling 19 613 km2 and covering the period 1981 2007 and gaochang controlling 135 378 km2 and covering the period 1981 2015 which are situated on the jialing tuo and min rivers respectively see fig 1 the 6 hr era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 from 1981 to 2017 was used as the input data for the hysplit model this dataset has a horizontal resolution of 0 75 and 37 vertical pressure levels the variables used included terrestrial height geopotential height zonal and meridional wind vertical velocity and specific humidity 2 2 backward simulations with hysplit we used the hysplit model developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa air resources laboratory arl draxler and hess 1997 1998 to calculate the air parcel trajectories this model has been extensively used to track and forecast the release of radionuclides wildfire smoke windblown dust air pollution and moisture e g tichý et al 2017 chen and luo 2018 kalabokas et al 2020 kim et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in the model of the backwards trajectory the air parcel is set to move with the wind the movement of the air parcel is the integral of its position vector through space and time the final position of the air parcel p t δ t is calculated as the average velocity between the initial position p t and the first guess position p t δ t the first guess position is written as 1 p t δ t p t v p t δ t the final position is expressed as 2 p t δ t p t 0 5 v p t v p t δ t δ t where δ t is the time step 6 hr in this study we used the hysplit model to simulate the backward trajectories the target region was the scb as illustrated by the area inside the box in fig 1 and the simulations were carried out every 6 hr during the warm season may to september from 1981 to 2017 the air parcels were released from the objective region at five above ground levels agl of 500 1500 3000 5000 and 9000 m and 510 horizontal locations with a resolution of 0 5 in this way we obtained 11 548 440 backward trajectories each backward simulation lasted for 10 days 240 hr which is considered to be the retention time of moisture in the atmosphere eagleson 1970 trenberth 1998 the output of the hysplit model was recorded at 6 hr intervals and included the three dimensional position latitude longitude and agl and specific humidity of the air parcels 2 3 clustering of backward trajectories to identify the main moisture paths from the large number of backward trajectories we applied a clustering method using the curve clustering toolbox gaffney 2004 which has been used in several previous studies e g li et al 2016b chen and luo 2018 rapolaki et al 2020 in the clustering procedure the different number of clusters k have a corresponding in sample log likelihood value which is a goodness of fit metric for probabilistic models and is expressed as the log probability of the observed data see gaffney 2004 for details 2 4 calculation of moisture contribution to obtain a better understanding of moisture transport associated with precipitation over the scb we quantified the moisture contributions from different clusters of trajectories as well as from the individual moisture sources each air parcel tracked can undergo multiple cycles of moisture uptake evaporation and loss precipitation before arriving in the target region i e the scb the changes in the moisture content for an air parcel can be expressed as evaporation minus precipitation stohl and james 2004 2005 3 e a p a m δ q a δ t 4 δ q a q a q a δ t where e a and p a are the rates of moisture uptake evaporation and loss precipitation respectively along the trajectory at time a and m is the mass of the air parcels δ t is the time step of the backward tracking 6 hr in this study and δ q a represents the changes in specific humidity q from time a δ t to a that is when δ q a 0 the moisture content of the air parcel increases at time a since evaporation gain is larger than precipitation loss and vice versa 2 4 1 moisture contribution of each cluster the moisture contribution ratio of the cluster c to the total moisture released over the target area cr c can be expressed as follows 5 cr c 1 m δ q t 6 1 n δ q t 6 100 where δ q t 6 is the change in specific humidity q of a trajectory from time t 6 to t 0 m is the number of trajectories in the cluster c and n is the total number of trajectories 2 4 2 moisture contribution from each source considering the multiple cycles of evaporation gain and precipitation loss of each air parcel sodemann et al 2008 developed a comprehensive source attribution method which has been widely used e g sun and wang 2015 chen and luo 2018 peng et al 2020 to quantify the moisture contribution from each grid area the effective specific humidity change of air parcels at time a to the target area q a is used to calculate the moisture contribution from each grid area to the precipitation in the study region the details of this approach are as follows 1 if evaporation is less than or equal to precipitation e a p a 0 for the air parcel at time a q a is set to 0 2 when e a p a 0 q a is set temporarily to δ q a to calculate the final q a δ q b should be considered in the calculation and time b is any time after time a excluding the last 6 hr before reaching the study area if δ q b 0 is maintained q a equals to δ q a if δ q b 0 q a is decreasing by the following proportion 6 q a δ q a q b δ t q b where q b δ t and q b are the specific humidity of air parcels at time b δ t and time b respectively 3 the effective moisture contribution ratio of region i to the target area cr i can be expressed as follows 7 cr i q i q t 6 100 where q i is the sum of the effective specific humidity change for all air parcels over the region i while q t 6 is the total specific humidity of all air parcels over the last 6 hr before reaching the target region 3 results 3 1 warm season rainfall over the scb and the associated moisture transport fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the mean warm season precipitation over the period 1981 2017 overall averaged over the scb the mean total warm season precipitation was 806 7 mm with centers of maximum rainfall located over the western scb such as at ya an 29 59 n 103 00 e leshan 29 34 n 103 45 e and meishan 30 04 n 103 48 e where the total precipitation exceeded 1200 mm these features are generally consistent with previous studies zhu and yu 2003 moreover the warm season precipitation over the scb is characterized by significant interannual variability as indicated by the normalized time series of warm season precipitation averaged at 121 meteorological stations over the scb during the period 1981 2017 fig 2b where a positive negative value represents adequate inadequate rainfall in addition we found significant positive correlations between the total warm season precipitation over the scb and total runoff from the rivers jialing r 0 75 p 0 01 tuo r 0 76 p 0 01 and min r 0 61 p 0 01 fig 2b suggesting that flooding is closely related to warm season precipitation over interannual timescales based on the normalized precipitation values above 1 or below 1 standard deviations we classified six years with maximum above normal values as wet years 1981 1984 1985 1988 1998 and 2013 and six years with minimum below normal values as dry years 1994 1997 2001 2002 2006 and 2011 during the wet years increases in warm season precipitation were recorded consistently at all stations over the scb but increases of more than 400 mm relative to the dry years occurred mostly in the central and northern parts of the scb fig 2c the climatology of the column integrated atmospheric water vapor flux between may and september is shown in fig 3 a the primary moisture channel supplying precipitation over the scb was the southwest channel from the indian ocean and the indochina peninsula the moisture fluxes delivered by both the south from the maritime continent and southeast from the western north pacific channels were relatively weaker these features are similar to those described in previous studies zhou et al 2005 huang and cui 2015 chen and xu 2016 compared with dry years the southwesterly wind anomalies from the yunnan guizhou plateau significantly enhance moisture transport to the scb in wet years as reported by jiang et al 2007 and li et al 2010 which is favorable for rainfall over the scb fig 3b 3 2 climatology of moisture sources and paths to investigate the sources and paths associated with the moisture supply for warm season precipitation over the scb we used the concept of effective trajectory which is defined with a decrease in specific humidity during the last 6 hr before arrival in the target region i e the scb by definition the effective trajectories are those that contribute to rainfall over the scb we identified 3 922 028 effective trajectories which accounted for 34 0 of all trajectories we divided these trajectories into four groups using the clustering method outlined above the curve in fig 4 a shows diminishing returns in terms of improvement in fit beyond k 4 consequently this is a reasonable endpoint for the cluster analysis and hence the number of clusters that we used for the moisture trajectories was 4 fig 4b shows the distribution of the trajectory frequency and the four groups of moisture pathways for the scb between may and september black circles represent the mean position of the air parcels in each group of backward trajectories on the first 24 hr fourth 96 hr seventh 168 hr and tenth 240 hr day before the precipitation overall the four groups of pathways coincide with the high values of the trajectory frequency the average altitude and specific humidity within each group along the pathways during the 10 days of backward tracking are shown in fig 5 during the last 6 hr the altitude of the four group mean trajectories rises and the specific humidity decreases indicating intense moisture condensation with a strong ascending motion among all groups the southwesterly path group 3 from the bay of bengal was the most important moisture transport pathway accounting for 36 0 of the total moisture and 34 9 of the total trajectories this group of pathways is ocean originated and during the early period of the simulation 240 to 96 hr indicates the backward simulation it had the highest specific humidity fig 5 as it moved to the target region the altitude specific humidity increased decreased until about 24 hr indicating a large amount of moisture loss due to the influence of the topography along the pathways such as the indochina peninsula and the yunnan guizhou plateau furthermore it experienced moisture uptake over the scb during the last day before arriving at the target region fig 4b and 5 the northeasterly path group 2 ranked second in both trajectory contribution 34 2 and moisture contribution 26 5 however the importance of this group of pathways has rarely been stressed in previous studies along this path the air parcels maintained a high specific humidity over 9 g kg 1 and a low altitude below 2000 m with no large variability until the last 12 hr before reaching the target region fig 5 the remaining two groups of pathways i e the northwesterly group 1 and westerly group 4 paths together contributed less than a third 29 8 of the total moisture the altitude specific humidity was among the highest lowest of the four paths almost throughout the pathway especially the trajectories in group 4 for which the specific humidity was always 5 g kg 1 the moisture uptake for both of these groups occurred mainly near the qinghai tibet plateau and the scb within the last 4 days 96 to 6 hr fig s 4b and 5 fig 6 a shows the spatial distribution of the moisture contribution to warm season precipitation over the scb which is similar to that of the trajectory frequency in fig 4b and the differences can be attributed mainly to changes in specific humidity along the trajectories for instance the moisture contributions from the western arabian sea 0 02 over most regions and the western indian peninsula 0 001 over most regions are in sharp contrast and this can be attributed largely to the orographic precipitation caused by the western ghat over the western indian peninsula to identify the major moisture sources and their contributions we calculated the contributions from six moisture source regions as illustrated in fig 6a namely eurasia a the indian ocean b the south china sea c the sichuan basin d eastern china e and the western north pacific f the moisture contributions from the individual regions on climatological state are shown in fig 6b the indian ocean b is the most important moisture source accounting for 36 3 of the total moisture contribution high moisture contributions occur in the bay of bengal and indochina peninsula over the indian ocean region eastern china e and eurasia a make important moisture contributions to the target region supplying 21 2 and 15 7 respectively for eurasia high values are found over the qinghai tibet plateau especially to its south in addition the sichuan basin d contributes 13 3 of the moisture indicating that evaporation over the scb contributes to warm season precipitation within the region itself the south china sea c and western north pacific f contribute the least moisture to rainfall over the scb and account for only 8 6 and 3 9 respectively of the moisture contribution to the target region 3 3 interannual variability of moisture sources and paths fig 7 shows the differences in trajectory frequency and the four groups of moisture channels between wet and dry years compared with dry years the wet years show a significant increase in the frequency of southwesterly trajectories across the bay of bengal and indochina peninsula whereas there is a decrease in the frequency of northeasterly trajectories across eastern and northern china for the southwesterly path group 3 from the bay of bengal in wet years the corresponding moisture contribution and trajectory frequency increase by 18 6 38 3 vs 32 3 and 19 5 36 8 vs 30 8 respectively over the dry years in contrast the moisture contributions trajectory frequencies of the westerly path group 4 the northwesterly path group 1 and the northeasterly path group 2 decreased by 16 4 16 2 10 4 7 7 and 5 5 4 1 respectively however in contrast to the long term mean state during the dry years the northeasterly path group 2 instead of the southwesterly path group3 becomes the most important path in terms of moisture contribution 34 6 fig 7b which indicates the potential impacts of the northeasterly path on regulating warm season precipitation over the scb the composite differences in moisture contribution to the target region and the moisture contribution differences of the six source regions between wet and dry years are shown in fig 8 the spatial distribution of moisture contribution changes is mostly consistent with that of the trajectory frequency changes indicating that an increase in trajectory frequency may lead to an increased moisture contribution from a certain region compared with dry years during the wet years moisture contribution from the indian ocean b increases by 20 71 38 38 vs 31 80 and especially significantly from the bay of bengal and indochina peninsula consistent with the composite analysis there is a significant positive correlation r 0 53 p 0 01 between the time series of total warm season precipitation and the moisture contribution from the indian ocean b in contrast the moisture contributions from eastern china e eurasia a and the sichuan basin d decrease by 12 95 20 38 vs 23 41 14 40 14 17 vs 16 56 and 8 42 12 87 vs 14 05 respectively in addition compared with the above sources the changes in moisture contributions from the south china sea c and western north pacific f are almost negligible furthermore the interannual variability of runoff across the scb can be linked to changes in the moisture contributions from the various sources for example variations in runoff from the jialing river r 0 51 p 0 05 and the tuo river r 0 44 p 0 05 are closely correlated with moisture contribution from the indian ocean this is because when moisture contributions from the indian ocean are higher than normal excess warm season precipitation is observed over the central and northern scb where the jialing and tuo basins are located fig 9 a in contrast variations in runoff from the jialing are significantly negatively correlated r 0 53 p 0 05 with the moisture contribution from the scb because when the moisture contribution from the scb increases negative precipitation anomalies occur over the jialing basin fig 9b however variations in moisture contributions from the other four sources are poorly correlated with runoff across the scb to investigate the possible mechanisms behind the relationship between moisture contributions and the precipitation anomalies we regressed the column integrated moisture flux and the associated divergence onto the variations in moisture contributions from two sources i e the indian ocean and scb in years with an above normal moisture contribution from the indian ocean significant moisture convergence anomalies occur over central and northern parts of the scb associated with the increase in moisture transport from the indian ocean fig 10 a this leads to an increase in local precipitation fig 9a and increased runoff from the rivers jialing and tuo in contrast in years with an above normal moisture contribution from the sichuan basin there are significant moisture divergence anomalies over central and northern parts of the scb this leads to a reduction in moisture transport from the indian ocean fig 10b which significantly suppresses precipitation fig 9b and reduces runoff from the jialing river 4 discussion and conclusions in this study climatological moisture sources and pathways and their interannual variability associated with precipitation across the sichuan basin scb during the warm season may to september over the period 1981 2017 were investigated using the hysplit model our main findings are summarized below for the long term mean state over the period 1981 2017 the trajectories were clustered into four groups the southwesterly northeasterly northwesterly and westerly paths the southwesterly path from the indian ocean was the most important path and accounted for 34 9 of total trajectories and 36 0 of total moisture the northeasterly path across eastern china ranked second in both trajectory contribution 26 5 and moisture contribution 34 2 these two pathways combined to contribute more than 70 of all moisture regarding the moisture contribution from individual sources the indian ocean accounting for 36 3 of all moisture was the most important moisture source for precipitation over the scb in addition eastern china 21 2 eurasia 15 7 and the sichuan basin 13 3 also served as important moisture contributors regarding the interannual variability compared with dry years there were significant increases during wet years in the moisture contributions from the southwesterly path of 18 6 38 3 vs 32 3 and the indian ocean of 20 71 38 38 vs 31 80 in contrast the contributions from the other moisture pathways and major source areas were lower in the wet years than in the dry years in the wet years the southwesterly path ranked first for moisture contribution 38 3 whereas in the dry years the northeasterly path was most important 34 6 furthermore the yearly moisture contribution from the indian ocean was significantly positively correlated r 0 53 p 0 01 with total warm season precipitation over the scb further analysis revealed significant correlations between the variations in moisture contributions from the various sources and the fluctuations in runoff across the scb over interannual timescales a significant positive correlation was found between moisture contributions from the indian ocean and runoff from the jialing river r 0 51 p 0 05 and the tuo river r 0 44 p 0 05 which we interpreted as being related to the anomalous precipitation over the jialing and tuo basins associated with the variations in moisture contributions from the indian ocean in contrast we found a significant negative correlation r 0 53 p 0 05 between moisture contributions from the scb and runoff from the jialing river which we relate to anomalous precipitation over the jialing basin associated with variations in moisture contributions from the scb it should be mentioned that not all moisture can be attributed by using the moisture source attribution method sodemann et al 2008 one reason for this is the residence time of moisture in the atmosphere used for this study was 10 days it is known that the longer the backward tracking time the more moisture can be identified for precipitation over the target region however when the backward tracking time is beyond 10 days wind field errors can lead to large deviations of trajectories stohl and seibert 1998 the other is that 10 days before reaching the target area the air parcels are not assured to have a zero specific humidity and this part of the moisture is not attributed for this study the attributable moisture accounted for about 70 0 68 5 and 70 0 of all moisture for the long term mean state of the period 1981 2017 the selected wet years and the selected dry years respectively which is similar to the values reported in previous studies sodemann and zubler 2009 chen and luo 2018 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key r d
