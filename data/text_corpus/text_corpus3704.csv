18520,reservoir operations affect both the quantity and quality of stored and discharged water hedging rules hrs are commonly used in water supply reservoir operations to ration water delivery and decrease water shortage risk however the increased carryover storage with hedging may aggravate reservoir eutrophication through complex effects on hydrodynamic temperature light nutrient and sediment conditions the influencing mechanisms are unclear and require further investigation this study applies a mathematical modeling approach to comparing the effects of standard operation policy sop and hr discussing the processes and driving factors and exploring the relationship between water shortage and water quality indicators we simulate reservoir operation by sop and optimize hr to generate water supply schedules and run a quasi 3d water quality model to simulate reservoir hydrodynamic conditions nutrient cycles water sediment exchanges and algal dynamics under various water supply schedules the danjiangkou reservoir the water source for china s south north water transfer project is used as a case study the hr for this reservoir decreases its water shortage risk from 22 under sop to 8 modeling results find that the hr increases sediment phosphorus p release by 285 3 tons 5 7 annually as a consequence of extended reservoir submerged area and aggravated hypolimnetic hypoxia increased p release can support algal growth but this effect is set off by the enhancement of light limiting effect caused by higher storages under hr consequently decreasing the annual mean chlorophyll a concentration in the deep reservoir by 18 the hr also improves the horizontal mixing of water by changing the hydraulic retention time and flow velocity field which mitigates algal bloom risks in the surrounding shallow water zones but deteriorates water quality of the release to downstream the water quality analysis offers implications for reservoir managers to coordinate their efforts in

reservoir operations on water quality would provide scientific support to enable hydraulic regulations as effective methods for water quality protection while sustaining the water supply service of reservoirs around the world lürling et al 2016 the regulation of inflow for water quantity is the primary objective in current water supply reservoir operations hedging rule hr is a common operation policy for rationing water supply quantities between now and future to reduce water shortage risk in future periods draper and lund 2004 kumar and kasthurirengan 2018 you and cai 2008 for a water supply reservoir water can be released to satisfy current water demands or retained in the reservoir for future usage it is not always beneficial to fully meet the immediate demand even when enough water is available due to the possibility of future drought events and the nonlinearity in water use benefits xu et al 2017a instead the rational way is to curtail the current supply by a certain extent and retain some water for high value usages during subsequent dry periods when water availability is below a certain threshold to address this hr is used in reservoir operations to answer the questions of when and how much water should be curtailed from current release and retained for future use which represents a tradeoff between current and future water usage shiau 2011 tu et al 2008 you and cai 2008 despite the benefits in rationing the quantity of water delivery hrs may also result in multiple negative effects on reservoir water quality first hrs typically decrease water flow and increase the hydraulic retention time in a reservoir it has been widely shown that a low flow velocity and long hydraulic retention time weaken water exchange and the flushing effect on algal communities which is beneficial for algal proliferation gao et al 2018 yang et al 2013 second hrs promote higher reservoir storage levels during some periods and may aggravate seasonal thermal stratification according to the critical depth model sverdrup 1953 the ratio of euphotic depth to mixing depth in the water column determines the algal bloom potential which is restrained when the ratio is below a critical value liu et al 2012 thermal stratification benefits algal bloom proliferation by decreasing the mixing depth li et al 2015 in addition hrs can affect nutrient cycling in a reservoir especially matter exchanges between the water and sediment in particular reservoir sediments can act as a phosphorus p sink maavara et al 2015 vollenweider 1975 however when external p loads are under controlled p stored in reservoir sediments releases and sediments therefore act as an internal p source hamilton 2012 shu et al 2017 this phenomenon is referred to p legacy sharpley et al 2013 oxygen is an important controller of sediment p release gerling et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 hrs can enlarge the submerged area of reservoirs and may aggravate hypolimnetic hypoxia caused by higher water depths during water stratification season thereby promoting sediment nutrient release besides the negative effects listed above hrs can also have positive effects on water quality for example hrs increase the dilution storage of a reservoir by retaining more water within the reservoir to analyze these complex negative and positive effects a comprehensive quantitative examination is needed to assess reservoir hydrodynamic temperature light nutrient and sediment conditions under the various reservoir operation policies existing research concerning the impacts of reservoir operations on water quality have mostly focused on water quality downstream of dams e g dhar and datta 2008 park et al 2014 weber et al 2017 or in tributaries to reservoirs yang et al 2013 there are a few studies on the impacts on water quality in reservoirs but those generally considered single water quality factors only such as p huang et al 2015 temperature li et al 2018b or sedimentation lee and foster 2013 in particular a few studies have addressed water quality within a reservoir through reservoir operation optimization e g castelletti et al 2013 chaves and kojiri 2007 kerachian and karamouz 2006 those studies all employed zero dimensional 0d or 1d water quality models without accounting for the horizontal distribution of water quality and did not analyze the factors and processes driving the water quality changes indeed the influencing mechanisms underlying reservoir operations on temporal and spatial variations of different water quality factors in reservoirs and their releases as well as the relationships between water supply and water quality are all important for reservoir operation policy evaluation research is needed to understand the mechanisms and explore the relationships for designing more appropriate reservoir operation policies to mitigate the conflicts between reservoir water supply and water quality in this study we apply a comprehensive modeling approach to assess the impacts of water supply operation policies on temporal and spatial distributions of water quality in a reservoir and of the water release and analyze the key factors and processes driving these impacts we simulate reservoir operations by standard operation policy sop and optimize hr to generate water supply schedules and run a quasi 3d hydrodynamic eutrophication sediment model to simulate reservoir hydrodynamic conditions nutrient cycles water sediment exchanges and algal dynamics resulting from the water supply schedules under sop and hr the danjiangkou reservoir which serves as the water source for the middle route of south north water transfer project snwtp in china is used as a case study the implications of the results are discussed for the sake of sustainable reservoir operation considering both water quantity and quality 2 methodology we first introduce the study area that is used to illustrate the methodology proposed in this paper this will ease the description of the reservoir water quality simulation model as well as help understanding the study issues involving tradeoffs between water supply and water quality and between in situ reservoir and downstream environment 2 1 study area the danjiangkou reservoir located in the yangtze river basin is the second largest reservoir in china with a storage capacity of 29 05 109 m3 at the normal pool stage i e 170 m the reservoir serves as the water source for the middle route of snwtp fig 1 a national key project in china and the largest inter basin water transfer project in the world the reservoir is scheduled to provide 9 5 109 m3 water per year through the snwtp to northern cities under high water stress including two megacities beijing and tianjin the reservoir retains water that mainly derives from two tributaries of the yangtze river namely the han river and the dan river inflow from the han river is much greater the danjiangkou dam controls the release of water for both downstream human and ecosystem usage the taocha gate which is located at the head of the snwtp controls water delivery to northern china fig 1 meanwhile eutrophication is a severe threat to water quality in the danjiangkou reservoir the concentrations of total nitrogen tn and tp in the reservoir exceeded the established standard for drinking water local algal blooms occurred several times during the period from 1992 to 2003 tang et al 2014 since then nutrient concentrations in the reservoir have been increasing field monitored data during 2006 2012 showed that the tn concentration in the reservoir increased by about 50 while the tp concentration nearly doubled during a period of seven years ma et al 2014 additionally investigations have found that p in particular of loosely exchangeable form storage in the soil surrounding the reservoir area is high tang et al 2014 to enhance water supply reliability for the snwtp the reservoir storage was increased starting in 2014 since then sediment p release in the intermittent submerged zone surrounding the reservoir has been observed shu et al 2017 the potential increase of algal bloom risk as a consequence of decreased flow velocities and increased hydraulic retention time has also been discussed pan et al 2018 2 2 reservoir operation method in general water supply reservoir operations follow either sop or hr zhao et al 2011 sop supplies water to the current demand as much as the water available allows and retains only surplus water if the water available i e the sum of the initial storage and reservoir inflow exceeds the current demand for future usage loucks et al 1981 stedinger 1984 thus sop does not consider any future water shortage vulnerability hrs are adopted for reservoir operations to reduce the risk of severe water shortages in the future as well as to improve overall water delivery benefits bower et al 1962 since the late 1970s hrs have been extensively studied in reservoir operation research and widely employed for real world practices e g kumar and kasthurirengan 2018 you and cai 2008 various methods have been proposed to determine hrs for reservoir operations among these the reservoir operating rule curve is a common method tu et al 2008 yin et al 2011 and is employed for the danjiangkou reservoir xu et al 2017b fig 2 shows typical reservoir operating curves which divide a reservoir into four zones of different storage levels yin et al 2011 different operating rules i e with different release rates are applied to the various zones a reservoir releases water to satisfy the full water demand when the reservoir storage is above the upper limit curve i e zone 1 with extraordinarily high water availability however when the reservoir storage is below this curve a reservoir releases water to satisfy only a part of the current demand namely the water release is curtailed by a b and c for zone 2 3 and 4 respectively more water is curtailed from current release when reservoir water availability is lower i e 0 a b c 100 resulting in decreasing levels of release for the demand at the current stage from zone 1 to zone 4 and no water is released when reservoir storage is below the dead level in this zone based hr a b and c are the hedging rates of the different zones and their values are typically determined empirically by reservoir managers regarding specified water supply reliability and acceptable deficits yin et al 2011 the shapes and locations of these curves in fig 2 are typically determined through optimization a common optimization model is formulated as below with an objective to minimize multi year mean economic losses caused by water supply deficits under a constraint of water shortage control the economic loss is expressed as a quadratic function of the water deficit ratio draper and lund 2004 tu et al 2008 in the case of the danjiangkou reservoir water shortage is defined as the water delivery rate below the critical value of 135 m3 s 1 which is the designed minimum flow rate for the snwtp yang et al 2017 we simulate reservoir operations under sop and the designed hr yang et al 2017 for the danjiangkou reservoir the

under sop to 8 2 3 reservoir eutrophication simulation this study selects a quasi 3d water quality model developed with the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc platform for reservoir eutrophication simulation the efdc is a state of the art surface water modeling system supported by the united states environmental protection agency which includes modules for hydrodynamic temperature sediment and water quality simulations hamrick 1992 tetra tech inc 2007 efdc has been widely used to model various water body types including rivers lakes estuaries and reservoirs chen et al 2016 the hydrodynamic eutrophication modules of the efdc are capable of simulating a dozen water quality parameters including dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss algae groups i e cyanobacteria bc green algae bg diatom algae bd and stationary algae bm and multiple components of carbon c n and p cycles to better simulate realistic distributions organic c n and p are represented by three reactive sub classes namely labile particulate organic lpo refractory particulate organic rpo and dissolved organic sub classes the interaction processes between the various water quality state variables are illustrated in fig 3 tetra tech inc 2007 water quality is simulated on the basis of hydrodynamic and temperature simulations algae play a central role in the water eutrophication module the efdc accounts for algal growth basal metabolism predation and settling in simulating algal dynamics algal growth depends on nutrient availability ambient light and temperature main governing equations on these processes are provided in the supplementary material the effect of reservoir operations on sediment nutrient release is a research topic of this study to simulate the processes occurring in sediment and the matter flux at the water sediment interface the sediment diagenesis module in the efdc is activated and coupled with the hydrodynamic eutrophication modules the sediment module considers basic processes that include 1 the depositional flux of particulate organic c n and p from the water 2 the diagenesis of particulate organic matter in sediment and 3 the resultant flux of substances e g phosphate ammonium and nitrate and oxygen between the water and sediment details on simulation processes and governing equations can be found in tetra tech inc 2007 to simulate water quality in the danjiangkou reservoir we follow our previous work and employ an existing hydrodynamic eutrophication sediment model developed by chen et al 2016 for the danjiangkou reservoir the model simulates c n and p dynamics and two dominant algal groups i e green algae and cyanobacteria in the reservoir to set up the model bathymetry processing mesh generation and boundary conditions setting were completed field bathymetry were conducted to detect the terrain in deep water zones and the field data were combined with an existing digital elevation model to determining the reservoir bottom topography chen et al 2016 xu et al 2017b two types of grid systems were coupled for the mesh generation i e a rectangular grid system for wide areas of the reservoir and an orthogonally curvilinear system for narrow channels connected to the reservoir the final mesh of the model contains 10 000 cells on a horizontal plane with a cell size of 280 m the reservoir is stratified into six vertical layers allowing the simulation of the vertical distribution of water quality the hydrological data used in the model were provided by local hydrological stations the meteorological data including air temperature precipitation evaporation wind speed solar radiation and cloud conditions were obtained from the national meteorological information center of china a dynamic time step is used for modeling and the initial step is set as 2 s the model was calibrated and validated for the danjiangkou reservoir using tn tp do and chlorophyll a chl a field data obtained in 2009 and 2010 chen et al 2016 for the current study we select 2009 as the study period with necessary data on hydrological meteorological and pollutant loading conditions 3 results and discussion for this case study of danjiangkou reservoir we provide detailed modeling results under two representative reservoir operation policies namely sop and the designed hr by comparing the modeling outputs between the two policies we show different influences on stored and discharged water quality and discuss the processes and key driving factors finally by comparing a number of scenarios with different hedging levels we demonstrate the relationship between water shortage and reservoir eutrophication indicators 3 1 phosphorus dynamics and release from sediment globally p is a limiting factor of algal blooms in many water bodies fig 4 provides plane averaged tp concentration variations for the different layers in the danjiangkou reservoir under sop and the designed hr seasonal variations in plane averaged tp concentration are found in the reservoir under both policies tp concentrations are higher in summer and autumn from june to november than those in other seasons this is attributed to the variation of matter exchange between water and sediment across seasons modeling results show that p release from sediment is significantly active in summer and autumn fig 5 while the deposition of organic p particulates from water to sediment is a dominant process in spring and winter a large amount of p releases from sediment during summer and autumn months which significantly increases tp concentrations in the bottom layer while having a smaller effect on tp concentrations in the surface layer which results in a situation that the tp concentration in the surface layer is much lower than that in the bottom during the summer and early autumn from june to september as displayed by dsb in fig 4 this is caused by thermal stratification which hinders the vertical mixing of reservoir water a common phenomenon during the summer and early autumn as thermal stratification dissipates in late autumn vertical mixing is renewed in reservoir water and the difference in tp concentrations between the bottom and surface layers becomes much smaller in the river basins contributing to the danjiangkou reservoir flooding events typically occur during july to october before the flood season reservoir storages under both sop and hr are relatively low since hr curtails water releases to build up carryover storage releases under sop are larger and thus the reservoir storage levels are lower thus under sop the average flow velocity in the reservoir is higher than that under hr it is found that disturbance accompanied with high flow velocities slightly increase sediment p release during april to june fig 5a which ends with a bit higher tp concentrations in the bottom layer under sop than those under hr during may to july as displayed by the upper boundary of dsb in fig 4 as inflows significantly increase the differences of tp concentrations under sop and hr are much more significant since august compared to sop more water is retained in the reservoir during the flood season under the hr policy to decease water shortage risk during subsequent dry seasons thus the reservoir dilution capability under hr is higher however fig 4 shows that starting in august the tp concentration under hr is higher than that under sop with the same external pollutant loads under the two policy scenarios the result discussed above implies that hr increases the amount of p release from sediment as shown in fig 5a starting in august the daily p release rate under hr is higher compared to that under sop the difference is as high as 5 3 tons day 1 the p release throughout the modeling year under hr is 285 3 tons 5 7 higher than that under sop two reasons explain this higher release rate since august first more water is retained in the reservoir under hr and the submerged area of the reservoir is larger the intermittent submerged zone surrounding the reservoir presents as a large p storage and contributes to the p loading into the reservoir second the hr policy resulting in higher reservoir storage levels can aggravate hypolimnetic hypoxia during water stratification seasons i e summer and early autumn the absorption of phosphate onto iron oxyhydroxides is a crucial process affecting sediment p dynamics ding et al 2016 hypolimnetic hypoxia promotes iron oxyhydroxides dissolution and thereby improves sediment phosphate release chen et al 2018 testa et al 2013 oxygen at the bottom in deep water zones are generally lower than that in shallow water zones during water stratification seasons thus sediment p release rates in deep water zones of the reservoir are generally higher than those in surrounding shallow water zones as displayed in fig 5b 3 2 algae dynamics and limiting factors the chl a concentration is used to represent algae conditions in the reservoir variations in seasonal chl a concentration are modeled under both reservoir operation policies the chl a concentration in summer and autumn from june to november was considerably higher than that in other seasons fig 6 a the vertical difference of the chl a concentration is obvious among the six layers during these months fig 6b which is due to thermal stratification moreover the chl a concentration in the hypolimnion is much lower and this is due to algal growth constraints with light limitations and low temperatures since the risk of an algal bloom at the surface layer is significantly higher the following analysis focuses on the chl a concentration in the surface layer fig 6a as presented in section 3 1 hr promotes p release from sediment and thereby increases the p concentration in reservoir water however it is also found that starting in april the plane averaged chl a concentration in the surface layer is generally lower under the hr policy fig 6a the annual mean value under hr is 11 08 μg l 1 lower by 18 than that under sop 13 45 μg l 1 this is explained in the following with exploration on the potential factors on algal growth under different operation policies main factors that may affect algal growth include n p light and temperature the limiting effects of these factors are described by indicators equ 3 8 in the supplementary material in the efdc the values of these indicators range from 0 to 1 where a lower value represents a stronger limiting effect modeling results show that the trend in intra year algal variation is driven by temperature temperature suppresses algal growth during the period from january to april in which the limiting indicator is generally lower than 0 3 under both operation policies fig 7 b the limiting indicator is or close to 1 0 from june to september which means that temperature is nearly optimal for algal growth this explains why the chl a concentration during these months is significantly high fig 6a the differences of temperature effects under the two operation policies are generally small throughout the modeling year fig 7b since water temperature is mainly driven by air temperature however slightly opposite effects are found between sop and hr for two periods april june and october december i e temperature limiting effect is stronger during april to june and is weaker during october to december under hr than sop this is because water temperature varies slower than air temperature does and a delay effect exists water temperature increases with air temperature from april to june since reservoir storages under hr are larger than those under sop water temperature increases slower under hr thus temperature limiting effect under hr is stronger during this period similarly water temperature decreases with air temperature from october to december it decreases slower and consequently the temperature effect is weaker under hr than sop additionally the delay of water temperature variation also explains the differences of temperature limiting effects in january and december actually air temperature decreases sharply in november and the air temperature in december is similar with that in january however water temperature decreases much slower this explains the gradual decrease of temperature limiting indicator in november and december fig 7b on the other hand the limiting effect of light exhibits significant daily fluctuations fig 7a due to the various weather conditions e g sunny cloudy or rainy conditions modeling results show that light limiting indicator is generally lower than 0 6 under both policies during june to october fig 7a when the limiting indicators of other factors i e n p and temperature are generally higher than 0 9 this means that light is the dominant limiting factor on algal growth in the reservoir during months when algal bloom risk is high i e june to october water depth is an important factor affecting light limiting effect due to light attenuation in water bodies the case study reservoir is located in a mountainous area with steep slopes i e a v shape reservoir as many other reservoirs in the world the reservoir is deep and thereby light limitation is strong especially during summer and autumn when water inflows are generally high fig 7a only shows the light limiting effect on algae within the surface layer while light limitation is obviously stronger in the layers below the surface layer reservoir operation affects water depths in the reservoir and thereby affects light limiting effect on algal growth reservoir storages under both sop and hr are relatively low during the period from january to may due to low inflows thus the differences of light limiting effects under sop and hr are small during this period fig 7a however as inflow increases since june the differences of reservoir storages under sop and hr become more significant hr results in considerably stronger light limitation than sop starting from june fig 7a this is because the reservoir storage level under hr is higher and a greater water depth weakens light access to algae to summarize opposite effects on algal growth exist with hr in summer and autumn i e promoted p release from sediment and thus mitigated p limitation on algal growth and enhanced light limitation under both policies during the months when algal bloom risk is high i e june to october p limitation is weak indicator 0 9 and light limitation is strong indicator 0 6 and presents as a dominant factor on algal growth therefore despite promoting p release from sediment hr decreases the space averaged chl a concentration in the reservoir fig 6a due to a strong light limitation effect on algal growth 3 3 horizontal algal distribution in the reservoir and water quality of release aside from the vertical distribution horizontal distribution of the chl a concentration is also significant in the danjiangkou reservoir under both sop and hr the chl a concentration in the surrounding shallow water zones is generally higher than that in deep water zones fig 8 a and b which is due to stronger light limitation in deeper water reservoir operation policies affect the horizontal distribution of algae by changing water depth and the horizontal flow velocity field under sop flow velocities along the route between the han river entryway the primary inflow source of the danjiangkou reservoir and the dam are obviously higher than those in other reservoir zones fig 8d given that high flow velocities are unfavorable to algal accumulation and weaken water mixing by reducing the hydraulic retention time the chl a concentration along the route between the han river entryway and the dam is lower than that in other zones fig 8b on the other hand hr increases the hydraulic retention time and enhances water mixing in the entire reservoir fig 8c thus the chl a concentration under hr ends with a more evenly distribution fig 8a than under sop fig 8b an even distribution is beneficial for mitigating algal bloom risk in surrounding shallow water zones but it poses some negative effect on the water quality along the route between the inflow entryway and the dam as displayed in fig 8a and b because of these positive and negative effects the influence of hr on the water quality in the water delivery from the reservoir depends on the location of reservoir outlets which is further discussed as follows the danjiangkou reservoir has two outlets the dam and taocha gate labeled in fig 8 the water quality in the release from the dam for downstream usage is provided in fig 9 a and b since sediment p release is not active and low temperture suppresses algal growth during january to april the differences of water quality in reservoir releases under sop and hr are hardly obvious in this period however the chl a and tp concentrations are significantly higher under hr starting in june fig 9a and b as discussed above hr enhances p release from sediment and increases chl a concentration along the route between the inflow entryway and the dam by promoting horizontal mixing of water thereby resulting in a negative effect on the quality of water release to downstream on the other hand hr also results in higher tp concentration in the water delivery from the taocha gate fig 8d but it leads to a positive effect on chl a concentration fig 8c which is opposite to its effect on the water release from the dam this is attributed to the locations of two outlets the water depth of the reservoir at the dam is high but at the taocha gate where water is delivered to the snwtp the water depth is relatively low hr promotes horizontal mixing of water which increases chl a concentration at the dam and in the water release while decreasing chl a concentration in shallow water zones and thus the water delivery these results show that a reservoir operation policy can effectuate opposite water quality effects at different outlets in additional water quality of different outlets under a given operation policy sop or hr are different by comparing fig 9a and c the chl a concentration in the water delivery via the taocha gate is significantly higher than that in the water release to downstream via the dam this is because water release via the dam is from a deep layer of the reservoir while water delivery via the taocha gate is from the surface layer the chl a concentration in the deep layers of the reservoir is much lower than that in the shallow layers due to the stronger light and temperature limitations on algal growth 3 4 relationship between water shortage and eutrophication indicators to explore the relationship between water shortage and eutrophication indicators we create two additional reservoir operation hr policies by setting different hedging rates using multi year 1955 2005 historical inflow records the modeled water shortage risk is 22 for sop 8 for the designed hr and 17 and 12 for the two additional hr policies the means of chl a and tp concentrations vs water shortage risk from june to november in the reservoir the release to downstream via the dam and the delivery to northern china via the snwtp are compared among the four operation scenarios fig 10 since hr promotes sediment p release the reservoir space averaged tp concentration increases as the water shortage risk decreases implying a tradeoff between p pollution and water shortage mitigation fig 10b however hr also promotes higher reservoir storage levels and then enhances light limitation on algal growth which decreases the reservoir space averaged chl a concentration thus hr can be a win win policy for chl a concentration control and water shortage mitigation fig 10a furthermore the results show that hr changes the horizontal distribution of algae in the reservoir and effectuates opposite effects on chl a concentration at two outlets fig 8 due to improved horizontal mixing of water under hr chl a concentration increases in the water release via the dam while decreases in the water delivery via the snwtp fig 10a given the opposite effects of hr on different water quality indicators tp and chl a and on the water quality at the two outlets to determine which policy is the best depends on managers priorities on multiple water quality targets as well as water conservation fig 10 illustrates the relationships between the water quantity target and multiple water quality targets i e control of tp and algae in the reservoir and in the water discharges taking advantage of the relationships reservoir managers can choose their desirable operation policy based on their priorities on the various water quantity and water quality targets additionally this study finds no significant difference among the operation polices on the tn concentration in the reservoir the mean space averaged tn concentration in the reservoir throughout the year ranges from 1 14 under the designed hr to 1 19 under sop mg l 1 under all operation scenarios hr results in a trivial and positive effect on decreasing reservoir tn concentration during july to october which is opposite to the negative effect on tp concentration according to the modeling results on sediment n release nitrate release is weak under all operation policies and hr promotes ammonium release from the sediment during summer and autumn as a consequence of the aggravation of hypolimnetic hypoxia however the increase of ammonium release caused by hr is small 1 6 under three hr policies scenarios and is offset by higher reservoir dilution capability this explains the trivial and positive effect of hr policy on decreasing tn concentration in the reservoir some field data reported in recent studies are helpful for validating the results described above hr policy has been used in the danjiangkou reservoir for managing water delivery for the snwtp since 2014 as a result the mean annual storage level increased from 144 m in 2012 2013 to 154 m in 2015 2016 pan et al 2018 field monitoring results found that tp in the reservoir sediment decreased from 557 mg kg 1 in 2012 2013 to 530 mg kg 1 in 2015 2016 li et al 2018a the increase of storage level from 144 to 154 m extended the reservoir submerged area by 177 km2 and the newly submerged land contributed to the p loading into the reservoir shu et al 2017 meanwhile field sampling analysis found that phytoplankton biomass in the reservoir decreased from 7 4 mg l 1 in 2014 to 4 9 mg l 1 in 2015 and 2 3 mg l 1 in 2016 pan et al 2018 the biomass reduction can be explained by the increased reservoir dilution capability and the weakened light access to algae caused by significant water depth increase shen et al 2015 loiselle et al 2007 demonstrated that light availability is dominant in controlling algal growth in many aquatic ecosystems and it is directly affected by hydrological conditions these observations are consistent with the results from our study i e hr policy ending with increased carryover storage can promote sediment p release but decreased chl a concentration in the reservoir these findings provide implications for sustainable reservoir management since hr can cause opposite consequences to water quality i e increased sediment p release but reduced algal concentration reservoir managers need to use hr with caution to mitigate the negative impact on water quality and take advantage of the positive impact e g reduced algal concentration given the significant spatial differences of water quality within a reservoir the selection of appropriate outlet locations and water layers wherein to discharge water is important besides given the temporal variation of water quality impact from reservoir operation various water users e g human agriculture industry and ecosystem with different water quality requirement should be coordinated to satisfy the multiple requirements using the methods presented in this study future studies may extend the modeling period to explore the long term influence of operation policies and account for the inflow variability and change caused by either human interference and or climate change in addition external nutrient loads affect matter exchanges at the water sediment interface the influence of reservoir operations on sediment nutrient retention and release can be further explored under different external nutrient load scenarios which can offer implications for the implementation of the total maximum daily load within watersheds contributing to a reservoir 4 conclusions hedging is typically used in water supply reservoir operations to regulate water supply quantities between now and future in order to reduce severe water shortage risk in the future in this study we develop a reservoir operation optimization model coupled with an integrated hydrodynamic eutrophication sediment model using the models we assess the impacts of operation policies such as hr and sop on the quality of stored and discharged reservoir water which in turn can be used to optimize hr to consider both water quantity and water quality requirements for the case study reservoir the danjiangkou reservoir in china the hr decreases the water shortage risk of the reservoir from 22 to 8 and increases the reservoir dilution capability by retaining more water in the reservoir however it increases reservoir p concentrations starting in summer due to the promotion of sediment p release the annual p released under the hr in this reservoir is higher by 285 3 tons 5 7 than that under the sop the reservoir chl a concentration an indicator of the environment for algae condition is significantly higher in summer and early autumn sediment p release promoted by hr can support algal growth however this effect is set off by the enhancement of light limiting effect resulting from higher storage levels under hr light is found to be the dominant limiting factor on algal growth in this deep eutrophic reservoir during summer and early autumn when reservoir storages increase significantly due to these two opposite effects hr decreases the annual mean chl a concentration by 18 from 13 45 μg l 1 under sop to 11 08 μg l 1 additionally vertical and horizontal differences in water quality are significant for this large reservoir which can be related to the reservoir operation policies hr improves the horizontal mixing of water in the reservoir through affecting the hydraulic retention time and the horizontal flow velocity field which significantly deteriorates water quality along the route between the inflow entryway and the dam while mitigating algal bloom risk in surrounding shallow water zones for the two outlets of the danjiangkou reservoir hr deteriorates the water quality released to downstream via the dam but decreases algal concentrations in the water delivery to northern china the quantified

18520,reservoir operations affect both the quantity and quality of stored and discharged water hedging rules hrs are commonly used in water supply reservoir operations to ration water delivery and decrease water shortage risk however the increased carryover storage with hedging may aggravate reservoir eutrophication through complex effects on hydrodynamic temperature light nutrient and sediment conditions the influencing mechanisms are unclear and require further investigation this study applies a mathematical modeling approach to comparing the effects of standard operation policy sop and hr discussing the processes and driving factors and exploring the relationship between water shortage and water quality indicators we simulate reservoir operation by sop and optimize hr to generate water supply schedules and run a quasi 3d water quality model to simulate reservoir hydrodynamic conditions nutrient cycles water sediment exchanges and algal dynamics under various water supply schedules the danjiangkou reservoir the water source for china s south north water transfer project is used as a case study the hr for this reservoir decreases its water shortage risk from 22 under sop to 8 modeling results find that the hr increases sediment phosphorus p release by 285 3 tons 5 7 annually as a consequence of extended reservoir submerged area and aggravated hypolimnetic hypoxia increased p release can support algal growth but this effect is set off by the enhancement of light limiting effect caused by higher storages under hr consequently decreasing the annual mean chlorophyll a concentration in the deep reservoir by 18 the hr also improves the horizontal mixing of water by changing the hydraulic retention time and flow velocity field which mitigates algal bloom risks in the surrounding shallow water zones but deteriorates water quality of the release to downstream the water quality analysis offers implications for reservoir managers to coordinate their efforts in

reservoirs around the world lürling et al 2016 the regulation of inflow for water quantity is the primary objective in current water supply reservoir operations hedging rule hr is a common operation policy for rationing water supply quantities between now and future to reduce water shortage risk in future periods draper and lund 2004 kumar and kasthurirengan 2018 you and cai 2008 for a water supply reservoir water can be released to satisfy current water demands or retained in the reservoir for future usage it is not always beneficial to fully meet the immediate demand even when enough water is available due to the possibility of future drought events and the nonlinearity in water use benefits xu et al 2017a instead the rational way is to curtail the current supply by a certain extent and retain some water for high value usages during subsequent dry periods when water availability is below a certain threshold to address this hr is used in reservoir operations to answer the questions of when and how much water should be curtailed from current release and retained for future use which represents a tradeoff between current and future water usage shiau 2011 tu et al 2008 you and cai 2008 despite the benefits in rationing the quantity of water delivery hrs may also result in multiple negative effects on reservoir water quality first hrs typically decrease water flow and increase the hydraulic retention time in a reservoir it has been widely shown that a low flow velocity and long hydraulic retention time weaken water exchange and the flushing effect on algal communities which is beneficial for algal proliferation gao et al 2018 yang et al 2013 second hrs promote higher reservoir storage levels during some periods and may aggravate seasonal thermal stratification according to the critical depth model sverdrup 1953 the ratio of euphotic depth to mixing depth in the water column determines the algal bloom potential which is restrained when the ratio is below a critical value liu et al 2012 thermal stratification benefits algal bloom proliferation by decreasing the mixing depth li et al 2015 in addition hrs can affect nutrient cycling in a reservoir especially matter exchanges between the water and sediment in particular reservoir sediments can act as a phosphorus p sink maavara et al 2015 vollenweider 1975 however when external p loads are under controlled p stored in reservoir sediments releases and sediments therefore act as an internal p source hamilton 2012 shu et al 2017 this phenomenon is referred to p legacy sharpley et al 2013 oxygen is an important controller of sediment p release gerling et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 hrs can enlarge the submerged area of reservoirs and may aggravate hypolimnetic hypoxia caused by higher water depths during water stratification season thereby promoting sediment nutrient release besides the negative effects listed above hrs can also have positive effects on water quality for example hrs increase the dilution storage of a reservoir by retaining more water within the reservoir to analyze these complex negative and positive effects a comprehensive quantitative examination is needed to assess reservoir hydrodynamic temperature light nutrient and sediment conditions under the various reservoir operation policies existing research concerning the impacts of reservoir operations on water quality have mostly focused on water quality downstream of dams e g dhar and datta 2008 park et al 2014 weber et al 2017 or in tributaries to reservoirs yang et al 2013 there are a few studies on the impacts on water quality in reservoirs but those generally considered single water quality factors only such as p huang et al 2015 temperature li et al 2018b or sedimentation lee and foster 2013 in particular a few studies have addressed water quality within a reservoir through reservoir operation optimization e g castelletti et al 2013 chaves and kojiri 2007 kerachian and karamouz 2006 those studies all employed zero dimensional 0d or 1d water quality models without accounting for the horizontal distribution of water quality and did not analyze the factors and processes driving the water quality changes indeed the influencing mechanisms underlying reservoir operations on temporal and spatial variations of different water quality factors in reservoirs and their releases as well as the relationships between water supply and water quality are all important for reservoir operation policy evaluation research is needed to understand the mechanisms and explore the relationships for designing more appropriate reservoir operation policies to mitigate the conflicts between reservoir water supply and water quality in this study we apply a comprehensive modeling approach to assess the impacts of water supply operation policies on temporal and spatial distributions of water quality in a reservoir and of the water release and analyze the key factors and processes driving these impacts we simulate reservoir operations by standard operation policy sop and optimize hr to generate water supply schedules and run a quasi 3d hydrodynamic eutrophication sediment model to simulate reservoir hydrodynamic conditions nutrient cycles water sediment exchanges and algal dynamics resulting from the water supply schedules under sop and hr the danjiangkou reservoir which serves as the water source for the middle route of south north water transfer project snwtp in china is used as a case study the implications of the results are discussed for the sake of sustainable reservoir operation considering both water quantity and quality 2 methodology we first introduce the study area that is used to illustrate the methodology proposed in this paper this will ease the description of the reservoir water quality simulation model as well as help understanding the study issues involving tradeoffs between water supply and water quality and between in situ reservoir and downstream environment 2 1 study area the danjiangkou reservoir located in the yangtze river basin is the second largest reservoir in china with a storage capacity of 29 05 109 m3 at the normal pool stage i e 170 m the reservoir serves as the water source for the middle route of snwtp fig 1 a national key project in china and the largest inter basin water transfer project in the world the reservoir is scheduled to provide 9 5 109 m3 water per year through the snwtp to northern cities under high water stress including two megacities beijing and tianjin the reservoir retains water that mainly derives from two tributaries of the yangtze river namely the han river and the dan river inflow from the han river is much greater the danjiangkou dam controls the release of water for both downstream human and ecosystem usage the taocha gate which is located at the head of the snwtp controls water delivery to northern china fig 1 meanwhile eutrophication is a severe threat to water quality in the danjiangkou reservoir the concentrations of total nitrogen tn and tp in the reservoir exceeded the established standard for drinking water local algal blooms occurred several times during the period from 1992 to 2003 tang et al 2014 since then nutrient concentrations in the reservoir have been increasing field monitored data during 2006 2012 showed that the tn concentration in the reservoir increased by about 50 while the tp concentration nearly doubled during a period of seven years ma et al 2014 additionally investigations have found that p in particular of loosely exchangeable form storage in the soil surrounding the reservoir area is high tang et al 2014 to enhance water supply reliability for the snwtp the reservoir storage was increased starting in 2014 since then sediment p release in the intermittent submerged zone surrounding the reservoir has been observed shu et al 2017 the potential increase of algal bloom risk as a consequence of decreased flow velocities and increased hydraulic retention time has also been discussed pan et al 2018 2 2 reservoir operation method in general water supply reservoir operations follow either sop or hr zhao et al 2011 sop supplies water to the current demand as much as the water available allows and retains only surplus water if the water available i e the sum of the initial storage and reservoir inflow exceeds the current demand for future usage loucks et al 1981 stedinger 1984 thus sop does not consider any future water shortage vulnerability hrs are adopted for reservoir operations to reduce the risk of severe water shortages in the future as well as to improve overall water delivery benefits bower et al 1962 since the late 1970s hrs have been extensively studied in reservoir operation research and widely employed for real world practices e g kumar and kasthurirengan 2018 you and cai 2008 various methods have been proposed to determine hrs for reservoir operations among these the reservoir operating rule curve is a common method tu et al 2008 yin et al 2011 and is employed for the danjiangkou reservoir xu et al 2017b fig 2 shows typical reservoir operating curves which divide a reservoir into four zones of different storage levels yin et al 2011 different operating rules i e with different release rates are applied to the various zones a reservoir releases water to satisfy the full water demand when the reservoir storage is above the upper limit curve i e zone 1 with extraordinarily high water availability however when the reservoir storage is below this curve a reservoir releases water to satisfy only a part of the current demand namely the water release is curtailed by a b and c for zone 2 3 and 4 respectively more water is curtailed from current release when reservoir water availability is lower i e 0 a b c 100 resulting in decreasing levels of release for the demand at the current stage from zone 1 to zone 4 and no water is released when reservoir storage is below the dead level in this zone based hr a b and c are the hedging rates of the different zones and their values are typically determined empirically by reservoir managers regarding specified water supply reliability and acceptable deficits yin et al 2011 the shapes and locations of these curves in fig 2 are typically determined through optimization a common optimization model is formulated as below with an objective to minimize multi year mean economic losses caused by water supply deficits under a constraint of water shortage control the economic loss is expressed as a quadratic function of the water deficit ratio draper and lund 2004 tu et al 2008 in the case of the danjiangkou reservoir water shortage is defined as the water delivery rate below the critical value of 135 m3 s 1 which is the designed minimum flow rate for the snwtp yang et al 2017 we simulate reservoir operations under sop and the designed hr yang et al 2017 for the danjiangkou reservoir the

under sop to 8 2 3 reservoir eutrophication simulation this study selects a quasi 3d water quality model developed with the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc platform for reservoir eutrophication simulation the efdc is a state of the art surface water modeling system supported by the united states environmental protection agency which includes modules for hydrodynamic temperature sediment and water quality simulations hamrick 1992 tetra tech inc 2007 efdc has been widely used to model various water body types including rivers lakes estuaries and reservoirs chen et al 2016 the hydrodynamic eutrophication modules of the efdc are capable of simulating a dozen water quality parameters including dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss algae groups i e cyanobacteria bc green algae bg diatom algae bd and stationary algae bm and multiple components of carbon c n and p cycles to better simulate realistic distributions organic c n and p are represented by three reactive sub classes namely labile particulate organic lpo refractory particulate organic rpo and dissolved organic sub classes the interaction processes between the various water quality state variables are illustrated in fig 3 tetra tech inc 2007 water quality is simulated on the basis of hydrodynamic and temperature simulations algae play a central role in the water eutrophication module the efdc accounts for algal growth basal metabolism predation and settling in simulating algal dynamics algal growth depends on nutrient availability ambient light and temperature main governing equations on these processes are provided in the supplementary material the effect of reservoir operations on sediment nutrient release is a research topic of this study to simulate the processes occurring in sediment and the matter flux at the water sediment interface the sediment diagenesis module in the efdc is activated and coupled with the hydrodynamic eutrophication modules the sediment module considers basic processes that include 1 the depositional flux of particulate organic c n and p from the water 2 the diagenesis of particulate organic matter in sediment and 3 the resultant flux of substances e g phosphate ammonium and nitrate and oxygen between the water and sediment details on simulation processes and governing equations can be found in tetra tech inc 2007 to simulate water quality in the danjiangkou reservoir we follow our previous work and employ an existing hydrodynamic eutrophication sediment model developed by chen et al 2016 for the danjiangkou reservoir the model simulates c n and p dynamics and two dominant algal groups i e green algae and cyanobacteria in the reservoir to set up the model bathymetry processing mesh generation and boundary conditions setting were completed field bathymetry were conducted to detect the terrain in deep water zones and the field data were combined with an existing digital elevation model to determining the reservoir bottom topography chen et al 2016 xu et al 2017b two types of grid systems were coupled for the mesh generation i e a rectangular grid system for wide areas of the reservoir and an orthogonally curvilinear system for narrow channels connected to the reservoir the final mesh of the model contains 10 000 cells on a horizontal plane with a cell size of 280 m the reservoir is stratified into six vertical layers allowing the simulation of the vertical distribution of water quality the hydrological data used in the model were provided by local hydrological stations the meteorological data including air temperature precipitation evaporation wind speed solar radiation and cloud conditions were obtained from the national meteorological information center of china a dynamic time step is used for modeling and the initial step is set as 2 s the model was calibrated and validated for the danjiangkou reservoir using tn tp do and chlorophyll a chl a field data obtained in 2009 and 2010 chen et al 2016 for the current study we select 2009 as the study period with necessary data on hydrological meteorological and pollutant loading conditions 3 results and discussion for this case study of danjiangkou reservoir we provide detailed modeling results under two representative reservoir operation policies namely sop and the designed hr by comparing the modeling outputs between the two policies we show different influences on stored and discharged water quality and discuss the processes and key driving factors finally by comparing a number of scenarios with different hedging levels we demonstrate the relationship between water shortage and reservoir eutrophication indicators 3 1 phosphorus dynamics and release from sediment globally p is a limiting factor of algal blooms in many water bodies fig 4 provides plane averaged tp concentration variations for the different layers in the danjiangkou reservoir under sop and the designed hr seasonal variations in plane averaged tp concentration are found in the reservoir under both policies tp concentrations are higher in summer and autumn from june to november than those in other seasons this is attributed to the variation of matter exchange between water and sediment across seasons modeling results show that p release from sediment is significantly active in summer and autumn fig 5 while the deposition of organic p particulates from water to sediment is a dominant process in spring and winter a large amount of p releases from sediment during summer and autumn months which significantly increases tp concentrations in the bottom layer while having a smaller effect on tp concentrations in the surface layer which results in a situation that the tp concentration in the surface layer is much lower than that in the bottom during the summer and early autumn from june to september as displayed by dsb in fig 4 this is caused by thermal stratification which hinders the vertical mixing of reservoir water a common phenomenon during the summer and early autumn as thermal stratification dissipates in late autumn vertical mixing is renewed in reservoir water and the difference in tp concentrations between the bottom and surface layers becomes much smaller in the river basins contributing to the danjiangkou reservoir flooding events typically occur during july to october before the flood season reservoir storages under both sop and hr are relatively low since hr curtails water releases to build up carryover storage releases under sop are larger and thus the reservoir storage levels are lower thus under sop the average flow velocity in the reservoir is higher than that under hr it is found that disturbance accompanied with high flow velocities slightly increase sediment p release during april to june fig 5a which ends with a bit higher tp concentrations in the bottom layer under sop than those under hr during may to july as displayed by the upper boundary of dsb in fig 4 as inflows significantly increase the differences of tp concentrations under sop and hr are much more significant since august compared to sop more water is retained in the reservoir during the flood season under the hr policy to decease water shortage risk during subsequent dry seasons thus the reservoir dilution capability under hr is higher however fig 4 shows that starting in august the tp concentration under hr is higher than that under sop with the same external pollutant loads under the two policy scenarios the result discussed above implies that hr increases the amount of p release from sediment as shown in fig 5a starting in august the daily p release rate under hr is higher compared to that under sop the difference is as high as 5 3 tons day 1 the p release throughout the modeling year under hr is 285 3 tons 5 7 higher than that under sop two reasons explain this higher release rate since august first more water is retained in the reservoir under hr and the submerged area of the reservoir is larger the intermittent submerged zone surrounding the reservoir presents as a large p storage and contributes to the p loading into the reservoir second the hr policy resulting in higher reservoir storage levels can aggravate hypolimnetic hypoxia during water stratification seasons i e summer and early autumn the absorption of phosphate onto iron oxyhydroxides is a crucial process affecting sediment p dynamics ding et al 2016 hypolimnetic hypoxia promotes iron oxyhydroxides dissolution and thereby improves sediment phosphate release chen et al 2018 testa et al 2013 oxygen at the bottom in deep water zones are generally lower than that in shallow water zones during water stratification seasons thus sediment p release rates in deep water zones of the reservoir are generally higher than those in surrounding shallow water zones as displayed in fig 5b 3 2 algae dynamics and limiting factors the chl a concentration is used to represent algae conditions in the reservoir variations in seasonal chl a concentration are modeled under both reservoir operation policies the chl a concentration in summer and autumn from june to november was considerably higher than that in other seasons fig 6 a the vertical difference of the chl a concentration is obvious among the six layers during these months fig 6b which is due to thermal stratification moreover the chl a concentration in the hypolimnion is much lower and this is due to algal growth constraints with light limitations and low temperatures since the risk of an algal bloom at the surface layer is significantly higher the following analysis focuses on the chl a concentration in the surface layer fig 6a as presented in section 3 1 hr promotes p release from sediment and thereby increases the p concentration in reservoir water however it is also found that starting in april the plane averaged chl a concentration in the surface layer is generally lower under the hr policy fig 6a the annual mean value under hr is 11 08 μg l 1 lower by 18 than that under sop 13 45 μg l 1 this is explained in the following with exploration on the potential factors on algal growth under different operation policies main factors that may affect algal growth include n p light and temperature the limiting effects of these factors are described by indicators equ 3 8 in the supplementary material in the efdc the values of these indicators range from 0 to 1 where a lower value represents a stronger limiting effect modeling results show that the trend in intra year algal variation is driven by temperature temperature suppresses algal growth during the period from january to april in which the limiting indicator is generally lower than 0 3 under both operation policies fig 7 b the limiting indicator is or close to 1 0 from june to september which means that temperature is nearly optimal for algal growth this explains why the chl a concentration during these months is significantly high fig 6a the differences of temperature effects under the two operation policies are generally small throughout the modeling year fig 7b since water temperature is mainly driven by air temperature however slightly opposite effects are found between sop and hr for two periods april june and october december i e temperature limiting effect is stronger during april to june and is weaker during october to december under hr than sop this is because water temperature varies slower than air temperature does and a delay effect exists water temperature increases with air temperature from april to june since reservoir storages under hr are larger than those under sop water temperature increases slower under hr thus temperature limiting effect under hr is stronger during this period similarly water temperature decreases with air temperature from october to december it decreases slower and consequently the temperature effect is weaker under hr than sop additionally the delay of water temperature variation also explains the differences of temperature limiting effects in january and december actually air temperature decreases sharply in november and the air temperature in december is similar with that in january however water temperature decreases much slower this explains the gradual decrease of temperature limiting indicator in november and december fig 7b on the other hand the limiting effect of light exhibits significant daily fluctuations fig 7a due to the various weather conditions e g sunny cloudy or rainy conditions modeling results show that light limiting indicator is generally lower than 0 6 under both policies during june to october fig 7a when the limiting indicators of other factors i e n p and temperature are generally higher than 0 9 this means that light is the dominant limiting factor on algal growth in the reservoir during months when algal bloom risk is high i e june to october water depth is an important factor affecting light limiting effect due to light attenuation in water bodies the case study reservoir is located in a mountainous area with steep slopes i e a v shape reservoir as many other reservoirs in the world the reservoir is deep and thereby light limitation is strong especially during summer and autumn when water inflows are generally high fig 7a only shows the light limiting effect on algae within the surface layer while light limitation is obviously stronger in the layers below the surface layer reservoir operation affects water depths in the reservoir and thereby affects light limiting effect on algal growth reservoir storages under both sop and hr are relatively low during the period from january to may due to low inflows thus the differences of light limiting effects under sop and hr are small during this period fig 7a however as inflow increases since june the differences of reservoir storages under sop and hr become more significant hr results in considerably stronger light limitation than sop starting from june fig 7a this is because the reservoir storage level under hr is higher and a greater water depth weakens light access to algae to summarize opposite effects on algal growth exist with hr in summer and autumn i e promoted p release from sediment and thus mitigated p limitation on algal growth and enhanced light limitation under both policies during the months when algal bloom risk is high i e june to october p limitation is weak indicator 0 9 and light limitation is strong indicator 0 6 and presents as a dominant factor on algal growth therefore despite promoting p release from sediment hr decreases the space averaged chl a concentration in the reservoir fig 6a due to a strong light limitation effect on algal growth 3 3 horizontal algal distribution in the reservoir and water quality of release aside from the vertical distribution horizontal distribution of the chl a concentration is also significant in the danjiangkou reservoir under both sop and hr the chl a concentration in the surrounding shallow water zones is generally higher than that in deep water zones fig 8 a and b which is due to stronger light limitation in deeper water reservoir operation policies affect the horizontal distribution of algae by changing water depth and the horizontal flow velocity field under sop flow velocities along the route between the han river entryway the primary inflow source of the danjiangkou reservoir and the dam are obviously higher than those in other reservoir zones fig 8d given that high flow velocities are unfavorable to algal accumulation and weaken water mixing by reducing the hydraulic retention time the chl a concentration along the route between the han river entryway and the dam is lower than that in other zones fig 8b on the other hand hr increases the hydraulic retention time and enhances water mixing in the entire reservoir fig 8c thus the chl a concentration under hr ends with a more evenly distribution fig 8a than under sop fig 8b an even distribution is beneficial for mitigating algal bloom risk in surrounding shallow water zones but it poses some negative effect on the water quality along the route between the inflow entryway and the dam as displayed in fig 8a and b because of these positive and negative effects the influence of hr on the water quality in the water delivery from the reservoir depends on the location of reservoir outlets which is further discussed as follows the danjiangkou reservoir has two outlets the dam and taocha gate labeled in fig 8 the water quality in the release from the dam for downstream usage is provided in fig 9 a and b since sediment p release is not active and low temperture suppresses algal growth during january to april the differences of water quality in reservoir releases under sop and hr are hardly obvious in this period however the chl a and tp concentrations are significantly higher under hr starting in june fig 9a and b as discussed above hr enhances p release from sediment and increases chl a concentration along the route between the inflow entryway and the dam by promoting horizontal mixing of water thereby resulting in a negative effect on the quality of water release to downstream on the other hand hr also results in higher tp concentration in the water delivery from the taocha gate fig 8d but it leads to a positive effect on chl a concentration fig 8c which is opposite to its effect on the water release from the dam this is attributed to the locations of two outlets the water depth of the reservoir at the dam is high but at the taocha gate where water is delivered to the snwtp the water depth is relatively low hr promotes horizontal mixing of water which increases chl a concentration at the dam and in the water release while decreasing chl a concentration in shallow water zones and thus the water delivery these results show that a reservoir operation policy can effectuate opposite water quality effects at different outlets in additional water quality of different outlets under a given operation policy sop or hr are different by comparing fig 9a and c the chl a concentration in the water delivery via the taocha gate is significantly higher than that in the water release to downstream via the dam this is because water release via the dam is from a deep layer of the reservoir while water delivery via the taocha gate is from the surface layer the chl a concentration in the deep layers of the reservoir is much lower than that in the shallow layers due to the stronger light and temperature limitations on algal growth 3 4 relationship between water shortage and eutrophication indicators to explore the relationship between water shortage and eutrophication indicators we create two additional reservoir operation hr policies by setting different hedging rates using multi year 1955 2005 historical inflow records the modeled water shortage risk is 22 for sop 8 for the designed hr and 17 and 12 for the two additional hr policies the means of chl a and tp concentrations vs water shortage risk from june to november in the reservoir the release to downstream via the dam and the delivery to northern china via the snwtp are compared among the four operation scenarios fig 10 since hr promotes sediment p release the reservoir space averaged tp concentration increases as the water shortage risk decreases implying a tradeoff between p pollution and water shortage mitigation fig 10b however hr also promotes higher reservoir storage levels and then enhances light limitation on algal growth which decreases the reservoir space averaged chl a concentration thus hr can be a win win policy for chl a concentration control and water shortage mitigation fig 10a furthermore the results show that hr changes the horizontal distribution of algae in the reservoir and effectuates opposite effects on chl a concentration at two outlets fig 8 due to improved horizontal mixing of water under hr chl a concentration increases in the water release via the dam while decreases in the water delivery via the snwtp fig 10a given the opposite effects of hr on different water quality indicators tp and chl a and on the water quality at the two outlets to determine which policy is the best depends on managers priorities on multiple water quality targets as well as water conservation fig 10 illustrates the relationships between the water quantity target and multiple water quality targets i e control of tp and algae in the reservoir and in the water discharges taking advantage of the relationships reservoir managers can choose their desirable operation policy based on their priorities on the various water quantity and water quality targets additionally this study finds no significant difference among the operation polices on the tn concentration in the reservoir the mean space averaged tn concentration in the reservoir throughout the year ranges from 1 14 under the designed hr to 1 19 under sop mg l 1 under all operation scenarios hr results in a trivial and positive effect on decreasing reservoir tn concentration during july to october which is opposite to the negative effect on tp concentration according to the modeling results on sediment n release nitrate release is weak under all operation policies and hr promotes ammonium release from the sediment during summer and autumn as a consequence of the aggravation of hypolimnetic hypoxia however the increase of ammonium release caused by hr is small 1 6 under three hr policies scenarios and is offset by higher reservoir dilution capability this explains the trivial and positive effect of hr policy on decreasing tn concentration in the reservoir some field data reported in recent studies are helpful for validating the results described above hr policy has been used in the danjiangkou reservoir for managing water delivery for the snwtp since 2014 as a result the mean annual storage level increased from 144 m in 2012 2013 to 154 m in 2015 2016 pan et al 2018 field monitoring results found that tp in the reservoir sediment decreased from 557 mg kg 1 in 2012 2013 to 530 mg kg 1 in 2015 2016 li et al 2018a the increase of storage level from 144 to 154 m extended the reservoir submerged area by 177 km2 and the newly submerged land contributed to the p loading into the reservoir shu et al 2017 meanwhile field sampling analysis found that phytoplankton biomass in the reservoir decreased from 7 4 mg l 1 in 2014 to 4 9 mg l 1 in 2015 and 2 3 mg l 1 in 2016 pan et al 2018 the biomass reduction can be explained by the increased reservoir dilution capability and the weakened light access to algae caused by significant water depth increase shen et al 2015 loiselle et al 2007 demonstrated that light availability is dominant in controlling algal growth in many aquatic ecosystems and it is directly affected by hydrological conditions these observations are consistent with the results from our study i e hr policy ending with increased carryover storage can promote sediment p release but decreased chl a concentration in the reservoir these findings provide implications for sustainable reservoir management since hr can cause opposite consequences to water quality i e increased sediment p release but reduced algal concentration reservoir managers need to use hr with caution to mitigate the negative impact on water quality and take advantage of the positive impact e g reduced algal concentration given the significant spatial differences of water quality within a reservoir the selection of appropriate outlet locations and water layers wherein to discharge water is important besides given the temporal variation of water quality impact from reservoir operation various water users e g human agriculture industry and ecosystem with different water quality requirement should be coordinated to satisfy the multiple requirements using the methods presented in this study future studies may extend the modeling period to explore the long term influence of operation policies and account for the inflow variability and change caused by either human interference and or climate change in addition external nutrient loads affect matter exchanges at the water sediment interface the influence of reservoir operations on sediment nutrient retention and release can be further explored under different external nutrient load scenarios which can offer implications for the implementation of the total maximum daily load within watersheds contributing to a reservoir 4 conclusions hedging is typically used in water supply reservoir operations to regulate water supply quantities between now and future in order to reduce severe water shortage risk in the future in this study we develop a reservoir operation optimization model coupled with an integrated hydrodynamic eutrophication sediment model using the models we assess the impacts of operation policies such as hr and sop on the quality of stored and discharged reservoir water which in turn can be used to optimize hr to consider both water quantity and water quality requirements for the case study reservoir the danjiangkou reservoir in china the hr decreases the water shortage risk of the reservoir from 22 to 8 and increases the reservoir dilution capability by retaining more water in the reservoir however it increases reservoir p concentrations starting in summer due to the promotion of sediment p release the annual p released under the hr in this reservoir is higher by 285 3 tons 5 7 than that under the sop the reservoir chl a concentration an indicator of the environment for algae condition is significantly higher in summer and early autumn sediment p release promoted by hr can support algal growth however this effect is set off by the enhancement of light limiting effect resulting from higher storage levels under hr light is found to be the dominant limiting factor on algal growth in this deep eutrophic reservoir during summer and early autumn when reservoir storages increase significantly due to these two opposite effects hr decreases the annual mean chl a concentration by 18 from 13 45 μg l 1 under sop to 11 08 μg l 1 additionally vertical and horizontal differences in water quality are significant for this large reservoir which can be related to the reservoir operation policies hr improves the horizontal mixing of water in the reservoir through affecting the hydraulic retention time and the horizontal flow velocity field which significantly deteriorates water quality along the route between the inflow entryway and the dam while mitigating algal bloom risk in surrounding shallow water zones for the two outlets of the danjiangkou reservoir hr deteriorates the water quality released to downstream via the dam but decreases algal concentrations in the water delivery to northern china the quantified relationships between indicators of water shortage and water quality of the reservoir and of the release will support the reservoir managers to coordinate the mitigation efforts for controlling water

18521,iron and aluminium based coagulants are used in enormous amounts and play an essential role in urban water management globally they are dosed at drinking water production facilities for the removal of natural organic matter iron salts are also dosed to sewers for corrosion and odour control and at wastewater treatment plants wwtps for phosphate removal from wastewater and hydrogen sulfide removal from biogas a recent laboratory study revealed that iron dosed to sewers is available for phosphate and hydrogen sulfide removal in the downstream wwtp this study demonstrates for the first time under real life conditions the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the strategy through a year long full scale investigation over a period of 5 months alum dosing at 190 kg al day to the bioreactor in a full scale wwtp was stopped while fecl2 dosing at 160 kg fe day in the upstream network was commenced extensive sampling campaigns were conducted over the baseline trial and recovery periods to investigate sulfide control in sewers and its flow on effects on phosphate in wwtp effluent h2s in biogas as well as on the wwtp effluent hypochlorite disinfection process a plant wide mass balance analysis showed that the fe2 dosed upstream was effectively used for p removal in the activated sludge tanks with an effluent phosphate concentration comparable to that in the baseline period i e with alum dosing to the bioreactor simultaneously hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas decreased 43 from 495 10 to 283 4 ppm no effects on biological nitrogen removal and disinfection processes were observed both effluent phosphate and h2s in biogas increased in the recovery period when in sewer dosing of fecl2 was stopped x ray diffraction failed to reveal the presence of vivianite in the digested sludge providing strong evidence that thermal hydrolysis prevented the formation of vivianite during anaerobic digestion the latter limits the potential for selective recovery of fe and p through magnetic separation overall our study clearly demonstrates the multiple beneficial reuse of iron in a real urban wastewater system and urges water utilities to adopt an integrated approach to coagulant use in urban water management keywords integrated management resource efficiency coagulants multiple reuse phosphate removal sewer corrosion 1 introduction chemical coagulants are used in enormous amounts and play an essential role in urban water management globally bratby 2006 jiang 2015 keeley et al 2014 amongst the different coagulants dosed at various places within our urban water infrastructure iron and aluminium based coagulants are the most commonly used apgar et al 2007 bratby 2006 dewolfe et al 2003 pikaar et al 2014 first the majority of drinking water treatment plants dwtps rely heavily on the use of iron or aluminium based coagulants for the removal of turbidity colour natural organic matter nom and pathogens matilainen et al 2010 okour et al 2009 secondly the addition of iron based coagulants to sewer networks is the most commonly applied method to combat hydrogen sulfide induced concrete corrosion apgar et al 2007 ganigue et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 a notorious and multi billion dollar problem in sewer management brongers 2002 pikaar et al 2014 third both alum and iron based coagulants also play an important role in downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps with the majority of wwtps still relying on chemical dosing for the removal of phosphate carliell marquet and cooper 2014 de bashan and bashan 2004 korving et al 2019 finally iron salts are also often dosed to anaerobic digesters for hydrogen sulfide control akgul et al 2017 charles et al 2006 significant research efforts have been conducted in the past decades aiming to minimize chemical dosing requirements while optimizing the removal efficiency of the target pollutants at the point of dosing bratby 2006 to the authors best knowledge a system wide integrated coagulant management strategy that takes into consideration the fate of these chemicals and their potential negative or positive flow on effects on downstream processes has attracted little attention the latter is rather surprising as the flow on effects could potentially have a substantial impact on the overall chemical requirement and treatment performance for the urban water infrastructure at large there are several reasons why the flow on effects of iron based coagulants are of special interest first iron based coagulants possess the ability to remove both phosphate and hydrogen sulfide lin et al 2017 second iron chemistry is complex and versatile with a wide variety of iron oxides e g magnetite hematite goethite ferrihydrite iron sulfide e g pyrite mackinawite pyrrhotite troilite and greigite likosova et al 2014 and iron phosphate e g vivianite and strengite wilfert et al 2015 2016 2018a species as well as iron organic complexes piepenbrock et al 2014 weber et al 2006 these iron species can undergo rapid changes in oxidation state from fe2 very effective in removing sulfide to fe3 very effective in removing phosphate and vice versa depending on prevalent anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions as sewage is subjected to different oxidation reduction conditions when it flows through the different sub sections of our urban water infrastructure one iron molecule could potentially be reused several times for removal of both sulfide and phosphate by alteration of its oxidation state wilfert et al 2015 indeed laboratory scale experiments demonstrated that fe3 dosed as ferric chloride fecl3 for sulfide control in rising main sewers was reduced to fe2 thereby precipitating sulfide as fes subsequently when the effluent of the rising main was fed to an aerated primary settler the fe2 was re oxidized to fe3 resulting in efficient phosphate removal whereas the hydrogen sulfide was oxidized to sulfate gutierrez et al 2010 another laboratory scale study demonstrated that when activated sludge from a sequence batch reactor to which fe3 was dosed in the form of fecl3 for phosphate removal is subjected to anaerobic digestion the iron is reduced to fe2 and can effectively control hydrogen sulfide thereby releasing the phosphate ge et al 2013 these studies clearly show the potential of multiple beneficial reuse paths of iron beyond removal of the target pollutants at the point of dosing these benefits have been successfully demonstrated recently by rebosura et al 2018 through the use of continuously operated laboratory scale wastewater systems comprising sewers wastewater treatment reactors and anaerobic sludge digesters these above described laboratory scale studies clearly highlight the potential to reduce the overall chemical footprint of water utilities by adopting a catchment wide approach coupled with substantial improvements in terms of overall sulfide control performance and phosphate removal however it should be emphasized that these studies were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions i e constant temperature flow and hrt using simplified configurations in real life situations the flow and thus hrt is highly dynamic whereas sewer networks typically comprise a complex system of large amounts of different sewer pipes consisting of a mixture of gravity sewers and rising mains with changing anaerobic and aerobic conditions full scale field trials over a prolonged time period using a real life full scale sewer network and downstream wwtp are therefore essential to assess the practical feasibility of multiple reuse of iron salts therefore this study aimed to evaluate the multiple beneficial reuse paths of iron salts in urban water management through full scale field trials to achieve this we performed long term analysis coupled with comprehensive monitoring campaigns at a full scale sewer network connected to the oxley creek wastewater treatment plant south east queensland australia such a study is considered essential before this integrated approach to coagulant use can be widely taken up by water utilities finally we conducted xrd analyses to distinguish between amorphous and crystalline phases of iron compounds in sludges collected from various units in the treatment plant to shed light on the transformation of iron compounds in the treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 process configuration of oxley creek wwtp the oxley creek wwtp is located in brisbane south east queensland australia and has a capacity of about 250 000 population equivalent pe nitrogen removal is achieved through the traditional nitrification denitrification process using a bardenpho capacity 12 ml day i e 18 of the total hydraulic load and carrousel capacity 55 ml day i e 82 of the total hydraulic load configuration under dry weather flow conditions see fig 1 a phosphate is removed by means of a combination of biological phosphate removal assisted with alum dosing as described in more detail in section 2 2 the final effluent is disinfected by means of hypochlorite prior to final discharge onto surface water the excess waste activated sludge was is dewatered using a belt filter press and mixed with dewatered sludge received from other wwtps operated by queensland urban utilities quu reaching to a ratio of 0 8 1 i e 120 wet tons was day versus 150 tons imported wet sludge day the sludge is subjected to thermal hydrolysis treatment cambi 5 bar at 155 c prior to the anaerobic digestion step srt 22 25 days the digested sludge is dewatered by means of centrifugation and the centrate is recirculated back to the influent a simplified diagram of the oxley creek wwtp is shown in fig 1a 2 2 coagulant dosing at oxley creek wwtp both aluminium sulfate alum and ferric chloride are dosed at several locations within the oxley creek wwtp fig 1a alum dosed for p removal is added to activated sludge prior to entering the secondary clarifiers ferric chloride is dosed prior to the centrifugation as a dewaterability aid as well as to the centrate for odour control the dosing rates of these chemicals are summarised in table 1 2 3 experimental procedures to assess the potential multiple reuse of iron dosed in upstream sewer network the experiments were divided into three periods namely i baseline i e no ferrous chloride dosing in upstream sewer network ii experimental i e ferrous chloride dosing in upstream sewer network at 160 kg fe day and simultaneously alum dosing at the treatment plant was stopped and iii post experimental i e ferrous chloride dosing in upstream sewer network was reduced to 23 kg fe day not stopped because of odour control need ferrous chloride 13 w w as fe was dosed at two different locations in the upstream sewer network referred as location a and b from here onwards fig 1b these two locations were chosen in response to odour complaints from the local communities the ferrous chloride dosing rate was 109 and 51 kg fecl2 fe day for location a and b respectively giving an average fe2 concentration of 31 and 82 mg fe l at the two locations the hydraulic flows in these two sections are only 3 5 ml day location a and 0 62 ml day location b representing 7 2 of the total sewage flow to the oxley creek wwtp 57 ml day hence the average fe concentration in the sewage entering the plant is calculated to be 2 8 mg fe l 2 4 monitoring and sampling 2 4 1 monitoring in upstream sewer network the impact of iron dosing on the gas phase hydrogen sulfide concentration was evaluated through online monitoring during both baseline and experimental periods in the sewer headspace of the manholes in both location a and b using a hydrogen sulfide gas sensor app tek odalog logger l2 the hydrogen sulfide levels were recorded at a 1 min interval over a period of 7 and 13 days for baseline and experimental periods in both locations respectively the ph during experimental period at these locations were also measured by grab sampling n 5 for location a and n 12 for location b 2 4 2 sampling campaigns at oxley creek wwtp extensive short term sampling campaigns were conducted during the baseline and the experimental period each campaign lasted for three consecutive days under dry weather flow conditions samples were taken at 8 locations see fig 1a 24 hour flow proportional composite samples were taken from influent and effluent by using auto sampler sampling containers inside the auto sampler were kept in ice buckets at all times on each sampling day three grab samples were taken between 9 a m and 5 p m from bioreactors thickened sludge cambi and anaerobic digesters one additional sample point after the sludge centrifugation step referred to as centrate before iron dosing location s8 in table s3 and fig s9 was added to the sampling campaign in the experimental period samples were collected with no headspace remaining in the containers and sealed with caps immediately afterwards samples were immediately put into ice boxes in the field and transported back to the laboratory for analysis of p total and soluble as well as po4 p nitrogen ammonium and tkn fe and al total and soluble ts vs and tss vss in addition xrd analyses were conducted on thickened waste activated sludge cambi sludge and anaerobically digested sludge to distinguish between amorphous and crystalline phases of iron compounds in sludges a complete overview of the analyses of the monitoring campaigns can be found in the supplementary information tables s2 and s3 2 4 3 long term monitoring at the oxley creek wwtp the influent and effluent nitrogen ammonium and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and phosphate total p and phosphate p concentrations were measured by means of routine off line measurements by the operators of the oxley creek wwtp the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentration ppm h2s in the biogas as well as total biogas production m3 biogas day was monitored using an online gas sensor swg 200 1 biogas measuring system 2 5 mass balance analysis in addition to the long term monitoring data the impact of replacing alum dosing to the bioreactor 190 kg al day with fecl2 dosing in the upstream network 160 kg fe day on the effluent p concentrations hydrogen sulfide levels and overall biogas production during anaerobic digestion was evaluated through a plant wide mas balance analysis based on the results from the comprehensive sampling campaigns the plant wide mass balance included the total and soluble aluminium iron phosphate sulfur and nitrogen as well as the ts vs and tss vss mass flows and concentrations within the different process units of the oxley creek wwtp during both the baseline and experimental periods we assumed that steady state conditions in the activated sludge tanks and digesters to be obtained in each period after 3 sludge retention times srts hydraulic data of the flows within the wwtp was collected from the scada system

speciation using semi quantitative x ray diffraction analyses after collection the sludge samples were immediately freeze dried under vacuum conditions 50 c 0 1 mbar and subsequently grinded to powder

methods apha 1995 3 results 3 1 effect of fecl2 dosing on sulfide control in the sewer network fig 2 shows the 90th percentile of gaseous daily peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations during both the baseline and experimental periods measured in location a and b respectively see figs s1 and s2 for the complete datasets it can be seen that there was a substantial difference in sulfide control efficiency between the two locations at location a with a ferrous chloride dosing of 31 mg fe l the peak h2s concentration decreased from 1041 to 557 ppm h2s i e 46 reduction at location b with a ferrous chloride dosing of 82 mg fe l the peak sulfide concentrations decreased from 80 to 6 ppm h2s i e 93 reduction the lower sulfide control in location a can be attributed to the relatively low sewage ph levels i e average ph 6 28 0 25 with levels at times as low as 6 0 it is well known that the iron sulfide precipitation reaction is highly ph dependent with significant lower removal efficiencies at lower ph values in contrast the average ph at location b was one unit higher at 7 32 0 27 to illustrate this a decrease in ph from 7 to 6 5 was found to result in an increase in iron dosing requirements of 200 in order to achieve the same effluent dissolved sulfide concentrations firer et al 2008 the low ph values were most likely caused by industrial trade waste entering the sewer in that sewer section although the detailed source was yet to be determined 3 2 phosphorus removal at the wwtp fig 3 shows the long term average phosphate removal in the activated sludge tanks of the downstream wwtp the long term average phosphate removal was found to be 9 44 0 53 9 61 0 32 and 6 43 0 33 mg po4 p l for the baseline experimental and post experimental period respectively these latter resulted in effluent phosphate concentrations for these periods of 0 71 0 19 0 89 0 23 and 2 13 0 44 mg po4 p l respectively hence the phosphate removal was not negatively affected by replacing the al3 dosing at the wwtp with in sewer fe2 dosing this was further supported by the data from 24 hr flow proportional composite samples obtained during the sampling campaigns with effluent phosphate concentrations of 0 43 0 11 and 0 28 0 06 mg po4 p l for the baseline and experimental period respectively the three day average concentrations of aluminium iron and phosphorus at all sampling locations during baseline and experimental period are presented in tables s2 and s3 respectively the long term monitoring data revealed that reducing the in sewer fe dosing to 14 in absence of alum dosing at the wwtp during the post experimental period resulted in a significant decrease p 0 05 in average phosphate removal from 9 61 0 32 to 6 43 0 33 mg po4 p l fig 3 and s3 b these observations strongly suggest the role of in sewer dosed fe2 in downstream phosphate removal importantly besides the above described beneficial impact on phosphate removal in the activated sludge tanks and the hydrogen sulfide control in the biogas see section 3 3 replacing alum dosing with in sewer ferrous chloride dosing in the upstream sewer network did not negatively affect overall performance of the wwtp importantly the biological nitrogen removal process was not affected with very high nitrogen removal efficiencies of 99 during both the baseline and experimental period figs s6 and s7 the latter resulted in very low nitrogen effluent concentrations in both periods i e 0 5 mg nh4 n l and 3 mg tkn l tables s2 and s3 moreover dosing fe2 in the sewer network did not affect the soluble iron concentrations in the effluent of the wwtp i e below detection limit see table s3 the latter was found to be important for quu as increased levels of soluble fe have been associated with increased formation of disinfection by products and increased dosing requirements liu et al 2012 3 3 sulfide control and biogas production in anaerobic digester fig 4 shows that the average h2s concentrations in the biogas decreased from 495 10 ppm h2s during the baseline period to 283 4 ppm h2s during the experimental period a significant p 0 05 decrease of 43 the mass balance analysis showed that the total iron that ultimately ended in the anaerobic digester increased from 341 4 kg fe day to 449 2 kg fe day figs s8 and s9 an increase of 24 the resulting fe concentrations in the anaerobic digester were 15 7 0 2 g fe kg ts to 22 2 0 1 g fe kg ts tables s2 and s3 the mass balance analysis also revealed that the total s concentrations in the digesters were 11 8 0 1 g s kg ts and 11 08 0 05 g s kg ts during the baseline and experimental period respectively tables s2 and s3 as the total s concentrations comprise a variety of sulfur species i e sulfate thiosulfate sulfite elemental sulfur and sulfide it was not possible to determine the hydrogen sulfide production rate during both periods however despite that the total s concentrations were similar in both period the hydrogen sulfide levels during experimental period were significantly lower figs 4 and s4 providing strong evidence of the effectiveness of in sewer iron dosing on sulfide control in the anaerobic digester indeed during the post experimental period the h2s concentration in the biogas increased to values close to that of the baseline period i e 451 6 ppm h2s it should be noted that the oxley creek wwtp imports sludge from a number of smaller wwtps that do not implement iron dosing i e 120 wet tons was day versus 150 tons imported wet sludge day thereby substantially diluting the beneficial impact of upstream iron dosing by 55 6 importantly besides the beneficial impact on the hydrogen sulfide levels in the biogas replacing alum dosing at the wwtp with ferrous chloride in the upstream sewer did not negatively affect p 0 05 the performance of the anaerobic digester with average biogas production rates of 2768 25 and 2786 33 m3 biogas day during the baseline and the experimental period respectively figs 4 and s5 a slightly lower average biogas production was observed during the post experimental phase with a biogas production rate of 2683 44 m3 day a decrease of 4 this slight decrease was not significant p 0 05 and should not be related to in sewer iron dosing at 23 kg day only and was likely caused by other factors 3 4 determining iron speciation at the wwtp fig 5 a c shows the x ray diffraction patterns of thickened waste activated sludge before and after thermal hydrolysis treatment and anaerobically digested sludge fig 5a shows the presence of vivianite in the thickened sludge from the activated sludge tank this finding is in agreement with recent studies that also found vivianite is present in activated sludge prior to anaerobic digestion wilfert et al 2018a with iron salts added to the treatment plant directly rather than in sewers however vivianite was not found in sludge after thermal hydrolysis fig 5b and the digested sludge fig 5c since vivianite is a crystalline mineral its presence in the sludge would be seen in the x ray diffraction patterns it is possible that vivianite was oxidized during the thermal hydrolysis process and transformed to amorphous ferric hydroxide phosphate fe iii 3 po4 2 oh 3 5h2o pratesi et al 2003 the fact that no vivianite was found after anaerobic digestion contrarily to various previous studies wilfert et al 2016 2018a suggests that the thermal hydrolysis cambi hindered vivianite formation during anaerobic digestion this was further supported by the semi quantitative xrd analyses which showed that the overall crystalline content of the inorganic fraction of the sludge was substantially reduced i e from 100 to 26 after the thermal hydrolysis step table s1 fig 5 d after anaerobic digestion the crystallinity of the inorganic fraction of the sludge increased to 62 hematite fe2o3 was the only observed crystalline fe species comprising about 4 3 of the total crystalline content table s1 considering the above and a total fe concentration in the digested sludge of 22 2 0 1 g kg ts table s3 it can be calculated that 45 of the total fe was present in the form of crystalline hematite the remaining fe must have been present in amorphous form 4 discussion we previously demonstrated the potential of multiple reuse of iron dosed as ferric chloride fe3 in sewer networks as a sulfide control method for downstream phosphate removal and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion using continuous laboratory scale urban wastewater systems under controlled conditions rebosura et al 2018 however the applicability of these results obtained under controlled laboratory conditions i e constant temperature flow and hrt to real life systems remains far from being certain real life wastewater systems sewer networks and treatment plants are far more complicated in addition the wastewater flow rate and composition are highly dynamic here we evaluated the feasibility through full scale field trials under real life conditions using the oxley creek catchment and wwtp as a case study the results obtained in this study confirmed our previous laboratory findings and demonstrated that dosing of iron salts i e ferrous chloride in this case in sewer networks to combat hydrogen sulfide induced sewer corrosion and odour complaints can have multiple flow on benefits also for large complex and highly dynamic real life full scale sewer networks connected to large downstream wastewater treatment plants during the experimental period the overall coagulant dosing reduced by 6 i e from 502 kg to 470 kg per day by replacing alum dosing at the wwtp 192 kg al day with iron salts dosing 160 kg fe day at two locations in the sewer network despite this slight decrease in overall chemical consumption and substantial reduction in chemical dosing at the wwtp from 502 kg day to 310 kg day i e a reduction of 39 due to the fact that the alum dosing was completely ceased at the wwtp the phosphate removal was not affected at all equally important a significant increase in sulfide control 43 in the anaerobic digestion step during experimental period was achieved while maintaining similar biogas production the decrease in hydrogen sulfide levels in the biogas was found to be extremely important for the water utility as the maximum allowable hydrogen sulfide concentration for cogeneration engines often referred to as combined heat power chp units operated at the wwtp to avoid issues with corrosion is restricted to maximum levels of 300 ppm h2s moreover the presence of elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide in sewers and biogas comes with serious oh s concerns for operators as hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic odorous and highly corrosive compound it should be emphasized that at the oxley creek wwtp 150 wet tons of dewatered sludge is daily imported from several other wwtps operated by quu none of these wwtps dosed iron coagulants in their treatment process as the excess was production at the wwtp is only 120 wet tons per day the iron concentration in the was is diluted by a factor of 2 25 it can thus be expected that much higher sulfide control efficiencies during the anaerobic digestion stage can be achieved in cases where the sludge is not mixed with imported dewatered sludge in total 470 kg fe day was added to the oxley creek sewage collection and treatment system the majority of the iron is dosed to the centrate stream 295 kg fe3 day prior to being mixed back with the influent fig 1a the latter was implemented previously in order to reduce issues with struvite formation in the digester and to mitigate odour problems in the centrate buffer tank overall only 34 i e 160 kg out of 470 kg fe day of the chemicals dosed at the downstream wwtp was re located at two locations upstream in the sewer network that were subjected to the most serious odour complaints by the surrounding community the iron dosing at these two places within the sewer network only comprised 7 of the total hydraulic flow of the sewage entering the oxley creek wwtp only resulting in a slight increase in fe concentration at the wwtp of 2 8 mg fe l in practice the occurrence of hydrogen sulfide induced sewer corrosion often becomes apparent through odour complaints rather than internal assessment of the underground sewer pipe in most sewer networks the places at which sewer corrosion and issues with odour occur are plentiful hence the amount of iron salts required could be much higher than the amount dosed in this study in this case both p removal from wastewater and h2s reduction in biogas are expected to be further enhanced in this sense more iron salt dosed at the treatment plant should be moved upstream to sewers to further increase the overall sulfide control efficiency within the sewer network thereby enhancing the protection of our critical sewer assets as well as increasing the community liveability however further research is needed to assess whether increased relocation of iron lasts to upstream sewers would negatively affect odour control in the dewatering process which was not covered in this study it is noted that the two dosing locations used in this study both sit at upstream reaches of the network far from the treatment plant the impact of these distances on the p removal and biogas h2s control is not assessed in this study and requires further investigation however the choice of dosing locations should mainly be governed by sewer conditions network wide simulations using advanced dynamic sewer models such as the sewex model sharma et al 2008a 2008b are desirable for identifying hotspots with high hydrogen sulfide concentrations and provide a robust assessment of the potential savings that can be achieved in terms of sewer asset management and community liveability in addition to hydrogen sulfide sewer networks are also an important source of methane a potent greenhouse gas with a ghg potential of 21 23 times that of co2 emissions that can significantly contribute to the overall carbon footprint of wastewater utilities guisasola et al 2008 2009 liu et al 2015 in fact it has been estimated that methane emissions in sewers comprise as high as 20 of the combined ghg emissions in wwtps while beyond the scope of this study previous laboratory scale studies revealed that iron dosing can inhibit the methanogenic activity of the sewer biofilms by about 50 80 zhang et al 2009 2012 and could thus provide another benefit that warrants further exploration the oxley creek wwtp achieves nitrogen removal through the traditional nitrification denitrification process as the effluent nitrogen discharge limits are stringent i e total n 5 mg l there is no primary settling as all influent cod is needed for denitrification however many wwtps around the world have a primary settling step in place further research is needed to assess what fraction of the in sewer dosed iron would be removed during primary settling and which fraction will pass through the activated sludge tanks for p removal the fe that ends up in the primary sludge would not assist in p removal albeit it would still have a beneficial impact on the sulfide control in anaerobic digestion recently it was found that when iron salts are dosed at wwtps for phosphate removal and subsequently subjected to anaerobic digestion vivianite fe ii 3 po4 2 8h2o becomes the predominant fe p precipitation product wilfert et al 2016 2018a the latter can be as high as 90 of all the phosphate present in digested sewage sludge with high iron content wilfert et al 2018a this is an important finding due to the paramagnetic properties of vivianite which allows for selective recovery of vivianite from the digested sludge through magnetic separation prot et al 2019 wilfert et al 2018b our study clearly showed that thermal hydrolysis as a pre treatment step for anaerobic digestion eliminated vivianite in the activated sludge with no further formation of vivianite during anaerobic digestion while further research is needed to fundamentally understand the mechanisms behind these observations it is evident that the implementation of thermal hydrolysis as a pre treatment step for anaerobic digestion would likely limit the selective recovery of iron and phosphate in the form of vivianite through magnetic separation the above described opportunities and research needs for further optimization and additional benefits needs to be assessed through long term full scale trials coupled with life cycle assessment lcas the overall economic benefits that can be achieved are expected to differ depending on the local conditions such as the type and size of sewer network configuration of the downstream wwtp effluent nutrients discharge standards and the price and availability of alum and iron based coagulants and would require careful consideration on a case by case basis however the costs associated with chemical change over costs and location of dosing are expected to be much lower than the potential up stream and downstream savings that can be achieved for e g expenditure for odour control and rehabilitation of sewer assets alone pikaar et al 2014 all of the above are required in order to quantify the potential savings that could be achieved from an economic environmental and liveability perspective 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the feasibility of multiple reuse of iron salts dosed as a sulfide control method in a large full scale

studies the key findings of the work are fecl2 dosing for sewer corrosion control in the upstream sewer network was beneficially reused for p removal in the activated sludge tanks and subsequently for control of hydrogen sulfide during anaerobic digestion process at the downstream wwtp and does not negatively affect the overall treatment performance in terms of nitrogen removal biogas production and disinfection process in wwtp dosing of alum could be replaced with in sewer dosing of iron salts with significant economic and environmental benefits the thermal hydrolysis process prior to anaerobic digestion eliminated vivianite in the activated sludge with no further formation of vivianite during anaerobic digestion overall the findings in this study show the urgent need for

18521,iron and aluminium based coagulants are used in enormous amounts and play an essential role in urban water management globally they are dosed at drinking water production facilities for the removal of natural organic matter iron salts are also dosed to sewers for corrosion and odour control and at wastewater treatment plants wwtps for phosphate removal from wastewater and hydrogen sulfide removal from biogas a recent laboratory study revealed that iron dosed to sewers is available for phosphate and hydrogen sulfide removal in the downstream wwtp this study demonstrates for the first time under real life conditions the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the strategy through a year long full scale investigation over a period of 5 months alum dosing at 190 kg al day to the bioreactor in a full scale wwtp was stopped while fecl2 dosing at 160 kg fe day in the upstream network was commenced extensive sampling campaigns were conducted over the baseline trial and recovery periods to investigate sulfide control in sewers and its flow on effects on phosphate in wwtp effluent h2s in biogas as well as on the wwtp effluent hypochlorite disinfection process a plant wide mass balance analysis showed that the fe2 dosed upstream was effectively used for p removal in the activated sludge tanks with an effluent phosphate concentration comparable to that in the baseline period i e with alum dosing to the bioreactor simultaneously hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas decreased 43 from 495 10 to 283 4 ppm no effects on biological nitrogen removal and disinfection processes were observed both effluent phosphate and h2s in biogas increased in the recovery period when in sewer dosing of fecl2 was stopped x ray diffraction failed to reveal the presence of vivianite in the digested sludge providing strong evidence that thermal hydrolysis prevented the formation of vivianite during anaerobic digestion the latter limits the potential for selective recovery of fe and p through magnetic separation overall our study clearly demonstrates the multiple beneficial reuse of iron in a real urban wastewater system and urges water utilities to adopt an integrated approach to coagulant use in urban water management keywords integrated management resource efficiency coagulants multiple reuse phosphate removal sewer corrosion 1 introduction chemical coagulants are used in enormous amounts and play an essential role in urban water management globally bratby 2006 jiang 2015 keeley et al 2014 amongst the different coagulants dosed at various places within our urban water infrastructure iron and aluminium based coagulants are the most commonly used apgar et al 2007 bratby 2006 dewolfe et al 2003 pikaar et al 2014 first the majority of drinking water treatment plants dwtps rely heavily on the use of iron or aluminium based coagulants for the removal of turbidity colour natural organic matter nom and pathogens matilainen et al 2010 okour et al 2009 secondly the addition of iron based coagulants to sewer networks is the most commonly applied method to combat hydrogen sulfide induced concrete corrosion apgar et al 2007 ganigue et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 a notorious and multi billion dollar problem in sewer management brongers 2002 pikaar et al 2014 third both alum and iron based coagulants also play an important role in downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps with the majority of wwtps still relying on chemical dosing for the removal of phosphate carliell marquet and cooper 2014 de bashan and bashan 2004 korving et al 2019 finally iron salts are also often dosed to anaerobic digesters for hydrogen sulfide control akgul et al 2017 charles et al 2006 significant research efforts have been conducted in the past decades aiming to minimize chemical dosing requirements while optimizing the removal efficiency of the target pollutants at the point of dosing bratby 2006 to the authors best knowledge a system wide integrated coagulant management strategy that takes into consideration the fate of these chemicals and their potential negative or positive flow on effects on downstream processes has attracted little attention the latter is rather surprising as the flow on effects could potentially have a substantial impact on the overall chemical requirement and treatment performance for the urban water infrastructure at large there are several reasons why the flow on effects of iron based coagulants are of special interest first iron based coagulants possess the ability to remove both phosphate and hydrogen sulfide lin et al 2017 second iron chemistry is complex and versatile with a wide variety of iron oxides e g magnetite hematite goethite ferrihydrite iron sulfide e g pyrite mackinawite pyrrhotite troilite and greigite likosova et al 2014 and iron phosphate e g vivianite and strengite wilfert et al 2015 2016 2018a species as well as iron organic complexes piepenbrock et al 2014 weber et al 2006 these iron species can undergo rapid changes in oxidation state from fe2 very effective in removing sulfide to fe3 very effective in removing phosphate and vice versa depending on prevalent anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions as sewage is subjected to different oxidation reduction conditions when it flows through the different sub sections of our urban water infrastructure one iron molecule could potentially be reused several times for removal of both sulfide and phosphate by alteration of its oxidation state wilfert et al 2015 indeed laboratory scale experiments demonstrated that fe3 dosed as ferric chloride fecl3 for sulfide control in rising main sewers was reduced to fe2 thereby precipitating sulfide as fes subsequently when the effluent of the rising main was fed to an aerated primary settler the fe2 was re oxidized to fe3 resulting in efficient phosphate removal whereas the hydrogen sulfide was oxidized to sulfate gutierrez et al 2010 another laboratory scale study demonstrated that when activated sludge from a sequence batch reactor to which fe3 was dosed in the form of fecl3 for phosphate removal is subjected to anaerobic digestion the iron is reduced to fe2 and can effectively control hydrogen sulfide thereby releasing the phosphate ge et al 2013 these studies clearly show the potential of multiple beneficial reuse paths of iron beyond removal of the target pollutants at the point of dosing these benefits have been successfully demonstrated recently by rebosura et al 2018 through the use of continuously operated laboratory scale wastewater systems comprising sewers wastewater treatment reactors and anaerobic sludge digesters these above described laboratory scale studies clearly highlight the potential to reduce the overall chemical footprint of water utilities by adopting a catchment wide approach coupled with substantial improvements in terms of overall sulfide control performance and phosphate removal however it should be emphasized that these studies were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions i e constant temperature flow and hrt using simplified configurations in real life situations the flow and thus hrt is highly dynamic whereas sewer networks typically comprise a complex system of large amounts of different sewer pipes consisting of a mixture of gravity sewers and rising mains with changing anaerobic and aerobic conditions full scale field trials over a prolonged time period using a real life full scale sewer network and downstream wwtp are therefore essential to assess the practical feasibility of multiple reuse of iron salts therefore this study aimed to evaluate the multiple beneficial reuse paths of iron salts in urban water management through full scale field trials to achieve this we performed long term analysis coupled with comprehensive monitoring campaigns at a full scale sewer network connected to the oxley creek wastewater treatment plant south east queensland australia such a study is considered essential before this integrated approach to coagulant use can be widely taken up by water utilities finally we conducted xrd analyses to distinguish between amorphous and crystalline phases of iron compounds in sludges collected from various units in the treatment plant to shed light on the transformation of iron compounds in the treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 process configuration of oxley creek wwtp the oxley creek wwtp is located in brisbane south east queensland australia and has a capacity of about 250 000 population equivalent pe nitrogen removal is achieved through the traditional nitrification denitrification process using a bardenpho capacity 12 ml day i e 18 of the total hydraulic load and carrousel capacity 55 ml day i e 82 of the total hydraulic load configuration under dry weather flow conditions see fig 1 a phosphate is removed by means of a combination of biological phosphate removal assisted with alum dosing as described in more detail in section 2 2 the final effluent is disinfected by means of hypochlorite prior to final discharge onto surface water the excess waste activated sludge was is dewatered using a belt filter press and mixed with dewatered sludge received from other wwtps operated by queensland urban utilities quu reaching to a ratio of 0 8 1 i e 120 wet tons was day versus 150 tons imported wet sludge day the sludge is subjected to thermal hydrolysis treatment cambi 5 bar at 155 c prior to the anaerobic digestion step srt 22 25 days the digested sludge is dewatered by means of centrifugation and the centrate is recirculated back to the influent a simplified diagram of the oxley creek wwtp is shown in fig 1a 2 2 coagulant dosing at oxley creek wwtp both aluminium sulfate alum and ferric chloride are dosed at several locations within the oxley creek wwtp fig 1a alum dosed for p removal is added to activated sludge prior to entering the secondary clarifiers ferric chloride is dosed prior to the centrifugation as a dewaterability aid as well as to the centrate for odour control the dosing rates of these chemicals are summarised in table 1 2 3 experimental procedures to assess the potential multiple reuse of iron dosed in upstream sewer network the experiments were divided into three periods namely i baseline i e no ferrous chloride dosing in upstream sewer network ii experimental i e ferrous chloride dosing in upstream sewer network at 160 kg fe day and simultaneously alum dosing at the treatment plant was stopped and iii post experimental i e ferrous chloride dosing in upstream sewer network was reduced to 23 kg fe day not stopped because of odour control need ferrous chloride 13 w w as fe was dosed at two different locations in the upstream sewer network referred as location a and b from here onwards fig 1b these two locations were chosen in response to odour complaints from the local communities the ferrous chloride dosing rate was 109 and 51 kg fecl2 fe day for location a and b respectively giving an average fe2 concentration of 31 and 82 mg fe l at the two locations the hydraulic flows in these two sections are only 3 5 ml day location a and 0 62 ml day location b representing 7 2 of the total sewage flow to the oxley creek wwtp 57 ml day hence the average fe concentration in the sewage entering the plant is calculated to be 2 8 mg fe l 2 4 monitoring and sampling 2 4 1 monitoring in upstream sewer network the impact of iron dosing on the gas phase hydrogen sulfide concentration was evaluated through online monitoring during both baseline and experimental periods in the sewer headspace of the manholes in both location a and b using a hydrogen sulfide gas sensor app tek odalog logger l2 the hydrogen sulfide levels were recorded at a 1 min interval over a period of 7 and 13 days for baseline and experimental periods in both locations respectively the ph during experimental period at these locations were also measured by grab sampling n 5 for location a and n 12 for location b 2 4 2 sampling campaigns at oxley creek wwtp extensive short term sampling campaigns were conducted during the baseline and the experimental period each campaign lasted for three consecutive days under dry weather flow conditions samples were taken at 8 locations see fig 1a 24 hour flow proportional composite samples were taken from influent and effluent by using auto sampler sampling containers inside the auto sampler were kept in ice buckets at all times on each sampling day three grab samples were taken between 9 a m and 5 p m from bioreactors thickened sludge cambi and anaerobic digesters one additional sample point after the sludge centrifugation step referred to as centrate before iron dosing location s8 in table s3 and fig s9 was added to the sampling campaign in the experimental period samples were collected with no headspace remaining in the containers and sealed with caps immediately afterwards samples were immediately put into ice boxes in the field and transported back to the laboratory for analysis of p total and soluble as well as po4 p nitrogen ammonium and tkn fe and al total and soluble ts vs and tss vss in addition xrd analyses were conducted on thickened waste activated sludge cambi sludge and anaerobically digested sludge to distinguish between amorphous and crystalline phases of iron compounds in sludges a complete overview of the analyses of the monitoring campaigns can be found in the supplementary information tables s2 and s3 2 4 3 long term monitoring at the oxley creek wwtp the influent and effluent nitrogen ammonium and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and phosphate total p and phosphate p concentrations were measured by means of routine off line measurements by the operators of the oxley creek wwtp the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentration ppm h2s in the biogas as well as total biogas production m3 biogas day was monitored using an online gas sensor swg 200 1 biogas measuring system 2 5 mass balance analysis in addition to the long term monitoring data the impact of replacing alum dosing to the bioreactor 190 kg al day with fecl2 dosing in the upstream network 160 kg fe day on the effluent p concentrations hydrogen sulfide levels and overall biogas production during anaerobic digestion was evaluated through a plant wide mas balance analysis based on the results from the comprehensive sampling campaigns the plant wide mass balance included the total and soluble aluminium iron phosphate sulfur and nitrogen as well as the ts vs and tss vss mass flows and concentrations within the different process units of the oxley creek wwtp during both the baseline and experimental periods we assumed that steady state conditions in the activated sludge tanks and digesters to be obtained in each period after 3 sludge retention times srts hydraulic data of the flows within the wwtp was collected from the scada system

speciation using semi quantitative x ray diffraction analyses after collection the sludge samples were immediately freeze dried under vacuum conditions 50 c 0 1 mbar and subsequently grinded to powder form under anaerobic conditions in an enclosed cabinet sparged with n2 x ray diffractograms were recorded with a d8 bruker diffractometer using a cu kα1 radiation at λ 1 55 å the diffractometer was

methods apha 1995 3 results 3 1 effect of fecl2 dosing on sulfide control in the sewer network fig 2 shows the 90th percentile of gaseous daily peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations during both the baseline and experimental periods measured in location a and b respectively see figs s1 and s2 for the complete datasets it can be seen that there was a substantial difference in sulfide control efficiency between the two locations at location a with a ferrous chloride dosing of 31 mg fe l the peak h2s concentration decreased from 1041 to 557 ppm h2s i e 46 reduction at location b with a ferrous chloride dosing of 82 mg fe l the peak sulfide concentrations decreased from 80 to 6 ppm h2s i e 93 reduction the lower sulfide control in location a can be attributed to the relatively low sewage ph levels i e average ph 6 28 0 25 with levels at times as low as 6 0 it is well known that the iron sulfide precipitation reaction is highly ph dependent with significant lower removal efficiencies at lower ph values in contrast the average ph at location b was one unit higher at 7 32 0 27 to illustrate this a decrease in ph from 7 to 6 5 was found to result in an increase in iron dosing requirements of 200 in order to achieve the same effluent dissolved sulfide concentrations firer et al 2008 the low ph values were most likely caused by industrial trade waste entering the sewer in that sewer section although the detailed source was yet to be determined 3 2 phosphorus removal at the wwtp fig 3 shows the long term average phosphate removal in the activated sludge tanks of the downstream wwtp the long term average phosphate removal was found to be 9 44 0 53 9 61 0 32 and 6 43 0 33 mg po4 p l for the baseline experimental and post experimental period respectively these latter resulted in effluent phosphate concentrations for these periods of 0 71 0 19 0 89 0 23 and 2 13 0 44 mg po4 p l respectively hence the phosphate removal was not negatively affected by replacing the al3 dosing at the wwtp with in sewer fe2 dosing this was further supported by the data from 24 hr flow proportional composite samples obtained during the sampling campaigns with effluent phosphate concentrations of 0 43 0 11 and 0 28 0 06 mg po4 p l for the baseline and experimental period respectively the three day average concentrations of aluminium iron and phosphorus at all sampling locations during baseline and experimental period are presented in tables s2 and s3 respectively the long term monitoring data revealed that reducing the in sewer fe dosing to 14 in absence of alum dosing at the wwtp during the post experimental period resulted in a significant decrease p 0 05 in average phosphate removal from 9 61 0 32 to 6 43 0 33 mg po4 p l fig 3 and s3 b these observations strongly suggest the role of in sewer dosed fe2 in downstream phosphate removal importantly besides the above described beneficial impact on phosphate removal in the activated sludge tanks and the hydrogen sulfide control in the biogas see section 3 3 replacing alum dosing with in sewer ferrous chloride dosing in the upstream sewer network did not negatively affect overall performance of the wwtp importantly the biological nitrogen removal process was not affected with very high nitrogen removal efficiencies of 99 during both the baseline and experimental period figs s6 and s7 the latter resulted in very low nitrogen effluent concentrations in both periods i e 0 5 mg nh4 n l and 3 mg tkn l tables s2 and s3 moreover dosing fe2 in the sewer network did not affect the soluble iron concentrations in the effluent of the wwtp i e below detection limit see table s3 the latter was found to be important for quu as increased levels of soluble fe have been associated with increased formation of disinfection by products and increased dosing requirements liu et al 2012 3 3 sulfide control and biogas production in anaerobic digester fig 4 shows that the average h2s concentrations in the biogas decreased from 495 10 ppm h2s during the baseline period to 283 4 ppm h2s during the experimental period a significant p 0 05 decrease of 43 the mass balance analysis showed that the total iron that ultimately ended in the anaerobic digester increased from 341 4 kg fe day to 449 2 kg fe day figs s8 and s9 an increase of 24 the resulting fe concentrations in the anaerobic digester were 15 7 0 2 g fe kg ts to 22 2 0 1 g fe kg ts tables s2 and s3 the mass balance analysis also revealed that the total s concentrations in the digesters were 11 8 0 1 g s kg ts and 11 08 0 05 g s kg ts during the baseline and experimental period respectively tables s2 and s3 as the total s concentrations comprise a variety of sulfur species i e sulfate thiosulfate sulfite elemental sulfur and sulfide it was not possible to determine the hydrogen sulfide production rate during both periods however despite that the total s concentrations were similar in both period the hydrogen sulfide levels during experimental period were significantly lower figs 4 and s4 providing strong evidence of the effectiveness of in sewer iron dosing on sulfide control in the anaerobic digester indeed during the post experimental period the h2s concentration in the biogas increased to values close to that of the baseline period i e 451 6 ppm h2s it should be noted that the oxley creek wwtp imports sludge from a number of smaller wwtps that do not implement iron dosing i e 120 wet tons was day versus 150 tons imported wet sludge day thereby substantially diluting the beneficial impact of upstream iron dosing by 55 6 importantly besides the beneficial impact on the hydrogen sulfide levels in the biogas replacing alum dosing at the wwtp with ferrous chloride in the upstream sewer did not negatively affect p 0 05 the performance of the anaerobic digester with average biogas production rates of 2768 25 and 2786 33 m3 biogas day during the baseline and the experimental period respectively figs 4 and s5 a slightly lower average biogas production was observed during the post experimental phase with a biogas production rate of 2683 44 m3 day a decrease of 4 this slight decrease was not significant p 0 05 and should not be related to in sewer iron dosing at 23 kg day only and was likely caused by other factors 3 4 determining iron speciation at the wwtp fig 5 a c shows the x ray diffraction patterns of thickened waste activated sludge before and after thermal hydrolysis treatment and anaerobically digested sludge fig 5a shows the presence of vivianite in the thickened sludge from the activated sludge tank this finding is in agreement with recent studies that also found vivianite is present in activated sludge prior to anaerobic digestion wilfert et al 2018a with iron salts added to the treatment plant directly rather than in sewers however vivianite was not found in sludge after thermal hydrolysis fig 5b and the digested sludge fig 5c since vivianite is a crystalline mineral its presence in the sludge would be seen in the x ray diffraction patterns it is possible that vivianite was oxidized during the thermal hydrolysis process and transformed to amorphous ferric hydroxide phosphate fe iii 3 po4 2 oh 3 5h2o pratesi et al 2003 the fact that no vivianite was found after anaerobic digestion contrarily to various previous studies wilfert et al 2016 2018a suggests that the thermal hydrolysis cambi hindered vivianite formation during anaerobic digestion this was further supported by the semi quantitative xrd analyses which showed that the overall crystalline content of the inorganic fraction of the sludge was substantially reduced i e from 100 to 26 after the thermal hydrolysis step table s1 fig 5 d after anaerobic digestion the crystallinity of the inorganic fraction of the sludge increased to 62 hematite fe2o3 was the only observed crystalline fe species comprising about 4 3 of the total crystalline content table s1 considering the above and a total fe concentration in the digested sludge of 22 2 0 1 g kg ts table s3 it can be calculated that 45 of the total fe was present in the form of crystalline hematite the remaining fe must have been present in amorphous form 4 discussion we previously demonstrated the potential of multiple reuse of iron dosed as ferric chloride fe3 in sewer networks as a sulfide control method for downstream phosphate removal and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion using continuous laboratory scale urban wastewater systems under controlled conditions rebosura et al 2018 however the applicability of these results obtained under controlled laboratory conditions i e constant temperature flow and hrt to real life systems remains far from being certain real life wastewater systems sewer networks and treatment plants are far more complicated in addition the wastewater flow rate and composition are highly dynamic here we evaluated the feasibility through full scale field trials under real life conditions using the oxley creek catchment and wwtp as a case study the results obtained in this study confirmed our previous laboratory findings and demonstrated that dosing of iron salts i e ferrous chloride in this case in sewer networks to combat hydrogen sulfide induced sewer corrosion and odour complaints can have multiple flow on benefits also for large complex and highly dynamic real life full scale sewer networks connected to large downstream wastewater treatment plants during the experimental period the overall coagulant dosing reduced by 6 i e from 502 kg to 470 kg per day by replacing alum dosing at the wwtp 192 kg al day with iron salts dosing 160 kg fe day at two locations in the sewer network despite this slight decrease in overall chemical consumption and substantial reduction in chemical dosing at the wwtp from 502 kg day to 310 kg day i e a reduction of 39 due to the fact that the alum dosing was completely ceased at the wwtp the phosphate removal was not affected at all equally important a significant increase in sulfide control 43 in the anaerobic digestion step during experimental period was achieved while maintaining similar biogas production the decrease in hydrogen sulfide levels in the biogas was found to be extremely important for the water utility as the maximum allowable hydrogen sulfide concentration for cogeneration engines often referred to as combined heat power chp units operated at the wwtp to avoid issues with corrosion is restricted to maximum levels of 300 ppm h2s moreover the presence of elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide in sewers and biogas comes with serious oh s concerns for operators as hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic odorous and highly corrosive compound it should be emphasized that at the oxley creek wwtp 150 wet tons of dewatered sludge is daily imported from several other wwtps operated by quu none of these wwtps dosed iron coagulants in their treatment process as the excess was production at the wwtp is only 120 wet tons per day the iron concentration in the was is diluted by a factor of 2 25 it can thus be expected that much higher sulfide control efficiencies during the anaerobic digestion stage can be achieved in cases where the sludge is not mixed with imported dewatered sludge in total 470 kg fe day was added to the oxley creek sewage collection and treatment system the majority of the iron is dosed to the centrate stream 295 kg fe3 day prior to being mixed back with the influent fig 1a the latter was implemented previously in order to reduce issues with struvite formation in the digester and to mitigate odour problems in the centrate buffer tank overall only 34 i e 160 kg out of 470 kg fe day of the chemicals dosed at the downstream wwtp was re located at two locations upstream in the sewer network that were subjected to the most serious odour complaints by the surrounding community the iron dosing at these two places within the sewer network only comprised 7 of the total hydraulic flow of the sewage entering the oxley creek wwtp only resulting in a slight increase in fe concentration at the wwtp of 2 8 mg fe l in practice the occurrence of hydrogen sulfide induced sewer corrosion often becomes apparent through odour complaints rather than internal assessment of the underground sewer pipe in most sewer networks the places at which sewer corrosion and issues with odour occur are plentiful hence the amount of iron salts required could be much higher than the amount dosed in this study in this case both p removal from wastewater and h2s reduction in biogas are expected to be further enhanced in this sense more iron salt dosed at the treatment plant should be moved upstream to sewers to further increase the overall sulfide control efficiency within the sewer network thereby enhancing the protection of our critical sewer assets as well as increasing the community liveability however further research is needed to assess whether increased relocation of iron lasts to upstream sewers would negatively affect odour control in the dewatering process which was not covered in this study it is noted that the two dosing locations used in this study both sit at upstream reaches of the network far from the treatment plant the impact of these distances on the p removal and biogas h2s control is not assessed in this study and requires further investigation however the choice of dosing locations should mainly be governed by sewer conditions network wide simulations using advanced dynamic sewer models such as the sewex model sharma et al 2008a 2008b are desirable for identifying hotspots with high hydrogen sulfide concentrations and provide a robust assessment of the potential savings that can be achieved in terms of sewer asset management and community liveability in addition to hydrogen sulfide sewer networks are also an important source of methane a potent greenhouse gas with a ghg potential of 21 23 times that of co2 emissions that can significantly contribute to the overall carbon footprint of wastewater utilities guisasola et al 2008 2009 liu et al 2015 in fact it has been estimated that methane emissions in sewers comprise as high as 20 of the combined ghg emissions in wwtps while beyond the scope of this study previous laboratory scale studies revealed that iron dosing can inhibit the methanogenic activity of the sewer biofilms by about 50 80 zhang et al 2009 2012 and could thus provide another benefit that warrants further exploration the oxley creek wwtp achieves nitrogen removal through the traditional nitrification denitrification process as the effluent nitrogen discharge limits are stringent i e total n 5 mg l there is no primary settling as all influent cod is needed for denitrification however many wwtps around the world have a primary settling step in place further research is needed to assess what fraction of the in sewer dosed iron would be removed during primary settling and which fraction will pass through the activated sludge tanks for p removal the fe that ends up in the primary sludge would not assist in p removal albeit it would still have a beneficial impact on the sulfide control in anaerobic digestion recently it was found that when iron salts are dosed at wwtps for phosphate removal and subsequently subjected to anaerobic digestion vivianite fe ii 3 po4 2 8h2o becomes the predominant fe p precipitation product wilfert et al 2016 2018a the latter can be as high as 90 of all the phosphate present in digested sewage sludge with high iron content wilfert et al 2018a this is an important finding due to the paramagnetic properties of vivianite which allows for selective recovery of vivianite from the digested sludge through magnetic separation prot et al 2019 wilfert et al 2018b our study clearly showed that thermal hydrolysis as a pre treatment step for anaerobic digestion eliminated vivianite in the activated sludge with no further formation of vivianite during anaerobic digestion while further research is needed to fundamentally understand the mechanisms behind these observations it is evident that the implementation of thermal hydrolysis as a pre treatment step for anaerobic digestion would likely limit the selective recovery of iron and phosphate in the form of vivianite through magnetic separation the above described opportunities and research needs for further optimization and additional benefits needs to be assessed through long term full scale trials coupled with life cycle assessment lcas the overall economic benefits that can be achieved are expected to differ depending on the local conditions such as the type and size of sewer network configuration of the downstream wwtp effluent nutrients discharge standards and the price and availability of alum and iron based coagulants and would require careful consideration on a case by case basis however the costs associated with chemical change over costs and location of dosing are expected to be much lower than the potential up stream and downstream savings that can be achieved for e g expenditure for odour control and rehabilitation of sewer assets alone pikaar et al 2014 all of the above are required in order to quantify the potential savings that could be achieved from an economic environmental and liveability perspective 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the feasibility of multiple reuse of iron salts dosed as a sulfide control method in a large full scale sewer network for removal of phosphate and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion in the downstream oxley creek wastewater treatment plant south east queensland australia through full scale field studies the key findings of the work are fecl2 dosing for sewer corrosion control in the upstream sewer network was beneficially reused for p removal in the activated sludge tanks and subsequently for control of hydrogen sulfide during anaerobic digestion process at the downstream wwtp and does not negatively affect the overall treatment performance in terms of nitrogen removal biogas production and disinfection process in wwtp dosing of alum could be replaced with in sewer dosing of iron salts with significant economic and environmental benefits the thermal hydrolysis process prior to anaerobic digestion eliminated vivianite in the activated sludge with no further formation of vivianite during anaerobic digestion overall the findings in this study show the urgent need for integrated water management and can be seen as a first step for water utilities towards more efficient coagulants usage through development of an integrated network wide coagulant dosing management

18522,the ability of satellites to assess surface water quality indicators such as colored dissolved organic matter cdom suggests that remote sensing could be a useful tool for evaluating water treatability metrics in considering potential drinking water supplies to explore this possibility 24 surface water samples were collected throughout minnesota usa with wide ranging values of cdom a 440 0 41 27 9 m 1 dissolved organic carbon doc 5 5 47 6 mg l and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 1 3 5 1 l mg m laboratory experiments were performed to quantify chlorine demand and the formation of two classes of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas using the uniform formation conditions ufc test chlorine demand and thmufc were linearly correlated with cdom r2 0 97 and 0 91 respectively indicating that cdom is a useful predictor of these parameters on the other hand data comparing di and tri haaufc with cdom were better fit by a logarithmic relationship r2 0 73 and 0 87 respectively while mono haaufc was linearly correlated with cdom r2 0 46 but only for low to moderately colored waters a 440 11 m 1 the correlations relating chlorine demand and dbpufc values with cdom were coupled with satellite cdom assessments to estimate chlorine demand and dbpufc values for all surface waters larger than 0 05 km2 in the state of minnesota usa the resulting maps suggest that only 21 8 of minnesota lakes would meet both the thm and haa maximum contaminant levels but only when pre disinfection treatment removes 75 of dbp precursors there are limitations to determining cdom using satellites for high color surface waters a 440 11 m 1 however leading to underpredicted values for cdom chlorine demand and dbpufc overall the results demonstrate the potential benefits of satellite remote sensing for assessing potential drinking water sources and water treatability metrics graphical abstract image 1 keywords colored dissolved organic matter disinfection byproducts chlorine demand satellite remote sensing surface water quality drinking water source 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom originates primarily from two natural sources production by aquatic organisms autochthonous and leaching of decaying terrestrial plant matter allochthonous thurman 2012 dom is also derived from anthropogenic sources such as wastewater effluent and agricultural and urban runoff colored dissolved organic matter cdom is the portion of dom that absorbs light at a specific wavelength commonly 420 or 440 nm for freshwaters and 412 nm for marine waters brezonik et al 2015 cdom is primarily composed of humic and fulvic acids that contain abundant unsaturated carbon carbon bonds including aromatic moieties which are known to absorb light in the ultraviolet uv and visible wavelength ranges del castillo and miller 2008 shank et al 2005 cdom is a major water quality driver because of its ability to mobilize metals mcknight and bencala 1990 and hydrophobic chemicals act as a photosensitizer for aquatic photochemistry gerecke et al 2001 and control aquatic ecosystem processes e g decrease light penetration houser 2006 sommaruga 2001 thrane et al 2014 although not directly harmful to human health dom in source waters including the cdom fraction can have negative effects on the cost and effectiveness of water treatment operations and the finished water quality it increases the consumption of water treatment chemicals such as coagulants sharp et al 2006 and fouls membranes used for filtration zularisam et al 2006 furthermore it reacts with chemical disinfectants such as free chlorine leading to the formation of potentially toxic disinfection byproducts dbps beggs et al 2009 bellar et al 1974 eikebrokk et al 2004 herzsprung et al 2012 ledesma et al 2012 sedlak and von gunten 2011 thus cdom plays a critical role in affecting both the chemistry of surface waters and their potential use as drinking water supplies the dom content of surface waters is usually obtained by grab sampling and subsequent laboratory measurement of the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration using a carbon analyzer or the uv visible light absorbance using a spectrophotometer using such a sampling methodology to monitor dom in large numbers of surface water bodies on a regular e g monthly basis would be tedious and cost prohibitive fortunately investigations over the past 15 years have demonstrated the feasibility and practicality of using satellite remote sensing to measure cdom in surface waters chen et al 2017 del castillo and miller 2008 fichot et al 2015 olmanson et al 2016 spyrakos et al 2018 xie et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 by correlating measured cdom to satellite reflectance models can be developed for retrieving cdom from publicly available satellite imagery such imagery from satellite sensors such as the landsat series provide global coverage going back to 1972 potentially permitting researchers to quantify cdom distributions and variability across long time periods and broad regional scales kutser 2012 moreover cdom typically is closely correlated with doc in lakes and rivers griffin et al 2018 and thus the use of cdom as a proxy of doc for assessment of water treatability has important practical advantages over other water quality parameters because cdom can be obtained via satellite remote sensing and is associated with humic substances that are known to have significant impacts on drinking water processes given the importance of dom in terms of water treatability many researchers have developed empirical models that relate dom content as doc uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 or specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 to various measures of water treatability including chlorine demand abdullah et al 2009 yee et al 2006 dbp formation amy et al 1998 chang et al 1996 rodriguez et al 2000 sohn et al 2004 watson et al 1993 coagulant consumption van leeuwen et al 2005 yang et al 2010 and membrane fouling li and chen 2004 liang et al 2006 such models are useful for process control because they permit important treatment concerns such as water treatment chemical demand and dbp formation to be predicted using parameters such as doc and uv254 that can be measured in near real time at a given location brinkman and hozalski 2011 we are unaware of any water treatability models that consider cdom as a predictive variable developing models that consider cdom as a variable instead of doc or uv254 would enable the use of satellite remote sensing to assess potential water supplies and monitor the treatability of existing surface water supplies the objective of this study was to develop relationships between cdom and two measures of water treatability chlorine demand and dbp formation a focus of this study was to compare trends for different classes of dbps surface water samples were collected from 24 locations in 20 lakes and 1 river throughout minnesota and the formation of two regulated dbp classes thms and haas upon chlorination was measured following the uniform formation conditions ufc test summers et al 1996 the relationships between cdom doc uv vis absorbance and suva values for the water samples and their measured chlorine demand and dbp formation potentials thms mono di and tri haas were determined the resulting models were coupled with landsat derived cdom measurements to create statewide chlorine demand and dbpufc maps of minnesota s lakes and rivers to demonstrate the possible use of satellite remote sensing for rapid large scale assessments of water treatability 2 methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a table of the chemicals used and their purities and suppliers is provided in the supplementary material table s1 all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm resistivity millipore 2 2 lake water sampling surface water samples were collected from 24 locations 20 lakes and 1 river lake vermilion lake of the woods and upper red lake were sampled twice in different locations in four large ecoregions of minnesota usa the northern lakes and forests nlf 15 lakes the north central hardwood forests nchf 4 lakes the northern minnesota wetlands nmw 4 lakes and the western corn belt plains wcbp 1 lake fig s1 the adjacent nchf and wcbp ecoregions were combined into a single category nchf wcbp because there was only one lake representing the wcbp and very little of its watershed is within the wcbp the water samples were collected during the summer of 2016 and represent a subset of 412 samples collected from 299 locations mostly lakes across the upper midwest states of minnesota wisconsin and michigan between 2014 and 2016 for analysis of cdom and other water quality parameters griffin et al 2018 the 24 water samples included in this investigation were selected to provide geographic diversity and a wide range of cdom water samples typically were collected from a boat canoe or kayak at least 100 m from shore and within 1 m of the water surface by submerging acid washed and triple rinsed polycarbonate or high density polyethylene hdpe containers to arm s length and then removing the cap gps coordinates of the sampling locations are provided in table s2 water samples for subsequent chlorine demand and dbp testing were filtered within a few hours of collection by pumping from the collection containers through 0 45 μm geotech high capacity capsule filters into clean containers aliquots of the filtered water for subsequent uv visible light scans and doc analysis were placed into separate pre ashed 40 ml amber glass vials with the latter acidified to ph 2 using 2 m hcl all water samples were stored in the dark under refrigeration until further use chlorophyll a was isolated from lake water samples by vacuum filtering onto 0 22 μm cellulose nitrate filters and stored frozen until analysis 2 3 chlorine demand and dbp formation testing the chlorine demand of each water sample was determined by adding a stock solution of sodium hypochlorite naocl with 10 available chlorine at three different doses cl2 doc ratios of 1 1 1 7 1 and 2 1 and measuring the residual concentration after incubating for 24 h at room temperature the chlorine dose for subsequent ufc testing was selected to yield a free chlorine residual of 1 0 0 4 mg cl2 l at the end of incubation all glassware used in the chlorine demand and ufc experiments was cleaned by soaking in a concentrated hydrochloric acid bath 10 for 24 h rinsing with ultrapure water and then baking at 550 c for at least 6 h for ufc testing triplicate aliquots of each water sample were dosed with 2 ml l borate buffer 1 0 m boric acid and 0 26 m sodium hydroxide ph 8 0 and adjusted to ph 8 0 0 2 using 1 0 m sulfuric acid or 1 0 m sodium hydroxide after an incubation time of 24 h in the dark at 20 1 c the chlorine residual was determined to ensure that it was within the required range samples outside the desired range were discarded and the test repeated with the chlorine dose adjusted as necessary the chlorine residual was then quenched with na2so3 prior to extraction and analysis of dbps 2 4 analytical methods doc was measured using a shimadzu toc l csn analyzer after sparging the acidified samples with nitrogen gas uv vis absorbance a scans from 200 to 800 nm were obtained using a shimadzu 1601uv pc dual beam spectrophotometer and 1 or 5 cm quartz cells cdom was calculated as the napierian absorption coefficient at 440 nm a 440 using the following equation 1 a 440 m 1 2 303 a 440 l where a 440 is the absorbance at 440 nm and l is the path length m specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by normalizing the absorbance at 254 nm uv254 to the doc concentration spectral slopes s275 295 and s350 400 were computed by fitting a linear regression to the natural logarithm of absorbance between the wavelength 275 295 and 350 400 nm respectively chlorophyll a chl a was determined using a standard fluorometric method method 10200h eaton et al 2005 total suspended solids tss was obtained by filtering lake water through a pre ashed 47 mm whatman gf f filter and normalizing the mass of dry residue by the volume of lake water filtered bromide concentration was determined via ion chromatography free chlorine was measured using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method and a hach dr 890 portable colorimeter the concentrations of the thm4 compounds chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform tbm and haa9 compounds monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa monobromoacetic acid mbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa and bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa were determined using gas chromatography microelectron capture detection gc μecd according to modified usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 respectively method details are provided in the si specific chlorine demand and specific thm and haa formation potentials specific thmufc and haaufc were calculated by normalizing chlorine demand thmufc or haaufc to the doc concentration 2 5 data analysis and mapping cdom maps of minnesota were created using an empirical model developed from landsat 8 oli surface reflectance sr level 2 products from the earth resources observation and science eros center the model was derived by step wise regression to relate cdom a 440 data from 194 in situ measurements with corresponding spectral radiometric data from four paths of clear landsat 8 imagery from 2015 to 2016 the two variable model used two band ratios oli3 oli4 green red and oli4 oli5 red near infrared 2 ln a 440 5 478 oli3 oli4 0 633 oli4 oli5 8 135 and had an r2 of 0 77 and root mean square error rmse of 0 624 m 1 this model was applied to 2016 clear landsat 8 imagery with a few 2017 images to fill in areas not available in the 2016 imagery due to cloud cover these areas were in western minnesota and included portions of the lake of the woods and the red lakes which are among minnesota s largest lakes image processing was conducted using erdas imagine software maps produced from multiple landsat images were mosaicked to create the final statewide cdom map for minnesota the resulting pixel level cdom maps together with experimentally obtained correlations either pearson for linear or linest for non linear using microsoft excel between chlorine demand and a 440 thmufc and a 440 and haaufc and a 440 were used to create state wide maps for chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc 3 results 3 1 characteristics of lake waters the water quality parameter values for the 24 water samples are summarized in table s2 observed ranges for key parameters are cdom a 440 0 41 27 9 m 1 doc 5 5 47 6 mg l uv254 8 7 200 m 1 suva254 1 3 5 1 l mg m chlorophyll a 1 1 14 4 μg l tss 0 7 13 9 mg l and ph 7 1 8 8 bromide concentrations were generally less than the limit of detection 0 01 mg l except for five samples with values ranging from 0 04 to 0 07 mg l relationships among the measured dom parameters a 440 doc uv254 and suva254 are shown in fig 1 doc and uv254 correlated linearly with a 440 across the entire data range r2 0 93 and 0 98 respectively the slopes and r2 values for the pearson correlations were similar when excluding three sampling sites with very high a 440 values south sturgeon lake lake vermilion pike bay and upper red lake 2 data not shown for suva254 the greatest correlation coefficient values were obtained for linear regressions with log a 440 r2 0 88 and log doc r2 0 78 a 440 did not correlate with other water quality indicators r2 0 18 and p 0 05 including ph tss chlorophyll a and bromide table s2 spectral slopes were computed from plots of the natural logarithm of absorbance vs wavelength over the range 250 450 nm for each water sample fig s2 spectral slopes s275 295 among the water samples ranged from 0 013 to 0 028 nm 1 but samples with visible color i e a 440 3 m 1 had a narrow range of s275 295 0 013 0 018 nm 1 s350 400 also showed small variation ranging from 0 015 to 0 020 nm 1 except for mille lacs lake low a 440 which had a s350 400 of 0 009 nm 1 the results indicated that the optical properties of a 440 from moderate to high a 440 waters are consistent across a large geographic range 3 2 chlorine demand chlorine demand values mean standard deviation for the 24 samples table s3 ranged from 3 68 0 10 to 72 0 0 17 mg cl2 l with a mean of 14 9 mg cl2 l and a median of 8 58 mg cl2 l in addition the specific chlorine demand ranged from 0 56 0 01 to 1 70 0 01 mg cl2 mg c and the mean and median specific chlorine demand were 0 97 and 0 85 mg cl2 mg c respectively chlorine demand exhibited a strong linear correlation with a 440 r2 0 97 slope 2 18 m mg cl2 l doc r2 0 98 slope 1 75 mg cl2 mg c and uv254 r2 0 99 slope 0 35 m mg cl2 l fig 2 indicating that all three parameters are useful predictors of chlorine demand for the lakes the slopes and r2 values remained similar when the three lakes with very high a 440 values were excluded from the regressions data not shown in addition the organic carbon normalized specific chlorine demand correlated linearly with suva254 r2 0 84 slope 0 28 m mg cl2 l 3 3 dbp formation a wide range of dbpufc values was found for the 24 waters table s3 south sturgeon lake lake vermilion pike bay and lake of the woods muskeg bay which had the highest doc levels generated the maximum values for both thmufc and haaufc the only thms observed as chlorination products were tcm and bdcm fig s3a although a few lakes contained bromide at concentrations exceeding the lod tcm was the dominant thm species formed in all samples with mass concentration corresponding to 80 of the total thms the observed thmufc values ranged from 104 16 9 to 2019 3 73 μg l and the mean thmufc 421 μg l was much greater than the median thmufc 264 μg l in contrast specific thmufc values ranged from 15 9 0 95 to 55 9 0 10 μg mg c with comparable mean and median values 29 8 and 27 5 μg mg c respectively five haa species mcaa mbaa dcaa tcaa bdcaa were detected after chlorine dosing fig s3b in general the total haaufc values were comparable to the total thmufc values table s3 although south sturgeon lake had the maximum haaufc 1366 103 μg l lake of the woods fourmile bay had the highest specific haaufc 76 0 2 19 μg mg c the lowest haaufc 47 0 19 4 μg l and specific haaufc 7 22 2 98 μg mg c were obtained for island lake the mean haaufc was 469 μg l which is greater than the median value 363 μg l while the average specific haaufc 35 1 μg mg c was similar to the median value 32 0 μg mg c distributions of haas were sorted into mono di and tri haa species table s4 because each group apparently is formed from distinct precursors and chemical pathways chellam and krasner 2001 consistent with many previous studies andrews et al 2005 krasner et al 2006 nuckols et al 2001 the dominant haa species were dcaa and tcaa accounting for 74 6 11 1 of the haa5 pool by mass followed by mcaa mbaa and bdcaa were detected but never exceeded 1 of the total haa5 pool data not shown 3 4 correlations between dbp formation and cdom thmufc exhibited a strong linear correlation with a 440 r2 0 91 slope 52 5 m μg l fig 3 a indicating that cdom a 440 is a useful predictor of thm yields considering only the 21 waters with a 440 below 9 m 1 the r2 decreased slightly r2 0 84 but the slope increased to 62 5 m μg l regression analyses on the formation potentials of tri di and mono haas fig 3b d in relation to a 440 showed different trends than the thmufc a 440 relationship tri haaufc correlated linearly with a 440 r2 0 87 for low to moderately colored waters a 440 11 m 1 but logarithmically when the entire data set was considered the relationship between di haaufc and a 440 was similar but with a lower slope in the low to moderately colored lake waters r2 0 73 slope 25 7 m μg l mono haaufc on the other hand exhibited a relatively weak correlation with a 440 with a linear correlation only observed for low to moderately colored waters r2 0 46 slope 16 7 m μg l overall these results agree with previous reports bond et al 2009 bull et al 2006 chang et al 2006 dickenson et al 2008 hua and reckhow 2007 kanokkantapong et al 2006 kraus et al 2010 liang and singer 2003 that suggest the three classes of haa species are formed from different precursors see below 3 5 correlations between dbp formation and doc or uv absorbance doc and uv254 have been widely used as surrogate parameters to predict dbp formation chowdhury et al 2009 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 given the linear relationships between uv254 and a 440 and between doc and a 440 fig 1 it is not surprising that the strength of correlations between thmufc di and tri haaufc and doc fig s4 or uv254 fig s5 were similar to those for a 440 thmufc exhibited a relatively strong linear relationship with doc r2 0 84 slope 40 3 μg mgc and uv254 r2 0 91 slope 8 21 m μg l di and tri haaufc relationships with doc and uv254 however were best fit by logarithmic relationships r2 0 87 and 0 73 respectively for doc and r2 0 91 and 0 82 respectively for uv254 when considering only the low to moderately colored lake waters di and tri haaufc increased linearly with increasing doc r2 0 67 and 0 66 respectively and uv254 r2 0 90 and 0 83 respectively these results support the conclusion from previous studies that uv254 serves as a slightly better predictor of dbp formation than doc concentration edzwald et al 1985 najm et al 1994 mono haaufc correlated poorly with doc and uv254 when all data were considered but a stronger correlation was found for low to moderately colored waters r2 0 69 slope 15 8 μg mg c for doc fig s4d r2 0 58 slope 2 73 m μg l fig s5d for uv254 3 6 correlations between specific dbp formation and suva suva is often used as a proxy for the hydrophobicity molecular weight mw and aromaticity of dom dickenson et al 2008 hua and reckhow 2007 singer et al 2002 doc normalized or specific thmufc and tri haaufc exhibited relatively strong linear correlations with suva r2 0 67 and 0 65 respectively slope 7 57 and 8 17 m μg l respectively fig s6 suggesting that these dbps are formed from uv absorbing organic matter i e humic substances conversely relatively weak correlations were observed between suva and specific mono and di haaufc in addition when lakes with suva exceeding 3 l mg m were considered the mono haa yields started to decrease with increasing suva fig s6d these results imply that low uv absorbing organic matter i e non humic substances contributed substantially to formation of mono and di haa species 3 7 chlorine demand and dbpufc mapping using a 440 data from satellite imagery and the correlations between chlorine demand and a 440 fig 2 thmufc and a 440 fig 3 and haaufc and a 440 fig s7 state wide maps for chlorine demand and dbp formation potentials were produced the map for thmufc fig 4 shows relatively high levels of thmufc 400 μg l in lakes of northeastern minnesota especially within the nlf ecoregion this result is not surprising as most minnesota lakes with a 440 3 m 1 are located in the nlf ecoregion lower thmufc values are predicted for the nchf nmw and wcbp ecoregions and most lakes in these three ecoregions are relatively low in color consistent with the thmufc results nlf lakes generally have higher levels of haaufc 480 μg l fig s8 and chlorine demand 5 mgcl2 l fig s9 the distribution of dbpufc levels in the four ecoregions clearly reflected their current distributions of forested urban and agricultural land uses for example the nlf ecoregion is extensively forested with large areas of wetlands and open water undeveloped land covers 89 of the nlf ecoregion in contrast almost half of the nchf ecoregion is cultivated with forests and wetlands only making up 35 of land cover brezonik et al 2019 the wcbp ecoregion is dominated by agricultural use 83 of land cover but also contains some open grassland brezonik et al 2019 comparisons of values of cdom chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc estimated from satellite imagery versus experimentally measured values are shown in fig 5 the estimated values represent an average of the grid cell containing the physical sampling location and the neighboring cells for lakes with cdom values less than 10 m 1 the plotted values for all parameters lie close to the 1 1 line fig 5a indicating that satellite remote sensing is capable of accurate assessing cdom and cdom associated parameters such as thmufc in low to moderately colored waters the agreement was poor however for two lakes with very high cdom levels a 440 20 m 1 i e south sturgeon lake and lake vermilion pike bay as the estimated cdom chlorine demand and dbpufc values were substantially less than the corresponding experimentally measured values fig 5a d in addition negative haaufc values were obtained for six low cdom a 440 2 5 m 1 sampling sites fig 5d the latter results suggest that estimation of haaufc using satellite remote sensing can be problematic for waters with very low color based on the usepa stage 1 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rule maximum contaminant levels for thm4 and haa5 are 80 μg l and 60 μg l respectively as our dbpufc values are for raw lake water lake averaged cdom values from the statewide cdom mapping were used to estimate the percentage of lakes that would violate either or both abovementioned mcls by assuming three potential levels of dbp precursor removal 25 poor removal 50 conventional treatment and 75 enhanced coagulation fig 6 and table s7 consequently thm4 concentrations in raw waters would be limited to 107 160 and 320 μg l respectively while for haa5 the limits would be 80 120 and 240 μg l respectively none of minnesota s lakes n 11 690 would be expected to meet the thm4 mcl assuming 25 precursor removal but 62 4 of minnesota lakes would meet the mcl assuming 75 precursor removal the percentage of minnesota lakes that would be expected to meet the haa5 mcl assuming 25 precursor removal was only 11 3 but increased to 21 8 for 75 removal finally the percentage of minnesota lakes that would be expected to meet both dbp mcls was only 21 8 for 75 precursor removal it is important to note however that this estimation considered only the number of lakes and not lake area or volume referring to the maps showing the distribution of dbpufc levels fig 4 and fig s9 most lakes in some regions of minnesota such as the northeast are not likely to be useful as drinking water sources because of their high color and potential to form high levels of dbps even when reasonable precursor removals are assumed 4 discussion 4 1 cdom as a predictor of chlorine demand dbp formation historically predictive models for dbp formation include parameters such as doc uv254 and suva254 which are commonly used surrogates for dom quantity and composition chowdhury et al 2009 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 other parameters include ph water temperature chlorine dose and reaction time most modeling efforts have focused on thm formation with considerably less work on haa formation chowdhury et al 2009 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 for example singer and chang 1989 developed linear relationships between thm formation and uv254 other researchers have developed multivariate models to relate dbp concentrations to a combination of doc and other variables including water temperature bromide level chlorine dose and contact time amy et al 1987 sérodes et al 2003 such empirical models often have limited applicability given the narrow range of water qualities used for model development doc is a broad indicator of the concentration of dom whereas uv254 represents specific structural characteristics and functional groups croue et al 2000 edzwald et al 1985 suva254 provides a relative proxy for the aromaticity of dom and as a result its feasibility at predicting dbp formation highly depends on the relative importance of aromatic dom in reacting with chlorine to form dbps unfortunately neither doc nor uv254 can be obtained directly from satellite observations although uv254 is an optical property that provides a sensitive measure of dom content uv irradiation is so strongly absorbed by the earth s atmosphere that very little is reflected back to orbiting satellites cdom a 440 in contrast is readily obtained from satellite observations because light in the visible and longer wavelength ranges is not as strongly absorbed by the atmosphere yet is sufficiently absorbed by cdom to result in predictable shifts in the reflectance spectra cdom in the limnology literature refers to the color or light absorptivity of dissolved substances in water which has implications for growth of phytoplankton and submerged vegetation gallegos 2001 geider 1987 lake trophic status brezonik et al 2005 and biogeochemical cycling of elements zepp et al 2007 as such cdom is an important variable affecting lake and river ecology the color of drinking water is important as an aesthetic parameter with a color maximum of 15 mg pt l as measured by the cobalt platinum method in the usa epa 2018 and generally correlates with light absorptivity we are unaware however of any reports in the literature regarding models for predicting dbp formation that use cdom a 440 as a proxy the results of this study demonstrated strong correlations between a 440 and thmufc di haaufc and tri haaufc indicating that cdom can serve as a predictor of dbp formation this has important implications for the use of satellite remote sensing to assess the suitability and treatability of surface waters as potential drinking water sources unfortunately mono haaufc did not correlate strongly with a 440 indicating that a 440 alone may not be adequate for predicting mono haa formation in source waters total haa5 however is reasonably well predicted using a 440 r2 0 85 fig s7a because mono haaufc accounted for less than 26 of the total haa5 pool thus using this correlation between a 440 and haa5 for haaufc mapping is possible despite the issues with mono haa cdom is a reasonably good predictor of the formation of regulated dbps upon chlorination 4 2 dbp formation and correlations with uv254 and doc reported values for thmufc and haaufc typically range from 3 to 388 μg l but values as high as 1300 μg l have been observed in a few cases white et al 2003 zeng and arnold 2013 additionally values for thm and haa formation potentials thmfp and haafp ranging from 20 to 450 μg l have been reported bougeard et al 2010 gang et al 2002 hua and reckhow 2007 lee et al 2007 summers et al 1996 zhao et al 2016 dbpfp is expected to be greater than dbpufc due to the higher chlorine doses and longer contact times in the formation potential test reported chlorine demand values also exhibit a wide range 2 0 108 mg cl2 l gang et al 2002 zeng and arnold 2013 zhao et al 2016 the chlorine demand and dbpufc values determined in the present study fall into the above reported ranges with the exception of a few waters containing doc concentrations that were much greater than surface waters routinely used as drinking water supplies including south sturgeon lake lake vermilion pike bay and lake of the woods muskeg bay when the results were normalized to doc to obtain specific chlorine demand and specific dbpufc values from the present study specific chlorine demand 0 56 0 01 to 1 70 0 01 mg cl2 mg c specific thmufc 15 9 0 95 to 55 9 0 10 μg mg c specific haaufc 7 22 2 98 to 76 0 2 19 μg mg c were comparable with previously published values specific chlorine demand 0 5 1 8 mg cl2 mg c specific dbpufc 2 5 106 μg mg c previously reported correlations of chlorine demand and dbp formation potential with doc uv254 and suva254 were summarized table s6 to allow comparison with our findings the slope of chlorine demand versus doc in the present study 1 75 0 06 mg cl2 mg c was greater than previously published values 0 56 1 05 mg cl2 mg c gang et al 2002 zeng and arnold 2013 the slope of the thmufc versus doc plot in the present study 52 5 3 67 μg mg c was also somewhat greater than values reported for raw waters 30 36 μg mg c gang et al 2002 summers et al 1996 but much greater than that for treated coagulation filtration ozone gac waters 0 038 μg mg c bougeard et al 2010 the slope of haaufc versus uv254 observed in the present study was similar to previously reported values the slope of haaufc versus doc in the present study however was greater than previously reported values which is likely due to the different dbp precursors present in the tested waters thus it appears that organic matter in the lakes of this study was often more reactive with free chlorine than those in previous investigations nevertheless other differences in experimental conditions such as chlorine contact time ph or water temperature also could have played a role in the observed differences in specific chlorine demand and specific dbpufc 4 3 factors affecting dbp formation previous research has suggested that the hydrophobic or aromatic fractions of dom are primarily responsible for the formation of thms and haas bond et al 2012 kitis et al 2002 pan and zhang 2013 zhai and zhang 2011 for example humic substances i e fulvic and humic acids generally representing the major fraction of dom in surface waters are the main thm and haa precursors leenheer and croué 2003 reckhow and singer 1985 specifically 1 3 dihydroxybenzene structures as phenolic aromatic moieties preferentially generate thms rook 1977 phenolic groups also are important tcaa precursors bond et al 2009 dickenson et al 2008 earlier research on chlorination of dom fractions isolated from whole water samples indicated that dcaa precursors are more hydrophilic and lower in mw than tcaa precursors hua and reckhow 2007 kanokkantapong et al 2006 liang and singer 2003 and aliphatic β dicarbonyl moieties are key precursors in dcaa formation bond et al 2009 bull et al 2006 chang et al 2006 dickenson et al 2008 likewise suva was an effective predictor for specific thms and tri haaufc in our study suggesting that aromatic structures such as phenolic groups are the primary precursor of thms and tri haas singer et al 2002 the weaker relationship observed between suva and specific di haaufc indicated that the di haa precursors are less aromatic and aliphatic carbon may play a more important role in their formation than in that of tri haas suva was shown to be a poor indicator of mono haa formation suggesting that non humic substances are important precursors of mono haas our findings lend further support to the finding that the mono di and tri haas have different precursors and formation mechanisms upon chlorination besides the nature and concentrations of dom the underlying causes of differences in speciation of dbps in different waters could also include bromide ion concentration chlorine dose and chlorination conditions e g ph contact time panyapinyopol et al 2005 symons et al 1996 xie et al 2006 zhao et al 2006 bromide concentrations above 0 1 mg l trigger concern about brominated dbp formation zhang et al 2011 due to the formation of hobr and its ability to react with dbp precursors in our study bromide was lod in most lakes with a maximum of 0 066 mg l in lake vermilion pike bay effectively limiting the generation of brominated dbps in addition previous publications have shown that ph affects haa and thm formation in opposite ways thm formation increases with increasing ph but haa formation decreases with increasing ph singer et al 1995 4 4 implications for use of satellite remote sensing for assessment of water treatability the generally strong correlations between cdom and chlorine demand or dbpufc suggests that satellite remote sensing is a useful technology for assessing the treatability of low to moderately colored surface waters with regard to chlorine demand and dbp formation furthermore it might be possible to elucidate long term trends in surface water treatability measures impacted by cdom such as chlorine demand using historical landsat imagery satellite remote sensing could also prove valuable in assessing other water treatability metrics such as coagulant demand and membrane fouling if the metrics are strongly linked to cdom levels dbpufc values for two highly colored waters computed from satellite assessed cdom values however were severely underestimated high cdom a 440 11 m 1 results in strong light absorption with very little reflected light reaching the satellite sensors the resulting weak signal leads to substantial errors in predicted cdom to date most investigations on satellite remote sensing have focused on cdom levels up to 10 m 1 kutser et al 2005a 2005b olmanson et al 2016 however reported models that considered lakes with high cdom levels a 440 up to 18 m 1 the models showed an increase in uncertainty at higher a 440 which is consistent with our results in addition other factors such as interference from suspended solids could also affect satellite cdom values hence our approach for assessing dbpufc from satellite imagery should be used with caution for high cdom and optically complex waters the chlorine demand and dbp formation experiments in this study were performed on raw lake water samples and the maps created reflect these raw water values certainly the characteristics of organic matter and specific precursors present in the raw waters in this study will differ from treated waters that have undergone organic matter removal via coagulation flocculation coagulation processes can remove 50 or more of the doc with even greater reductions in uv254 suggesting that coagulation preferentially removes higher mw and more aromatic dom chowdhury et al 2009 further the removal of dom increases the bromide to organic carbon ratio which can shift the distribution of dbps toward more brominated species chowdhury et al 2009 filtered but untreated surface waters were used in our ufc tests because models have been developed to relate cdom to light reflectance values from lake surfaces obtained by satellites thus maps showing predictions of minnesota lakes likely to meet dbp mcls were prepared assuming various levels of precursor removal 25 50 and 75 that could be obtained with conventional treatment or enhanced coagulation the resulting state wide assessments suggested that a very low percentage of minnesota lakes especially in the heavily forested nlf ecoregion would meet both thm and haa mcls unless aggressive pre disinfection treatment was done to remove at least 75 of dbp precursors finally another potential limitation of this work is that satellites are measuring near surface parameters while water utilities often withdraw water from greater depths such as below the thermocline in stratified lakes the effect of this discrepancy in where measurements are made in the water body and where the water is withdrawn on predictions of cdom and cdom related parameters is uncertain but believed to be relatively minor compared to other water quality parameters that exhibit strong depth dependence such as chlorophyll a vertical profiles of cdom in a few colored minnesota lakes showed small to moderate changes with depth brezonik et al 2019 5 conclusions twenty four surface water samples were collected throughout minnesota usa with wide ranging values of cdom a 440 0 41 27 9 m 1 dissolved organic carbon doc 5 5 47 6 mg l and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 1 3 5 1 l mg m laboratory experiments were performed to quantify chlorine demand and the formation of two classes of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas using the uniform formation conditions ufc test the correlations relating chlorine demand and dbpufc values with cdom were coupled with satellite cdom assessments to estimate chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc values for all surface waters larger than 0 05 km2 in the state of minnesota usa the main conclusions from this work are as follows chlorine demand and thmufc correlated linearly with cdom a 440 and di and tri haaufc correlated logarithmically with cdom when all sampled waters were considered for low to moderately colored waters a 440 11 m 1 a linear relationship provided a good fit r2 0 73 for all of these cases and a moderate fit r2 0 46 for mono haaufc versus cdom thus cdom a 440 appears to be an effective predictor of chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc cdom a 440 chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc did not correlate with conventional water quality indicators including tss and chlorophyll a for highly colored surface waters a 440 11 m 1 cdom and dbpufc values were substantially underestimated from the satellite data due to various factors including strong absorption of incident light resulting in a weak signal received by the satellite sensors overall the results demonstrate that satellite remote sensing could be a useful tool for assessing water treatability metrics like chlorine demand and dbp formation especially for low to

18522,the ability of satellites to assess surface water quality indicators such as colored dissolved organic matter cdom suggests that remote sensing could be a useful tool for evaluating water treatability metrics in considering potential drinking water supplies to explore this possibility 24 surface water samples were collected throughout minnesota usa with wide ranging values of cdom a 440 0 41 27 9 m 1 dissolved organic carbon doc 5 5 47 6 mg l and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 1 3 5 1 l mg m laboratory experiments were performed to quantify chlorine demand and the formation of two classes of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas using the uniform formation conditions ufc test chlorine demand and thmufc were linearly correlated with cdom r2 0 97 and 0 91 respectively indicating that cdom is a useful predictor of these parameters on the other hand data comparing di and tri haaufc with cdom were better fit by a logarithmic relationship r2 0 73 and 0 87 respectively while mono haaufc was linearly correlated with cdom r2 0 46 but only for low to moderately colored waters a 440 11 m 1 the correlations relating chlorine demand and dbpufc values with cdom were coupled with satellite cdom assessments to estimate chlorine demand and dbpufc values for all surface waters larger than 0 05 km2 in the state of minnesota usa the resulting maps suggest that only 21 8 of minnesota lakes would meet both the thm and haa maximum contaminant levels but only when pre disinfection treatment removes 75 of dbp precursors there are limitations to determining cdom using satellites for high color surface waters a 440 11 m 1 however leading to underpredicted values for cdom chlorine demand and dbpufc overall the results demonstrate the potential benefits of satellite remote sensing for assessing potential drinking water sources and water treatability metrics graphical abstract image 1 keywords colored dissolved organic matter disinfection byproducts chlorine demand satellite remote sensing surface water quality drinking water source 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom originates primarily from two natural sources production by aquatic organisms autochthonous and leaching of decaying terrestrial plant matter allochthonous thurman 2012 dom is also derived from anthropogenic sources such as wastewater effluent and agricultural and urban runoff colored dissolved organic matter cdom is the portion of dom that absorbs light at a specific wavelength commonly 420 or 440 nm for freshwaters and 412 nm for marine waters brezonik et al 2015 cdom is primarily composed of humic and fulvic acids that contain abundant unsaturated carbon carbon bonds including aromatic moieties which are known to absorb light in the ultraviolet uv and visible wavelength ranges del castillo and miller 2008 shank et al 2005 cdom is a major water quality driver because of its ability to mobilize metals mcknight and bencala 1990 and hydrophobic chemicals act as a photosensitizer for aquatic photochemistry gerecke et al 2001 and control aquatic ecosystem processes e g decrease light penetration houser 2006 sommaruga 2001 thrane et al 2014 although not directly harmful to human health dom in source waters including the cdom fraction can have negative effects on the cost and effectiveness of water treatment operations and the finished water quality it increases the consumption of water treatment chemicals such as coagulants sharp et al 2006 and fouls membranes used for filtration zularisam et al 2006 furthermore it reacts with chemical disinfectants such as free chlorine leading to the formation of potentially toxic disinfection byproducts dbps beggs et al 2009 bellar et al 1974 eikebrokk et al 2004 herzsprung et al 2012 ledesma et al 2012 sedlak and von gunten 2011 thus cdom plays a critical role in affecting both the chemistry of surface waters and their potential use as drinking water supplies the dom content of surface waters is usually obtained by grab sampling and subsequent laboratory measurement of the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration using a carbon analyzer or the uv visible light absorbance using a spectrophotometer using such a sampling methodology to monitor dom in large numbers of surface water bodies on a regular e g monthly basis would be tedious and cost prohibitive fortunately investigations over the past 15 years have demonstrated the feasibility and practicality of using satellite remote sensing to measure cdom in surface waters chen et al 2017 del castillo and miller 2008 fichot et al 2015 olmanson et al 2016 spyrakos et al 2018 xie et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 by correlating measured cdom to satellite reflectance models can be developed for retrieving cdom from publicly available satellite imagery such imagery from satellite sensors such as the landsat series provide global coverage going back to 1972 potentially permitting researchers to quantify cdom distributions and variability across long time periods and broad regional scales kutser 2012 moreover cdom typically is closely correlated with doc in lakes and rivers griffin et al 2018 and thus the use of cdom as a proxy of doc for assessment of water treatability has important practical advantages over other water quality parameters because cdom can be obtained via satellite remote sensing and is associated with humic substances that are known to have significant impacts on drinking water processes given the importance of dom in terms of water treatability many researchers have developed empirical models that relate dom content as doc uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 or specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 to various measures of water treatability including chlorine demand abdullah et al 2009 yee et al 2006 dbp formation amy et al 1998 chang et al 1996 rodriguez et al 2000 sohn et al 2004 watson et al 1993 coagulant consumption van leeuwen et al 2005 yang et al 2010 and membrane fouling li and chen 2004 liang et al 2006 such models are useful for process control because they permit important treatment concerns such as water treatment chemical demand and dbp formation to be predicted using parameters such as doc and uv254 that can be measured in near real time at a given location brinkman and hozalski 2011 we are unaware of any water treatability models that consider cdom as a predictive variable developing models that consider cdom as a variable instead of doc or uv254 would enable the use of satellite remote sensing to assess potential water supplies and monitor the treatability of existing surface water supplies the objective of this study was to develop relationships between cdom and two measures of water treatability chlorine demand and dbp formation a focus of this study was to compare trends for different classes of dbps surface water samples were collected from 24 locations in 20 lakes and 1 river throughout minnesota and the formation of two regulated dbp classes thms and haas upon chlorination was measured following the uniform formation conditions ufc test summers et al 1996 the relationships between cdom doc uv vis absorbance and suva values for the water samples and their measured chlorine demand and dbp formation potentials thms mono di and tri haas were determined the resulting models were coupled with landsat derived cdom measurements to create statewide chlorine demand and dbpufc maps of minnesota s lakes and rivers to demonstrate the possible use of satellite remote sensing for rapid large scale assessments of water treatability 2 methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a table of the chemicals used and their purities and suppliers is provided in the supplementary material table s1 all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm resistivity millipore 2 2 lake water sampling surface water samples were collected from 24 locations 20 lakes and 1 river lake vermilion lake of the woods and upper red lake were sampled twice in different locations in four large ecoregions of minnesota usa the northern lakes and forests nlf 15 lakes the north central hardwood forests nchf 4 lakes the northern minnesota wetlands nmw 4 lakes and the western corn belt plains wcbp 1 lake fig s1 the adjacent nchf and wcbp ecoregions were combined into a single category nchf wcbp because there was only one lake representing the wcbp and very little of its watershed is within the wcbp the water samples were collected during the summer of 2016 and represent a subset of 412 samples collected from 299 locations mostly lakes across the upper midwest states of minnesota wisconsin and michigan between 2014 and 2016 for analysis of cdom and other water quality parameters griffin et al 2018 the 24 water samples included in this investigation were selected to provide geographic diversity and a wide range of cdom water samples typically were collected from a boat canoe or kayak at least 100 m from shore and within 1 m of the water surface by submerging acid washed and triple rinsed polycarbonate or high density polyethylene hdpe containers to arm s length and then removing the cap gps coordinates of the sampling locations are provided in table s2 water samples for subsequent chlorine demand and dbp testing were filtered within a few hours of collection by pumping from the collection containers through 0 45 μm geotech high capacity capsule filters into clean containers aliquots of the filtered water for subsequent uv visible light scans and doc analysis were placed into separate pre ashed 40 ml amber glass vials with the latter acidified to ph 2 using 2 m hcl all water samples were stored in the dark under refrigeration until further use chlorophyll a was isolated from lake water samples by vacuum filtering onto 0 22 μm cellulose nitrate filters and stored frozen until analysis 2 3 chlorine demand and dbp formation testing the chlorine demand of each water sample was determined by adding a stock solution of sodium hypochlorite naocl with 10 available chlorine at three different doses cl2 doc ratios of 1 1 1 7 1 and 2 1 and measuring the residual concentration after incubating for 24 h at room temperature the chlorine dose for subsequent ufc testing was selected to yield a free chlorine residual of 1 0 0 4 mg cl2 l at the end of incubation all glassware used in the chlorine demand and ufc experiments was cleaned by soaking in a concentrated hydrochloric acid bath 10 for 24 h rinsing with ultrapure water and then baking at 550 c for at least 6 h for ufc testing triplicate aliquots of each water sample were dosed with 2 ml l borate buffer 1 0 m boric acid and 0 26 m sodium hydroxide ph 8 0 and adjusted to ph 8 0 0 2 using 1 0 m sulfuric acid or 1 0 m sodium hydroxide after an incubation time of 24 h in the dark at 20 1 c the chlorine residual was determined to ensure that it was within the required range samples outside the desired range were discarded and the test repeated with the chlorine dose adjusted as necessary the chlorine residual was then quenched with na2so3 prior to extraction and analysis of dbps 2 4 analytical methods doc was measured using a shimadzu toc l csn analyzer after sparging the acidified samples with nitrogen gas uv vis absorbance a scans from 200 to 800 nm were obtained using a shimadzu 1601uv pc dual beam spectrophotometer and 1 or 5 cm quartz cells cdom was calculated as the napierian absorption coefficient at 440 nm a 440 using the following equation 1 a 440 m 1 2 303 a 440 l where a 440 is the absorbance at 440 nm and l is the path length m specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by normalizing the absorbance at 254 nm uv254 to the doc concentration spectral slopes s275 295 and s350 400 were computed by fitting a linear regression to the natural logarithm of absorbance between the wavelength 275 295 and 350 400 nm respectively chlorophyll a chl a was determined using a standard fluorometric method method 10200h eaton et al 2005 total suspended solids tss was obtained by filtering lake water through a pre ashed 47 mm whatman gf f filter and normalizing the mass of dry residue by the volume of lake water filtered bromide concentration was determined via ion chromatography free chlorine was

were calculated by normalizing chlorine demand thmufc or haaufc to the doc concentration 2 5 data analysis and mapping cdom maps of minnesota were created using an empirical model developed from landsat 8 oli surface reflectance sr level 2 products from the earth resources observation and science eros center the model was derived by step wise regression to relate cdom a 440 data from 194 in situ measurements with corresponding spectral radiometric data from four paths of clear landsat 8 imagery from 2015 to 2016 the two variable model used two band ratios oli3 oli4 green red and oli4 oli5 red near infrared 2 ln a 440 5 478 oli3 oli4 0 633 oli4 oli5 8 135 and had an r2 of 0 77 and root mean square error rmse of 0 624 m 1 this model was applied to 2016 clear landsat 8 imagery with a few 2017 images to fill in areas not available in the 2016 imagery due to cloud cover these areas were in western minnesota and included portions of the lake of the woods and the red lakes which are among minnesota s largest lakes image processing was conducted using erdas imagine software maps produced from multiple landsat images were mosaicked to create the final statewide cdom map for minnesota the resulting pixel level cdom maps together with experimentally obtained correlations either pearson for linear or linest for non linear using microsoft excel between chlorine demand and a 440 thmufc and a 440 and haaufc and a 440 were used to create state wide maps for chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc 3 results 3 1 characteristics of lake waters the water quality parameter values for

the measured dom parameters a 440 doc uv254 and suva254 are shown in fig 1 doc and uv254 correlated linearly with a 440 across the entire data range r2 0 93 and 0 98 respectively the slopes and r2 values for the pearson correlations were similar when excluding three sampling sites with very high a 440 values south sturgeon lake lake vermilion pike bay and upper red lake 2 data not shown for suva254 the greatest correlation coefficient values were obtained for linear regressions with log a 440 r2 0 88 and log doc r2 0 78 a 440 did not correlate with other water quality indicators r2 0 18 and p 0 05 including ph tss chlorophyll a and bromide table s2 spectral slopes were computed from plots of the natural logarithm of absorbance vs wavelength over the range 250 450 nm for each water sample fig s2 spectral slopes s275 295 among the water samples ranged from 0 013 to 0 028 nm 1 but samples with visible color i e a 440 3 m 1 had a narrow range of s275 295 0 013 0 018 nm 1 s350 400 also showed small variation ranging from 0 015 to 0 020 nm 1 except for mille lacs lake low a 440 which had a s350 400 of 0 009 nm 1 the results indicated that the optical properties of a 440 from moderate to high a 440 waters are consistent across a large geographic range 3 2 chlorine demand chlorine demand values mean standard deviation for the 24 samples table s3 ranged from 3 68 0 10 to 72 0 0 17 mg cl2 l with a mean of 14 9 mg cl2 l and a median of 8 58 mg cl2 l in addition the specific chlorine demand ranged from 0 56 0 01 to 1 70 0 01 mg cl2 mg c and the mean and median specific chlorine demand were 0 97 and 0 85 mg cl2 mg c respectively chlorine demand exhibited a strong linear correlation with a 440 r2 0 97 slope 2 18 m mg cl2 l doc r2 0 98 slope 1 75 mg cl2 mg c and uv254 r2 0 99 slope 0 35 m mg cl2 l fig 2 indicating that all three parameters are useful predictors of chlorine demand for the lakes the slopes and r2 values remained similar when the three lakes with very high a 440 values were excluded from the regressions data not shown in addition the organic carbon normalized specific chlorine demand correlated linearly with suva254 r2 0 84 slope 0 28 m mg cl2 l 3 3 dbp formation a wide range of dbpufc values was found for the 24 waters table s3 south sturgeon lake lake vermilion pike bay and lake of the woods muskeg bay which had the highest doc levels generated the maximum values for both thmufc and haaufc the only thms observed as chlorination products were tcm and bdcm fig s3a although a few lakes contained bromide at concentrations exceeding the lod tcm was the dominant thm species formed in all samples with mass concentration corresponding to 80 of the total thms the observed thmufc values ranged from 104 16 9 to 2019 3 73 μg l and the mean thmufc 421 μg l was much greater than the median thmufc 264 μg l in contrast specific thmufc values ranged from 15 9 0 95 to 55 9 0 10 μg mg c with comparable mean and median values 29 8 and 27 5 μg mg c respectively five haa species mcaa mbaa dcaa tcaa bdcaa were detected after chlorine dosing fig s3b in general the total haaufc values were comparable to the total thmufc values table s3 although south sturgeon lake had the maximum haaufc 1366 103 μg l lake of the woods fourmile bay had the highest specific haaufc 76 0 2 19 μg mg c the lowest haaufc 47 0 19 4 μg l and specific haaufc 7 22 2 98 μg mg c were obtained for island lake the mean haaufc was 469 μg l which is greater than the median value 363 μg l while the average specific haaufc 35 1 μg mg c was similar to the median value 32 0 μg mg c distributions of haas were sorted into mono di and tri haa species table s4 because each group apparently is formed from distinct precursors and chemical pathways chellam and krasner 2001 consistent with many previous studies andrews et al 2005 krasner et al 2006 nuckols et al 2001 the dominant haa species were dcaa and tcaa accounting for 74 6 11 1 of the haa5 pool by mass followed by mcaa mbaa and bdcaa were detected but never exceeded 1 of the total haa5 pool data not shown 3 4 correlations between dbp formation and cdom thmufc exhibited a strong linear correlation with a 440 r2 0 91 slope 52 5 m μg l fig 3 a indicating that cdom a 440 is a useful predictor of thm yields considering only the 21 waters with a 440 below 9 m 1 the r2 decreased slightly r2 0 84 but the slope increased to 62 5 m μg l regression analyses on the formation potentials of tri di and mono haas fig 3b d in relation to a 440 showed different trends than the thmufc a 440 relationship tri haaufc correlated linearly with a 440 r2 0 87 for low to moderately colored waters a 440 11 m 1 but logarithmically when the entire data set was considered the relationship between di haaufc and a 440 was similar but with a lower slope in the low to moderately colored lake waters r2 0 73 slope 25 7 m μg l mono haaufc on the other hand exhibited a relatively weak correlation with a 440 with a linear correlation only observed for low to moderately colored waters r2 0 46 slope 16 7 m μg l overall these results agree with previous reports bond et al 2009 bull et al 2006 chang et al 2006 dickenson et al 2008 hua and reckhow 2007 kanokkantapong et al 2006 kraus et al 2010 liang and singer 2003 that suggest the three classes of haa species are formed from different precursors see below 3 5 correlations between dbp formation and doc or uv absorbance doc and uv254 have been widely used as surrogate parameters to predict dbp formation chowdhury et al 2009 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 given the linear relationships between uv254 and a 440 and between doc and a 440 fig 1 it is not surprising that the strength of correlations between thmufc di and tri haaufc and doc fig s4 or uv254 fig s5 were similar to those for a 440 thmufc exhibited a relatively strong linear relationship with doc r2 0 84 slope 40 3 μg mgc and uv254 r2 0 91 slope 8 21 m μg l di and tri haaufc relationships with doc and uv254 however were best fit by logarithmic relationships r2 0 87 and 0 73 respectively for doc and r2 0 91 and 0 82 respectively for uv254 when considering only the low to moderately colored lake waters di and tri haaufc increased linearly with increasing doc r2 0 67 and 0 66 respectively and uv254 r2 0 90 and 0 83 respectively these results support the conclusion from previous studies that uv254 serves as a slightly better predictor of dbp formation than doc concentration edzwald et al 1985 najm et al 1994 mono haaufc correlated poorly with doc and uv254 when all data were considered but a stronger correlation was found for low to moderately colored waters r2 0 69 slope 15 8 μg mg c for doc fig s4d r2 0 58 slope 2 73 m μg l fig s5d for uv254 3 6 correlations between specific dbp formation and suva suva is often used as a proxy for the hydrophobicity molecular weight mw and aromaticity of dom dickenson et al 2008 hua and reckhow 2007 singer et al 2002 doc normalized or specific thmufc and tri haaufc exhibited relatively strong linear correlations with suva r2 0 67 and 0 65 respectively slope 7 57 and 8 17 m μg l respectively fig s6 suggesting that these dbps are formed from uv absorbing organic matter i e humic substances conversely relatively weak correlations were observed between suva and specific mono and di haaufc in addition when lakes with suva exceeding 3 l mg m were considered the mono haa yields started to decrease with increasing suva fig s6d these results imply that low uv absorbing organic matter i e non humic substances contributed substantially to formation of mono and di haa species 3 7 chlorine demand and dbpufc mapping using a 440 data from satellite imagery and the correlations between chlorine demand and a 440 fig 2 thmufc and a 440 fig 3 and haaufc and a 440 fig s7 state wide maps for chlorine demand and dbp formation potentials were produced the map for thmufc fig 4 shows relatively high levels of thmufc 400 μg l in lakes of northeastern minnesota especially within the nlf ecoregion this result is not surprising as most minnesota lakes with a 440 3 m 1 are located in the nlf ecoregion lower thmufc values are predicted for the nchf nmw and wcbp ecoregions and most lakes in these three ecoregions are relatively low in color consistent with the thmufc results nlf lakes generally have higher levels of haaufc 480 μg l fig s8 and chlorine demand 5 mgcl2 l fig s9 the distribution of dbpufc levels in the four ecoregions clearly reflected their current distributions of forested urban and agricultural land uses for example the nlf ecoregion is extensively forested with large areas of wetlands and open water undeveloped land covers 89 of the nlf ecoregion in contrast almost half of the nchf ecoregion is cultivated with forests and wetlands only making up 35 of land cover brezonik et al 2019 the wcbp ecoregion is dominated by agricultural use 83 of land cover but also contains some open grassland brezonik et al 2019 comparisons of values of cdom chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc estimated from satellite imagery versus experimentally measured values are shown in fig 5 the estimated values represent an average of the grid cell containing the physical sampling location and the neighboring cells for lakes with cdom values less than 10 m 1 the plotted values for all parameters lie close to the 1 1 line fig 5a indicating that satellite remote sensing is capable of accurate assessing cdom and cdom associated parameters such as thmufc in low to moderately colored waters the agreement was poor however for two lakes with very high cdom levels a 440 20 m 1 i e south sturgeon lake and lake vermilion pike bay as the estimated cdom chlorine demand and dbpufc values were substantially less than the corresponding experimentally measured values fig 5a d in addition negative haaufc values were obtained for six low cdom a 440 2 5 m 1 sampling sites fig 5d the latter results suggest that estimation of haaufc using satellite remote sensing can be problematic for waters with very low color based on the usepa stage 1 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rule maximum contaminant levels for thm4 and haa5 are 80 μg l and 60 μg l respectively as our dbpufc values are for raw lake water lake averaged cdom values from the statewide cdom mapping were used to estimate the percentage of lakes that would violate either or both abovementioned mcls by assuming three potential levels of dbp precursor removal 25 poor removal 50 conventional treatment and 75 enhanced coagulation fig 6 and table s7 consequently thm4 concentrations in raw waters would be limited to 107 160 and 320 μg l respectively while for haa5 the limits would be 80 120 and 240 μg l respectively none of minnesota s lakes n 11 690 would be expected to meet the thm4 mcl assuming 25 precursor removal but 62 4 of minnesota lakes would meet the mcl assuming 75 precursor removal the percentage of minnesota lakes that would be expected to meet the haa5 mcl assuming 25 precursor removal was only 11 3 but increased to 21 8 for 75 removal finally the percentage of minnesota lakes that would be expected to meet both dbp mcls was only 21 8 for 75 precursor removal it is important to note however that this estimation considered only the number of lakes and not lake area or volume referring to the maps showing the distribution of dbpufc levels fig 4 and fig s9 most lakes in some regions of minnesota such as the northeast are not likely to be useful as drinking water sources because of their high color and potential to form high levels of dbps even when reasonable precursor removals are assumed 4 discussion 4 1 cdom as a predictor of chlorine demand dbp formation historically predictive models for dbp formation include parameters such as doc uv254 and suva254 which are commonly used surrogates for dom quantity and composition chowdhury et al 2009 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 other parameters include ph water temperature chlorine dose and reaction time most modeling efforts have focused on thm formation with considerably less work on haa formation chowdhury et al 2009 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 for example singer and chang 1989 developed linear relationships between thm formation and uv254 other researchers have developed multivariate models to relate dbp concentrations to a combination of doc and other variables including water temperature bromide level chlorine dose and contact time amy et al 1987 sérodes et al 2003 such empirical models often have limited applicability given the narrow range of water qualities used for model development doc is a broad indicator of the concentration of dom whereas uv254 represents specific structural characteristics and functional groups croue et al 2000 edzwald et al 1985 suva254 provides a relative proxy for the aromaticity of dom and as a result its feasibility at predicting dbp formation highly depends on the relative importance of aromatic dom in reacting with chlorine to form dbps unfortunately neither doc nor uv254 can be obtained directly from satellite observations although uv254 is an optical property that provides a sensitive measure of dom content uv irradiation is so strongly absorbed by the earth s atmosphere that very little is reflected back to orbiting satellites cdom a 440 in contrast is readily obtained from satellite observations because light in the visible and longer wavelength ranges is not as strongly absorbed by the atmosphere yet is sufficiently absorbed by cdom to result in predictable shifts in the reflectance spectra cdom in the limnology literature refers to the color or light absorptivity of dissolved substances in water which has implications for growth of phytoplankton and submerged vegetation gallegos 2001 geider 1987 lake trophic status brezonik et al 2005 and biogeochemical cycling of elements zepp et al 2007 as such cdom is an important variable affecting lake and river ecology the color of drinking water is important as an aesthetic parameter with a color maximum of 15 mg pt l as measured by the cobalt platinum method in the usa epa 2018 and generally correlates with light absorptivity we are unaware however of any reports in the literature regarding models for predicting dbp formation that use cdom a 440 as a proxy the results of this study demonstrated strong correlations between a 440 and thmufc di haaufc and tri haaufc indicating that cdom can serve as a predictor of dbp formation this has important implications for the use of satellite remote sensing to assess the suitability and treatability of surface waters as potential drinking water sources unfortunately mono haaufc did not correlate strongly with a 440 indicating that a 440 alone may not be adequate for predicting mono haa formation in source waters total haa5 however is reasonably well predicted using a 440 r2 0 85 fig s7a because mono haaufc accounted for less than 26 of the total haa5 pool thus using this correlation between a 440 and haa5 for haaufc mapping is possible despite the issues with mono haa cdom is a reasonably good predictor of the formation of regulated dbps upon chlorination 4 2 dbp formation and correlations with uv254 and doc reported values for thmufc and haaufc typically range from 3 to 388 μg l but values as high as 1300 μg l have been observed in a few cases white et al 2003 zeng and arnold 2013 additionally values for thm and haa formation potentials thmfp and haafp ranging from 20 to 450 μg l have been reported bougeard et al 2010 gang et al 2002 hua and reckhow 2007 lee et al 2007 summers et al 1996 zhao et al 2016 dbpfp is expected to be greater than dbpufc due to the higher chlorine doses and longer contact times in the formation potential test reported chlorine demand values also exhibit a wide range 2 0 108 mg cl2 l gang et al 2002 zeng and arnold 2013 zhao et al 2016 the chlorine demand and dbpufc values determined in the present study fall into the above reported ranges with the exception of a few waters containing doc concentrations that were much greater than surface waters routinely used as drinking water supplies including south sturgeon lake lake vermilion pike bay and lake of the woods muskeg bay when the results were normalized to doc to obtain specific chlorine demand and specific dbpufc values from the present study specific chlorine demand 0 56 0 01 to 1 70 0 01 mg cl2 mg c specific thmufc 15 9 0 95 to 55 9 0 10 μg mg c specific haaufc 7 22 2 98 to 76 0 2 19 μg mg c were comparable with previously published values specific chlorine demand 0 5 1 8 mg cl2 mg c specific dbpufc 2 5 106 μg mg c previously reported correlations of chlorine demand and dbp formation potential with doc uv254 and suva254 were summarized table s6 to allow comparison with our findings the slope of chlorine demand versus doc in the present study 1 75 0 06 mg cl2 mg c was greater than previously published values 0 56 1 05 mg cl2 mg c gang et al 2002 zeng and arnold 2013 the slope of the thmufc versus doc plot in the present study 52 5 3 67 μg mg c was also somewhat greater than values reported for raw waters 30 36 μg mg c gang et al 2002 summers et al 1996 but much greater than that for treated coagulation filtration ozone gac waters 0 038 μg mg c bougeard et al 2010 the slope of haaufc versus uv254 observed in the present study was similar to previously reported values the slope of haaufc versus doc in the present study however was greater than previously reported values which is likely due to the different dbp precursors present in the tested waters thus it appears that organic matter in the lakes of this study was often more reactive with free chlorine than those in previous investigations nevertheless other differences in experimental conditions such as chlorine contact time ph or water temperature also could have played a role in the observed differences in specific chlorine demand and specific dbpufc 4 3 factors affecting dbp formation previous research has suggested that the hydrophobic or aromatic fractions of dom are primarily responsible for the formation of thms and haas bond et al 2012 kitis et al 2002 pan and zhang 2013 zhai and zhang 2011 for example humic substances i e fulvic and humic acids generally representing the major fraction of dom in surface waters are the main thm and haa precursors leenheer and croué 2003 reckhow and singer 1985 specifically 1 3 dihydroxybenzene structures as phenolic aromatic moieties preferentially generate thms rook 1977 phenolic groups also are important tcaa precursors bond et al 2009 dickenson et al 2008 earlier research on chlorination of dom fractions isolated from whole water samples indicated that dcaa precursors are more hydrophilic and lower in mw than tcaa precursors hua and reckhow 2007 kanokkantapong et al 2006 liang and singer 2003 and aliphatic β dicarbonyl moieties are key precursors in dcaa formation bond et al 2009 bull et al 2006 chang et al 2006 dickenson et al 2008 likewise suva was an effective predictor for specific thms and tri haaufc in our study suggesting that aromatic structures such as phenolic groups are the primary precursor of thms and tri haas singer et al 2002 the weaker relationship observed between suva and specific di haaufc indicated that the di haa precursors are less aromatic and aliphatic carbon may play a more important role in their formation than in that of tri haas suva was shown to be a poor indicator of mono haa formation suggesting that non humic substances are important precursors of mono haas our findings lend further support to the finding that the mono di and tri haas have different precursors and formation mechanisms upon chlorination besides the nature and concentrations of dom the underlying causes of differences in speciation of dbps in different waters could also include bromide ion concentration chlorine dose and chlorination conditions e g ph contact time panyapinyopol et al 2005 symons et al 1996 xie et al 2006 zhao et al 2006 bromide concentrations above 0 1 mg l trigger concern about brominated dbp formation zhang et al 2011 due to the formation of hobr and its ability to react with dbp precursors in our study bromide was lod in most lakes with a maximum of 0 066 mg l in lake vermilion pike bay effectively limiting the generation of brominated dbps in addition previous publications have shown that ph affects haa and thm formation in opposite ways thm formation increases with increasing ph but haa formation decreases with increasing ph singer et al 1995 4 4 implications for use of satellite remote sensing for assessment of water treatability the generally strong correlations between cdom and chlorine demand or dbpufc suggests that satellite remote sensing is a useful technology for assessing the treatability of low to moderately colored surface waters with regard to chlorine demand and dbp formation furthermore it might be possible to elucidate long term trends in surface water treatability measures impacted by cdom such as chlorine demand using historical landsat imagery satellite remote sensing could also prove valuable in assessing other water treatability metrics such as coagulant demand and membrane fouling if the metrics are strongly linked to cdom levels dbpufc values for two highly colored waters computed from satellite assessed cdom values however were severely underestimated high cdom a 440 11 m 1 results in strong light absorption with very little reflected light reaching the satellite sensors the resulting weak signal leads to substantial errors in predicted cdom to date most investigations on satellite remote sensing have focused on cdom levels up to 10 m 1 kutser et al 2005a 2005b olmanson et al 2016 however reported models that considered lakes with high cdom levels a 440 up to 18 m 1 the models showed an increase in uncertainty at higher a 440 which is consistent with our results in addition other factors such as interference from suspended solids could also affect satellite cdom values hence our approach for assessing dbpufc from satellite imagery should be used with caution for high cdom and optically complex waters the chlorine demand and dbp formation experiments in this study were performed on raw lake water samples and the maps created reflect these raw water values certainly the characteristics of organic matter and specific precursors present in the raw waters in this study will differ from treated waters that have undergone organic matter removal via coagulation flocculation coagulation processes can remove 50 or more of the doc with even greater reductions in uv254 suggesting that coagulation preferentially removes higher mw and more aromatic dom chowdhury et al 2009 further the removal of dom increases the bromide to organic carbon ratio which can shift the distribution of dbps toward more brominated species chowdhury et al 2009 filtered but untreated surface waters were used in our ufc tests because models have been developed to relate cdom to light reflectance values from lake surfaces obtained by satellites thus maps showing predictions of minnesota lakes likely to meet dbp mcls were prepared assuming various levels of precursor removal 25 50 and 75 that could be obtained with conventional treatment or enhanced coagulation the resulting state wide assessments suggested that a very low percentage of minnesota lakes especially in the heavily forested nlf ecoregion would meet both thm and haa mcls unless aggressive pre disinfection treatment was done to remove at least 75 of dbp precursors finally another potential limitation of this work is that satellites are measuring near surface parameters while water utilities often withdraw water from greater depths such as below the thermocline in stratified lakes the effect of this discrepancy in where measurements are made in the water body and where the water is withdrawn on predictions of cdom and cdom related parameters is uncertain but believed to be relatively minor compared to other water quality parameters that exhibit strong depth dependence such as chlorophyll a vertical profiles of cdom in a few colored minnesota lakes showed small to moderate changes with depth brezonik et al 2019 5 conclusions twenty four surface water samples were collected throughout minnesota usa with wide ranging values of cdom a 440 0 41 27 9 m 1 dissolved organic carbon doc 5 5 47 6 mg l and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 1 3 5 1 l mg m laboratory experiments were performed to quantify chlorine demand and the formation of two classes of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas using the uniform formation conditions ufc test the correlations relating chlorine demand and dbpufc values with cdom were coupled with satellite cdom assessments to estimate chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc values for all surface waters larger than 0 05 km2 in the state of minnesota usa the main conclusions from this work are as follows chlorine demand and thmufc correlated linearly with cdom a 440 and di and tri haaufc correlated logarithmically with cdom when all sampled waters were considered for low to moderately colored waters a 440 11 m 1 a linear relationship provided a good fit r2 0 73 for all of these cases and a moderate fit r2 0 46 for mono haaufc versus cdom thus cdom a 440 appears to be an effective predictor of chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc cdom a 440 chlorine demand thmufc and haaufc did not correlate with conventional water quality indicators including tss and chlorophyll a for highly colored surface waters a 440 11 m 1 cdom and dbpufc values were substantially underestimated from the satellite data due to various factors including strong absorption of incident light resulting in a weak signal received by the satellite sensors overall the results demonstrate that satellite remote sensing could be a useful tool for assessing water treatability metrics like chlorine demand and dbp formation especially for low to

18523,smectite clays are widely found in subsurface soils and waters although they strongly sequester tetracyclines tcs little is known about their reactions with these antibiotics under dark anoxic conditions this study investigated the interactions between tcs and fe bearing smectite clays and the influences of environmental factors fe bearing smectite clays were shown to significantly induce the transformation of tcs including tautomerization dechlorination and dehydration moreover the adsorbed tcs reduced the structural fe iii in clay particles to structural fe ii through electron transfer the transformation of tcs was more readily induced by smectite clays with a higher rather than a lower fe content tetrahedral fe iii and distorted cis or trans octahedral fe iii were more reactive as an electron acceptor than cis octahedral fe iii as observed on the mössbauer and ftir spectra a lower ph facilitated the adsorption of tcs through dimethyl amino amide and conjugated oh functional groups and induced a higher rate of tcs transformation the transformation of chlortetracycline ctc was faster than that of oxytetracycline or tetracycline ttc due to cl substitution the major transformation ctc products included keto ctc epi ctc iso ctc anhydro ctc and ttc mixtures of these transformed products were found to have a higher acute toxicity than their parent compounds to

natural waters and sediments their high specific surface areas and cation exchange capacity allow them to retain large amounts of a broad range of organic pollutants in water and soil environments

2004 pils and laird 2007 their results showed that tcs adsorb to clay particles via cationic exchange hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and complexation the type of adsorption is influenced by the structures of the tcs the exchangeable cations of the clays and the ph dependent speciation of the reaction components fig 1 most of studies of tcs have focused on their adsorption under ambient conditions chang et al 2009a 2009b li et al 2010b whereas little is known about the transformation of tcs in subsurface environments however it has been shown that fe3 in aqueous solution enhances tcs

the rapid transformation of tcs in the presence of fe bearing smectite clays in the presence of na nau 2 the transformation of ctc was significantly faster than that of otc or ttc perhaps due to the cl substitution at the c7 position of ctc fig 1 because of the electron withdrawing effect of cl the altered electron density could have resulted in a lower pk a2 of ctc 7 55 than of ttc 7 78 together with the increased solubility and altered orientation of ctc relative to ttc and otc during the adsorption process pils and laird 2007 rubert and pedersen 2006 this would have induced the stronger interaction with clay surfaces of ctc than either ttc or otc the buffer used to maintain the solution ph 10 mm mops had negligible effects on ttc transformation and adsorption at ph 7 9 fig a2a and a2b increasing the solution ph from 5 6 to 8 6 decreased the transformation rate of ttc from 0 30 0 04 h 1 to 0 19 0 02 h 1 consistent with the results of rubert and pedersen 2006 the mechanism for the reduced transformation rate may attribute to the reduction in the fraction of neutral 98 37 6 98 vs negatively charged 1 10 78 40 zwitterions as the ph increased from 5 6 to 8 6 fig 1 this change would have also decreased the adsorption of ttc to clay particles fig a2c 3 2 effects of clay type on ctc transformation because the transformation of ctc was faster than that of otc and ttc it was selected to investigate the effects of the clay type on tcs transformation as seen in fig 2b the total amount of ctc was reduced by 56 8 0 2 44 5 4 6 and 13 1 0 5 within 12 h with the addition of na nau 2 na nau 1 and na saz 2 respectively these results indicated the higher activity of na nau 2 than that of na nau 1 or na saz 2 in catalyzing ctc transformation the specific transformation rate k obs trans fecontent achieved with na nau 2 47 2 14 3 h 1 g 1 was approximately twice as high as that achieved with na nau 1 23 1 2 9 h 1 g 1 these results were consistent with our previous studies chen et al 2018 2019 in which the reactivity of na nau 2 with polyphenols and dissolved oxygen was higher than that of na nau 1 structural fe iii atoms are present in the octahedral sheets of na saz 2 based on its formula table a1 but its structural fe content 0 12 is much lower than that of nau 1 21 2 or nau 2 19 2 however the k obs trans fecontent of na saz 2 131 6 22 7 h 1 g 1 is about three times higher than that of na nau 2 which suggests that elements other than fe were involved in the transformation of ctc chen and huang 2010 xu et al 2018 3 3 characterization for structural fe by mössbauer spectroscopy mössbauer spectra fig 3 were obtained to investigate the structural changes in the fe of na nau 1 or na nau 2 after incubation of these clays with ctc there are three fe iii conformations in na nau 2 tetrahedral fe iii tetfe iii octahedral fe iii 1 octfe iii 1 and octahedral fe iii 2 octfe iii 2 whereas only octfe iii 1 is present in na nau 1 octfe iii 1 has a smaller qs value and based on the quadrupole splitting qs values is considered to be cis octfe iii dyar 1987 gorski et al 2012a 2012b octfe iii 2 with its larger qs value has been designated as cis octfe iii near a tetrahedral fe iii atom or trans octfe iii fig a3 while the presumed conformation of octfe ii is trans octfe ii in this study the peak areas of octfe iii 2 and tetfe iii in the na nau 2 spectrum decreased by 15 4 and 0 8 respectively after incubation of the clay with ctc for 12 h but the peak area of octfe iii 1 increased and new peaks of octfe ii appeared fig 3b and c these results suggested that due to structural rearrangements distorted cis octfe iii or trans octfe iii is either partially reduced to octfe ii or converted to cis octfe iii fig 3c both are more active than cis octfe iii in accepting electrons these results are consistent with those of gorski et al 2012b 2013 and besson et al 1983 although the decrease in the peak area of tetfe iii was only 0 8 it probably had a higher electron acceptor activity than octfe iii because the atoms in its basal planes are exposed to the bulk solution and can complex with tcs directly merola and mcguire 2009 the slight change in the peak area of tetfe iii might have arisen from the reduction of tetfe iii by tcs as observed in a previous study wang et al 2019 no significant change was noted in the spectra of na nau 1 after its incubation with ctc fig 3a which suggests that cis octfe iii is relatively inert as an electron acceptor from tcs 3 4 ftir spectra analyses ftir spectra of na nau 2 before and after its incubation with ctc were obtained to interpret the interactions between them the peaks of pristine na nau 2 at 821 cm 1 and 868 cm 1 were assigned to the hydroxyl deformation vibration δ oh of fe iii fe iii oh and alfe iii oh and the peaks at 3441 cm 1 and 3563 cm 1 to their hydroxyl stretching vibrations ν oh respectively fig 4 a after the incubation of na nau 2 with ctc these peaks red shifted to 818 819 cm 1 856 858 cm 1 3419 3426 cm 1 and 3566 3568 cm 1 respectively which demonstrated the ability of ctc to reduce fe iii fe iii oh thus yielding fe ii fe iii oh chen et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 fig 4b shows the subtracted ftir spectra of adsorbed ctc and the products on the clay surfaces most of the changes related to the products were in the range of 1050 1750 cm 1 the peaks at 1581 cm 1 and 1616 cm 1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of co at the c and a rings respectively these peaks remained at the same positions after the incubation of ctc with na nau 2 which suggested that neither of these co groups was significantly involved in the adsorption and transformation of the tcs li et al 2010a 2010b the unchanged peak of the aromatic cc skeleton vibration at 1457 cm 1 gu and karthikeyan 2005 kulshrestha et al 2004 li et al 2010a 2010b indicated that there was no cation π interaction between the aromatic plane of ctc and the exchangeable cations on the clay surfaces thus ctc was probably adsorbed to the clay surfaces in a tilted rather than a parallel conformation li et al 2010a zhu et al 2003 a finding supported by the xrd results text a9 the d 001 spacings of na nau 2 incubated with 4 mm ctc increased from 1 25 nm to 2 17 nm fig a4 the peaks at 1524 cm 1 and 1673 cm 1 were assigned to nh2 and co of the amide group of ctc fig 4b respectively gu and karthikeyan 2005 li et al 2010b the intensities of these peaks decreased significantly in the subtracted spectrum of adsorbed ctc and its transformation products the peak of c n in the amide group at 1228 cm 1 was also significantly attenuated fig 4b these results indicated strong interactions between the amide groups of ctc and the clay surfaces in the transformation of ctc it was also observed that the peak of the dimethyl amino group at 1357 cm 1 gunasekaran et al 1996 red shifted to 1334 1344 cm 1 and its intensity decreased significantly during the reaction with na nau 2 this result suggests that dimethyl amino groups also participate in the clay mediated transformation of ctc 3 5 proposed transformation products of ctc fifteen major products of ctc transformation were identified on the lc ms ms spectra table 1 fig a5 and text a10 including the products of tautomerization dechlorination dehydration and oxidation table 1 the proportions of three tautomers of ctc keto ctc iso ctc and epi ctc were much higher than those of other products in the reaction system fig a6a the tautomers of iso ctc and keto ctc were detected both in solution and in solid phase while epi ctc was found only in solid phase after a 1 h incubation the amounts of keto ctc epi ctc and iso ctc increased by 12 2 9 3 and 6 7 respectively after 12 h the amounts of keto ctc and epi ctc decreased by 4 2 and 1 9 respectively the amount of iso ctc increased to 7 1 until 2 h slightly decreasing thereafter whereas the amounts of the other major products steadily increased fig a6a the decreasing amounts of keto and epi ctc mainly occurred on clay particles 0 9 3 7 rather than in solution 0 1 0 5 fig a6b and a6c these results indicated that keto ctc and epi ctc were the major tautomers responsible for the subsequent transformations in the presence of na nau 2 anhydro ctc actc was the product of intramolecular dehydration and emerged at ph 7 via the loss of oh at the c6 position and of h at c5 chen and huang 2010 2011 table 1 previous studies reported that the formation of dehydration products is mainly due to surface bound al iii o or fe iii o and occurs by the subtraction of a proton hofstetter et al 2003 pines and haag 1960 tournassat et al 2016 ttc was the dechlorinated product of ctc and it was further dehydrated to form anhydro ttc attc table 1 the dechlorination as a ctc transformation pathway was further evidenced by the increasing cl concentration during the incubation fig 5 a the extraction products i ii iii iv v vi and vii table 1 had molecule ions peaks m z at 495 511 465 467 437 452 and 481 respectively table 1 their formation was attributed to the c n cleavage at dimethylamino groups chen and huang 2011 adsorbed to the clay surfaces via electrostatic forces fig a7b in contrast to the results of chen and huang 2011 our study showed that iso ctc was not the major tautomer contributing to ctc transformation the oxidative transformation of ctc could mainly be attributed to structural fe iii a conclusion supported by the good linear correlation slope 0 92 r 2 0 98 between the amounts of reduced structural fe ii and the amount of total oxidized ctc fig 5b the fraction of total dissolved fe during the incubation was always 0 3 indicating that ctc oxidation occurred mainly on the clay surfaces no dimers or polymers of ctc were observed in this study 3 6 mechanisms of ctc transformation on fe bearing smectite clays as noted above according to the ftir and xrd spectra tcs adsorbed on clay surfaces assumed in a tilted not a parallel conformation chang et al 2009b li et al 2010b after adsorption on clay basal planes or broken edges with fe iii o al iii o ctc was preferentially tautomerized to keto ctc and epi ctc with a smaller amount of iso ctc fig a6a these results were consistent with previous studies halling sørensen et al 2002 mitscher 1978 showing that epi ctc forms in acidic solutions ph 2 6 fig a7a such as in the aqueous environment around the clay surfaces hauser 1945 tournassat et al 2016 whereas iso ctc preferentially forms in alkaline solutions mitscher 1978 and keto ctc at ph 3 9 halling sørensen et al 2002 surface bound or exposed fe iii on the basal planes or at the broken edges of the clay can serve as acid centers to induce ctc transformation although the majority of the fe iii of smectite clays is located in the clay lattices hofstetter et al 2003 neumann et al 2013 the surface active sites may have been gradually occupied or occluded due to the adsorption of ctc and its transformation products which would have slowed subsequent ctc transformation reactions fig 2a additionally as shown in mössbauer spectra the structural fe contained in the clay lattice also contributed to the transformations especially distorted cis octfe iii and trans octfe iii according to the dft calculation the dechlorination of ctc and actc in the presence na nau 2 was thermodynamically feasible the δe values for the transformation of ctc to ttc and actc to attc were 6 27 ev and 7 04 ev respectively the dehydration of ctc to actc and ttc to attc on clay surfaces table 1 was ascribed to the lewis acid sites al o fe o chen and huang 2010 karpov et al 2018 with δe values of 1 82 ev the n ch3 2 at c4 and the oh groups at c3 and c10 of the ctc structure were responsible for the oxidative transformation fig a7b the electron transfer process between adsorbed ctc and structural fe iii may have produced structural fe ii and ctc radical intermediates able to induce the formation of other transformation products via electron delocalization chen and huang 2011 however the hydration of ctc radical intermediates to form products iii v vi and vii was not supported by the dft calculation in this study this result may have been partially due to the simplified computation model in which only one fe was substituted for al in the octahedral sheet of the nontronite supercell such that the oxidation ability of the fe bearing clay would have been underestimated further study is needed to explain the formation of the hydration products detected in our study 3 7 the acute toxicity of tcs transformation products fig a8 shows the acute toxicity of tcs transformation products to p phosphoreum t3 there was no significant difference p 0 05 among the r inhibition values of ctc 26 8 2 2 otc 27 8 0 7 and ttc 27 3 1 4 the extracts of clay particles had no significant influence on the luminescence intensity of p phosphoreum t3 however the r inhibition values of ctc otc and ttc significantly increased to 64 2 2 9 45 7 0 7 and 37 3 2 2 after incubation with na nau 2 for 12 h respectively these results indicated that transformation products of tcs have higher acute toxicity than the parent compounds and more toxic products of ctc produced the highest k obs trans than otc or ttc p 0 05 the higher acute toxicity of transformed products than parent compounds might be contributed by the formed keto epi derivatives and the oxidation products and further study should be conducted to explore the toxicity of these products it has been reported that iso derivatives of tcs have less toxicity to bacteria because of the changed c4 configuration in tcs structure halling sørensen et al 2002 4 conclusions tetracyclines are widely distributed antimicrobials in subsurface soils sediments and groundwater in these environments in the presence of fe bearing smectite clays and the absence of light and or oxygen tcs can be transformed or degraded to form a wide range of compounds our study of the underlying transformation mechanisms showed that tcs adsorbed on clay surfaces tautomerize to keto epi or iso tcs with intramolecular dehydration occurring at al iii o or fe iii o sites in addition electron transfer between tcs and clay particles was shown to induce the dechlorination and oxidation of keto epi ctc and to produce structural fe ii smectite clays with tetfe iii distorted cis octfe iii and trans octfe iii are more active than those containing only cis octfe iii other fe bearing clay minerals such as vermiculite and illites may mediate similar tcs transformation the transformation products of tcs obtained under the conditions of this study had a higher acute toxicity for photobacterium phosphoreum t3 than the parent compounds thus environmental assessment of widely used antibiotics must take into account that the ecological risks of tcs will likely depend on the subsequent reactions of the antibiotics in

18523,smectite clays are widely found in subsurface soils and waters although they strongly sequester tetracyclines tcs little is known about their reactions with these antibiotics under dark anoxic conditions this study investigated the interactions between tcs and fe bearing smectite clays and the influences of environmental factors fe bearing smectite clays were shown to significantly induce the transformation of tcs including tautomerization dechlorination and dehydration moreover the adsorbed tcs reduced the structural fe iii in clay particles to structural fe ii through electron transfer the transformation of tcs was more readily induced by smectite clays with a higher rather than a lower fe content tetrahedral fe iii and distorted cis or trans octahedral fe iii were more reactive as an electron acceptor than cis octahedral fe iii as observed on the mössbauer and ftir spectra a lower ph facilitated the adsorption of tcs through dimethyl amino amide and conjugated oh functional groups and induced a higher rate of tcs transformation the transformation of chlortetracycline ctc was faster than that of oxytetracycline or tetracycline ttc due to cl substitution the major transformation ctc products included keto ctc epi ctc iso ctc anhydro ctc and ttc mixtures of these transformed products were found to have a higher acute toxicity than their parent compounds to photobacterium phosphoreum t3 our study revealed several previously overlooked interactions between tcs and clay particles that could cause these antibiotics to become unstable in the subsurface environment with negative effects on the soil borne microbial community graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlortetracycline electron transfer mössbauer spectrum structural fe photobacterium

sørensen et al 1998 hamscher et al 2002 martinez 2009 in china 6950 metric tons of tcs were used in 2013 zhao et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 while in the usa total annual sales of tcs in 2016 exceeded 5866 metric tons fda 2016 tcs are not completely metabolized after their ingestion either by humans or by animals cheesanford et al 2001 and 30 90 of the parent compounds and their metabolites are excreted into the environment through the urine and feces alcock et al 1999 hamscher et al 2002 jacobsen et al 2004 the excreted compounds are highly hydrophilic logk ow 1 97 to 0 47 kulshrestha et al 2004 thiele bruhn 2003 and thus readily transported into groundwater and subsurface soils via runoff infiltration or wastewater leaching huang et al 2013 smectite clay minerals are commonly found in soils natural waters and sediments their high specific surface areas and cation exchange capacity allow them to retain large amounts of a broad range of organic pollutants in water and soil environments chang et al 2009b gu and karthikeyan 2008 several studies have investigated the adsorption of tcs onto ca2 k saturated clay minerals chen and huang 2010 gu and karthikeyan 2005 2008 kulshrestha et al 2004 pils and laird 2007 their results showed that tcs adsorb to clay particles via cationic exchange hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and complexation the type of adsorption is influenced by the structures of the tcs the exchangeable cations of the clays and the ph dependent speciation of the reaction components fig 1 most of studies of tcs have focused on their adsorption under ambient conditions chang et al 2009a 2009b li et al 2010b whereas little is known about the transformation of tcs in subsurface environments however it has been shown that fe3 in aqueous solution enhances tcs transformation via complexation and oxidation wang et al 2015 2016 the effects of manganese oxides chen and huang 2011 aluminum oxide chen and huang 2010 and smectite clays on the transformation of tcs under sunlight xu et al 2018 have been studied and the ability of surface bound al or mn to provide active sites for the respective reactions was demonstrated however while both tcs and fe bearing clay minerals are widely present in subsurface environments the reactions between them under anoxic dark conditions have largely been ignored fe bearing smectite clays are phyllosilicates with a 2 1 layered structure 2 tetrahedral layers and 1 octahedral layer hillier 2003 the structural fe in smectite clays is active in the degradation of organic contaminants chen et al 2016 2018 2019 elsner et al 2004 melton et al 2014 by serving as an electron donor or acceptor in biotic and abiotic processes shi et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 recently published studies described the transformation of diethyl phthalate trichloroethylene and 1 4 dioxane by fe bearing smectites in the presence of o2 via oh radical formation chen et al 2019 liu et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 whether fe bearing smectite clays are able to react with tcs in the absence of o2 is unclear however this information is important in predicting the fate and toxicity of tcs in subsurface soils and groundwater after complexing with metal ions e g fe3 cu2 in solution chen and huang 2009 wang et al 2016 or with manganese oxides chen and huang 2011 rubert and pedersen 2006 tcs are quickly oxidized structural fe iii in smectite clays is reduced after accepting electrons from organic compounds containing nh2 oh functional groups such as pentachlorophenol anilines and triclosan gu et al 2008 jia et al 2014 polubesova et al 2010 wang et al 2018 because tcs have four combined rings attached with oh n ch3 2 and conh2 chen and huang 2011 karpov et al 2018 the structural fe iii in fe bearing clay minerals is capable of inducing the transformation of tcs but the associated mechanisms and pathways must still be determined the objectives of this study were i to investigate the transformation of tcs in the presence of fe bearing smectite clays ii to identify the underlying mechanisms of electron transfer and the factors that influence the reaction and iii to examine the acute toxicity of the tcs transformation products chlortetracycline ctc oxytetracycline otc and tetracycline ttc were selected as model compounds fig 1 because of their broad usage and thus their widespread distribution in the environment halling

freshly prepared in the dark with 10 mm deoxygenated phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 batch experiments were conducted in 20 ml serum bottles covered with aluminum foil to avoid light the initial concentrations of tcs and clay particles were 20 μm and 5 g l 1 respectively the serum bottles were quickly assembled under anoxic conditions and continuously shaken at 200 rpm using a reciprocating

presence of fe bearing smectite clays the tested tcs were relative stable in solution under dark anoxic condition at ph 7 0 fig 2 a with 0 1 transformed in 12 h however following the addition of na nau 2 the total amounts of ctc otc and ttc fig 2a were reduced by 56 8 0 2 26 5 2 5 and 36 8 0 4 within 12 h respectively indicating the transformation of these compounds the kinetics of tcs transformation well fit a pseudo first order model the estimated transformation rates k obs trans details in text a3 were 0 45 0 06 h 1 0 10 0 02 h 1 and 0 23 0 05 h 1 for ctc otc and ttc respectively these values are 15 25 times higher than those reported by chen and huang 2010 for reactions with aluminum oxides 0 018 0 001 h 1 0 0062 0 0009 h 1 and 0 015 0 001 h 1 respectively thus demonstrating the rapid transformation of tcs in the presence of fe bearing smectite clays in the presence of na nau 2 the transformation of ctc was significantly faster than that of otc or ttc perhaps due to the cl substitution at the c7 position of ctc fig 1 because of the electron withdrawing effect of cl the altered electron density could have resulted in a lower pk a2 of ctc 7 55 than of ttc 7 78 together with the increased solubility and altered orientation of ctc relative to ttc and otc during the adsorption process pils and laird 2007 rubert and pedersen 2006 this would have induced the stronger interaction with clay surfaces of ctc than either ttc or otc the buffer used to maintain the solution ph 10 mm mops had negligible effects on ttc transformation and adsorption at ph 7 9 fig a2a and a2b increasing the solution ph from 5 6 to 8 6 decreased the transformation rate of ttc from 0 30 0 04 h 1 to 0 19 0 02 h 1 consistent with the results of rubert and pedersen 2006 the mechanism for the reduced transformation rate may attribute to the reduction in the fraction of neutral 98 37 6 98 vs negatively charged 1 10 78 40 zwitterions as the ph increased from 5 6 to 8 6 fig 1 this change would have also decreased the adsorption of ttc to clay particles fig a2c 3 2 effects of clay type on ctc transformation because the transformation of ctc was faster than that of otc and ttc it was selected to investigate the effects of the clay type on tcs transformation as seen in fig 2b the total amount of ctc was reduced by 56 8 0 2 44 5 4 6 and 13 1 0 5 within 12 h with the addition of na nau 2 na nau 1 and na saz 2 respectively these results indicated the higher activity of na nau 2 than that of na nau 1 or na saz 2 in catalyzing ctc transformation the specific transformation rate k obs trans fecontent achieved with na nau 2 47 2 14 3 h 1 g 1 was approximately twice as high as that achieved with na nau 1 23 1 2 9 h 1 g 1 these results were consistent with our previous studies chen et al 2018 2019 in which the reactivity of na nau 2 with polyphenols and dissolved oxygen was higher than that of na nau 1 structural fe iii atoms are present in the octahedral sheets of na saz 2 based on its formula table a1 but its structural fe content 0 12 is much lower than that of nau 1 21 2 or nau 2 19 2 however the k obs trans fecontent of na saz 2 131 6 22 7 h 1 g 1 is about three times higher than that of na nau 2 which suggests that elements other than fe were involved in the transformation of ctc chen and huang 2010 xu et al 2018 3 3 characterization for structural fe by mössbauer spectroscopy mössbauer spectra fig 3 were obtained to investigate the structural changes in the fe of na nau 1 or na nau 2 after incubation of these clays with ctc there are three fe iii conformations in na nau 2 tetrahedral fe iii tetfe iii octahedral fe iii 1 octfe iii 1 and octahedral fe iii 2 octfe iii 2 whereas only octfe iii 1 is present in na nau 1 octfe iii 1 has a smaller qs value and based on the quadrupole splitting qs values is considered to be cis octfe iii dyar 1987 gorski et al 2012a 2012b octfe iii 2 with its larger qs value has been designated as cis octfe iii near a tetrahedral fe iii atom or trans octfe iii fig a3 while the presumed conformation of octfe ii is trans octfe ii in this study the peak areas of octfe iii 2 and tetfe iii in the na nau 2 spectrum decreased by 15 4 and 0 8 respectively after incubation of the clay with ctc for 12 h but the peak area of octfe iii 1 increased and new peaks of octfe ii appeared fig 3b and c these results suggested that due to structural rearrangements distorted cis octfe iii or trans octfe iii is either partially reduced to octfe ii or converted to cis octfe iii fig 3c both are more active than cis octfe iii in accepting electrons these results are consistent with those of gorski et al 2012b 2013 and besson et al 1983 although the decrease in the peak area of tetfe iii was only 0 8 it probably had a higher electron acceptor activity than octfe iii because the atoms in its basal planes are exposed to the bulk solution and can complex with tcs directly merola and mcguire 2009 the slight change in the peak area of tetfe iii might have arisen from the reduction of tetfe iii by tcs as observed in a previous study wang et al 2019 no significant change was noted in the spectra of na nau 1 after its incubation with ctc fig 3a which suggests that cis octfe iii is relatively inert as an electron acceptor from tcs 3 4 ftir spectra analyses ftir spectra of na nau 2 before and after its incubation with ctc were obtained to interpret the interactions between them the peaks of pristine na nau 2 at 821 cm 1 and 868 cm 1 were assigned to the hydroxyl deformation vibration δ oh of fe iii fe iii oh and alfe iii oh and the peaks at 3441 cm 1 and 3563 cm 1 to their hydroxyl stretching vibrations ν oh respectively fig 4 a after the incubation of na nau 2 with ctc these peaks red shifted to 818 819 cm 1 856 858 cm 1 3419 3426 cm 1 and 3566 3568 cm 1 respectively which demonstrated the ability of ctc to reduce fe iii fe iii oh thus yielding fe ii fe iii oh chen et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 fig 4b shows the subtracted ftir spectra of adsorbed ctc and the products on the clay surfaces most of the changes related to the products were in the range of 1050 1750 cm 1 the peaks at 1581 cm 1 and 1616 cm 1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of co at the c and a rings respectively these peaks remained at the same positions after the incubation of ctc with na nau 2 which suggested that neither of these co groups was significantly involved in the adsorption and transformation of the tcs li et al 2010a 2010b the unchanged peak of the aromatic cc skeleton vibration at 1457 cm 1 gu and karthikeyan 2005 kulshrestha et al 2004 li et al 2010a 2010b indicated that there was no cation π interaction between the aromatic plane of ctc and the exchangeable cations on the clay surfaces thus ctc was probably adsorbed to the clay surfaces in a tilted rather than a parallel conformation li et al 2010a zhu et al 2003 a finding supported by the xrd results text a9 the d 001 spacings of na nau 2 incubated with 4 mm ctc increased from 1 25 nm to 2 17 nm fig a4 the peaks at 1524 cm 1 and 1673 cm 1 were assigned to nh2 and co of the amide group of ctc fig 4b respectively gu and karthikeyan 2005 li et al 2010b the intensities of these peaks decreased significantly in the subtracted spectrum of adsorbed ctc and its transformation products the peak of c n in the amide group at 1228 cm 1 was also significantly attenuated fig 4b these results indicated strong interactions between the amide groups of ctc and the clay surfaces in the transformation of ctc it was also observed that the peak of the dimethyl amino group at 1357 cm 1 gunasekaran et al 1996 red shifted to 1334 1344 cm 1 and its intensity decreased significantly during the reaction with na nau 2 this result suggests that dimethyl amino groups also participate in the clay mediated transformation of ctc 3 5 proposed transformation products of ctc fifteen major products of ctc transformation were identified on the lc ms ms spectra table 1 fig a5 and text a10 including the products of tautomerization dechlorination dehydration and oxidation table 1 the proportions of three tautomers of ctc keto ctc iso ctc and epi ctc were much higher than those of other products in the reaction system fig a6a the tautomers of iso ctc and keto ctc were detected both in solution and in solid phase while epi ctc was found only in solid phase after a 1 h incubation the amounts of keto ctc epi ctc and iso ctc increased by 12 2 9 3 and 6 7 respectively after 12 h the amounts of keto ctc and epi ctc decreased by 4 2 and 1 9 respectively the amount of iso ctc increased to 7 1 until 2 h slightly decreasing thereafter whereas the amounts of the other major products steadily increased fig a6a the decreasing amounts of keto and epi ctc mainly occurred on clay particles 0 9 3 7 rather than in solution 0 1 0 5 fig a6b and a6c these results indicated that keto ctc and epi ctc were the major tautomers responsible for the subsequent transformations in the presence of na nau 2 anhydro ctc actc was the product of intramolecular dehydration and emerged at ph 7 via the loss of oh at the c6 position and of h at c5 chen and huang 2010 2011 table 1 previous studies reported that the formation of dehydration products is mainly due to surface bound al iii o or fe iii o and occurs by the subtraction of a proton hofstetter et al 2003 pines and haag 1960 tournassat et al 2016 ttc was the dechlorinated product of ctc and it was further dehydrated to form anhydro ttc attc table 1 the dechlorination as a ctc transformation pathway was further evidenced by the increasing cl concentration during the incubation fig 5 a the extraction products i ii iii iv v vi and vii table 1 had molecule ions peaks m z at 495 511 465 467 437 452 and 481 respectively table 1 their formation was attributed to the c n cleavage at dimethylamino groups chen and huang 2011 adsorbed to the clay surfaces via electrostatic forces fig a7b in contrast to the results of chen and huang 2011 our study showed that iso ctc was not the major tautomer contributing to ctc transformation the oxidative transformation of ctc could mainly be attributed to structural fe iii a conclusion supported by the good linear correlation slope 0 92 r 2 0 98 between the amounts of reduced structural fe ii and the amount of total oxidized ctc fig 5b the fraction of total dissolved fe during the incubation was always 0 3 indicating that ctc oxidation occurred mainly on the clay surfaces no dimers or polymers of ctc were observed in this study 3 6 mechanisms of ctc transformation on fe bearing smectite clays as noted above according to the ftir and xrd spectra tcs adsorbed on clay surfaces assumed in a tilted not a parallel conformation chang et al 2009b li et al 2010b after adsorption on clay basal planes or broken edges with fe iii o al iii o ctc was preferentially tautomerized to keto ctc and epi ctc with a smaller amount of iso ctc fig a6a these results were consistent with previous studies halling sørensen et al 2002 mitscher 1978 showing that epi ctc forms in acidic solutions ph 2 6 fig a7a such as in the aqueous environment around the clay surfaces hauser 1945 tournassat et al 2016 whereas iso ctc preferentially forms in alkaline solutions mitscher 1978 and keto ctc at ph 3 9 halling sørensen et al 2002 surface bound or exposed fe iii on the basal planes or at the broken edges of the clay can serve as acid centers to induce ctc transformation although the majority of the fe iii of smectite clays is located in the clay lattices hofstetter et al 2003 neumann et al 2013 the surface active sites may have been gradually occupied or occluded due to the adsorption of ctc and its transformation products which would have slowed subsequent ctc transformation reactions fig 2a additionally as shown in mössbauer spectra the structural fe contained in the clay lattice also contributed to the transformations especially distorted cis octfe iii and trans octfe iii according to the dft calculation the dechlorination of ctc and actc in the presence na nau 2 was thermodynamically feasible the δe values for the transformation of ctc to ttc and actc to attc were 6 27 ev and 7 04 ev respectively the dehydration of ctc to actc and ttc to attc on clay surfaces table 1 was ascribed to the lewis acid sites al o fe o chen and huang 2010 karpov et al 2018 with δe values of 1 82 ev the n ch3 2 at c4 and the oh groups at c3 and c10 of the ctc structure were responsible for the oxidative transformation fig a7b the electron transfer process between adsorbed ctc and structural fe iii may have produced structural fe ii and ctc radical intermediates able to induce the formation of other transformation products via electron delocalization chen and huang 2011 however the hydration of ctc radical intermediates to form products iii v vi and vii was not supported by the dft calculation in this study this result may have been partially due to the simplified computation model in which only one fe was substituted for al in the octahedral sheet of the nontronite supercell such that the oxidation ability of the fe bearing clay would have been underestimated further study is needed to explain the formation of the hydration products detected in our study 3 7 the acute toxicity of tcs transformation products fig a8 shows the acute toxicity of tcs transformation products to p phosphoreum t3 there was no significant difference p 0 05 among the r inhibition values of ctc 26 8 2 2 otc 27 8 0 7 and ttc 27 3 1 4 the extracts of clay particles had no significant influence on the luminescence intensity of p phosphoreum t3 however the r inhibition values of ctc otc and ttc significantly increased to 64 2 2 9 45 7 0 7 and 37 3 2 2 after incubation with na nau 2 for 12 h respectively these results indicated that transformation products of tcs have higher acute toxicity than the parent compounds and more toxic products of ctc produced the highest k obs trans than otc or ttc p 0 05 the higher acute toxicity of transformed products than parent compounds might be contributed by the formed keto epi derivatives and the oxidation products and further study should be conducted to explore the toxicity of these products it has been reported that iso derivatives of tcs have less toxicity to bacteria because of the changed c4 configuration in tcs structure halling sørensen et al 2002 4 conclusions tetracyclines are widely distributed antimicrobials in subsurface soils sediments and groundwater in these environments in the presence of fe bearing smectite clays and the absence of light and or oxygen tcs can be transformed or degraded to form a wide range of compounds our study of the underlying transformation mechanisms showed that tcs adsorbed on clay surfaces tautomerize to keto epi or iso tcs with intramolecular dehydration occurring at al iii o or fe iii o sites in addition electron transfer between tcs and clay particles was shown to induce the dechlorination and oxidation of keto epi ctc and to produce structural fe ii smectite clays with tetfe iii distorted cis octfe iii and trans octfe iii are more active than those containing only cis octfe iii other fe bearing clay minerals such as vermiculite and illites may mediate similar tcs transformation the transformation products of tcs obtained under the conditions of this study had a higher acute toxicity for photobacterium phosphoreum t3 than the parent compounds thus environmental assessment of widely used antibiotics must take into account that the ecological risks of tcs will likely depend on the subsequent reactions of the antibiotics in

18524,a combined heterotrophic sulfur autotrophic system chsas was established to simultaneously reduce perchlorate and nitrate in water in this system the oh produced by the acetate heterotrophic part h part could be neutralized with the h produced by the sulfur autotrophic part s part thus the ph of the final effluent could keep neutral in addition the s part could further reduce the pollutants and residual carbon from the h part to achieve a high performance for 19 62 0 30 mg l clo4 and 21 56 0 83 mg l no3 n in the influent the operating parameters were optimal at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 0 h and an acetate concentration of 70 mg l the removal efficiency of clo4 and no3 reached 95 43 and 99 23 without secondary pollution caused by residual organic carbon it was also revealed that sulfur s0 disproportionation can be inhibited by shortening the hrt and reducing the acetate dosage the dominant heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were thauera and ferritrophicum respectively while chlorobaculum was related to s0 disproportionation graphical abstract image 1 keywords perchlorate nitrate combined heterotrophic sulfur autotrophic system chsas secondary pollution control ph balance high throughput sequencing 1 introduction perchlorate clo4 is a strong oxidant zhao et al 2011a that is used in pyrotechnics as well as an explosive and propellant in military and aerospace industries mahmudov and huang 2010 because of its high solubility and chemical stability kim and logan 2001 perchlorate can easily enter water and cause pollution furthermore perchlorate can interfere with the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones urbansky and schock 1999 which affects human metabolism and growth in a study conducted in 2010 it was found that 6 8 54 4 μg l perchlorate was detected in surface water samples from hengyang city hunan province wu et al 2010 a perchlorate concentration of 1 10 mg l was detected in groundwater near the nitrate deposit in the atacama desert chile duncan et al 2005 in california the highest concentration of perchlorate detected in well water was 280 μg l srinivasan and sorial 2009 nitrate no3 is widely present in surface water and groundwater and often coexists with perchlorate kimbrough and parekh 2007 ginkel et al 2008 it may cause methemoglobinemia in infants and could result in malformation and mutation when it was transformed into nitrosamines rocca et al 2007 groundwater nitrate pollution levels in the us and some european countries have risen to 200 mg l chen et al 2014 for contaminated groundwater sites perchlorate is usually present in low concentrations ppb range and nitrate is present in high concentrations ppm range matos et al 2006 nevertheless high concentration perchlorate ppm range pollution with the coexistence of nitrate occurred in the water near fireworks plant and rocket propellant manufacturing plant have been reported in recent years kosaka et al 2011 isobe et al 2013 nadaraja et al 2015 sijimol et al 2017 perchlorate concentration as high as 32 602 60 μg l was detected in ammonium perchlorate experimental plant water samples with an average value of 5094 87 μg l in pre monsoon sijimol et al 2017 meanwhile nitrate concentration in the water was 7 06 mg l therefore the high concentration of perchlorate in water threat caused by related fields could not be underestimated strategies for treating perchlorate and nitrate contaminated water include physical chemical and biological processes huq et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the physical chemical technologies such as ion exchange and reverse osmosis generate a brine waste that need to be further treated gu et al 2007 häyrynen et al 2009 chemical catalytic methods require high cost catalysts and restrict reaction conditions yao et al 2017 limiting theirs large scale field application compared with the physical and chemical methods biological reduction of perchlorate and nitrate is favored by researchers because of its high efficiency and low cost gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 microorganisms use electron donors to completely transform clo4 and no3 into innocuous cl and n2 under anaerobic conditions gao et al 2016 which achieves the transformation of pollutant form according to the type of electron donors biological methods can be divided into heterotrophic and autotrophic methods acetate lactate and methanol are the common carbon sources and electron donors for heterotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate foglar and briški 2003 shrout and parkin 2006 wan et al 2018a the main advantages of the heterotrophic method are the high reduction rates and treatment capacity karanasios et al 2010 guan et al 2015 ucar et al 2016b for heterotrophic reduction process with acetate as the electron donor the stoichiometric of denitrification process has been studied for many years and the eq 1 includes the biomass growth and is often

a previous study wan et al 2018a it was found that the optimal acetate perchlorate m m ratio was 1 78 3 fold of the theoretical value calculated by eq 2 2 c l o 4 c h 3 c o o c l h 2 o 2 c o 2 o h previous studies have shown that the carbon source dosage was affected by the type of carbon source and the concentration of pollutants gómez et al 2000 chiu and chung 2003 shrout and parkin 2006 fernández nava et al 2010 wan et al 2018a from practical aspects the dose of carbon source is not easy to control when the carbon source is in excess the residual organics in the effluent can support microbial growth in water distribution systems resulting in the formation of toxic trihalomethanes during disinfection via chlorination thrash et al 2007 therefore post treatment such as the aerobic polishing stage is needed after the heterotrophic process zhang et al 2005 when the carbon source is insufficient pollutants cannot be completely degraded in addition inorganic electron donors such as hydrogen zero valent iron and elemental sulfur s0 may be used for the autotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate logan and lapoint 2002 cai et al 2008 oh et al 2016 s0 has gained significant attention in recent years wang et al 2016 guo et al 2017 for sulfur autotrophic reduction process the stoichiometric equation of denitrification process has been studied for many years and the eq 3 includes the biomass growth and is often used in many researches oh et al 2003 sahinkaya et al 2014 wan et al 2017 meanwhile the stoichiometric equation for perchlorate was still unclear eq 4 is the most commonly used equation based on redox balance and is used in many studies without consideration of biomass yield ju et al 2008 wan et al 2017 the stoichiometric equations for autotrophic

could eliminate secondary contamination caused by residual organics it generates sulfate so4 2 and consumes the alkalinity of the effluent moon et al 2006 ju et al 2007 meanwhile s0 disproportionation always occurred in the process of sulfur autotrophic reduction of perchlorate ju et al 2008 wan et al 2017 2018a the disproportionation is a reaction in which the reactant itself not only acts as an oxidizing agent but also as a reducing agent microorganisms use s0 for disproportionation to produce sulfate and sulfide the s0 disproportionation is shown in eq 5 ju et al 2008 5 4 s 0 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 3 h 2 s 2 h in order to make up for the deficiencies of heterotrophic or autotrophic processes this study developed a combined heterotrophic sulfur autotrophic system chsas for the reduction of perchlorate and nitrate in the combined system the dosage of the carbon source added to the heterotrophic part h part was insufficient to avoid the threat of organic secondary pollution meanwhile the hrt and carbon source dosage were changed to adjust the load of the sulfur autotrophic part s part thereby controlling the so4 2 production in addition the alkalinity produced by the h part was consumed by s part allowing that the ph value in s part effluent maintain balance with the influent at present most of the studies on mixotrophic reduction are related to denitrification liu et al 2009 zhao et al 2011a b sahinkaya and kilic 2014 tong et al 2014 for nitrate and perchlorate co existing pollution the studies are still very limited ucar et al 2017 evaluated the performance of a heterotrophic autotrophic sequential system for nitrate and perchlorate removal under a single operational condition c n 2 44 and hrt 2 h however the competition of the two pollutants for different electron donors the effects of key operational parameters such as the hrt and organic carbon source dosage were not systemically explored control strategies for secondary pollution especially for sulfate and organic carbon and methods to maintain ph balance which are the important aspects of the chsas technology still deserve further research besides studies using high throughput sequencing to describe the microbial community structure in the chsas for perchlorate and nitrate reduction are still inadequate previous studies have mostly focused on the treatment of co contamination of nitrate with high concentration ppm range and perchlorate with low concentration ppb range logan and lapoint 2002 matos et al 2006 zhao et al 2014 ucar et al 2017 wan et al 2017 hydrogen autotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate has been extensively investigated sahu et al 2009a gao et al 2016 chen et al 2017 epsztein et al 2017 logan and lapoint 2002 explored hydrogen autotrophic reduction of perchlorate 73 2 μg l and nitrate 21 2 mg n l in a packed bed bioreactor the removal efficiencies reached 25 and 10 respectively zhao et al 2014 used h2 fed two stages membrane biofilm reactor mbfr to remove perchlorate 160 200 μg l and nitrate 8 9 mg n l from water they found that most of nitrate was removed in the lead mbfr while perchlorate was mainly removed in the lag mbfr however the problem of high concentration perchlorate and nitrate pollution cannot be underestimated isobe et al 2013 sijimol et al 2017 hence this study use high concentrations ppm range perchlorate and nitrate as the research object the main objectives of the present study were to 1 evaluate the chsas reduction process for the simultaneous removal of clo4 and no3 2 explore the control strategies for secondary pollution focusing on sulfate and organic carbon 3 explore methods to maintain ph and alkalinity consumption balance 4 determine the dominant microbial community members involved in clo4 and no3 removal in each part 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experimental set up consisted of the acetate heterotrophic part h part and the sulfur autotrophic part s part two cylindrical

only in h part and nahco3 100 00 mg l phosphorus sources such as k2hpo4 3h2o and kh2po4 were added to the basal medium at 5 00 mg l the trace metal solution 1 00 ml l used in the experiment was improved based on previous studies ju et al 2008 wan et al 2019 the two reactors were operated with an hrt of 8 0 h for 15 days respectively before shifting to the heterotrophic autotrophic continuous experiment 2 3 experimental design after 15 days of acclimation the reactors achieved stable conditions in this condition the fluctuation of effluent indicators the concentrations of clo4 no3 n so4 2

using the uchime to ensure quality wan et al 2016 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of perchlorate and nitrate previous studies have shown that both the hrt and carbon source are crucial elements for biodegradation of perchlorate and nitrate zhu et al 2016 in this study the performance of the chsas was investigated by varying the hrt from 4 0 h to 1 0 h and adjusting the concentration of acetate from 210 mg l to 35 mg l according to eq 1 71 31 mg l acetate is required to reduce 20 mg l no3 n in a previous study wan et al 2018a the optimal acetate perchlorate m m ratio was 1 78 3 fold of the theoretical value calculated by eq 2 that is 35 60 mg l 1 78 20 35 60 mg l acetate is required to reduce 20 mg l clo4 therefore the reduction of 20 mg l clo4 and no3 n requires 106 91 mg l acetate consequently an acetate concentration of 35 mg l represents an insufficient carbon source and 210 mg l is equivalent to an excessive carbon source the removal performance of perchlorate and nitrate under different operational condition is represented in fig 1 the results indicated that the removal efficiency of the h part was dependent on the carbon source dosage when the acetate concentration decreased from 210 mg l to 35 mg l at hrt 4 0 h the clo4 concentration in the effluent of the h part increased from 0 39 mg l to 19 67 mg l and the no3 n concentration in the effluent of the h part increased from 0 05 mg l to 16 13 mg l fig 1a and b the residual contaminants could be further reduced in the s part under all operation conditions the concentrations of clo4 and no3 n were below 1 18 mg l and 0 20 mg l respectively in final effluent fig 1a and b when the hrt gradually changed from 4 0 h to 1 0 h the clo4 removal efficiency for the h part was affected when the concentration of acetate was fixed at 210 mg l fig 1c the clo4 removal efficiency in h part decreased to 80 18 as the hrt dropped to 1 0 h meanwhile there was no obvious effect on no3 n removal 99 52 fig 1d in brief decreasing the carbon source dosage and shortening the hrt had a detrimental effect on the reduction of both perchlorate and nitrate in h part but the nitrate was easier to reduce than perchlorate fig 1c and d previous studies have found that the presence of nitrate inhibits perchlorate reductase enzyme resulting in the decrease in perchlorate reduction rate ucar et al 2016b therefore when clo4 and no3 co exist no3 is the favorable electron acceptor and is preferentially reduced by the microorganisms zhao et al 2011a additionally the decreased acetate concentration and shortened hrt resulted in the accumulation of no2 n in h part up to 7 44 mg l at an hrt of 1 0 h whereas the s part further reduced no2 n and the concentration in the effluent was always lower than 0 10 mg l fig 1b under all operating conditions pollutants were removed efficiently in the chsas when the acetate concentration was 35 mg l under an hrt of 1 0 h the removal efficiencies of perchlorate and nitrate in the h part were only 1 82 and 33 78 respectively after further biological reduction by the s part the final removal efficiency of perchlorate and nitrate reached 97 80 and 99 12 respectively thus even with a short hrt and insufficient carbon source the h part and s part cooperated to achieve high removal efficiencies of the co existing perchlorate and nitrate 3 2 so4 2 generation and control in order to investigate so4 2 generation in the combined system the so4 2 concentration was analyzed in each part when the carbon source was sufficient the heterotrophic microorganisms could reduce part of the sulfate when the acetate concentration was in excess 210 mg l and the hrt was 4 0 h and 1 5 h approximately 38 67 and 12 47 so4 2 respectively was reduced in the h part fig 2 a at the same time 6 09 mg l s2 was detected in the h part with 210 mg l acetate and an hrt of 4 0 h under other operating conditions the concentration of so4 2 84 15 101 00 mg l in the effluent of the h part was close to that in the influent 80 74 97 28 mg l during all stages the so4 2 concentration in the s part was higher than the theoretical value calculated by eqs 3 and 4 indicating that s0 disproportionation had occurred ju et al 2007 hence in this study the generated so4 2 in the s part had three sources perchlorate removal nitrate removal and s0 disproportionation the theoretical increase in so4 2 was calculated by the following formula 6 c c l o 4 c i n f c l o 4 c e f f c l o 4 1 29 7 c n o 3 n c i n f n o 3 n c e f f n o 3 n 7 18 8 c s c e f f s o 4 2 c i n f s o 4 2 c c l o 4 c n o 3 n where c c l o 4 c n o 3 n and c s are the theoretical sulfate concentrations mg l produced by perchlorate reduction nitrate reduction and s0 disproportionation respectively c i n f c l o 4 and c e f f c l o 4 are influent and effluent perchlorate concentrations mg l in s part respectively c i n f n o 3 n and c e f f n o 3 n are influent and effluent nitrate concentrations mg l in s part respectively c i n f s o 4 2 and c e f f s o 4 2 are influent and effluent sulfate concentrations mg l in s part respectively the coefficients of 1 29 and 7 18 are determined by eqs 3 and 4 respectively the theoretical increase in so4 2 concentrations in the s part under each operational condition and their distribution is shown in fig 2b it should be noted that more so4 2 was generated in the s part when the acetate concentration in the h part was lower under hrt of 4 0 h when the acetate concentration was 210 mg l the theoretical increase in so4 2 concentration was 51 27 mg l while when the acetate concentration decreased to 35 mg l the theoretical increase in so4 2 concentration reached 227 62 mg l when the dosage of acetate in the h part was reduced the s part should bear more removal load resulting in more so4 2 generation in addition the hrt also had an effect on the generated so4 2 in the s part which was mainly reflected in the s0 disproportionation when the hrt was shortened from 4 0 h to 1 0 h with a fixed acetate concentration in the h part of 35 mg l the theoretical concentration of so4 2 produced by s0 disproportionation decreased from 87 26 mg l to 29 94 mg l and the corresponding theoretical proportion of so4 2 generated by s0 disproportionation decreased from 38 31 to 18 22 wan et al 2017 found that when the hrt was long 1 0 h both nitrate and perchlorate decreased to low concentrations and s0 disproportionation was accelerated in the sulfur autotrophic system a long hrt increases the contact time of water with sulfur which promotes s0 disproportionation therefore it is not recommended to use a chsas to reduce perchlorate and nitrate under long hrts fig s2 indicates the theoretical proportion of so4 2 production in the s part of the chsas under different operating conditions with a lower acetate dosage in h part the so4 2 theoretical proportion produced by the reduction of clo4 and no3 gradually increased and the so4 2 theoretical proportion produced by s0 disproportionation gradually decreased as the acetate concentration was reduced from 210 mg l to 35 mg l at an hrt of 4 0 h the theoretical proportion of so4 2 generated by clo4 and no3 reduction increased from 1 15 to 10 99 and 0 40 to 50 70 respectively in other words the theoretical proportion of so4 2 generated by s0 disproportionation decreased from 98 45 to 38 31 this phenomenon is related to the influent nitrate and perchlorate concentrations of the s part as reported s0 disproportionation is mainly accelerated when perchlorate is reduced to low concentrations whereas it is restricted when nitrate is not completely removed wan et al 2017 when the carbon source was sufficient 210 mg l acetate the pollutants in the h part were almost completely reduced and the s part mainly performed s0 disproportionation both the nitrate and perchlorate concentrations in the influent of the s part were low at an hrt 1 0 h the concentrations of clo4 and no3 n in the s part influent were 3 89 mg l and 0 10 mg l respectively thus s0 disproportionation was accelerated when the carbon source was insufficient 35 mg l acetate the perchlorate and nitrate reduction were mainly performed in the s part both the nitrate and perchlorate concentrations in the influent of the s part were high at an hrt 1 0 h the concentrations of clo4 and no3 n in the s part influent were 19 35 mg l and 14 93 mg l respectively thus s0 disproportionation could be restricted the gibb s free energies of perchlorate and nitrate reduction were calculated to be 2397 73 kj mol and 2595 95 kj mol respectively indicating that the reduction reaction was spontaneous at the same time the gibb s free energy of nitrate reduction was less than that of perchlorate reduction indicating that nitrate reduction was more likely to occur than perchlorate reduction on the other hand the gibb s free energy of s0 disproportionation is 103 31 kj mol indicating that the reaction is non spontaneous process however s0 disproportionation always occurred in the process of sulfur autotrophic reduction of perchlorate sahu et al 2009b boles et al 2012 wan et al 2017 2019 indicating that only chemical thermodynamics analysis is not enough to predict the reaction direction and extent and the involvement of microbial reaction complicates the reaction which needs further study s2 was detected in the s part effluent as a product of s0 disproportionation fig 2a shows that when the hrt was longer and the carbon source was sufficient at an hrt 4 0 h the concentrations of acetate was 210 mg l a higher concentration of s2 14 42 mg l was detected in the s part effluent adjusting the hrt and acetate concentration inhibited the s0 disproportionation reaction and also decreased the concentration of s2 in the s part effluent thus s0 disproportionation an unfavorable side reaction generated excessive so4 2 and s2 thereby limiting the application of autotrophic sulfur reduction however in this combined system a short hrt and low carbon source dosage effectively restricted s0 disproportionation in the s part 3 3 residual organic carbon in the effluent the variation of npoc in the influent and effluent from the h part and s part under different operational conditions is shown in fig 3 the residual organic carbon in the h part could be further decomposed and utilized in the s part and the secondary pollution could be effectively avoided by controlling the carbon source dosage and the hrt under an hrt 1 0 h when the acetate concentration was 210 mg l the npoc of the effluent from the h part was 38 45 2 90 mg l and the residual carbon source in the final effluent from the s part was 17 27 3 68 mg l indicating that the organic secondary pollution in the final effluent was serious when the acetate concentration was further reduced to 70 mg l the npoc of the final effluent was less than 1 94 mg l indicating that the organic secondary pollution in the final effluent was avoided under a longer hrt hrt 4 0 h even at a high acetate dosage 210 mg l less organic carbon remained in the effluent of both the h part and s part 12 39 mg l and 3 07 mg l npoc respectively it is speculated that a long hrt is beneficial because microorganisms can make full use of the carbon sources to reduce pollutants and sulfate as well as maintain their own growth therefore an appropriate hrt and organic carbon source can eliminate secondary pollution caused by residual organic carbon under the premise of guaranteeing a high removal efficiency of the reactor 3 4 ph variation and alkalinity consumption the variation of ph and alkalinity in the influent and effluent under different operational conditions is shown in fig 4 under all conditions the influent ph was between 7 55 and 8 09 the ph of effluent from the h part ranged from 8 09 to 8 77 according to eqs 1 and 2 the heterotrophic reduction processes of clo4 and no3 is accompanied by the generation of oh therefore across all test stages the ph of the effluent from the h part was higher than that of the influent meanwhile the ph of the effluent from the s part was between 6 85 and 7 98 which was lower than the h part throughout the operation time h was produced by sulfur autotrophic reduction of clo4 and no3 eqs 3 and 4 at the same time s0 disproportionation also generated h eq 5 those three sources of h led to a low ph in the s part the influent alkalinity varied between 199 57 and 349 41 mg l since the heterotrophic reduction of clo4 and no3 produced alkalinity in the h part the alkalinity of the effluent from the h part was higher than that of the influent the decreased acetate concentration led to the decreased alkalinity production of the h part when the acetate concentration was lowered from 210 mg l to 35 mg l at hrt 1 0 h the generated alkalinity of the h part decreased from 126 69 mg l to 45 21 mg l in the s part theoretically 1 34 mg caco3 alkalinity is consumed to reduce 1 0 mg clo4 3 91 mg caco3 alkalinity is consumed to reduce 1 0 mg no3 n and 1 04 mg caco3 alkalinity is consumed to generate 1 0 mg so4 2 by s0 disproportionation when the hrt was 4 0 h and the acetate concentration was decreased from 210 mg l to 35 mg l the consumed alkalinity increased from 56 93 mg l to 183 62 mg l which was very close to the theoretical value 53 53 mg l to 179 61 mg l when the acetate concentration was 35 mg l and the hrt was shortened from 4 0 h to 1 0 h the consumed alkalinity decreased from 183 62 mg l to 139 89 mg l therefore the chsas is able to achieve balanced ph and alkalinity in the effluent when the carbon source dosage and hrt are adjusted in summary the optimal operating conditions of the chsas were at hrt 1 0 h and 70 mg l acetate under such conditions the clo4 and no3 removal efficiencies were 95 43 and 99 23 respectively and there was no accumulation of no2 n in effluent 0 10 0 03 mg l the effluent ph and alkalinity can maintain a balance with the influent additionally the increased so4 2 concentration was 94 43 mg l and the so4 2 concentration in final effluent was 192 02 mg l which is lower than the secondary drinking water regulations of us epa 250 mg l the concentration of residual organic carbon in the effluent was less than 1 83 mg l indicating that the secondary pollution was eliminated thus in the chsas an insufficient carbon source in the h part avoids secondary pollution and the low load of the s part reduces the production of sulfate while at the same time balancing the ph and alkalinity of the effluent 3 5 microbial community analysis 3 5 1 microbial community diversity high throughput sequencing technology was adopted to analyze six microorganism samples the number of raw sequences of all samples was over 34 000 after quality control the effective number of sequences exceeded 33 647 for ease of analysis and comparison the number of sequences was normalized to 31 000 the coverage of all samples was greater than 99 indicating that the probability of an undetected sequence was very low and that the sequencing results represented the actual microbial community the samples the alpha diversity of the sample reflects the abundance and diversity of the microbial community and can be represented by the chao 1 ace and shannon indices as well as the operational taxonomic units otus hwang et al 2012 table 1 summarizes the parameters associated with alpha diversity the measured richness estimators of the inoculated sludge were the largest indicating that this sample had the highest microbial abundance and diversity conversely the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the bioreactor was obviously lower than the inoculum in the h part the abundance and diversity of the microbial community gradually decreased along the height of the reactor because clo4 and no3 were the only electron acceptors some microorganisms that did not participate in the specific reduction reactions were gradually outcompeted leading to a decreased microbial community abundance and diversity in the s part the shannon chao and ace indices first increased and then decreased along the height of the reactor when the hrt was 1 5 h and the acetate concentration was 35 mg l the concentrations of clo4 and no3 in the s part influent were 19 38 mg l and 15 27 mg l respectively it is inferred that the pollutant reduction reactions occurred mainly at the bottom of the reactor and that the microbial community structure was simple when the concentration of pollutants was reduced to a low level s0 disproportionation was accompanied by reduction reactions in the middle of the reactor which resulted in an increased microbial community abundance and diversity s0 disproportionation mainly occurred at the top of the reactor due to the depletion of electron acceptors wan et al 2017 resulting in a decreased community diversity unifrac analysis uses evolutionary information between sample sequences to compare microbial population differences in evolutionary lineages unifrac can be used for beta diversity analysis that is a comparative analysis between two samples by obtaining a unifrac distance matrix lozupone et al 2011 as shown in fig 5 heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria each formed a cluster the similarity between the bottom and the top part of the h part was 82 68 the similarity of the bottom and middle part of the s part was 83 37 while the similarity with the top part was 70 85 the clo4 and no3 reduction processes mainly occur in the bottom and middle part of the s part therefore the similarity was higher than the top part compared with the s part the h part had a higher similarity with the inoculated sludge 58 05 this is likely because the inoculated sludge comes from a heterotrophic environment 3 5 2 bacterial taxonomic identification the results of the a taxonomic tree and b taxonomic classification at the genus level are shown in fig 6 the results indicated that the microbial community was mainly composed of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi fig s3 shows the taxonomic classification at phylum level for each sample proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the dominant bacteria in the microbial samples of the h part the abundance of proteobacteria increased from 62 22 to 70 49 along the height of the reactor many of the confirmed perchlorate reducing and denitrifying bacteria belong to proteobacteria zhu et al 2016 under heterotrophic conditions the rapid growth rate of microorganisms leads to an increased abundance of proteobacteria the abundance of chloroflexi increased from 5 24 to 5 75 in contrast the abundance of bacteroidetes decreased from 19 64 to 14 83 fig s3 in the s part proteobacteria had an absolute advantage and its abundance decreased from 86 99 bottom to 84 45 middle to 57 45 top along the height of the reactor as the concentration of clo4 and no3 gradually decreased the electron acceptors were gradually depleted leading to a gradual decrease in the proportion of proteobacteria similarly the abundance of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi gradually decreased from 3 43 to 2 66 and 4 01 to 2 74 respectively along the height of reactor the enrichment of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi has been described in previous studies on sulfur autotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate zhang et al 2015 2017 significantly the abundance of chlorobi which may be related to s0 disproportionation increased from 0 94 to 30 84 along the height of the reactor analysis at the genus level can further understand the function of microorganisms fig 6b summarizes the most representative genera abundance 1 in the h part thauera was the most dominant genus with an abundance greater than 31 thauera and comamonas can use organic carbon sources to reduce nitrate under anaerobic conditions etchebehere et al 2001 mechichi et al 2005 yun et al 2018 claims that thauera and comamonas are versatile pollutant reducing bacteria therefore it is speculated that they have the ability to reduce perchlorate in this study pseudomonas can use acetate as an electron donor for the reduction of perchlorate and nitrate to obtain energy under anoxic conditions shah 2014 liu et al 2018 in summary thauera comamonas and pseudomonas are effective denitrifying bacteria db perchlorate reducing bacteria prb in this study in addition the abundance of owenweeksia which belong to the phylum bacteroidetes lau et al 2005 reached 6 89 in the h part however whether it played a positive role in the degradation of perchlorate and nitrate requires further study the dominant genera in the s part were ferritrophicum thiobacillus and sulfurospirillum wan et al 2017 speculated that ferritrophicum acts as a db in sulfur autotrophic reduction perchlorate and nitrate systems in this study the maximum abundance of ferritrophicum reached 23 97 suggesting that ferritrophicum may be related to the reduction of perchlorate and nitrate db prb the genera sulfurospirillum and sulfurovum have the ability to oxidize sulfides while reducing nitrate or perchlorate wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 geobacter has been identified in previous studies on the microbial reduction of nitrate or perchlorate wen et al 2017 wan et al 2018b in this study its abundance was maintained at approximately 4 83 in the reactor and it is speculated to be a db prb the abundances of thiobacillus sulfurimonas and sulfurisoma decreased along the reactor height from 11 11 to 0 71 4 95 0 45 and 7 89 3 02 respectively they are the common db that use elemental sulfur sulfides and thiosulfate to reduce no3 and no2 kelly and wood 2000 zhang et al 2009 kojima and fukui 2014 some nitrate reducers can use perchlorate as an electron acceptor srinivasan and sorial 2009 thereby indicating that in this study thiobacillus sulfurimonas and sulfurisoma have the ability to simultaneously reduce perchlorate and nitrate db prb desulfocapsa is sulfate reducing bacteria srb that reduce sulfur oxides such as sulfates sulfites thiosulfates and s0 to hydrogen sulfide abed et al 2011 in this study the maximum abundance of desulfocapsa was 8 82 in middle of the reactor the excess theoretical value of so4 2 produced by the s part was attributed to the presence of the genus chlorobaculum chlorobaculum tepidum is a green sulfur bacterium belonging to the chlorobi phylum and has the ability to oxidize sulfide and s0 to so4 2 rodriguez et al 2011 green sulfur bacteria are specialized anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria and their growth requires the simultaneous presence of light and sulfide marschall et al 2010 the s part was an anaerobic environment with the presence of s0 and the reactor was exposed to natural light providing the necessary conditions for the growth of chlorobaculum the abundance of chlorobaculum increased dramatically from 0 50 to 28 29 at the top part of reactor wan et al 2017 found that s0 disproportionation notably occurs at the top of reactors during sulfur autotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate when accompanied by an increase of chloroobaculum therefore it is considered that chlorobaculum is closely related to s0 disproportionation 4 conclusion the effective removal of perchlorate and nitrate by microorganisms was achieved in the chsas and the removal efficiencies of perchlorate and nitrate were higher than 93 96 shortening the hrt and decreasing the influent acetate concentration inhibited s0 disproportionation thereby reducing the production of so4 2 the alkalinity and ph of the effluent were balanced with the influent by adjusting the influent acetate concentration and the hrt at the same time the s part further reduced the pollutants and the residual organic carbon from the h part eliminated the secondary pollution and achieved synergism microbial community analysis showed that the perchlorate and nitrate reducing bacteria of the h part were different from those of the s part the appearance of chlorobaculum was related to the occurrence of s0 disproportionation this study systematically investigated the reduction performance of chsas for high concentration perchlorate ppm range pollution with the coexistence of nitrate occurred in the water establishing a practical foundation for treatment of potential water contaminated by perchlorate and nitrate with high concentrations ppm range in the future declaration of competing interest

18524,a combined heterotrophic sulfur autotrophic system chsas was established to simultaneously reduce perchlorate and nitrate in water in this system the oh produced by the acetate heterotrophic part h part could be neutralized with the h produced by the sulfur autotrophic part s part thus the ph of the final effluent could keep neutral in addition the s part could further reduce the pollutants and residual carbon from the h part to achieve a high performance for 19 62 0 30 mg l clo4 and 21 56 0 83 mg l no3 n in the influent the operating parameters were optimal at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 0 h and an acetate concentration of 70 mg l the removal efficiency of clo4 and no3 reached 95 43 and 99 23 without secondary pollution caused by residual organic carbon it was also revealed that sulfur s0 disproportionation can be inhibited by shortening the hrt and reducing the acetate dosage the dominant heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were thauera and ferritrophicum respectively while chlorobaculum was related to s0 disproportionation graphical abstract image 1 keywords perchlorate nitrate combined heterotrophic sulfur autotrophic system chsas secondary pollution control ph balance high throughput sequencing 1 introduction perchlorate clo4 is a strong oxidant zhao et al 2011a that is used in pyrotechnics as well as an explosive and propellant in military and aerospace industries mahmudov and huang 2010 because of its high solubility and chemical stability kim and logan 2001 perchlorate can easily enter water and cause pollution furthermore perchlorate can interfere with the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones urbansky and schock 1999 which affects human metabolism and growth in a study conducted in 2010 it was found that 6 8 54 4 μg l perchlorate was detected in surface water samples from hengyang city hunan province wu et al 2010 a perchlorate concentration of 1 10 mg l was detected in groundwater near the nitrate deposit in the atacama desert chile duncan et al 2005 in california the highest concentration of perchlorate detected in well water was 280 μg l srinivasan and sorial 2009 nitrate no3 is widely present in surface water and groundwater and often coexists with perchlorate kimbrough and parekh 2007 ginkel et al 2008 it may cause methemoglobinemia in infants and could result in malformation and mutation when it was transformed into nitrosamines rocca et al 2007 groundwater nitrate pollution levels in the us and some european countries have risen to 200 mg l chen et al 2014 for contaminated groundwater sites perchlorate is usually present in low concentrations ppb range and nitrate is present in high concentrations ppm range matos et al 2006 nevertheless high concentration perchlorate ppm range pollution with the coexistence of nitrate occurred in the water near fireworks plant and rocket propellant manufacturing plant have been reported in recent years kosaka et al 2011 isobe et al 2013 nadaraja et al 2015 sijimol et al 2017 perchlorate concentration as high as 32 602 60 μg l was detected in ammonium perchlorate experimental plant water samples with an average value of 5094 87 μg l in pre monsoon sijimol et al 2017 meanwhile nitrate concentration in the water was 7 06 mg l therefore the high concentration of perchlorate in water threat caused by related fields could not be underestimated strategies for treating perchlorate and nitrate contaminated water include physical chemical and biological processes huq et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the physical chemical technologies such as ion exchange and reverse osmosis generate a brine waste that need to be further treated gu et al 2007 häyrynen et al 2009 chemical catalytic methods require high cost catalysts and restrict reaction conditions yao et al 2017 limiting theirs large scale field application compared with the physical and chemical methods biological reduction of perchlorate and nitrate is favored by researchers because of its high efficiency and low cost gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 microorganisms use electron donors to completely transform clo4 and no3 into innocuous cl and n2 under anaerobic conditions gao et al 2016 which achieves the transformation of pollutant form according to the type of electron donors biological methods can be divided into heterotrophic and autotrophic methods acetate lactate and methanol are the common carbon sources and electron donors for heterotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate foglar and briški 2003 shrout and parkin 2006 wan et al 2018a the main advantages of the heterotrophic method are the high reduction rates and treatment capacity karanasios et al 2010 guan et al 2015 ucar et al 2016b for heterotrophic reduction process with acetate as the electron donor the stoichiometric of denitrification process has been studied for many years and the eq 1 includes the biomass growth and is often

previous studies have shown that the carbon source dosage was affected by the type of carbon source and the concentration of pollutants gómez et al 2000 chiu and chung 2003 shrout and parkin 2006 fernández nava et al 2010 wan et al 2018a from practical aspects the dose of carbon source is not easy to control when the carbon source is in excess the residual organics in the effluent can support microbial growth in water distribution systems resulting in the formation of toxic trihalomethanes during disinfection via chlorination thrash et al 2007 therefore post treatment such as the aerobic polishing stage is needed after the heterotrophic process zhang et al 2005 when the carbon source is insufficient pollutants cannot be completely degraded in addition inorganic electron donors such as hydrogen zero valent iron and elemental sulfur s0 may be used for the autotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate logan and lapoint 2002 cai et al 2008 oh et al 2016 s0 has gained significant attention in recent years wang et al 2016 guo et al 2017 for sulfur autotrophic reduction process the stoichiometric equation of denitrification process has been studied for many years and the eq 3 includes the biomass growth and is often used in many researches oh et al 2003 sahinkaya et al 2014 wan et al 2017 meanwhile the stoichiometric equation for perchlorate was still unclear eq 4 is the most commonly used equation based on redox balance and is used in many studies without consideration of biomass yield ju et al 2008 wan et al 2017 the stoichiometric equations for autotrophic

could eliminate secondary contamination caused by residual organics it generates sulfate so4 2 and consumes the alkalinity of the effluent moon et al 2006 ju et al 2007 meanwhile s0 disproportionation always occurred in the process of sulfur autotrophic reduction of perchlorate ju et al 2008 wan et al 2017 2018a the disproportionation is a reaction in which the reactant itself not only acts as an oxidizing agent but also as a reducing agent microorganisms use s0 for disproportionation to produce sulfate and sulfide the s0 disproportionation is shown in eq 5 ju et al 2008 5 4 s 0 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 3 h 2 s 2 h in order to make up for the deficiencies of heterotrophic or autotrophic processes this study developed a combined heterotrophic sulfur autotrophic system chsas for the reduction of perchlorate and nitrate in the combined system the dosage of the carbon source added to the heterotrophic part h part was insufficient to avoid the threat of organic secondary pollution meanwhile the hrt and carbon source dosage were changed to adjust the load of the sulfur autotrophic part s part thereby controlling the so4 2 production in addition the alkalinity produced by the h part was consumed by s part allowing that the ph value in s part effluent maintain balance with the influent at present most of the studies on mixotrophic reduction are related to denitrification liu et al 2009 zhao et al 2011a b sahinkaya and kilic 2014 tong et al 2014 for nitrate and perchlorate co existing pollution the studies are still very limited ucar et al 2017 evaluated the performance of a heterotrophic autotrophic sequential system for nitrate and perchlorate removal under a single operational condition c n 2 44 and hrt 2 h however the competition of the two pollutants for different electron donors the effects of key operational parameters such as the hrt and organic carbon source dosage were not systemically explored control strategies for secondary pollution especially for sulfate and organic carbon and methods to maintain ph balance which are the important aspects of the chsas technology still deserve further research besides studies using high throughput sequencing to describe the microbial community structure in the chsas for perchlorate and nitrate reduction are still inadequate previous studies have mostly focused on the treatment of co contamination of nitrate with high concentration ppm range and perchlorate with low concentration ppb range logan and lapoint 2002 matos et al 2006 zhao et al 2014 ucar et al 2017 wan et al 2017 hydrogen autotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate has been extensively investigated sahu et al 2009a gao et al 2016 chen et al 2017 epsztein et al 2017 logan and lapoint 2002 explored hydrogen autotrophic reduction of perchlorate 73 2 μg l and nitrate 21 2 mg n l in a packed bed bioreactor the removal efficiencies reached 25 and 10 respectively zhao et al 2014 used h2 fed two stages membrane biofilm reactor mbfr to remove perchlorate 160 200 μg l and nitrate 8 9 mg n l from water they found that most of nitrate was removed in the lead mbfr while perchlorate was mainly removed in the lag mbfr however the problem of high concentration perchlorate and nitrate pollution cannot be underestimated isobe et al 2013 sijimol et al 2017 hence this study use high concentrations ppm range perchlorate and nitrate as the research object the main objectives of the present study were to 1 evaluate the chsas reduction process for the simultaneous removal of clo4 and no3 2 explore the control strategies for secondary pollution focusing on sulfate and organic carbon 3 explore methods to maintain ph and alkalinity consumption balance 4 determine the dominant microbial community members involved in clo4 and no3 removal in each part 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experimental set up consisted of the acetate heterotrophic part h part and the sulfur autotrophic part s part two cylindrical plexiglas columns were established as the up flow bioreactors the h part 5 cm inner diameter contained elastic space packing yan shanpc co ltd beijing china with a packed height of 45 cm the s part 10 cm inner diameter was filled with s0 granules yan shanpc co ltd beijing china of 2 4 mm diameter with a packed height of 37 cm the working volumes of the two bioreactors were 0 84 l and 0 90 l respectively a peristaltic pump longer bt100 2j china was used to feed synthetic water into the h part and then into the s part through three way connection this study simulated contaminated water with high concentration of perchlorate ppm range and co existence nitrate the synthetic water was prepared using tap water with naclo4 h2o and nano3 as the contaminants the influent concentrations of clo4 and no3 n were 19 03 20 10 mg l and 18 45 22 95 mg l respectively sodium acetate ch3coona was selected as the sole exogenous electron donor and carbon source in the h part kh2po4 was added to the feed as a source of phosphorous at a concentration of 3 18 mg l nahco3 100 00 mg l was employed as buffer medium wan et al 2017 2019 other influent water parameters were as follows so4 2 was 80 74 99

medium the reactor was inoculated with concentrated activated sludge from the wulongkou wastewater treatment plant zhengzhou china the amounts of inoculated culture were approximately 6 g mlvss for the acetate heterotrophic reactor and the sulfur autotrophic reactor a standard basal medium was prepared by adding the following elements nano3 100 00 mg l naclo4 h2o 100 00 mg l ch3coona 874 00 mg l only in h part and nahco3 100 00 mg l phosphorus sources such as k2hpo4 3h2o and kh2po4 were added to the basal medium at 5 00 mg l the trace metal solution 1 00 ml l used in the experiment was improved based on previous studies ju et al 2008 wan et al 2019 the two reactors were operated with an hrt of 8 0 h for 15 days respectively before shifting to the heterotrophic autotrophic continuous experiment 2 3 experimental design after 15 days of acclimation the reactors achieved stable conditions in this condition the fluctuation of effluent indicators the concentrations of clo4 no3 n so4 2 and npoc ph value alkalinity were less than 5 then the heterotrophic autotrophic continuous experiment was performed the experiment consisted of three stages with total hrt durations maintained at 4 0 h 1 5 h and 1 0 h each operation stage lasted for more than 50 days at each of the different hrts five acetate concentrations 210 mg l 140 mg l 100 mg l 70 mg l and 35 mg l were tested table s1 lists the conditions applied during each experimental stage for the chsas the effluent indicators were allowed to operate for 10 days before the next stage commenced 2 4 analytical methods all samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and stored at 4 c until analysis clo4 no3 and so4 2 concentrations were measured by ion chromatography ics 2100 dionex america equipped with a 4 250 mm as20 analytical column and a 4 50 mm ag20 guard column the eluent concentration was 25 mm koh and the flow rate was 1 0 ml min the injection volume was 25 μl and the retention times of clo4 and no3 were 20 70 and 6 66 min respectively the method detection limits of clo4 and no3 were 2 μg l and 50 μg l respectively no2 was analyzed using the n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine colorimetric method tu 1900 persee

l cpn cn200 shimadzu japan 2 5 dna extraction illumina miseq sequencing and data analysis six microorganism samples were collected from the inoculated sludge n 1 and the acclimated bacteria at different locations within the bioreactors n 5 specifically bioreactor samples were taken during the steady state period hrt 1 5 h acetate 35 mg l from the h part bottom hb 1 5 h h part top ht 1 5 h s part bottom sb 1 5 h s part middle sm 1 5 h and s part top st 1 5 h the samples were immediately stored at 4 c for further processing dna was extracted using an e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega the integrity of dna was detected using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using bacterial primers 341f and 805r the pcr procedures were mixed with dna and sequenced using the pe 300 strategy via illumina miseq 2 300 platform sangon china the low quality reads containing one or more ambiguous bases were deleted and the chimera sequences were removed using the uchime to ensure quality wan et al 2016 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of perchlorate and nitrate previous studies have shown that both the hrt and carbon source are crucial elements for biodegradation of perchlorate and nitrate zhu et al 2016 in this study the performance of the chsas was investigated by varying the hrt from 4 0 h to 1 0 h and adjusting the concentration of acetate from 210 mg l to 35 mg l according to eq 1 71 31 mg l acetate is required to reduce 20 mg l no3 n in a previous study wan et al 2018a the optimal acetate perchlorate m m ratio was 1 78 3 fold of the theoretical value calculated by eq 2 that is 35 60 mg l 1 78 20 35 60 mg l acetate is required to reduce 20 mg l clo4 therefore the reduction of 20 mg l clo4 and no3 n requires 106 91 mg l acetate consequently an acetate concentration of 35 mg l represents an insufficient carbon source and 210 mg l is equivalent to an excessive carbon source the removal performance of perchlorate and nitrate under different operational condition is represented in fig 1 the results indicated that the removal efficiency of the h part was dependent on the carbon source dosage when the acetate concentration decreased from 210 mg l to 35 mg l at hrt 4 0 h the clo4 concentration in the effluent of the h part increased from 0 39 mg l to 19 67 mg l and the no3 n concentration in the effluent of the h part increased from 0 05 mg l to 16 13 mg l fig 1a and b the residual contaminants could be further reduced in the s part under all operation conditions the concentrations of clo4 and no3 n were below 1 18 mg l and 0 20 mg l respectively in final effluent fig 1a and b when the hrt gradually changed from 4 0 h to 1 0 h the clo4 removal efficiency for the h part was affected when the concentration of acetate was fixed at 210 mg l fig 1c the clo4 removal efficiency in h part decreased to 80 18 as the hrt dropped to 1 0 h meanwhile there was no obvious effect on no3 n removal 99 52 fig 1d in brief decreasing the carbon source dosage and shortening the hrt had a detrimental effect on the reduction of both perchlorate and nitrate in h part but the nitrate was easier to reduce than perchlorate fig 1c and d previous studies have found that the presence of nitrate inhibits perchlorate reductase enzyme resulting in the decrease in perchlorate reduction rate ucar et al 2016b therefore when clo4 and no3 co exist no3 is the favorable electron acceptor and is preferentially reduced by the microorganisms zhao et al 2011a additionally the decreased acetate concentration and shortened hrt resulted in the accumulation of no2 n in h part up to 7 44 mg l at an hrt of 1 0 h whereas the s part further reduced no2 n and the concentration in the effluent was always lower than 0 10 mg l fig 1b under all operating conditions pollutants were removed efficiently in the chsas when the acetate concentration was 35 mg l under an hrt of 1 0 h the removal efficiencies of perchlorate and nitrate in the h part were only 1 82 and 33 78 respectively after further biological reduction by the s part the final removal efficiency of perchlorate and nitrate reached 97 80 and 99 12 respectively thus even with a short hrt and insufficient carbon source the h part and s part cooperated to achieve high removal efficiencies of the co existing perchlorate and nitrate 3 2 so4 2 generation and control in order to investigate so4 2 generation in the combined system the so4 2 concentration was analyzed in each part when the carbon source was sufficient the heterotrophic microorganisms could reduce part of the sulfate when the acetate concentration was in excess 210 mg l and the hrt was 4 0 h and 1 5 h approximately 38 67 and 12 47 so4 2 respectively was reduced in the h part fig 2 a at the same time 6 09 mg l s2 was detected in the h part with 210 mg l acetate and an hrt of 4 0 h under other operating conditions the concentration of so4 2 84 15 101 00 mg l in the effluent of the h part was close to that in the influent 80 74 97 28 mg l during all stages the so4 2 concentration in the s part was higher than the theoretical value calculated by eqs 3 and 4 indicating that s0 disproportionation had occurred ju et al 2007 hence in this study the generated so4 2 in the s part had three sources perchlorate removal nitrate removal and s0 disproportionation the theoretical increase in so4 2 was calculated by the following formula 6 c c l o 4 c i n f c l o 4 c e f f c l o 4 1 29 7 c n o 3 n c i n f n o 3 n c e f f n o 3 n 7 18 8 c s c e f f s o 4 2 c i n f s o 4 2 c c l o 4 c n o 3 n where c c l o 4 c n o 3 n and c s are the theoretical sulfate concentrations mg l produced by perchlorate reduction nitrate reduction and s0 disproportionation respectively c i n f c l o 4 and c e f f c l o 4 are influent and effluent perchlorate concentrations mg l in s part respectively c i n f n o 3 n and c e f f n o 3 n are influent and effluent nitrate concentrations mg l in s part respectively c i n f s o 4 2 and c e f f s o 4 2 are influent and effluent sulfate concentrations mg l in s part respectively the coefficients of 1 29 and 7 18 are determined by eqs 3 and 4 respectively the theoretical increase in so4 2 concentrations in the s part under each operational condition and their distribution is shown in fig 2b it should be noted that more so4 2 was generated in the s part when the acetate concentration in the h part was lower under hrt of 4 0 h when the acetate concentration was 210 mg l the theoretical increase in so4 2 concentration was 51 27 mg l while when the acetate concentration decreased to 35 mg l the theoretical increase in so4 2 concentration reached 227 62 mg l when the dosage of acetate in the h part was reduced the s part should bear more removal load resulting in more so4 2 generation in addition the hrt also had an effect on the generated so4 2 in the s part which was mainly reflected in the s0 disproportionation when the hrt was shortened from 4 0 h to 1 0 h with a fixed acetate concentration in the h part of 35 mg l the theoretical concentration of so4 2 produced by s0 disproportionation decreased from 87 26 mg l to 29 94 mg l and the corresponding theoretical proportion of so4 2 generated by s0 disproportionation decreased from 38 31 to 18 22 wan et al 2017 found that when the hrt was long 1 0 h both nitrate and perchlorate decreased to low concentrations and s0 disproportionation was accelerated in the sulfur autotrophic system a long hrt increases the contact time of water with sulfur which promotes s0 disproportionation therefore it is not recommended to use a chsas to reduce perchlorate and nitrate under long hrts fig s2 indicates the theoretical proportion of so4 2 production in the s part of the chsas under different operating conditions with a lower acetate dosage in h part the so4 2 theoretical proportion produced by the reduction of clo4 and no3 gradually increased and the so4 2 theoretical proportion produced by s0 disproportionation gradually decreased as the acetate concentration was reduced from 210 mg l to 35 mg l at an hrt of 4 0 h the theoretical proportion of so4 2 generated by clo4 and no3 reduction increased from 1 15 to 10 99 and 0 40 to 50 70 respectively in other words the theoretical proportion of so4 2 generated by s0 disproportionation decreased from 98 45 to 38 31 this phenomenon is related to the influent nitrate and perchlorate concentrations of the s part as reported s0 disproportionation is mainly accelerated when perchlorate is reduced to low concentrations whereas it is restricted when nitrate is not completely removed wan et al 2017 when the carbon source was sufficient 210 mg l acetate the pollutants in the h part were almost completely reduced and the s part mainly performed s0 disproportionation both the nitrate and perchlorate concentrations in the influent of the s part were low at an hrt 1 0 h the concentrations of clo4 and no3 n in the s part influent were 3 89 mg l and 0 10 mg l respectively thus s0 disproportionation was accelerated when the carbon source was insufficient 35 mg l acetate the perchlorate and nitrate reduction were mainly performed in the s part both the nitrate and perchlorate concentrations in the influent of the s part were high at an hrt 1 0 h the concentrations of clo4 and no3 n in the s part influent were 19 35 mg l and 14 93 mg l respectively thus s0 disproportionation could be restricted the gibb s free energies of perchlorate and nitrate reduction were calculated to be 2397 73 kj mol and 2595 95 kj mol respectively indicating that the reduction reaction was spontaneous at the same time the gibb s free energy of nitrate reduction was less than that of perchlorate reduction indicating that nitrate reduction was more likely to occur than perchlorate reduction on the other hand the gibb s free energy of s0 disproportionation is 103 31 kj mol indicating that the reaction is non spontaneous process however s0 disproportionation always occurred in the process of sulfur autotrophic reduction of perchlorate sahu et al 2009b boles et al 2012 wan et al 2017 2019 indicating that only chemical thermodynamics analysis is not enough to predict the reaction direction and extent and the involvement of microbial reaction complicates the reaction which needs further study s2 was detected in the s part effluent as a product of s0 disproportionation fig 2a shows that when the hrt was longer and the carbon source was sufficient at an hrt 4 0 h the concentrations of acetate was 210 mg l a higher concentration of s2 14 42 mg l was detected in the s part effluent adjusting the hrt and acetate concentration inhibited the s0 disproportionation reaction and also decreased the concentration of s2 in the s part effluent thus s0 disproportionation an unfavorable side reaction generated excessive so4 2 and s2 thereby limiting the application of autotrophic sulfur reduction however in this combined system a short hrt and low carbon source dosage effectively restricted s0 disproportionation in the s part 3 3 residual organic carbon in the effluent the variation of npoc in the influent and effluent from the h part and s part under different operational conditions is shown in fig 3 the residual organic carbon in the h part could be further decomposed and utilized in the s part and the secondary pollution could be effectively avoided by controlling the carbon source dosage and the hrt under an hrt 1 0 h when the acetate concentration was 210 mg l the npoc of the effluent from the h part was 38 45 2 90 mg l and the residual carbon source in the final effluent from the s part was 17 27 3 68 mg l indicating that the organic secondary pollution in the final effluent was serious when the acetate concentration was further reduced to 70 mg l the npoc of the final effluent was less than 1 94 mg l indicating that the organic secondary pollution in the final effluent was avoided under a longer hrt hrt 4 0 h even at a high acetate dosage 210 mg l less organic carbon remained in the effluent of both the h part and s part 12 39 mg l and 3 07 mg l npoc respectively it is speculated that a long hrt is beneficial because microorganisms can make full use of the carbon sources to reduce pollutants and sulfate as well as maintain their own growth therefore an appropriate hrt and organic carbon source can eliminate secondary pollution caused by residual organic carbon under the premise of guaranteeing a high removal efficiency of the reactor 3 4 ph variation and alkalinity consumption the variation of ph and alkalinity in the influent and effluent under different operational conditions is shown in fig 4 under all conditions the influent ph was between 7 55 and 8 09 the ph of effluent from the h part ranged from 8 09 to 8 77 according to eqs 1 and 2 the heterotrophic reduction processes of clo4 and no3 is accompanied by the generation of oh therefore across all test stages the ph of the effluent from the h part was higher than that of the influent meanwhile the ph of the effluent from the s part was between 6 85 and 7 98 which was lower than the h part throughout the operation time h was produced by sulfur autotrophic reduction of clo4 and no3 eqs 3 and 4 at the same time s0 disproportionation also generated h eq 5 those three sources of h led to a low ph in the s part the influent alkalinity varied between 199 57 and 349 41 mg l since the heterotrophic reduction of clo4 and no3 produced alkalinity in the h part the alkalinity of the effluent from the h part was higher than that of the influent the decreased acetate concentration led to the decreased alkalinity production of the h part when the acetate concentration was lowered from 210 mg l to 35 mg l at hrt 1 0 h the generated alkalinity of the h part decreased from 126 69 mg l to 45 21 mg l in the s part theoretically 1 34 mg caco3 alkalinity is consumed to reduce 1 0 mg clo4 3 91 mg caco3 alkalinity is consumed to reduce 1 0 mg no3 n and 1 04 mg caco3 alkalinity is consumed to generate 1 0 mg so4 2 by s0 disproportionation when the hrt was 4 0 h and the acetate concentration was decreased from 210 mg l to 35 mg l the consumed alkalinity increased from 56 93 mg l to 183 62 mg l which was very close to the theoretical value 53 53 mg l to 179 61 mg l when the acetate concentration was 35 mg l and the hrt was shortened from 4 0 h to 1 0 h the consumed alkalinity decreased from 183 62 mg l to 139 89 mg l therefore the chsas is able to achieve balanced ph and alkalinity in the effluent when the carbon source dosage and hrt are adjusted in summary the optimal operating conditions of the chsas were at hrt 1 0 h and 70 mg l acetate under such conditions the clo4 and no3 removal efficiencies were 95 43 and 99 23 respectively and there was no accumulation of no2 n in effluent 0 10 0 03 mg l the effluent ph and alkalinity can maintain a balance with the influent additionally the increased so4 2 concentration was 94 43 mg l and the so4 2 concentration in final effluent was 192 02 mg l which is lower than the secondary drinking water regulations of us epa 250 mg l the concentration of residual organic carbon in the effluent was less than 1 83 mg l indicating that the secondary pollution was eliminated thus in the chsas an insufficient carbon source in the h part avoids secondary pollution and the low load of the s part reduces the production of sulfate while at the same time balancing the ph and alkalinity of the effluent 3 5 microbial community analysis 3 5 1 microbial community diversity high throughput sequencing technology was adopted to analyze six microorganism samples the number of raw sequences of all samples was over 34 000 after quality control the effective number of sequences exceeded 33 647 for ease of analysis and comparison the number of sequences was normalized to 31 000 the coverage of all samples was greater than 99 indicating that the probability of an undetected sequence was very low and that the sequencing results represented the actual microbial community the samples the alpha diversity of the sample reflects the abundance and diversity of the microbial community and can be represented by the chao 1 ace and shannon indices as well as the operational taxonomic units otus hwang et al 2012 table 1 summarizes the parameters associated with alpha diversity the measured richness estimators of the inoculated sludge were the largest indicating that this sample had the highest microbial abundance and diversity conversely the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the bioreactor was obviously lower than the inoculum in the h part the abundance and diversity of the microbial community gradually decreased along the height of the reactor because clo4 and no3 were the only electron acceptors some microorganisms that did not participate in the specific reduction reactions were gradually outcompeted leading to a decreased microbial community abundance and diversity in the s part the shannon chao and ace indices first increased and then decreased along the height of the reactor when the hrt was 1 5 h and the acetate concentration was 35 mg l the concentrations of clo4 and no3 in the s part influent were 19 38 mg l and 15 27 mg l respectively it is inferred that the pollutant reduction reactions occurred mainly at the bottom of the reactor and that the microbial community structure was simple when the concentration of pollutants was reduced to a low level s0 disproportionation was accompanied by reduction reactions in the middle of the reactor which resulted in an increased microbial community abundance and diversity s0 disproportionation mainly occurred at the top of the reactor due to the depletion of electron acceptors wan et al 2017 resulting in a decreased community diversity unifrac analysis uses evolutionary information between sample sequences to compare microbial population differences in evolutionary lineages unifrac can be used for beta diversity analysis that is a comparative analysis between two samples by obtaining a unifrac distance matrix lozupone et al 2011 as shown in fig 5 heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria each formed a cluster the similarity between the bottom and the top part of the h part was 82 68 the similarity of the bottom and middle part of the s part was 83 37 while the similarity with the top part was 70 85 the clo4 and no3 reduction processes mainly occur in the bottom and middle part of the s part therefore the similarity was higher than the top part compared with the s part the h part had a higher similarity with the inoculated sludge 58 05 this is likely because the inoculated sludge comes from a heterotrophic environment 3 5 2 bacterial taxonomic identification the results of the a taxonomic tree and b taxonomic classification at the genus level are shown in fig 6 the results indicated that the microbial community was mainly composed of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi fig s3 shows the taxonomic classification at phylum level for each sample proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the dominant bacteria in the microbial samples of the h part the abundance of proteobacteria increased from 62 22 to 70 49 along the height of the reactor many of the confirmed perchlorate reducing and denitrifying bacteria belong to proteobacteria zhu et al 2016 under heterotrophic conditions the rapid growth rate of microorganisms leads to an increased abundance of proteobacteria the abundance of chloroflexi increased from 5 24 to 5 75 in contrast the abundance of bacteroidetes decreased from 19 64 to 14 83 fig s3 in the s part proteobacteria had an absolute advantage and its abundance decreased from 86 99 bottom to 84 45 middle to 57 45 top along the height of the reactor as the concentration of clo4 and no3 gradually decreased the electron acceptors were gradually depleted leading to a gradual decrease in the proportion of proteobacteria similarly the abundance of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi gradually decreased from 3 43 to 2 66 and 4 01 to 2 74 respectively along the height of reactor the enrichment of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi has been described in previous studies on sulfur autotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate zhang et al 2015 2017 significantly the abundance of chlorobi which may be related to s0 disproportionation increased from 0 94 to 30 84 along the height of the reactor analysis at the genus level can further understand the function of microorganisms fig 6b summarizes the most representative genera abundance 1 in the h part thauera was the most dominant genus with an abundance greater than 31 thauera and comamonas can use organic carbon sources to reduce nitrate under anaerobic conditions etchebehere et al 2001 mechichi et al 2005 yun et al 2018 claims that thauera and comamonas are versatile pollutant reducing bacteria therefore it is speculated that they have the ability to reduce perchlorate in this study pseudomonas can use acetate as an electron donor for the reduction of perchlorate and nitrate to obtain energy under anoxic conditions shah 2014 liu et al 2018 in summary thauera comamonas and pseudomonas are effective denitrifying bacteria db perchlorate reducing bacteria prb in this study in addition the abundance of owenweeksia which belong to the phylum bacteroidetes lau et al 2005 reached 6 89 in the h part however whether it played a positive role in the degradation of perchlorate and nitrate requires further study the dominant genera in the s part were ferritrophicum thiobacillus and sulfurospirillum wan et al 2017 speculated that ferritrophicum acts as a db in sulfur autotrophic reduction perchlorate and nitrate systems in this study the maximum abundance of ferritrophicum reached 23 97 suggesting that ferritrophicum may be related to the reduction of perchlorate and nitrate db prb the genera sulfurospirillum and sulfurovum have the ability to oxidize sulfides while reducing nitrate or perchlorate wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 geobacter has been identified in previous studies on the microbial reduction of nitrate or perchlorate wen et al 2017 wan et al 2018b in this study its abundance was maintained at approximately 4 83 in the reactor and it is speculated to be a db prb the abundances of thiobacillus sulfurimonas and sulfurisoma decreased along the reactor height from 11 11 to 0 71 4 95 0 45 and 7 89 3 02 respectively they are the common db that use elemental sulfur sulfides and thiosulfate to reduce no3 and no2 kelly and wood 2000 zhang et al 2009 kojima and fukui 2014 some nitrate reducers can use perchlorate as an electron acceptor srinivasan and sorial 2009 thereby indicating that in this study thiobacillus sulfurimonas and sulfurisoma have the ability to simultaneously reduce perchlorate and nitrate db prb desulfocapsa is sulfate reducing bacteria srb that reduce sulfur oxides such as sulfates sulfites thiosulfates and s0 to hydrogen sulfide abed et al 2011 in this study the maximum abundance of desulfocapsa was 8 82 in middle of the reactor the excess theoretical value of so4 2 produced by the s part was attributed to the presence of the genus chlorobaculum chlorobaculum tepidum is a green sulfur bacterium belonging to the chlorobi phylum and has the ability to oxidize sulfide and s0 to so4 2 rodriguez et al 2011 green sulfur bacteria are specialized anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria and their growth requires the simultaneous presence of light and sulfide marschall et al 2010 the s part was an anaerobic environment with the presence of s0 and the reactor was exposed to natural light providing the necessary conditions for the growth of chlorobaculum the abundance of chlorobaculum increased dramatically from 0 50 to 28 29 at the top part of reactor wan et al 2017 found that s0 disproportionation notably occurs at the top of reactors during sulfur autotrophic reduction of perchlorate and nitrate when accompanied by an increase of chloroobaculum therefore it is considered that chlorobaculum is closely related to s0 disproportionation 4 conclusion the effective removal of perchlorate and nitrate by microorganisms was achieved in the chsas and the removal efficiencies of perchlorate and nitrate were higher than 93 96 shortening the hrt and decreasing the influent acetate concentration inhibited s0 disproportionation thereby reducing the production of so4 2 the alkalinity and ph of the effluent were balanced with the influent by adjusting the influent acetate concentration and the hrt at the same time the s part further reduced the pollutants and the residual organic carbon from the h part eliminated the secondary pollution and achieved synergism microbial community analysis showed that the perchlorate and nitrate reducing bacteria of the h part were different from those of the s part the appearance of chlorobaculum was related to the occurrence of s0 disproportionation this study systematically investigated the reduction performance of chsas for high concentration perchlorate ppm range pollution with the coexistence of nitrate occurred in the water establishing a practical foundation for treatment of potential water contaminated by perchlorate and nitrate with high concentrations ppm range in the future declaration of competing interest
