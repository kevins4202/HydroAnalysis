1600,the contaminant situation at a norwegian firefighting training facility ftf was investigated 15 years after the use of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos based aqueous film forming foams afff products had ceased detailed mapping of the soil and groundwater at the ftf field site in 2016 revealed high concentrations of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas pfos accounted for 96 of the total pfas concentration in the soil with concentrations ranging from 0 3 μg kg to 6500 μg kg the average concentration of pfos in the groundwater down gradient of the site was 22 μg l 6 5 44 4 μg l accounting for 71 of the total pfas concentration to get a better understanding of the historic fate of afff used at the site unsaturated column studies were performed with pristine soil with a similar texture and mineralogy as found at the ftf and the same pfos containing afff used at the site transport and attenuation processes governing pfas behavior were studied with focus on cold climate conditions and infiltration during snow melting the main groundwater recharge process at the ftf low and high water infiltration rates of respectively 4 9 and 9 7 mm day were applied for 14 and 7 weeks thereby applying the same amount of water but changing the aqueous saturation of the soil columns the low infiltration rate represented 2 years of snow melting while the high infiltration rate can be considered to mimic the extra water added in the areas with intensive firefighting training in the low infiltration experiment pfos was not detected in the column leachate over the complete 14 weeks with high infiltration pfos was detected after 14 days and concentrations increased from 20 ng l to 2200 ng l at the end of the experiment 49 days soil was extracted from the columns in 5 cm layers and showed pfos concentrations in the range 0 21 1700 μg kg in the low infiltration column a clear maximum was observed at a soil depth of 30 cm no pfos was detected below 60 cm depth in the high infiltration column pfos concentration ranged from 7 4 to 1000 μg kg with highest concentrations found at 22 32 cm depth in this case pfos was detected down to the deepest sample 90 cm based on the field study retardation factors for the average vertical transport of pfos in the unsaturated zone were estimated to be 33 42 and 16 21 for the areas with a low and high afff impact respectively the estimated retardation factors for the column experiments were much lower at 6 5 and 5 8 for low and high infiltration respectively this study showed that pfos is strongly attenuated in the unsaturated zone and mobility is dependent on infiltration rate the results also suggest that the attenuation rate increases with time graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfas pfos afff column study unsaturated zone sorption retardation 1 introduction aqueous film forming foam afff containing per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas has been used extensively since the first development by 3m ansul and national foam companies in the mid 1960 s place and field 2012 afff has surface tension lowering properties and spreads rapidly across the surface of hydrocarbon fuels cooling the liquid fuel by forming a water film beneath the foam resulting in superior firefighting capabilities schaefer et al 2008 the use of afff has resulted in pfas and especially perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos contamination of soil groundwater surface waters and biota worldwide ahrens et al 2015 anderson et al 2016 filipovic et al 2015 houtz et al 2013 there is a growing concern for negative consequences for the environment and human health with regards to use and exposure to pfas blume et al 2015 cousins et al 2016 kemi 2016 lindstrom et al 2011 the persistency bioaccumulation and toxicity of long chain pfass define them as persistent organic pollutants pops and those of most concern are listed as substances of very high concern svhc in the european chemical agency s echa blume et al 2015 brendel et al 2018 fate of pfas released to the soil environment is primarily dependent on infiltration and sorption to the solid matrix partitioning coefficients for pfos and other pfass to soil and sediments have been thoroughly investigated and reported in literature gellrich et al 2012 hale et al 2017 hellsing et al 2016 higgins and luthy 2006 johnson et al 2007 zareitalabad et al 2013 recent studies have shown that sorption to the air water interface can be a major contributor to the retention of pfos and pfoa under partially saturated conditions brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 the norwegian aviation organization avinor has made an inventory of pfas contaminated soil groundwater surface water and biota at several firefighting training facilities ftf throughout norway the studies have shown widespread leaching of pfas from the soil to nearby water courses and exposure of biota in both fresh water and marine environments avinor miljøprosjekt dp2 2012 this study focuses on one specific ftf where afff containing pfos has been used extensively since the early 1990 s until it was phased out in 2001 and replaced by fluorotelomer containing afff kemi 2015 all use of pfas containing firefighting foams was banned at the airport in 2011 avinor miljøprosjekt dp2 2012 the aviation authorities have raised the question how much of the pfos is still present in the source zone after 15 years without pfos application can these residual levels form a long term source potentially contaminating the groundwater at the site to answer this question extensive field studies at the ftf site were performed to map the present pfas contamination situation in the unsaturated soil profile and the groundwater to reconstruct the initial release scenario of afff used at this site unsaturated column studies were performed under environmentally relevant experimental conditions this model study allowed to compare field observations with an unknown contamination history with well controlled exposure of a similar soil the objective was to improve our understanding of the contamination history and potential transport and attenuation processes governing pfas behavior at this site to our knowledge this is the first study where the pfas contamination history at a ftf site has been studied in a controlled unsaturated column experiment using a complete afff mixture 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the ftf investigated in this work has a total size of 25 000 m2 and was established in 1989 1990 extensive use of afff at the site started after the airport opened for civil aviation in 1998 but the area has previously been used for firefighting training activities there are six firefighting training platforms at the ftf each designed with membranes and a collection system for fuel water and firefighting foam to protect the underlying groundwater most of the liquids used at the site have been collected and discharged to the local sewage system foam and water have also spread to the soil outside the training areas due to wind and the increased spraying range of modern firefighting engines soil and groundwater sampling in 2008 revealed pfas contaminated soil outside the collection areas and leaching to the groundwater 4 m below the surface norwegian pollution authority 2008 the amount of afff spread outside the collection areas and the water infiltration rate has varied across the ftf in some afff source zones there has been extensive use of water during firefighting training activities resulting in high infiltration while in other parts of the ftf infiltration has been limited to the yearly precipitation which is dominated by snow melting 2 2 infiltration at the ftf site the yearly precipitation in the area of the ftf is approximately 800 mm jørgensen and østmo 1990 the soil at the site is a uniform medium fine sand over the whole unsaturated zone down to the groundwater at 4 m depth with an organic carbon content below 1 the hydraulic conductivity ks at the site ranges from 10 3 to 10 5 m s french et al 2009 the water balance developed by jørgensen and østmo 1990 for the area showed that 50 400 mm of the annual precipitation is lost due to evapotranspiration and close to 60 240 mm of groundwater recharge is occurring during a 3 5 week long snowmelt period in spring while the remainder of the annual infiltration occurs during the autumn months it was estimated that water infiltrates through the unsaturated zone during the snowmelt period with a mean vertical velocity of 20 cm day at 20 saturation jørgensen and østmo 1990 french et al 1999 showed that the mean vertical velocity of infiltrating water in the springtime snowmelt period was approximately 5 2 mm per mm infiltration at an estimated saturation level between 18 5 and 20 8 infiltration was lower during the autumn and the vertical pore water velocity in the soil was estimated to be 7 7 mm mm in the summer months precipitation was balanced by evapotranspiration with no net infiltration french et al 1999 2 3 site investigation 2 3 1 soil soil and groundwater investigation was performed at the ftf site in 2016 and included soil sampling at 80 locations in the unsaturated zone around the firefighting training platforms trial pits were excavated for sampling of the soil profile all equipment was rinsed with methanol before sampling each point samples were collected from 0 to 1 m 1 2 m 2 3 m and from 3 m and down to the groundwater level at 4 m soil was transferred into sampling bags 1 l polyamide and stored at 4 c in the laboratory before being shipped to a commercial laboratory for analysis a total of 288 soil samples were analyzed for pfas content 2 3 2 groundwater groundwater was sampled at 5 pumping wells installed as part of a pump and treat remediation system down gradient of the site to intercept the plume spreading from the ftf a total of 19 sampling campaigns were performed during 2016 the samples were stored in hdpe bottles at 4 c before being shipped to a commercial laboratory for pfas analysis 2 4 column set up pristine soil from an area close to the ftf with similar texture and mineralogy was collected and used to construct columns for the infiltration experiment acrylic glass columns with an inner diameter of 14 cm were equipped with a water drain at the bottom consisting of a coarse metal grid covered by a fine stainless steel filter to prevent the sand from washing out fig 1 the columns were packed with sand by adding layers of 6 cm compacting each layer with a 900 g weight dropped four times until each column had a total length of approximately 1 m the total weight of the sand added to each column was recorded the sand was analyzed for grain size distribution water content total organic carbon toc and background levels of pfas the columns were placed in a temperature controlled room at 10 c a water reservoir 2l at the top of each column was used for infiltration the reservoir emptied through 25 needles to ensure uniform distribution over the whole surface area of the column imitating natural infiltration of rain droplets the soil surface in the columns was approximately 30 cm below the outlet of the needles the flow through the columns was gravity driven to simulate field conditions french et al 1999 leachate was collected and sampled at the bottom of the columns in plastic buckets 2 5 column infiltration rates the experiments were performed at low and high infiltration rates of 4 9 mm and 9 7 mm per day for respectively 14 and 7 weeks a total of 477 mm water was added in both the low and high infiltration experiment the water was weighed and manually poured into the top reservoir and allowed to drip on the soil 3 times per week 2 6 non reactive tracer test non reactive tracer nrt experiments were performed in the columns to estimate the unsaturated water transport through the columns at low and high infiltration rates by adding a solution of nacl in the top reservoir during steady state water infiltration at the stated rates leachate was sampled 3 times per week and analyzed for temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec 2 7 afff experiment afff concentrate containing pfos as the main pfas from the same supplier as assumed to have been used historically at the site was used in the experiments the afff concentrate was mixed with milli q water in a 1 100 ratio and whipped to a stable foam which was then applied to the soil surface of both columns the 1 100 diluted afff concentrate was analyzed to determine the exact pfas composition see appendix a table a1 when applied the afff was a dense foam fig 2a 24 h after the first infiltration of water the foam had disappeared from the surface but foam bubbles could still be observed in the voids of the upper part of the soil columns fig 2b 2 8 column leachate sampling the infiltration period was 14 and 7 weeks respectively for the low and high infiltration experiments leachate samples were collected 3 times per week for the low infiltration experiment and daily for the high infiltration experiment for leachate volumes 50 ml samples were combined with the sample from the subsequent day to ensure sufficient sample size for analytical requirements the samples were stored at 4 c before shipping to a commercial laboratory for pfas analysis 2 9 column soil sampling after the infiltration experiments were completed the soil was extracted from the columns in 5 cm intervals and analyzed for pfas content the water content was measured in the soil samples after the experiment to quantify and confirm the unsaturated conditions in the soil columns the samples were stored at 4 c before shipping to a commercial laboratory for analysis 2 10 chemical analysis the list of target pfas analyzed varied between the field study and the laboratory experiments the field samples were analyzed for 12 pfas compounds for soil and groundwater in the column study 30 pfas compounds were analyzed in soil and 23 pfas compounds were analyzed in leachate and the afff foam for a complete overview of the compounds analyzed see appendix a and c soil and leachate analyses were carried out at the accredited laboratory eurofins gfa lab service gmbh in germany using method din 38414 s14 din 38414 14 2011 based on acetonitrile extraction followed by analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry lc ms ms for soil samples and din 38407 f42 din 38407 42 2011 and quantification using lc ms ms for leachate samples 2 11 quality control and assurance following the nrt experiments the infiltration reservoirs were thoroughly cleaned and all needles changed no material that could influence pfas sorption behavior glass metal was used when handling samples from the afff experiment hdpe bottles were used to store samples until analysis reference samples of the soil used in the columns and water used for infiltration were analyzed to determine the background levels of pfas pfas analysis was carried out at an accredited laboratory deutsche akkreditierungsstelle gmbh following din en iso iec 17025 2005 internal isotopically labelled standards were added to all soil and leachate samples prior to pfas analysis pfas identification was based on retention time and molecule or fragment ions and quantification was carried out by comparison with the internal isotopically labelled standards analytical detection limits varied from 0 2 1 μg kg for the respective pfas in soil and was 0 3 ng l for each pfas in leachate 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas concentration in soil at the ftf field site pfas concentrations found in the soil samples at the ftf varied from 0 3 to 6500 μg kg pfos accounts for 96 of the σ 12 pfas analyzed in the soil samples and is therefore focused on in the following discussion of source zones with high and low afff impact 3 1 1 source zones with low afff impact in source zones with low impact of afff the soil sampled from 0 to 1 m depth revealed concentrations of pfos in the range of 100 to 900 μg kg the soil samples from 1 to 2 m depth contained much lower concentrations of pfos from 0 3 70 μg kg the pfos concentrations at sampling locations with low afff impact are given in fig 3a the soil was not analyzed below 2 m due to low pfos concentrations in the soil samples from 1 to 2 m 3 1 2 source zones with high afff impact the pfos concentrations in the unsaturated soil in source zones with high impact of afff are shown in fig 3b concentrations of pfos in the soil from 0 to 1 m were in the range of 500 to 3000 μg kg the soil from 1 to 2 m revealed the highest pfos concentrations ranging from 1000 to 6500 μg kg from 2 to 3 m the pfos concentrations ranged from 1000 to 3500 μg kg with a further reduction 1000 to 1200 μg kg at 3 4 m depth not all samples analyzed differences between the low and high impacted areas might indicate that the attenuation and transport processes of pfos differ at these sites the concentration of pfos in the soil profiles are in the same order of magnitude as reported previously at ftf sites in sweden australia and the us baduel et al 2017 filipovic et al 2015 mcguire et al 2014 in france dauchy et al 2019 took 44 soil cores at a ftf belonging to an abandoned refinery where activities probably ceased in 1984 the median concentration at the highest impacted areas was respectively 8701 and 12 112 μg kg σ 34 pfas the highest concentrations were found in the top 1 m and 50 to 99 of the pfas content was identified as fluorotelemers dominated by 6 2 fluorotelomer sulphonamide alkylbetaine 6 2 ftab perfluorosulfonates represented 1 to 46 of the pfas in the soil dominated by pfos pfos precursors were in general below 1 of the quantified pfas 3 2 pfas concentration in the groundwater at the ftf field site the groundwater concentration varies between the 5 pumping wells fig 4a the yearly average concentration for pfos in the wells was 22 μg l 6 5 44 4μg l accounting for 71 of the σ 12 pfas concentration 31 9 μg l the average concentrations of pfhxs and 6 2 fts were 2 9 μg l and 2 7 μg l respectively accounting for 9 and 8 of the σ 12 pfas concentration in the groundwater other pfas detected in the groundwater represented approximately 12 of σ 12 pfas quantified in the groundwater fig 4b the pfas concentration in the groundwater varies during the year as can be seen by the high standard deviations in the yearly average concentrations presented in fig 4b filipovic et al 2015 reported similar values at a swedish airport pfos up to 42 μg l was reported representing 80 of the 4 pfas analyzed at a us military site a maximum of 78 μg l pfos was found as well as pfhxs 360 μg l pfhxa 350 μg l 6 2 fts 220 μg l pfoa 220 μg l pfbs 150 μg l and 120 μg l pfpea backe et al 2013 other studies have reported considerably lower groundwater concentrations dauchy et al 2019 found pfas concentrations in the range of 4 to 8277 ng l where perfluorosulfonates represented 16 to 100 of σ 34 pfas dominated by pfhxs and pfos the remainder were perfluorocarboxylic acids c4 c8 6 2 fts and 6 2 ftab 3 3 results from non reactive tracer column study the non reactive tracer tests nrt in the unsaturated column study showed the first breakthrough of the tracer after 28 and 18 days at low and high infiltration rates respectively a maximum electrical conductivity was measured in the leachate after 56 and 28 days as shown in fig 5 the results showed average water flow velocities during the low and high infiltration experiments of 1 7 cm day and 3 2 cm day respectively the observed pore water velocities in the columns are in the same order of magnitude as estimated for snow melting by french et al 1999 this shows that the hydrological behavior of our re packed columns is representative of the field conditions at the site 3 4 concentration of pfas in the afff foam applied pfos is the most dominant constituent of the σ 23 pfas determined in the afff used in the column experiments with a concentration of 100 mg l after dilution accounting for 90 of the σ 23 pfas amount applied the other pfass detected in amounts larger than 0 5 of the σ 23 pfas amount in the diluted concentrate are pfhxs contributing with 6 3 pfbs with 1 2 pfhps with 1 4 pfhxa with 0 7 and pfoa with 0 8 of the σ 23 pfas amount in the diluted afff the pfas concentrations measured in the diluted afff concentrate 1 100 with q water are presented in appendix a 3 5 concentration of pfas in the column leachate 3 5 1 low infiltration experiment the concentrations of pfas detected in the column leachate for the low infiltration experiment are shown in fig 6a pfbs shows a first breakthrough after 14 days reaches a maximum concentration of 53 μg l after 56 63 days and decreases thereafter it seems to move through the column without retardation at a rate similar to that observed for the nrt subsequently a breakthrough and decrease of pfhxa pfpea and pfhpa are seen pfhxs by definition a long chain pfas buck et al 2011 is not attenuated to the same degree as other long chained pfass in the column soil pfhxs is showing a breakthrough after 35 days and reaches a maximum concentration of 130 μg l at the end of the experiment at 98 days pfos pfhxs pfhps and pfoa were detected surprisingly in the 7 and 14 days samples 100 of the initial amount of pfbs added to the column has been detected in the leachate at the end of the experiment while 45 of pfhxs and 29 of pfhps added has leached through the column pfos was not detected over 15 ng l during the experiment disregarding the early detection most likely due to error 6 of the σ 23 pfas in the afff applied had leached through the column at the end of the experiment but only 0 006 of the pfos in the applied afff 3 5 2 high infiltration experiment pfas concentrations detected in the leachate for the high infiltration rate experiment are shown in fig 6b the first detection of any pfas was after 7 days but the onset of a breakthrough can be observed from 14 days and onwards pfbs pfhxa and pfhxs seem to breakthrough simultaneously however pfhxs is the most dominant compound in the column leachate thereafter similar to the low infiltration experiment the maximum pfhxs concentration in the leachate is 71 μg l after 47 days approx 50 lower than in the low infiltration column pfbs and pfhxa reach an apparently stable concentration at 17 and 15 μg l respectively considerably lower than observed in the low infiltration column pfos concentrations are difficult to observe in fig 6b but pfos was detected in the leachate after 21 days at a concentration of 20 ng l which continued to increase to 2200 ng l at the end of the experiment this is a major difference between the two experiments since pfos was not detected above 15 ng l in the low infiltration experiment 87 of the total pfbs amount had leached through the column at the high infiltration rate in contrast to 100 at low infiltration pfhxs leaching was comparable in both experiments at 47 of the added amount in contrast only 2 of pfhps leached out at high infiltration compared to 29 at low infiltration the total amount of pfos leached in the low infiltration experiment was 0 006 while it was 0 05 in the high infiltration experiment for the sum detected pfas in the leachate the amount leached was slightly lower for the low infiltration experiment with 5 89 compared to 5 93 in the high infiltration experiment of σ 23 pfas added 3 6 distribution of pfas in the soil columns 3 6 1 low infiltration experiment pfas analysis of the soil in the column at the end of the experiment showed that short chain pfas were less attenuated than long chained pfas as presented in figs 7a and 8a pfos was the most retarded pfas at low infiltration with concentrations ranging from 0 21 1700 μg kg in the soil and a maximum concentration detected at 30 cm depth in the soil columns previous column studies have not analyzed remaining pfas concentrations in the soil matrix however similar retention patterns have been reported where short chain pfas are less retarded in the soil than long chained pfas vierke et al 2014 gellrich et al 2012 3 6 2 high infiltration experiment the pfas analysis of the soil in the column at the end of the high infiltration experiment showed similar to the low infiltration experiment that short chain pfas were attenuated less than long chained pfas figs 7b and 8b the pfos concentration in the soil ranged from 7 4 to 1000 μg kg with the highest concentrations observed in a zone at 22 32 cm depth the highest pfos concentration was approximately 60 of the maximum concentration in the low infiltration experiment this might be a consequence of a reduced pore water concentration at the high infiltration rate resulting in reduced sorption to the soil matrix the presence of pfos in the column leachate is indicative of reduced sorption and increased vertical transport 3 7 comparison of retardation factors in field and column experiments the retardation factors for pfos in the unsaturated zone at the ftf are estimated based on an assumed average vertical water velocity from snowmelt infiltration of 4 9 7 5 cm day during 3 weeks 200 300 mm in addition autumn infiltration of 160 mm precipitation with an infiltration rate of 7 7 mm mm results in an estimated yearly vertical pore water transport of 227 280 cm french et al 1999 for the low impact areas pfos is mainly found at 1 m depth assuming pfos use ended 15 years ago this results in an average yearly vertical pfos transport rate of 6 7 cm year during the 15 years that have passed from these data a retardation factor of 33 42 can be estimated for the high impact areas the yearly average vertical velocity might be higher due to the extra water added during firefighting activities assuming the same average vertical water velocity as for low impact areas vertical transport for pfos down to 2 m is observed resulting in a pfos transport rate of 13 3 cm year and a retardation factor of 16 21 for pfos at high impact areas in the soil columns the vertical distance travelled for the center of mass of pfos in the soil columns was 25 5 and 27 cm respectively for the low and high infiltration experiment this results in mean pfos transport rates of 0 26 cm day and 0 55 cm day respectively the nrt showed average vertical water velocities of 1 7 cm day and 3 2 cm day for low and high infiltration respectively this gives retardation factors of 6 5 and 5 8 at low and high infiltration rate respectively based on these retardation factors and assuming a mean volumetric water content of 20 apparent distribution coefficients kd for pfos of 4 0 5 1 l kg and 1 9 2 5 l kg can be estimated for low and high impacted areas at the ftf respectively apparent kd values of 0 8 and 0 7l kg for the column studies with low and high infiltration respectively can be estimated with the same volumetric water content as for the field estimates these kd values are in the range of values reported for pfos in literature gellrich et al 2012 hale et al 2017 hellsing et al 2016 higgins and luthy 2006 johnson et al 2007 zareitalabad et al 2013 compiled in appendix b zareitalabad et al 2013 reports kd values for the sorption of pfos to various soils and sediments in the range of 1 and 35 3 l kg for the sandy soil in our study the value reported for ottowa sand of 2 8 l kg could be expected johnson et al 2007 the lower retardation factors for pfos in the column experiments compared to those estimated for field conditions at the ftf might be explained by the fact that the column infiltration was continuous in a relatively short time period compared to the field conditions where infiltration will be intermittent at the ftf there has only been net infiltration in the unsaturated zone during annual snowmelt and autumn precipitation long periods with stagnant pore water during summer and winter months are observed where the saturation is at field capacity and no groundwater recharge occurs french et al 1999 the annual changes in saturation level of the soil pores can have an effect on the attenuation processes for pfos in the unsaturated soil under field conditions both sorption kinetics and the potential effect of disequilibria complicate the comparison of the field and column study results but were not studied in this work wei et al 2017 brusseau 2018 showed that retention processes other than sorption to the solid phase can influence pfas transport air water interface adsorption alone accounted for 50 of the total retention observed in these studies the adsorption of pfoa to the air water interface during transport in unsaturated porous media was further investigated by lyu et al 2018 and the results for the experiments showed that adsorption to the air water interface was a significant source of retention contributing to approximately 50 75 of the total observed retention of pfoa the potential contribution of this process to pfos retention requires further attention 4 conclusion the use of afff at the ftf in this study has resulted in pfas and especially pfos contamination of the soil at high impacted areas soil contamination down to the groundwater level at 4 m below surface could be observed unsaturated column studies with afff applied to pristine soil to better understand the historic contamination history showed that when exposed to low infiltration rates pfos was not detected in the column leachate while exposed to high infiltration rates pfos was detected in increasing concentrations up to 2200 ng l during the experimental period estimated retardation factors for pfos in the field were 33 42 and 16 21 for low and high impacted areas compared to 6 5 and 5 8 for low and high infiltration column studies the leaching of pfas from source zones in the unsaturated zone at this site can represent a long term risk for contamination of the groundwater and transport to nearby surface water bodies better insight in the retention processes in the unsaturated zone is essential to achieve a more accurate prediction of leaching rates and improve risk assessment and remediation design at pfas contaminated sites acknowledgement the laboratory

1600,the contaminant situation at a norwegian firefighting training facility ftf was investigated 15 years after the use of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos based aqueous film forming foams afff products had ceased detailed mapping of the soil and groundwater at the ftf field site in 2016 revealed high concentrations of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas pfos accounted for 96 of the total pfas concentration in the soil with concentrations ranging from 0 3 μg kg to 6500 μg kg the average concentration of pfos in the groundwater down gradient of the site was 22 μg l 6 5 44 4 μg l accounting for 71 of the total pfas concentration to get a better understanding of the historic fate of afff used at the site unsaturated column studies were performed with pristine soil with a similar texture and mineralogy as found at the ftf and the same pfos containing afff used at the site transport and attenuation processes governing pfas behavior were studied with focus on cold climate conditions and infiltration during snow melting the main groundwater recharge process at the ftf low and high water infiltration rates of respectively 4 9 and 9 7 mm day were applied for 14 and 7 weeks thereby applying the same amount of water but changing the aqueous saturation of the soil columns the low infiltration rate represented 2 years of snow melting while the high infiltration rate can be considered to mimic the extra water added in the areas with intensive firefighting training in the low infiltration experiment pfos was not detected in the column leachate over the complete 14 weeks with high infiltration pfos was detected after 14 days and concentrations increased from 20 ng l to 2200 ng l at the end of the experiment 49 days soil was extracted from the columns in 5 cm layers and showed pfos concentrations in the range 0 21 1700 μg kg in the low infiltration column a clear maximum was observed at a soil depth of 30 cm no pfos was detected below 60 cm depth in the high infiltration column pfos concentration ranged from 7 4 to 1000 μg kg with highest concentrations found at 22 32 cm depth in this case pfos was detected down to the deepest sample 90 cm based on the field study retardation factors for the average vertical transport of pfos in the unsaturated zone were estimated to be 33 42 and 16 21 for the areas with a low and high afff impact respectively the estimated retardation factors for the column experiments were much lower at 6 5 and 5 8 for low and high infiltration respectively this study showed that pfos is strongly attenuated in the unsaturated zone and mobility is dependent on infiltration rate the results also suggest that the attenuation rate increases with time graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfas pfos afff column study unsaturated zone sorption retardation 1 introduction aqueous film forming foam afff containing per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas has been used extensively since the first development by 3m ansul and national foam companies in the mid 1960 s place and field 2012 afff has surface tension lowering properties and spreads rapidly across the surface of hydrocarbon fuels cooling the liquid fuel by forming a water film beneath the foam resulting in superior firefighting capabilities schaefer et al 2008 the use of afff has resulted in pfas and especially perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos contamination of soil groundwater surface waters and biota worldwide ahrens et al 2015 anderson et al 2016 filipovic et al 2015 houtz et al 2013 there is a growing concern for negative consequences for the environment and human health with regards to use and exposure to pfas blume et al 2015 cousins et al 2016 kemi 2016 lindstrom et al 2011 the persistency bioaccumulation and toxicity of long chain pfass define them as persistent organic pollutants pops and those of most concern are listed as substances of very high concern svhc in the european chemical agency s echa blume et al 2015 brendel et al 2018 fate of pfas released to the soil environment is primarily dependent on infiltration and sorption to the solid matrix partitioning coefficients for pfos and other pfass to soil and sediments have been thoroughly investigated and reported in literature gellrich et al 2012 hale et al 2017 hellsing et al 2016 higgins and luthy 2006 johnson et al 2007 zareitalabad et al 2013 recent studies have shown that sorption to the air water interface can be a major contributor to the retention of pfos and pfoa under partially saturated conditions brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 the norwegian aviation organization avinor has made an inventory of pfas contaminated soil groundwater surface water and biota at several firefighting training facilities ftf throughout norway the studies have shown widespread leaching of pfas from the soil to nearby water courses and exposure of biota in both fresh water and marine environments avinor miljøprosjekt dp2 2012 this study focuses on one specific ftf where afff containing pfos has been used extensively since the early 1990 s until it was phased out in 2001 and replaced by fluorotelomer containing afff kemi 2015 all use of pfas containing firefighting foams was banned at the airport in 2011 avinor miljøprosjekt dp2 2012 the aviation authorities have raised the question how much of the pfos is still present in the source zone after 15 years without pfos application can these residual levels form a long term source potentially contaminating the groundwater at the site to answer this question extensive field studies at the ftf site were performed to map the present pfas contamination situation in the unsaturated soil profile and the groundwater to reconstruct the initial release scenario of afff used at this site unsaturated column studies were performed under environmentally relevant experimental conditions this model study allowed to compare field observations with an unknown contamination history with well controlled exposure of a similar soil the objective was to improve our understanding of the contamination history and potential transport and attenuation processes governing pfas behavior at this site to our knowledge this is the first study where the pfas contamination history at a ftf site has been studied in a controlled unsaturated column experiment using a complete afff mixture 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the ftf investigated in this work has a total size of 25 000 m2 and was established in 1989 1990 extensive use of afff at the site started after the airport opened for civil aviation in 1998 but the area has previously been used for firefighting training activities there are six firefighting training platforms at the ftf each designed with membranes and a collection system for fuel water and firefighting foam to protect the underlying groundwater most of the liquids used at the site have been collected and discharged to the local sewage system foam and water have also spread to the soil outside the training areas due to wind and the increased spraying range of modern firefighting engines soil and groundwater sampling in 2008 revealed pfas contaminated soil outside the collection areas and leaching to the groundwater 4 m below the surface norwegian pollution authority 2008 the amount of afff spread outside the collection areas and the water infiltration rate has varied across the ftf in some afff source zones there has been extensive use of water during firefighting training activities resulting in high infiltration while in other parts of the ftf infiltration has been limited to the yearly precipitation which is dominated by snow melting 2 2 infiltration at the ftf site the yearly precipitation in the area of the ftf is approximately 800 mm jørgensen and østmo 1990 the soil at the site is a uniform medium fine sand over the whole unsaturated zone down to the groundwater at 4 m depth with an organic carbon content below 1 the hydraulic conductivity ks at the site ranges from 10 3 to 10 5 m s french et al 2009 the water balance developed by jørgensen and østmo 1990 for the area showed that 50 400 mm of the annual precipitation is lost due to evapotranspiration and close to 60 240 mm of groundwater recharge is occurring during a 3 5 week long snowmelt period in spring while the remainder of the annual infiltration occurs during the autumn months it was estimated that water infiltrates through the unsaturated zone during the snowmelt period with a mean vertical velocity of 20 cm day at 20 saturation jørgensen and østmo 1990 french et al 1999 showed that the mean vertical velocity of infiltrating water in the springtime snowmelt period was approximately 5 2 mm per mm infiltration at an estimated saturation level between 18 5 and 20 8 infiltration was lower during the autumn and the vertical pore water velocity in the soil was estimated to be 7 7 mm mm in the summer months precipitation was balanced by evapotranspiration with no net infiltration french et al 1999 2 3 site investigation 2 3 1 soil soil and groundwater investigation was performed at the ftf site in 2016 and included soil sampling at 80 locations in the unsaturated zone around the firefighting training platforms trial pits were excavated for sampling of the soil profile all equipment was rinsed with methanol before sampling each point samples were collected from 0 to 1 m 1 2 m 2 3 m and from 3 m and down to the groundwater level at 4 m soil was transferred into sampling bags 1 l polyamide and stored at 4 c in the laboratory before being shipped to a commercial laboratory for analysis a total of 288 soil samples were analyzed for pfas content 2 3 2 groundwater groundwater was sampled at 5 pumping wells installed as part of a pump and treat remediation system down gradient of the site to intercept the plume spreading from the ftf a total of 19 sampling campaigns were performed during 2016 the samples were stored in hdpe bottles at 4 c before being shipped to a commercial laboratory for pfas analysis 2 4 column set up pristine soil from an area close to the ftf with similar texture and mineralogy was collected and used to construct columns for the infiltration experiment acrylic glass columns with an inner diameter of 14 cm were equipped with a water drain at the bottom consisting of a coarse metal grid covered by a fine stainless steel filter to prevent the sand from washing out fig 1 the columns were packed with sand by adding layers of 6 cm compacting each layer with a 900 g weight dropped four times until each column had a total length of approximately 1 m the total weight of the sand added to each column was recorded the sand was analyzed for grain size distribution water content total organic carbon toc and background levels of pfas the columns were placed in a temperature controlled room at 10 c a water reservoir 2l at the top of each column was used for infiltration the reservoir emptied through 25 needles to ensure uniform distribution over the whole surface area of the column imitating natural infiltration of rain droplets the soil surface in the columns was approximately 30 cm below the outlet of the needles the flow through the columns was gravity driven to simulate field conditions french et al 1999 leachate was collected and sampled at the bottom of the columns in plastic buckets 2 5 column infiltration rates the experiments were performed at low and high infiltration rates of 4 9 mm and 9 7 mm per day for respectively 14 and 7 weeks a total of 477 mm water was added in both the low and high infiltration experiment the water was weighed and manually poured into the top reservoir and allowed to drip on the soil 3 times per week 2 6 non reactive tracer test non reactive tracer nrt experiments were performed in the columns to estimate the unsaturated water transport through the columns at low and high infiltration rates by adding a solution of nacl in the top reservoir during steady state water infiltration at the stated rates leachate was sampled 3 times per week and analyzed for temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec 2 7 afff experiment afff concentrate containing pfos as the main pfas from the same supplier as assumed to have been used historically at the site was used in the experiments the afff concentrate was mixed with milli q water in a 1 100 ratio and whipped to a stable foam which was then applied to the soil surface of both columns the 1 100 diluted afff concentrate was analyzed to determine the exact pfas composition see appendix a table a1 when applied the afff was a dense foam fig 2a 24 h after the first infiltration of water the foam had disappeared from the surface but foam bubbles could still be observed in the voids of the upper part of the soil columns fig 2b 2 8 column leachate sampling the infiltration period was 14 and 7 weeks respectively for the low and high infiltration experiments leachate samples were collected 3 times per week for the low infiltration experiment and daily for the high infiltration experiment for leachate volumes 50 ml samples were combined with the sample from the subsequent day to ensure sufficient sample size for analytical requirements the samples were stored at 4 c before shipping to a commercial laboratory for pfas analysis 2 9 column soil sampling after the infiltration experiments were completed the soil was extracted from the columns in 5 cm intervals and analyzed for pfas content the water content was measured in the soil samples after the experiment to quantify and confirm the unsaturated conditions in the soil columns the samples were stored at 4 c before shipping to a commercial laboratory for analysis 2 10 chemical analysis the list of target pfas analyzed varied between the field study and the laboratory experiments the field samples were analyzed for 12 pfas compounds for soil and groundwater in the column study 30 pfas compounds were analyzed in soil and 23 pfas compounds were analyzed in leachate and the afff foam for a complete overview of the compounds analyzed see appendix a and c soil and leachate analyses were carried out at the accredited laboratory eurofins gfa lab service gmbh in germany using method din 38414 s14 din 38414 14 2011 based on acetonitrile extraction followed by analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry lc ms ms for soil samples and din 38407 f42 din 38407 42 2011 and quantification using lc ms ms for leachate samples 2 11 quality control and assurance following the nrt experiments the infiltration reservoirs were thoroughly cleaned and all needles changed no material that could influence pfas sorption behavior glass metal was used when handling samples from the afff experiment hdpe bottles were used to store samples until analysis reference samples of the soil used in the columns and water used for infiltration were analyzed to determine the background levels of pfas pfas analysis was carried out at an accredited laboratory deutsche akkreditierungsstelle gmbh following din en iso iec 17025 2005 internal isotopically labelled standards were added to all soil and leachate samples prior to pfas analysis pfas identification was based on retention time and molecule or fragment ions and quantification was carried out by comparison with the internal isotopically labelled standards analytical detection limits varied from 0 2 1 μg kg for the respective pfas in soil and was 0 3 ng l for each pfas in leachate 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas concentration in soil at the ftf field site pfas concentrations found in the soil samples at the ftf varied from 0 3 to 6500 μg kg pfos accounts for 96 of the σ 12 pfas analyzed in the soil samples and is therefore focused on in the following discussion of source zones with high and low afff impact 3 1 1 source zones with low afff impact in source zones with low impact of afff the soil sampled from 0 to 1 m depth revealed concentrations of pfos in the range of 100 to 900 μg kg the soil samples from 1 to 2 m depth contained much lower concentrations of pfos from 0 3 70 μg kg the pfos concentrations at sampling locations with low afff impact are given in fig 3a the soil was not analyzed below 2 m due to low pfos concentrations in the soil samples from 1 to 2 m 3 1 2 source zones with high afff impact the pfos concentrations in the unsaturated soil in source zones with high impact of afff are shown in fig 3b concentrations of pfos in the soil from 0 to 1 m were in the range of 500 to 3000 μg kg the soil from 1 to 2 m revealed the highest pfos concentrations ranging from 1000 to 6500 μg kg from 2 to 3 m the pfos concentrations ranged from 1000 to 3500 μg kg with a further reduction 1000 to 1200 μg kg at 3 4 m depth not all samples analyzed differences between the low and high impacted areas might indicate that the attenuation and transport processes of pfos differ at these sites the concentration of pfos in the soil profiles are in the same order of magnitude as reported previously at ftf sites in sweden australia and the us baduel et al 2017 filipovic et al 2015 mcguire et al 2014 in france dauchy et al 2019 took 44 soil cores at a ftf belonging to an abandoned refinery where activities probably ceased in 1984 the median concentration at the highest impacted areas was respectively 8701 and 12 112 μg kg σ 34 pfas the highest concentrations were found in the top 1 m and 50 to 99 of the pfas content was identified as fluorotelemers dominated by 6 2 fluorotelomer sulphonamide alkylbetaine 6 2 ftab perfluorosulfonates represented 1 to 46 of the pfas in the soil dominated by pfos pfos precursors were in general below 1 of the quantified pfas 3 2 pfas concentration in the groundwater at the ftf field site the groundwater concentration varies between the 5 pumping wells fig 4a the yearly average concentration for pfos in the wells was 22 μg l 6 5 44 4μg l accounting for 71 of the σ 12 pfas concentration 31 9 μg l the average concentrations of pfhxs and 6 2 fts were 2 9 μg l and 2 7 μg l respectively accounting for 9 and 8 of the σ 12 pfas concentration in the groundwater other pfas detected in the groundwater represented approximately 12 of σ 12 pfas quantified in the groundwater fig 4b the pfas concentration in the groundwater varies during the year as can be seen by the high standard deviations in the yearly average concentrations presented in fig 4b filipovic et al 2015 reported similar values at a swedish airport pfos up to 42 μg l was reported representing 80 of the 4 pfas analyzed at a us military site a maximum of 78 μg l pfos was found as well as pfhxs 360 μg l pfhxa 350 μg l 6 2 fts 220 μg l pfoa 220 μg l pfbs 150 μg l and 120 μg l pfpea backe et al 2013 other studies have reported considerably lower groundwater concentrations dauchy et al 2019 found pfas concentrations in the range of 4 to 8277 ng l where perfluorosulfonates represented 16 to 100 of σ 34 pfas dominated by pfhxs and pfos the remainder were perfluorocarboxylic acids c4 c8 6 2 fts and 6 2 ftab 3 3 results from non reactive tracer column study the non reactive tracer tests nrt in the unsaturated column study showed the first breakthrough of the tracer after 28 and 18 days at low and high infiltration rates respectively a maximum electrical conductivity was measured in the leachate after 56 and 28 days as shown in fig 5 the results showed average water flow velocities during the low and high infiltration experiments of 1 7 cm day and 3 2 cm day respectively the observed pore water velocities in the columns are in the same order of magnitude as estimated for snow melting by french et al 1999 this shows that the hydrological behavior of our re packed columns is representative of the field conditions at the site 3 4 concentration of pfas in the afff foam applied pfos is the most dominant constituent of the σ 23 pfas determined in the afff used in the column experiments with a concentration of 100 mg l after dilution accounting for 90 of the σ 23 pfas amount applied the other pfass detected in amounts larger than 0 5 of the σ 23 pfas amount in the diluted concentrate are pfhxs contributing with 6 3 pfbs with 1 2 pfhps with 1 4 pfhxa with 0 7 and pfoa with 0 8 of the σ 23 pfas amount in the diluted afff the pfas concentrations measured in the diluted afff concentrate 1 100 with q water are presented in appendix a 3 5 concentration of pfas in the column leachate 3 5 1 low infiltration experiment the concentrations of pfas detected in the column leachate for the low infiltration experiment are shown in fig 6a pfbs shows a first breakthrough after 14 days reaches a maximum concentration of 53 μg l after 56 63 days and decreases thereafter it seems to move through the column without retardation at a rate similar to that observed for the nrt subsequently a breakthrough and decrease of pfhxa pfpea and pfhpa are seen pfhxs by definition a long chain pfas buck et al 2011 is not attenuated to the same degree as other long chained pfass in the column soil pfhxs is showing a breakthrough after 35 days and reaches a maximum concentration of 130 μg l at the end of the experiment at 98 days pfos pfhxs pfhps and pfoa were detected surprisingly in the 7 and 14 days samples 100 of the initial amount of pfbs added to the column has been detected in the leachate at the end of the experiment while 45 of pfhxs and 29 of pfhps added has leached through the column pfos was not detected over 15 ng l during the experiment disregarding the early detection most likely due to error 6 of the σ 23 pfas in the afff applied had leached through the column at the end of the experiment but only 0 006 of the pfos in the applied afff 3 5 2 high infiltration experiment pfas concentrations detected in the leachate for the high infiltration rate experiment are shown in fig 6b the first detection of any pfas was after 7 days but the onset of a breakthrough can be observed from 14 days and onwards pfbs pfhxa and pfhxs seem to breakthrough simultaneously however pfhxs is the most dominant compound in the column leachate thereafter similar to the low infiltration experiment the maximum pfhxs concentration in the leachate is 71 μg l after 47 days approx 50 lower than in the low infiltration column pfbs and pfhxa reach an apparently stable concentration at 17 and 15 μg l respectively considerably lower than observed in the low infiltration column pfos concentrations are difficult to observe in fig 6b but pfos was detected in the leachate after 21 days at a concentration of 20 ng l which continued to increase to 2200 ng l at the end of the experiment this is a major difference between the two experiments since pfos was not detected above 15 ng l in the low infiltration experiment 87 of the total pfbs amount had leached through the column at the high infiltration rate in contrast to 100 at low infiltration pfhxs leaching was comparable in both experiments at 47 of the added amount in contrast only 2 of pfhps leached out at high infiltration compared to 29 at low infiltration the total amount of pfos leached in the low infiltration experiment was 0 006 while it was 0 05 in the high infiltration experiment for the sum detected pfas in the leachate the amount leached was slightly lower for the low infiltration experiment with 5 89 compared to 5 93 in the high infiltration experiment of σ 23 pfas added 3 6 distribution of pfas in the soil columns 3 6 1 low infiltration experiment pfas analysis of the soil in the column at the end of the experiment showed that short chain pfas were less attenuated than long chained pfas as presented in figs 7a and 8a pfos was the most retarded pfas at low infiltration with concentrations ranging from 0 21 1700 μg kg in the soil and a maximum concentration detected at 30 cm depth in the soil columns previous column studies have not analyzed remaining pfas concentrations in the soil matrix however similar retention patterns have been reported where short chain pfas are less retarded in the soil than long chained pfas vierke et al 2014 gellrich et al 2012 3 6 2 high infiltration experiment the pfas analysis of the soil in the column at the end of the high infiltration experiment showed similar to the low infiltration experiment that short chain pfas were attenuated less than long chained pfas figs 7b and 8b the pfos concentration in the soil ranged from 7 4 to 1000 μg kg with the highest concentrations observed in a zone at 22 32 cm depth the highest pfos concentration was approximately 60 of the maximum concentration in the low infiltration experiment this might be a consequence of a reduced pore water concentration at the high infiltration rate resulting in reduced sorption to the soil matrix the presence of pfos in the column leachate is indicative of reduced sorption and increased vertical transport 3 7 comparison of retardation factors in field and column experiments the retardation factors for pfos in the unsaturated zone at the ftf are estimated based on an assumed average vertical water velocity from snowmelt infiltration of 4 9 7 5 cm day during 3 weeks 200 300 mm in addition autumn infiltration of 160 mm precipitation with an infiltration rate of 7 7 mm mm results in an estimated yearly vertical pore water transport of 227 280 cm french et al 1999 for the low impact areas pfos is mainly found at 1 m depth assuming pfos use ended 15 years ago this results in an average yearly vertical pfos transport rate of 6 7 cm year during the 15 years that have passed from these data a retardation factor of 33 42 can be estimated for the high impact areas the yearly average vertical velocity might be higher due to the extra water added during firefighting activities assuming the same average vertical water velocity as for low impact areas vertical transport for pfos down to 2 m is observed resulting in a pfos transport rate of 13 3 cm year and a retardation factor of 16 21 for pfos at high impact areas in the soil columns the vertical distance travelled for the center of mass of pfos in the soil columns was 25 5 and 27 cm respectively for the low and high infiltration experiment this results in mean pfos transport rates of 0 26 cm day and 0 55 cm day respectively the nrt showed average vertical water velocities of 1 7 cm day and 3 2 cm day for low and high infiltration respectively this gives retardation factors of 6 5 and 5 8 at low and high infiltration rate respectively based on these retardation factors and assuming a mean volumetric water content of 20 apparent distribution coefficients kd for pfos of 4 0 5 1 l kg and 1 9 2 5 l kg can be estimated for low and high impacted areas at the ftf respectively apparent kd values of 0 8 and 0 7l kg for the column studies with low and high infiltration respectively can be estimated with the same volumetric water content as for the field estimates these kd values are in the range of values reported for pfos in literature gellrich et al 2012 hale et al 2017 hellsing et al 2016 higgins and luthy 2006 johnson et al 2007 zareitalabad et al 2013 compiled in appendix b zareitalabad et al 2013 reports kd values for the sorption of pfos to various soils and sediments in the range of 1 and 35 3 l kg for the sandy soil in our study the value reported for ottowa sand of 2 8 l kg could be expected johnson et al 2007 the lower retardation factors for pfos in the column experiments compared to those estimated for field conditions at the ftf might be explained by the fact that the column infiltration was continuous in a relatively short time period compared to the field conditions where infiltration will be intermittent at the ftf there has only been net infiltration in the unsaturated zone during annual snowmelt and autumn precipitation long periods with stagnant pore water during summer and winter months are observed where the saturation is at field capacity and no groundwater recharge occurs french et al 1999 the annual changes in saturation level of the soil pores can have an effect on the attenuation processes for pfos in the unsaturated soil under field conditions both sorption kinetics and the potential effect of disequilibria complicate the comparison of the field and column study results but were not studied in this work wei et al 2017 brusseau 2018 showed that retention processes other than sorption to the solid phase can influence pfas transport air water interface adsorption alone accounted for 50 of the total retention observed in these studies the adsorption of pfoa to the air water interface during transport in unsaturated porous media was further investigated by lyu et al 2018 and the results for the experiments showed that adsorption to the air water interface was a significant source of retention contributing to approximately 50 75 of the total observed retention of pfoa the potential contribution of this process to pfos retention requires further attention 4 conclusion the use of afff at the ftf in this study has resulted in pfas and especially pfos contamination of the soil at high impacted areas soil contamination down to the groundwater level at 4 m below surface could be observed unsaturated column studies with afff applied to pristine soil to better understand the historic contamination history showed that when exposed to low infiltration rates pfos was not detected in the column leachate while exposed to high infiltration rates pfos was detected in increasing concentrations up to 2200 ng l during the experimental period estimated retardation factors for pfos in the field were 33 42 and 16 21 for low and high impacted areas compared to 6 5 and 5 8 for low and high infiltration column studies the leaching of pfas from source zones in the unsaturated zone at this site can represent a long term risk for contamination of the groundwater and transport to nearby surface water bodies better insight in the retention processes in the unsaturated zone is essential to achieve a more accurate prediction of leaching rates and improve risk assessment and remediation design at pfas contaminated sites acknowledgement the laboratory

1601,the spatial structure and auto correlation of total dissolved solids tds in an aquifer located in southwestern part of iran were investigated by both moran s index and variography since the feature of interest was non stationary so conventional methods of spatial analysis were not applicable and universal kriging uk as a common method for spatial prediction of features with a spatial trend along with a novel geostatistical method known as fixed rank kriging frk were utilized in this respect the results of moran s index were consistent with that of spatial analysis by geostatistical methods indicating the dominance of spatial clusters within the extent of study area the spatial analysis by frk was more efficient than that of its uk counterpart however the performance of uk was reasonable enough as well a variable selection by random forest rf was applied on eleven other water quality parameters that were the main constituents of tds to identify the main parameters influencing the observed variability of tds it was turned out that rf is a viable method for variable selection in the realm of environmental sciences keywords universal kriging fixed rank kriging moran s index random forest variable selection 1 introduction total dissolved solids tds represent an integrative effect of some cations and anions in water although among different cations and anions sodium potassium calcium magnesium bicarbonates chlorides and sulfates particularly contribute to its detected values in water in addition to this tds may also be derived from some small quantities of dissolved organic matters such as heavy metals miranda and krishnakumar 2015 although higher than normal values of tds does not pose any direct health risk however its elevated levels may be either due to the presence of dissolved materials that make the water hard corrosive or salty or originate from some ions such as nitrate lead arsenic etc boyd 2000 in other words based on the specific combination of constituent elements the higher than permissible level of tds may or may not be toxic to the living organisms and water users but the toxicity of water is not directly predictable from tds anyhow meanwhile there are some researches that indicated the toxic effects of tds on survival and biological productivity of living organisms including chironomids chapman et al 2000 and lahon cutthroat trout dickerson and vinyard 1999 furthermore some disorders in human being including eye and skin irritation problems have been attributed to the excessive levels of tds in water sorensen 1977 on the other hand an evidence based decision making associated with environmental contaminants by governmental industrial and social agencies relies on spatially continuous data which are not available since environmental data are usually collected at sparse point samples li et al 2011 therefore spatially continuous data have to be produced from these discrete spatial data to facilitate interpretation of generated results in this respect multiple spatial analysis techniques have been utilized to characterize the spatial variation of environmental contaminants in groundwater resources in different parts of the world e g wang et al 2015a 2015b ducci et al 2016 jia et al 2018 liang et al 2018 these methods varied from conventional ones to more advanced novel techniques for instance hussain et al 2014 applied ordinary kriging ok bayesian kriging bk along with gaussian spatial predictive process to investigate the spatial structure of tds in drinking water in punjab province pakistan it was concluded that in terms of root mean square prediction error bk outperformed compared to that of ok and gaussian spatial predictive process on the contrary jia et al 2018 utilized a modified local polynomial partition interpolation technique and ordinary kriging to consider the spatial variation of the groundwater pollution index in harbin city china in this context groundwater solute concentration may exhibit non stationary characteristics due to different geological formations and human interference along its flow path jia et al 2018 so the conventional geostatistical methods are not applicable in these cases universal kriging uk is a viable alternative technique for attributes that exhibit a spatial trend and has been popular in the field of environmental sciences e g li et al 2015 tonkin et al 2016 malamos and koutsoyiannis 2018 a novel technique known as fixed rank kriging frk has also been recently developed that is originally utilized for large data set but it is also applicable for spatial attributes which violate the stationary requirement of kriging approaches zammit mangion and cressie 2018 there has not been any application of this technique within the scope of environmental science to the best of the knowledge of the author of this paper in summary the main objective of the current study was to assess the spatial analysis of tds by both universal and fixed rank kriging method in dezful aquifer located in southwestern part of iran the main aim was to investigate the feasibility of frk compared to that of uk as a more conventional method for spatial analysis of non stationary variables the groundwater resources in this area are directly used for drinking purposes especially in rural regions so maintaining the quality of it is of paramount importance the spatial analysis of groundwater quality will help decision makers to detect hotspot areas that need to be managed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with an area of about 1920 km2 dezful aquifer is located in southwestern part of iran cities like dezful and part of shush are located within the extent of this aquifer in addition one of the most important rivers in iran namely dez river flows in the middle part of the aquifer there is a high specific yield and high hydraulic conductivity in the northern part of the aquifer with values of about 5 and 200 m day respectively shahsavari et al 2015 the majority part of the aquifer is unconfined however it changes to a confined aquifer due to presence of an extended clayey layer in southwestern part the dominant materials of this confined layer are gypsiferous sediments originated from aghajari formation that constitutes the majority part of the formations in the aquifer the average depth of aquifer is about 100 m however groundwater depth varies from 3 to 4 m in the western part to about 90 m in the northern part the dominant groundwater flow is from the north to the south but there are some flow interactions with surface water bodies as well shahsavari et al 2015 2 2 field data the data set used in the current research comprised of 12 groundwater quality parameters related to 271 sampling wells that were collected as part of the environmental monitoring network by khuzestan water authority and consisted of total hardness th bicarbonate hco3 ca2 mg2 k na cl sulfate so4 2 ec tds total sum of cations tc and total sum of anions ta other than tds as the main subject of this study the other parameters were regarded as the dominant constituents of tds in water as explained earlier the descriptive statistics associated with these parameters have been given in table 1 in complementary part although it seems as if some of the maximum values are higher than normal ranges of water quality parameters however it was opted to use them as outliers for further analysis since no evidence was found about analytical errors or incorrect recording of these values a view of sampling locations has been illustrated in fig 1 in complementary part the majority of samples were collected from wells located in agricultural fields as it can be deduced from this figure 2 3 spatial autocorrelation by moran s index exploratory spatial data analysis can be inspected by investigation of spatial autocorrelation in these methods spatial distribution and structure of the feature of interest is considered in order to detect any spatial dependence or autocorrelation fu et al 2014 in spatial statistics spatial autocorrelation implies correlation of a variable with itself through space while the recorded values for the variable of interest are usually more similar for nearby locations than that of locations farther apart in cases in which similar attributes occur near one another the autocorrelation will be positive otherwise if dissimilar values occur in close proximity to each other the respective autocorrelation will be negative accordingly there are a number of spatial autocorrelation indicators that were utilized in environmental researches such as moran s i li et al 2014 liu et al 2017a 2017b gholizadeh et al 2017 fallahzadeh et al 2018 getis s g nadari et al 2017 harvey et al 2018 tango c zhang and lin 2006 and geary s c miller et al 2016 among these indices the most popular approach is moran s i index due to its high accuracy and its capability to identify hotspot areas e g spatial outliers li et al 2014 the moran s i index is calculated by the following equation 1 i n i j w ij z i z j w i 1 n z i 2 where z i x i x and the mean of x is represented by x while w i 1 n j 1 n w ij is the sum of weight function w ij that can be defined as the reciprocal of distance among locations i and j for the sampling points under the null hypothesis of no spatial auto correlation the moran s i index was calculated by the method of gittleman and kot 1990 assuming normality of i under this null hypothesis in addition the sensitivity of the results was inspected by considering different bandwidth sizes e g kernel sizes that represented as the number of nearest neighbors in this case kalogirou 2017 2 4 universal kriging in addition to spatial autocorrelation analysis by moran s index the spatial dependence of the feature of interest was also investigated using variography that was essential for the generation of resultant maps there are a number of parameters associated with a variogram some part of variability in the field that is not accounted for by distance between observations is known as nugget effect leon et al 2014 one of the influential parameters on the level of nugget is the minimum distance between sampling points since the close range spatial dependence can t be estimated in the absence of close to each other observation points on the contrary the maximum observed variability in the field and the point where there is not any change in semivariance with increase of distance are represented by sill and range respectively karl and maurer 2010 in this study the semivariance was calculated for the log transformed values of tds since the distribution of original data values were positively skewed in order to find the direction of regional trend the method of kumar 2007 was used in this respect directional semivariograms and their respective perpendicular axes were estimated starting from zero with 5 intervals anticlockwise from the east direction followed by detection of the variograms with maximum difference given the semivariogram values following determination of the perpendicular directional variograms of interest different variogram models including gaussian spherical and exponential models were fitted to the log transformed variogram in the direction devoid of any external drift in universal kriging technique the values of tds at un sampled locations s 0 are calculated given n number of observations z s i by the following equation brus and heuvelink 2007 2 z s 0 c 0 x x c 1 x 1 x 0 x c 1 c 0 c 1 z where the matrix of covariates at the sampling stations wells is represented by x and comprises of n m 1 covariate matrices the vector of covariates at prediction locations x and y coordinates in this case and the vector of covariates between residuals at predicted and observed locations are shown by x 0 and c 0 respectively there is also a variance covariance matrix having a n n dimension for the related n residuals that is indicated by c in this equation the latest parameter c along with c 0 are estimated from the variogram of residuals which is normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance c 0 finally the last parameter z is the vector of observations z s i in this context the universal kriging variance at unobserved locations is also calculated by 3 σ 2 s 0 c 0 c 0 c 1 c 0 x 0 x c 1 c 0 x c 1 x 1 x 0 x c 1 c 0 which is an incorporation term related to the prediction error variance of residuals and the estimation error variance of the trend in this respect the best model was selected according to a cross validation algorithm using mean prediction error mpe root mean squared error rmse and mean squared deviation ratio msdr as the performance criteria bishop and lark 2006 an ideal model should produce a mpe of near zero a small amount within the scale of original data for rmse and a msdr value of near one finally the values of tds at unsampled locations were predicted at a grid covering the bounding box of data with respect to a second order trend model between tds values and coordinates of the sampling points these data were then back transformed to the original scale of data for comparison with actual values 2 5 fixed rank kriging although universal kriging is a viable approach for spatial prediction of a non stationary attribute at unobserved locations however there are some new alternative techniques that are applicable in these situations as well a novel method known as fixed rank kriging frk can be considered as a feasible alternative since it avoids stationary and isotropic covariance as well as variogram modeling so it can also be applied for non stationary features the mathematical detail of this method is complicated and beyond the scope of this paper but interested readers can refer to the previous published literatures for further information e g cressie and johannesson 2008 zammit mangion and cressie 2018 in practice in this method instead of variogram model a spatial random effects sre model is constructed on a discretized spatial domain known as basic real unit bau the sre model decomposes a spatially correlated random process while a term is used to control the random process s fine scale variation and the final decomposition is implemented by a linear combination of spatial basis functions with random weights and the respective control term in this research the baus with a size of 1500 1500 were constructed on a plane around tds sampling locations and the hetereoscedascity of the fine scale variation was set to unity a gaussian basis function was applied and placed regularly in the investigated domain a view of the constructed basis has been depicted in fig 2 in complementary part the sre model was then constructed given the specified baus and basis functions and was fitted using a maximum likelihood algorithm the prediction at all the constructed baus considering the fitted model was the final step in this process 2 6 variable selection by random forest in order to determine which water quality parameters are more influential related to the observed variability of the target variable e g tds in this case a dimensionality reduction procedure was followed using random forest rf technique genuer et al 2010 since rf is based on decision trees and aggregation ideas so they can be ideal methods for variable selection as well rf has been very popular as a new machine learning technique in different aspects of environmental researches philibert et al 2013 wang et al 2015a 2015b larras et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhan et al 2018 but its application as a variable selection algorithm in different majors has been very limited archer and kimes 2008 grömping 2009 genuer et al 2010 despite the proved high efficiency of this technique for variable selection in other fields of studies this technique has not been utilized for this purpose within the scope of environmental sciences to the best of knowledge of the author of this paper the variable selection in this algorithm is implemented during a two step process first a variable importance metric is used to rank variables according to their importance and eliminate the less important variables the following variable importance is utilized for this purpose 4 vi x j 1 ntree t erroo b j erroob t in this respect oob t denotes the data not included in the bootstrap sample for each tree t of the forest and erroob t is the respective mean squared error mse of a single tree t of this oob t sample accordingly erroo b j is the error following randomly permutation of the values of x j in the related oob t while ntree is the number of trees in the forest in the next step either by application of a collection of rf models followed by selection of the variable associated with the most accurate ones or introducing sequentially the sorted variables two different subset of variables represented as most influential and least influential parameters were produced 3 results and discussion the histogram of tds values and that of log transformed data along 271 sampling wells have been illustrated in fig 3 in complementary part according to the results table 1 in complementary part the minimum and maximum observed values fluctuated between 20 85 and 9680 00 mg l while the median and mean detected levels were 531 00 and 748 52 mg l respectively as it is clear the data were positively skewed so a log transformation was applied to transform them to a normal probability distribution the results of moran s i index for spatial autocorrelation analysis related to different kernel sizes lioyd 2014 have been given in table 1 spatial clustering of similar values either high or low is represented by a positive value whereas in areas in which clustering of dissimilar values occurs it results in a negative index where high values are surrendered by low values or vice versa anselin 1995 a value of near zero indicates no spatial autocorrelation meaning that we should expect a random spatial distribution bednářová et al 2016 in this respect the resultant p value was zero with observed and expected values of 0 421 and 0 003 for moran s index respectively this higher observed value compared to that of expected level implies that the detected values of tds are positively autocorrelated and are statistically significant with respect to both randomization or resampling hypotheses so a spatial clustering of similar values should be expected within the extent of study area on the other hand for different kernel sizes the calculated values of moran s index were all higher than 0 3 and statistically significant as well when the kernel size k increased from 3 to 24 km the associated level of moran s index decreased from 0 467 to 0 321 however it was still significantly higher than the expected value as a whole on the other hand another criterion for study of spatial dependence was semivariogram analysis the spatial dependence of observations as a function of distance is usually measured by semivariance and a plot representing the semivariance variations as a function of distance between observations is known as semivariogram naveed et al 2016 one of the essential requirements for spatial analysis by conventional kriging methods is that the feature of interest should be second order stationary isaaks and srivastava 1989 marchant 2018 meaning that the mean and variance of spatial variable are similar within the extent of study area and the spatial location is the dominant factor determining the correlation between observations with respect to the omnidirectional variogram of log transformed values of tds fig 4 in complementary part the parabolic shape with monotonic increase of semivariogram with lag distance is the typical behavior of a non stationary feature so conventional spatial prediction methods like ordinary kriging may not be applicable for this variable there are some alternative techniques for spatial modeling of variables that depict second order non stationary behavior e g fouedjio 2017 wadoux et al 2018 one of the common alternative approaches for these non stationary variables is kriging with external drift universal kriging li et al 2015 in this respect groundwater level is among natural features with the same behavior that may exhibit a spatial trend in the direction of groundwater flow gundogdu and guney 2007 kumar 2007 due to the fact that tds represents the solids that are totally dissolved in water so they are completely transported with water and may possibly depict the same spatial behavior as that of water level consequently during universal kriging it is hypothesized that part of variation in the observed feature is due to a trend e g drift while the variation of residuals can be accounted for by a random field cressie 1986 therefore instead of original variable the variogram for the residuals of the regional trend is computed in order to predict at unobserved locations with respect to the variogram model and the associated trend li et al 2015 an ordinary least squares method was applied to estimate the regional trend the resultant linear model for the first order trend was highly significant with an adjusted r squared of 0 34 implying that about 34 of variation of tds concentrations can be explained by a first order linear trend although this confirms the existence of a trend in data however a first order trend does not account for an interaction term therefore a second order trend surface was also fitted with respect to the coordinates of the sampling stations to take the interaction term into account rossiter 2012 the resultant adjusted r squared was highly significant and equal to 0 40 indicating that about 40 of variation is explained by the second order regional trend due to the significant improvement that was observed by application of a second order trend surface a second order trend instead of first order trend was applied for further analysis by the method of universal kriging considering different perpendicular directional variograms the variograms along the 85 and 175 had the maximum difference and have been illustrated in fig 1 the variogram along 175 depicted a parabolic behavior which implies a higher spatial rate in this direction due to the fact that tds are transported with groundwater flow so it may implicitly show the groundwater flow direction as well the semivariogram in the 85 direction did not indicate any trend e g unbounded increase with distance and was regarded as variogram of interest for further analysis the variogram of 85 direction was graphically compared with the variogram of uk which is called the residual variogram hereafter to inspect their difference fig 2 as a whole they are quite similar up till 10 km separation distance there after the residual variogram was significantly lower than that of its original variogram counterpart it may imply the coverage of some of the long range structures by this second order trend surface in addition the range of the residual variogram is also shorter in comparison the results of fitting gaussian spherical and exponential models to empirical variogram of log transformed values of tds have been illustrated in fig 3 as it is clear it seems as if all of the models have successfully captured the semivariace of data values and it is hard to select the best model among them in order to statistically compare these models a cross validation technique was followed nas and berktay 2010 in which one sample at random was taken out from the training set and performance of the model at unused sample was investigated with respect to the mean prediction error mpe and root mean square error rmse criteria considering the cross validation algorithm the variogram parameters including nugget sill and rage associated with the residual variogram models have been rendered in table 2 the results indicate that the exponential and spherical models have very similar performance with mpe and rmse values of 0 0015 and 0 1593 for exponential model respectively on the contrary the respective values for spherical model were in turn 0 0015 and 0 1589 the gaussian model however outperformed a little with mpe and rmse values of 0 0008 and 0 1585 respectively in this field the bias of the spherical model e g the relative value of mpe with respect to the mean was 0 5 and a value of 1 62 was also produced as the mean squared deviation ratio msdr of prediction errors the latest index implies some information about variability of cross validation compared to that of training set with a value of 1 for a best performed model bishop and lark 2006 kerry and oliver 2007 the generated result for this criterion associated with the exponential model was 1 68 indicating that the variability of actual values is a bit higher than its predicted levels on the other hand an ideal model usually contains a small nugget and large sill thus much spatial dependence and much information at unsampled locations can be inferred by their distance from the sampling sites karl and maurer 2010 in this context the ratio of nugget to sill implies valuable information about the spatial autocorrelation of the feature of interest since the nugget of variogram reflects random variation while partial sill represents variation with distance gao et al 2017 a strong spatial dependence e g spatial autocorrelation is represented through a ratio of lower than 25 whereas a higher than 75 ratio indicates a week spatial dependence moreover values between 25 and 75 are interpreted as moderate spatial dependence cambardella et al 1994 martín et al 2016 the resultant ratio for the gaussian spherical and exponential variogram models were 27 17 and 11 respectively with respect to the gaussian model as the best performed model the feature of interest has a moderate spatial dependence while it indicates a strong spatial dependence for tds values according to the spherical and exponential models since there hasn t been much deviation between the cut off value of 25 and 27 and given the finding of the other models it seems as if most probably the attribute of interest has a strong spatial dependence this strong spatial dependence is in accordance with findings of moran s index and shows that the origin of dissolved solids in the groundwater is mainly due to intrinsic properties instead of anthropogenic factors e g human interference cambardella et al 1994 in this field the interaction of groundwater with geological materials of the aquifer was the dominant factor for the observed values of tds in most parts of the study area the final predicted versus actual values of tds using gaussian variogram model has been rendered in fig 4 the adjusted r squared value for the fitted model for this data set was 0 67 reflecting the reasonable performance of the model given this high data record e g 171 number of wells in addition the residual plot and normal q q plot e g standardized residuals versus theoretical quantiles implied that other than stations numbers 48 147 and 269 the performance of the model for the other stations was roughly reasonable considering the developed variogram model the prediction at unobserved locations was implemented at a grid covering the bounding box of the area of interest the feasibility of the predictions was compared with that fixed rank kriging frk a novel spatial method according to the variance of prediction which is a uncertainty assessment that depends on the developed model and configuration of sampling points the predictions made by uk and frk along with their respective variance maps have been illustrated in fig 5 the trend of predictions is very similar to each other considering both techniques where the trend of contamination increases from northwestern to southeastern part of the study area the estimated values of tds by uk varied from 40 67 to 4422 78 mg l whereas those of frk fluctuated between 165 49 and 3575 85 mg l since the major constituent of tds is inorganic not organic materials so waters with high values of tds are known as mineralized waters the highly mineralized waters are usually found in areas with arid environmental condition and tds values higher than 1000 mg l are common in these regions boyd 2000 since the area where the current research was conducted is recognized as an arid region so the higher than normal values of tds may be justifiable given the dominant climatic condition it is not reasonable to compare the kriging generated values with that of actual values since kriging is an exact interpolation method mehdad and kleijnen 2018 e g for the sampling locations give a predictor equal to the observed values however the variance of predictions can implicitly bring about valuable information on the feasibility of prediction the results indicated that the variance of frk approach is very data dependent so in areas in which sampling locations are clustered the variance of predictions did not exceed 1 05 while for the majority of the other areas within the extent of studied region it did not surpass 1 11 on the contrary the variance produced by uk is smoother however they are less accurate than that of frk technique that is to say within the aquifer extent the variance of prediction varied from 1 03 to 1 18 which is quite a bit higher than its frk counterpart within the same region the higher groundwater depth in the northern part of the aquifer along with the dominant groundwater flow direction that is from the north to the south might have been contributed to the lower levels of tds found in the northern part in addition the generated maps are consistent with the findings of moran s index indicating that the sampling locations are of spatial cluster type so both high high high values are in close proximity to a high values neighborhood and low low clusters low values juxtaposed with low values should be expected this hypothesis seems to be true since higher spatial values are completely separated from that of lower predicted values the high high spatial clusters are mainly in the southeastern part of the area whereas the majority of the region belongs to the low low clusters the results of this study were in agreement with the findings of li et al 2014 yan et al 2015 fu et al 2016 and yuan et al 2018 where spatial clustered were detected for trace and major elements in soil in addition the findings of the current study were also in accordance with the results of towfiqul islam et al 2017 and johnson et al 2018 about the spatial auto correlation analysis of some groundwater quality parameters in bangladesh and usa respectively in order to find the main constituents of tds that accounted for the observed variability of this parameter among the investigated parameters a variable selection method was utilized considering the approach explained in the previous section according to the results of variable selection fig 6 and with respect to graphs of the mean and standard deviation of the variable importance vi index three different set of variables can be recognized the first category consists of ec and total cations whereas total anions comprised the second group during the variable selection the mean of vi index decreased from 350 000 to about 50 000 while the related standard deviation reduced from about more than 5000 to approximately more than 2000 for these two groups the rest of parameters comprised the third category of variables with the least importance given the observed variability of tds the mean of vi for this group was around zero accordingly because of the high correlation between tds and ec which has been emphasized in some of the previous researches e g walton 1989 it is not strange that it was the most influential parameter on the variability of tds meanwhile cations were most important than that of anions based on the findings of variable selection by random forest however none of the considered cations e g k ca mg and na were dominated compared to that of anions e g sulfate bicarbonate and cl since the respective mean level of vi for all of them were roughly the same and around zero there are a couple of natural and anthropogenic sources that may contribute to the observed values of tds in both surface and groundwater including urban run off industrial wastewater agricultural run off septic systems the nature of soil livestock waste etc hussain et al 2014 since roughly all of the sampling points are located in agricultural dominated areas fig 1 in complementary part so despite the fact that natural process were the prevalent source of contamination associated with tds in groundwater as discovered by spatial analysis during variography but at least in shallow groundwater regions where groundwater depth is as low as 3 4 m there is certainty an interaction between surface sources of contamination and groundwater in this respect irrigation return flows besides septic systems which are prevalent especially in urban areas are possibly the main contributing factors to the observed values of tds 4 conclusion this study was concerned with spatial analysis of tds in 271 groundwater samples taken from dezful aquifer located in southwestern part of iran in addition to tds there were also 11 other water quality parameters which were the main constituents of tds and consisted of total cations ta total anions tc na cl ca mg bicarbonate sulfate ec total hardness and k random forest was utilized as a variable selection method to select the most influential parameters on the variation of tds among the considered ones although rf has been used both as a machine learning technique in classification and regression problems and as a spatial prediction approach however it has not been utilized as a variable selection in environmental sciences up until know it was concluded that random forest was an efficient variable selection technique since the results were consistent and justifiable from environmental point of view the most important parameters were ec that has been proved to show a high correlation with tds in most of the previous researches in addition to tc followed by tc which implicitly contain the values of the rest of parameters none of the anions and cations alone had an influential effect on the observed variability of tds due to the unbounded behavior of semivariance values of tds with respect to distance that is the typical behavior of a non stationary attribute both universal kriging uk and fixed rank kriging frk were utilized for spatial analysis of the feature of interest it was concluded that both of the methods were efficient to capture the spatial structure of tds however frk was roughly more accurate in terms of the generated variances of the residuals although frk has been mainly developed for large data set but this study confirmed the efficiency of this approach for non stationary attributes as well acknowledgement this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors the generous aid of khuzestan water authority in fulfillment of the objectives of the current research is greatly appreciated the data used in the current research were kindly provided by this

1601,the spatial structure and auto correlation of total dissolved solids tds in an aquifer located in southwestern part of iran were investigated by both moran s index and variography since the feature of interest was non stationary so conventional methods of spatial analysis were not applicable and universal kriging uk as a common method for spatial prediction of features with a spatial trend along with a novel geostatistical method known as fixed rank kriging frk were utilized in this respect the results of moran s index were consistent with that of spatial analysis by geostatistical methods indicating the dominance of spatial clusters within the extent of study area the spatial analysis by frk was more efficient than that of its uk counterpart however the performance of uk was reasonable enough as well a variable selection by random forest rf was applied on eleven other water quality parameters that were the main constituents of tds to identify the main parameters influencing the observed variability of tds it was turned out that rf is a viable method for variable selection in the realm of environmental sciences keywords universal kriging fixed rank kriging moran s index random forest variable selection 1 introduction total dissolved solids tds represent an integrative effect of some cations and anions in water although among different cations and anions sodium potassium calcium magnesium bicarbonates chlorides and sulfates particularly contribute to its detected values in water in addition to this tds may also be derived from some small quantities of dissolved organic matters such as heavy metals miranda and krishnakumar 2015 although higher than normal values of tds does not pose any direct health risk however its elevated levels may be either due to the presence of dissolved materials that make the water hard corrosive or salty or originate from some ions such as nitrate lead arsenic etc boyd 2000 in other words based on the specific combination of constituent elements the higher than permissible level of tds may or may not be toxic to the living organisms and water users but the toxicity of water is not directly predictable from tds anyhow meanwhile there are some researches that indicated the toxic effects of tds on survival and biological productivity of living organisms including chironomids chapman et al 2000 and lahon cutthroat trout dickerson and vinyard 1999 furthermore some disorders in human being including eye and skin irritation problems have been attributed to the excessive levels of tds in water sorensen 1977 on the other hand an evidence based decision making associated with environmental contaminants by governmental industrial and social agencies relies on spatially continuous data which are not available since environmental data are usually collected at sparse point samples li et al 2011 therefore spatially continuous data have to be produced from these discrete spatial data to facilitate interpretation of generated results in this respect multiple spatial analysis techniques have been utilized to characterize the spatial variation of environmental contaminants in groundwater resources in different parts of the world e g wang et al 2015a 2015b ducci et al 2016 jia et al 2018 liang et al 2018 these methods varied from conventional ones to more advanced novel techniques for instance hussain et al 2014 applied ordinary kriging ok bayesian kriging bk along with gaussian spatial predictive process to investigate the spatial structure of tds in drinking water in punjab province pakistan it was concluded that in terms of root mean square prediction error bk outperformed compared to that of ok and gaussian spatial predictive process on the contrary jia et al 2018 utilized a modified local polynomial partition interpolation technique and ordinary kriging to consider the spatial variation of the groundwater pollution index in harbin city china in this context groundwater solute concentration may exhibit non stationary characteristics due to different geological formations and human interference along its flow path jia et al 2018 so the conventional geostatistical methods are not applicable in these cases universal kriging uk is a viable alternative technique for attributes that exhibit a spatial trend and has been popular in the field of environmental sciences e g li et al 2015 tonkin et al 2016 malamos and koutsoyiannis 2018 a novel technique known as fixed rank kriging frk has also been recently developed that is originally utilized for large data set but it is also applicable for spatial attributes which violate the stationary requirement of kriging approaches zammit mangion and cressie 2018 there has not been any application of this technique within the scope of environmental science to the best of the knowledge of the author of this paper in summary the main objective of the current study was to assess the spatial analysis of tds by both universal and fixed rank kriging method in dezful aquifer located in southwestern part of iran the main aim was to investigate the feasibility of frk compared to that of uk as a more conventional method for spatial analysis of non stationary variables the groundwater resources in this area are directly used for drinking purposes especially in rural regions so maintaining the quality of it is of paramount importance the spatial analysis of groundwater quality will help decision makers to detect hotspot areas that need to be managed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with an area of about 1920 km2 dezful aquifer is located in southwestern part of iran cities like dezful and part of shush are located within the extent of this aquifer in addition one of the most important rivers in iran namely dez river flows in the middle part of the aquifer there is a high specific yield and high hydraulic conductivity in the northern part of the aquifer with values of about 5 and 200 m day respectively shahsavari et al 2015 the majority part of the aquifer is unconfined however it changes to a confined aquifer due to presence of an extended clayey layer in southwestern part the dominant materials of this confined layer are gypsiferous sediments originated from aghajari formation that constitutes the majority part of the formations in the aquifer the average depth of aquifer is about 100 m however groundwater depth varies from 3 to 4 m in the western part to about 90 m in the northern part the dominant groundwater flow is from the north to the south but there are some flow interactions with surface water bodies as well shahsavari et al 2015 2 2 field data the data set used in the current research comprised of 12 groundwater quality parameters related to 271 sampling wells that were collected as part of the environmental monitoring network by khuzestan water authority and consisted of total hardness th bicarbonate hco3 ca2 mg2 k na cl sulfate so4 2 ec tds total sum of cations tc and total sum of anions ta other than tds as the main subject of this study the other parameters were regarded as the dominant constituents of tds in water as explained earlier the descriptive statistics associated with these parameters have been given in table 1 in complementary part although it seems as if some of the maximum values are higher than normal ranges of water quality parameters however it was opted to use them as outliers for further analysis since no evidence was found about analytical errors or incorrect recording of these values a view of sampling locations has been illustrated in fig 1 in complementary part the majority of samples were collected from wells located in agricultural fields as it can be deduced from this figure 2 3 spatial autocorrelation by moran s index exploratory spatial data analysis can be inspected by investigation of spatial autocorrelation in these methods spatial distribution and structure of the feature of interest is considered in order to detect any spatial dependence or autocorrelation fu et al 2014 in spatial statistics spatial autocorrelation implies correlation of a variable with itself through space while the recorded values for the variable of interest are usually more similar for nearby locations than that of locations farther apart in cases in which similar attributes occur near one another the autocorrelation will be positive otherwise if dissimilar values occur in close proximity to each other the respective autocorrelation will be negative accordingly there are a number of spatial autocorrelation indicators that were utilized in environmental researches such as moran s i li et al 2014 liu et al 2017a 2017b gholizadeh et al 2017 fallahzadeh et al 2018 getis s g nadari et al 2017 harvey et al 2018 tango c zhang and lin 2006 and geary s c miller et al 2016 among these indices the most popular approach is moran s i index due to its high accuracy and its capability to identify hotspot areas e g spatial outliers li et al 2014 the moran s i index is calculated by the following equation 1 i n i j w ij z i z j w i 1 n z i 2 where z i x i x and the mean of x is represented by x while w i 1 n j 1 n w ij is the sum of weight function w ij that can be defined as the reciprocal of distance among locations i and j for the sampling points under the null hypothesis of no spatial auto correlation the moran s i index was calculated by the method of gittleman and kot 1990 assuming normality of i under this null hypothesis in addition the sensitivity of the results was inspected by considering different bandwidth sizes e g kernel sizes that represented as the number of nearest neighbors in this case kalogirou 2017 2 4 universal kriging in addition to spatial autocorrelation analysis by moran s index the spatial dependence of the feature of interest was also investigated using variography that was essential for the generation of resultant maps there are a number of parameters associated with a variogram some part of variability in the field that is not accounted for by distance between observations is known as nugget effect leon et al 2014 one of the influential parameters on the level of nugget is the minimum distance between sampling points since the close range spatial dependence can t be estimated in the absence of close to each other observation points on the contrary the maximum observed variability in the field and the point where there is not any change in semivariance with increase of distance are represented by sill and range respectively karl and maurer 2010 in this study the semivariance was calculated for the log transformed values of tds since the distribution of original data values were positively skewed in order to find the direction of regional trend the method of kumar 2007 was used in this respect directional semivariograms and their respective perpendicular axes were estimated starting from zero with 5 intervals anticlockwise from the east direction followed by detection of the variograms with maximum difference given the semivariogram values following determination of the perpendicular directional variograms of interest different variogram models including gaussian spherical and exponential models were fitted to the log transformed variogram in the direction devoid of any external drift in universal kriging technique the values of tds at un sampled locations s 0 are calculated given n number of observations z s i by the following equation brus and heuvelink 2007 2 z s 0 c 0 x x c 1 x 1 x 0 x c 1 c 0 c 1 z where the matrix of covariates at the sampling stations wells is represented by x and comprises of n m 1 covariate matrices the vector of covariates at prediction locations x and y coordinates in this case and the vector of covariates between residuals at predicted and observed locations are shown by x 0 and c 0 respectively there is also a variance covariance matrix having a n n dimension for the related n residuals that is indicated by c in this equation the latest parameter c along with c 0 are estimated from the variogram of residuals which is normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance c 0 finally the last parameter z is the vector of observations z s i in this context the universal kriging variance at unobserved locations is also calculated by 3 σ 2 s 0 c 0 c 0 c 1 c 0 x 0 x c 1 c 0 x c 1 x 1 x 0 x c 1 c 0 which is an incorporation term related to the prediction error variance of residuals and the estimation error variance of the trend in this respect the best model was selected according to a cross validation algorithm using mean prediction error mpe root mean squared error rmse and mean squared deviation ratio msdr as the performance criteria bishop and lark 2006 an ideal model should produce a mpe of near zero a small amount within the scale of original data for rmse and a msdr value of near one finally the values of tds at unsampled locations were predicted at a grid covering the bounding box of data with respect to a second order trend model between tds values and coordinates of the sampling points these data were then back transformed to the original scale of data for comparison with actual values 2 5 fixed rank kriging although universal kriging is a viable approach for spatial prediction of a non stationary attribute at unobserved locations however there are some new alternative techniques that are applicable in these situations as well a novel method known as fixed rank kriging frk can be considered as a feasible alternative since it avoids stationary and isotropic covariance as well as variogram modeling so it can also be applied for non stationary features the mathematical detail of this method is complicated and beyond the scope of this paper but interested readers can refer to the previous published literatures for further information e g cressie and johannesson 2008 zammit mangion and cressie 2018 in practice in this method instead of variogram model a spatial random effects sre model is constructed on a discretized spatial domain known as basic real unit bau the sre model decomposes a spatially correlated random process while a term is used to control the random process s fine scale variation and the final decomposition is implemented by a linear combination of spatial basis functions with random weights and the respective control term in this research the baus with a size of 1500 1500 were constructed on a plane around tds sampling locations and the hetereoscedascity of the fine scale variation was set to unity a gaussian basis function was applied and placed regularly in the investigated domain a view of the constructed basis has been depicted in fig 2 in complementary part the sre model was then constructed given the specified baus and basis functions and was fitted using a maximum likelihood algorithm the prediction at all the constructed baus considering the fitted model was the final step in this process 2 6 variable selection by random forest in order to determine which water quality parameters are more influential related to the observed variability of the target variable e g tds in this case a dimensionality reduction procedure was followed using random forest rf technique genuer et al 2010 since rf is based on decision trees and aggregation ideas so they can be ideal methods for variable selection as well rf has been very popular as a new machine learning technique in different aspects of environmental researches philibert et al 2013 wang et al 2015a 2015b larras et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhan et al 2018 but its application as a variable selection algorithm in different majors has been very limited archer and kimes 2008 grömping 2009 genuer et al 2010 despite the proved high efficiency of this technique for variable selection in other fields of studies this technique has not been utilized for this purpose within the scope of environmental sciences to the best of knowledge of the author of this paper the variable selection in this algorithm is implemented during a two step process first a variable importance metric is used to rank variables according to their importance and eliminate the less important variables the following variable importance is utilized for this purpose 4 vi x j 1 ntree t erroo b j erroob t in this respect oob t denotes the data not included in the bootstrap sample for each tree t of the forest and erroob t is the respective mean squared error mse of a single tree t of this oob t sample accordingly erroo b j is the error following randomly permutation of the values of x j in the related oob t while ntree is the number of trees in the forest in the next step either by application of a collection of rf models followed by selection of the variable associated with the most accurate ones or introducing sequentially the sorted variables two different subset of variables represented as most influential and least influential parameters were produced 3 results and discussion the histogram of tds values and that of log transformed data along 271 sampling wells have been illustrated in fig 3 in complementary part according to the results table 1 in complementary part the minimum and maximum observed values fluctuated between 20 85 and 9680 00 mg l while the median and mean detected levels were 531 00 and 748 52 mg l respectively as it is clear the data were positively skewed so a log transformation was applied to transform them to a normal probability distribution the results of moran s i index for spatial autocorrelation analysis related to different kernel sizes lioyd 2014 have been given in table 1 spatial clustering of similar values either high or low is represented by a positive value whereas in areas in which clustering of dissimilar values occurs it results in a negative index where high values are surrendered by low values or vice versa anselin 1995 a value of near zero indicates no spatial autocorrelation meaning that we should expect a random spatial distribution bednářová et al 2016 in this respect the resultant p value was zero with observed and expected values of 0 421 and 0 003 for moran s index respectively this higher observed value compared to that of expected level implies that the detected values of tds are positively autocorrelated and are statistically significant with respect to both randomization or resampling hypotheses so a spatial clustering of similar values should be expected within the extent of study area on the other hand for different kernel sizes the calculated values of moran s index were all higher than 0 3 and statistically significant as well when the kernel size k increased from 3 to 24 km the associated level of moran s index decreased from 0 467 to 0 321 however it was still significantly higher than the expected value as a whole on the other hand another criterion for study of spatial dependence was semivariogram analysis the spatial dependence of observations as a function of distance is usually measured by semivariance and a plot representing the semivariance variations as a function of distance between observations is known as semivariogram naveed et al 2016 one of the essential requirements for spatial analysis by conventional kriging methods is that the feature of interest should be second order stationary isaaks and srivastava 1989 marchant 2018 meaning that the mean and variance of spatial variable are similar within the extent of study area and the spatial location is the dominant factor determining the correlation between observations with respect to the omnidirectional variogram of log transformed values of tds fig 4 in complementary part the parabolic shape with monotonic increase of semivariogram with lag distance is the typical behavior of a non stationary feature so conventional spatial prediction methods like ordinary kriging may not be applicable for this variable there are some alternative techniques for spatial modeling of variables that depict second order non stationary behavior e g fouedjio 2017 wadoux et al 2018 one of the common alternative approaches for these non stationary variables is kriging with external drift universal kriging li et al 2015 in this respect groundwater level is among natural features with the same behavior that may exhibit a spatial trend in the direction of groundwater flow gundogdu and guney 2007 kumar 2007 due to the fact that tds represents the solids that are totally dissolved in water so they are completely transported with water and may possibly depict the same spatial behavior as that of water level consequently during universal kriging it is hypothesized that part of variation in the observed feature is due to a trend e g drift while the variation of residuals can be accounted for by a random field cressie 1986 therefore instead of original variable the variogram for the residuals of the regional trend is computed in order to predict at unobserved locations with respect to the variogram model and the associated trend li et al 2015 an ordinary least squares method was applied to estimate the regional trend the resultant linear model for the first order trend was highly significant with an adjusted r squared of 0 34 implying that about 34 of variation of tds concentrations can be explained by a first order linear trend although this confirms the existence of a trend in data however a first order trend does not account for an interaction term therefore a second order trend surface was also fitted with respect to the coordinates of the sampling stations to take the interaction term into account rossiter 2012 the resultant adjusted r squared was highly significant and equal to 0 40 indicating that about 40 of variation is explained by the second order regional trend due to the significant improvement that was observed by application of a second order trend surface a second order trend instead of first order trend was applied for further analysis by the method of universal kriging considering different perpendicular directional variograms the variograms along the 85 and 175 had the maximum difference and have been illustrated in fig 1 the variogram along 175 depicted a parabolic behavior which implies a higher spatial rate in this direction due to the fact that tds are transported with groundwater flow so it may implicitly show the groundwater flow direction as well the semivariogram in the 85 direction did not indicate any trend e g unbounded increase with distance and was regarded as variogram of interest for further analysis the variogram of 85 direction was graphically compared with the variogram of uk which is called the residual variogram hereafter to inspect their difference fig 2 as a whole they are quite similar up till 10 km separation distance there after the residual variogram was significantly lower than that of its original variogram counterpart it may imply the coverage of some of the long range structures by this second order trend surface in addition the range of the residual variogram is also shorter in comparison the results of fitting gaussian spherical and exponential models to empirical variogram of log transformed values of tds have been illustrated in fig 3 as it is clear it seems as if all of the models have successfully captured the semivariace of data values and it is hard to select the best model among them in order to statistically compare these models a cross validation technique was followed nas and berktay 2010 in which one sample at random was taken out from the training set and performance of the model at unused sample was investigated with respect to the mean prediction error mpe and root mean square error rmse criteria considering the cross validation algorithm the variogram parameters including nugget sill and rage associated with the residual variogram models have been rendered in table 2 the results indicate that the exponential and spherical models have very similar performance with mpe and rmse values of 0 0015 and 0 1593 for exponential model respectively on the contrary the respective values for spherical model were in turn 0 0015 and 0 1589 the gaussian model however outperformed a little with mpe and rmse values of 0 0008 and 0 1585 respectively in this field the bias of the spherical model e g the relative value of mpe with respect to the mean was 0 5 and a value of 1 62 was also produced as the mean squared deviation ratio msdr of prediction errors the latest index implies some information about variability of cross validation compared to that of training set with a value of 1 for a best performed model bishop and lark 2006 kerry and oliver 2007 the generated result for this criterion associated with the exponential model was 1 68 indicating that the variability of actual values is a bit higher than its predicted levels on the other hand an ideal model usually contains a small nugget and large sill thus much spatial dependence and much information at unsampled locations can be inferred by their distance from the sampling sites karl and maurer 2010 in this context the ratio of nugget to sill implies valuable information about the spatial autocorrelation of the feature of interest since the nugget of variogram reflects random variation while partial sill represents variation with distance gao et al 2017 a strong spatial dependence e g spatial autocorrelation is represented through a ratio of lower than 25 whereas a higher than 75 ratio indicates a week spatial dependence moreover values between 25 and 75 are interpreted as moderate spatial dependence cambardella et al 1994 martín et al 2016 the resultant ratio for the gaussian spherical and exponential variogram models were 27 17 and 11 respectively with respect to the gaussian model as the best performed model the feature of interest has a moderate spatial dependence while it indicates a strong spatial dependence for tds values according to the spherical and exponential models since there hasn t been much deviation between the cut off value of 25 and 27 and given the finding of the other models it seems as if most probably the attribute of interest has a strong spatial dependence this strong spatial dependence is in accordance with findings of moran s index and shows that the origin of dissolved solids in the groundwater is mainly due to intrinsic properties instead of anthropogenic factors e g human interference cambardella et al 1994 in this field the interaction of groundwater with geological materials of the aquifer was the dominant factor for the observed values of tds in most parts of the study area the final predicted versus actual values of tds using gaussian variogram model has been rendered in fig 4 the adjusted r squared value for the fitted model for this data set was 0 67 reflecting the reasonable performance of the model given this high data record e g 171 number of wells in addition the residual plot and normal q q plot e g standardized residuals versus theoretical quantiles implied that other than stations numbers 48 147 and 269 the performance of the model for the other stations was roughly reasonable considering the developed variogram model the prediction at unobserved locations was implemented at a grid covering the bounding box of the area of interest the feasibility of the predictions was compared with that fixed rank kriging frk a novel spatial method according to the variance of prediction which is a uncertainty assessment that depends on the developed model and configuration of sampling points the predictions made by uk and frk along with their respective variance maps have been illustrated in fig 5 the trend of predictions is very similar to each other considering both techniques where the trend of contamination increases from northwestern to southeastern part of the study area the estimated values of tds by uk varied from 40 67 to 4422 78 mg l whereas those of frk fluctuated between 165 49 and 3575 85 mg l since the major constituent of tds is inorganic not organic materials so waters with high values of tds are known as mineralized waters the highly mineralized waters are usually found in areas with arid environmental condition and tds values higher than 1000 mg l are common in these regions boyd 2000 since the area where the current research was conducted is recognized as an arid region so the higher than normal values of tds may be justifiable given the dominant climatic condition it is not reasonable to compare the kriging generated values with that of actual values since kriging is an exact interpolation method mehdad and kleijnen 2018 e g for the sampling locations give a predictor equal to the observed values however the variance of predictions can implicitly bring about valuable information on the feasibility of prediction the results indicated that the variance of frk approach is very data dependent so in areas in which sampling locations are clustered the variance of predictions did not exceed 1 05 while for the majority of the other areas within the extent of studied region it did not surpass 1 11 on the contrary the variance produced by uk is smoother however they are less accurate than that of frk technique that is to say within the aquifer extent the variance of prediction varied from 1 03 to 1 18 which is quite a bit higher than its frk counterpart within the same region the higher groundwater depth in the northern part of the aquifer along with the dominant groundwater flow direction that is from the north to the south might have been contributed to the lower levels of tds found in the northern part in addition the generated maps are consistent with the findings of moran s index indicating that the sampling locations are of spatial cluster type so both high high high values are in close proximity to a high values neighborhood and low low clusters low values juxtaposed with low values should be expected this hypothesis seems to be true since higher spatial values are completely separated from that of lower predicted values the high high spatial clusters are mainly in the southeastern part of the area whereas the majority of the region belongs to the low low clusters the results of this study were in agreement with the findings of li et al 2014 yan et al 2015 fu et al 2016 and yuan et al 2018 where spatial clustered were detected for trace and major elements in soil in addition the findings of the current study were also in accordance with the results of towfiqul islam et al 2017 and johnson et al 2018 about the spatial auto correlation analysis of some groundwater quality parameters in bangladesh and usa respectively in order to find the main constituents of tds that accounted for the observed variability of this parameter among the investigated parameters a variable selection method was utilized considering the approach explained in the previous section according to the results of variable selection fig 6 and with respect to graphs of the mean and standard deviation of the variable importance vi index three different set of variables can be recognized the first category consists of ec and total cations whereas total anions comprised the second group during the variable selection the mean of vi index decreased from 350 000 to about 50 000 while the related standard deviation reduced from about more than 5000 to approximately more than 2000 for these two groups the rest of parameters comprised the third category of variables with the least importance given the observed variability of tds the mean of vi for this group was around zero accordingly because of the high correlation between tds and ec which has been emphasized in some of the previous researches e g walton 1989 it is not strange that it was the most influential parameter on the variability of tds meanwhile cations were most important than that of anions based on the findings of variable selection by random forest however none of the considered cations e g k ca mg and na were dominated compared to that of anions e g sulfate bicarbonate and cl since the respective mean level of vi for all of them were roughly the same and around zero there are a couple of natural and anthropogenic sources that may contribute to the observed values of tds in both surface and groundwater including urban run off industrial wastewater agricultural run off septic systems the nature of soil livestock waste etc hussain et al 2014 since roughly all of the sampling points are located in agricultural dominated areas fig 1 in complementary part so despite the fact that natural process were the prevalent source of contamination associated with tds in groundwater as discovered by spatial analysis during variography but at least in shallow groundwater regions where groundwater depth is as low as 3 4 m there is certainty an interaction between surface sources of contamination and groundwater in this respect irrigation return flows besides septic systems which are prevalent especially in urban areas are possibly the main contributing factors to the observed values of tds 4 conclusion this study was concerned with spatial analysis of tds in 271 groundwater samples taken from dezful aquifer located in southwestern part of iran in addition to tds there were also 11 other water quality parameters which were the main constituents of tds and consisted of total cations ta total anions tc na cl ca mg bicarbonate sulfate ec total hardness and k random forest was utilized as a variable selection method to select the most influential parameters on the variation of tds among the considered ones although rf has been used both as a machine learning technique in classification and regression problems and as a spatial prediction approach however it has not been utilized as a variable selection in environmental sciences up until know it was concluded that random forest was an efficient variable selection technique since the results were consistent and justifiable from environmental point of view the most important parameters were ec that has been proved to show a high correlation with tds in most of the previous researches in addition to tc followed by tc which implicitly contain the values of the rest of parameters none of the anions and cations alone had an influential effect on the observed variability of tds due to the unbounded behavior of semivariance values of tds with respect to distance that is the typical behavior of a non stationary attribute both universal kriging uk and fixed rank kriging frk were utilized for spatial analysis of the feature of interest it was concluded that both of the methods were efficient to capture the spatial structure of tds however frk was roughly more accurate in terms of the generated variances of the residuals although frk has been mainly developed for large data set but this study confirmed the efficiency of this approach for non stationary attributes as well acknowledgement this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit

1602,wastewater recovered from hydraulic fracturing is referred to as flowback and produced water fpw and is often saline contains numerous organic and inorganic constituents and may pose threats to groundwater resources hundreds of spills of fpw have been reported to the alberta energy regulator each year recently samples of fpw derived from hydraulic fracturing of the duvernay formation ab were found to contain a previously unidentified class of aryl phosphates including diphenyl phosphate dpp triphenyl phosphate tpp and others aryl phosphates are also used in a variety of other industries and their constituents can be found in flame retardants plasticizers lubricants hydraulic fluids and oxidizers many of these aryl phosphates break down into dpp therefore it is important to determine the environmental fate and potential impact of dpp if spilled in the near surface as dpp is an emerging contaminant in soil and groundwater systems this study was aimed at determining 1 the sorption behavior of dpp onto various surficial sediments collected within the fox creek ab region and 2 the toxicity of dpp toward aquatic ecosystems we report that the sorption of dpp onto both clay rich soils and sandy sediment was low compared to that of other aryl phosphates with an average log koc value of 2 30 0 42 1σ therefore the transport of dpp in groundwater would be rapid due to its low degree of sorption on surficial materials we also determined the acute 96 h lc50 of dpp on zebrafish embryos to be 50 0 7 1 mg l su et al 2014 studied the toxic effects of dpp and tpp on chicken embryonic hepatocytes and found that dpp had less cytotoxic effects than tpp but altered more gene transcripts from the results our study we infer that dpp may pose an environmental risk to aquatic ecosystems if released into the environment keywords aryl phosphate sorption flowback batch experiments aquatic toxicity 1 introduction diphenyl phosphate dpp c12h11po4 is a major environmental degradation product and metabolite of several aryl phosphate esters including triphenyl phosphate tpp 2 ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate ehdp and others that include the dpp moiety howard and deo 1979 muir and grift 1981 david and seiber 1999a su et al 2014 wang et al 2016 aryl phosphate esters are used in the manufacture of a variety of products including but not limited to flame retardants reemtsma et al 2008 van der veen and de boer 2012 plasticizers reemtsma et al 2008 wei et al 2015 lubricants andresen et al 2004 and hydraulic fluids williams and lebel 1981 david and seiber 1999b therefore it is important to study the environmental fate and transport of aryl phosphates due to their wide spread use and potential for toxicity in the environment aryl phosphates have been found to contaminate soil and water at a number of locales worldwide especially those near major industrialized sites e g sheldon and hites 1979 williams et al 1982 ishikawa et al 1985 fukushima et al 1992 martínez carballo et al 2007 rodil et al 2012 studying the northwest region of spain between november 2007 and september 2008 monitored the presence of 53 compounds including some aryl phosphate esters in wastewater surface water and drinking water it was found that dpp was widespread being present in many of the studied samples whereas tpp was found in only one sample rodil et al 2012 more recently he et al 2017 analyzed the organic and inorganic chemistry of flowback and produced water fpw collected from hydraulic fracturing operations in the region of fox creek alberta canada of the numerous chemical compounds identified in this fpw a group of aryl phosphates including tpp and dpp were identified the authors did not conclude that there was a purpose for adding aryl phosphates to the injected hydraulic fracturing fluids however they did identify an additive known as irgafos 168 a triphenyl phosphite that is sometimes added to hydraulic fracturing fluids as a processing stabilizer and secondary antioxidant the aryl phosphates in these samples were presumed to be downhole oxidation products of this additive hundreds of spills of fpw are reported to the alberta energy regulator aer each year aer 2016 similarly the us environmental protection agency epa conducted an extensive study of hydraulic fracturing related spills in 11 states and out of the 464 spills studied over a 6 year period approximately 48 of the spilled materials were fpw us epa 2016 clearly there is a possibility of introducing aryl phosphates from hydraulic fracturing operations including dpp into the environment the environmental fate of many aryl phosphates has not been extensively studied some work has been done to determine their sorption behavior and environmental fate studies by saeger et al 1979 renberg et al 1980 muir and grift 1981 huckins et al 1991 and anderson et al 1993 all concluded that the aryl phosphates studied including tpp and others that had the dpp moiety exhibited low water solubility and high partitioning to the organic matter or sediment fraction muir and grift 1981 and anderson et al 1993 both concluded that tpp degraded to dpp over the course of their experiments and that dpp was the main degradation product studies on the toxicity of aryl phosphates are also limited su et al 2014 has conducted the only known study on the cytotoxic effects of dpp using chicken embryonic hepatocytes wherein the authors found that dpp had less cytotoxic effects than its parent tpp however the toxicity to common aquatic organisms representative of those likely to be found in regions where for example hydraulic fracturing wastewater handling occurs is unknown currently it is unclear how changes in soil e g mineralogy fraction of organic carbon foc or solution chemistry e g ph impact the sorption behavior of dpp the goals of the present study were two fold first we investigated how dpp would interact in near surface environments characterizing the sorption characteristics and modeling transport of dpp in a variety of natural soils collected from the region we also used synthetic hydrous ferrous oxide hfo coated sand across a wide range of ph 5 to 9 and solid to dpp concentration ratios to understand the sorption behavior and transport potential of dpp in groundwater and soil environments second we investigated the potential for adverse effects of dpp a major environmental degradation product of commonly used aryl phosphates muir and grift 1981 su et al 2014 on zebrafish embryo acute toxicity 2 materials 2 1 aqueous solutions for the simulated groundwater used in the batch sorption experiments an electrolyte solution containing approximately 1000 mg l cl and 500 mg l hco3 was made by adding nacl and nahco3 to milli q distilled water the simulated groundwater composition was based on a representative groundwater sample collected in the fox creek area 500 mg l hco3 table s2 as well as representative fpw samples 100 000 mg l cl collected in the same region table s1 in supplementary materials of he et al 2017 we assumed an approximate 100 1 cl dilution of fpw with groundwater to simplify the experiments no other cations or anions were considered because they were not in high abundance in either sample stock solutions were made just prior to use in each experiment the presence of hco3 serves a dual purpose bicarbonate is both a common anion found in many shallow groundwater samples and acts as a ph buffer for the experiments a portion of the electrolyte solution was then segregated after which dpp was added such that the concentration of the stock solution was approximately 500 mg l measurements of the stock and electrolyte solutions were made gravimetrically 2 2 sediments two broad classes of unconsolidated sediment were used in this study 1 synthetic hydrous ferric oxide hfo coated sand and 2 representative surficial sediments collected in the fox creek area ab canada the procedure for making the hfo coated sand is outlined in the supplementary materials the surficial sediments were collected at locations around the fox creek area corresponding with major soil types found in the region pawley and atkinson 2013 utting 2013 collected sediment types studied included glaciolacustrine clay glc moraine mor stagnant moraine stgm and fluvial sand fluv grain size distributions of these collected soil types are given in tables s3 and s4 samples of moraine are dark brown to black in color samples of glaciolacustrine clay and stagnant moraine are a beige color fig s1 x ray diffraction xrd and tn tc toc total nitrogen total carbon total organic carbon results for the surficial sediment collected are given in table s5 the results show that the moraine soil has the highest toc content 8 92 and is mostly comprised of clay minerals muscovite and kaolinite the glaciolacustrine clay and stagnant moraine are composed of more feldspars albite and orthoclase and less clay minerals predominantly muscovite with a lower toc content glc 1 64 stgm 0 66 compared to the moraine samples the fluvial sand was dominantly comprised of quartz with minor amounts of feldspar clay minerals muscovite and kaolinite and some carbonates and pyrite not surprisingly analyses of the fluvial sand indicate that it has the lowest toc 0 23 and tn 0 02 of all the collected samples 3 methods 3 1 experimental methods 3 1 1 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments on the five sediments studied here closely followed the methods reported in roy et al 1992 and zachara and streile 1991 a constant solids to solution simulated groundwater spiked with dpp ratio of 1 4 2 5 g sand was applied to hfo coated sand and fluvial sand and 1 50 0 2 g sediment was used for clay dominated sediment types experiments were conducted in polypropylene vials the ph of each vial was adjusted by adding small volumes of either concentrated hcl or naoh from 0 1 m to 5 m to the solution until the ph of the solution was within 0 05 of the desired target additionally the mass of each vial was measured before and after the ph probe was placed into solution to record any solution losses due to ph measurements each tube was then placed on a rotator for approximately 24 h our kinetics data indicate that dpp sorption reached equilibrium before 8 h for all sediment types see supplementary materials after this equilibration time the ph of each tube was measured and recorded and the sample was then centrifuged for 40 min at 10 000g the supernatant was then extracted from each vial using a plastic pipette tip unfiltered to be analyzed for dpp total organic carbon toc and total phosphorous tp in solution 3 1 2 zebrafish embryo toxicity assays zebrafish embryo toxicity tests were conducted to assess the potential for adverse effects of dpp on aquatic organisms such as fish exposures were conducted under semi static conditions in 50 ml glass beakers at 25 1 c under a 16 h 8 h light dark cycle seven concentrations of dpp 3 1 6 3 12 5 25 50 100 200 mg l and one control water group using dilution water were tested exposure solutions were prepared by dissolving dpp powder into dilution water prior to exposure the dilution water was moderately hard water see supplementary materials each exposure beaker contained 30 ml of exposure solution control water and half of the exposure solution was changed daily to begin an experiment 10 fertilized embryos 1 h post fertilization hpf were randomly selected and placed into each exposure beaker during the 96 h exposure period any dead embryos observed were removed immediately all the exposures were repeated for three replications in total 30 embryos were tested for each exposure control group at the end of exposure the half lethal concentration lc50 was calculated using the toxicity relationship analysis program trap v1 21 erickson 2010 3 2 analytical methods 3 2 1 soil analyses we conducted xrd analyses to determine the mineralogical makeup of the soil samples samples were run in a rigaku ultima iv with a cobalt source with data collected from a 2θ range from 5 to 90 the jade 9 5 analysis package ks analytical systems was used to fit the resultant diffraction patterns soil analyses for tn total nitrogen tc total carbon and toc total organic carbon were determined using dry flash combustion following the method outlined by nelson and sommers 1996 and bremmer 1996 using a costech model ea 4010 elemental analyzer a known mass of soil was placed in a combustion chamber containing cr iii oxide and cobaltous ic oxide silver catalysts upon the addition of oxygen into the combustion chamber the temperature was increased from approximately 1020 c to between 1800 and 2000 c during combustion the nitrogen n and carbon c in the sample is converted into n2 or nox which is later reduced to n2 and co2 respectively the n2 and co2 gases are then collected separated run through a chromatographic column and detected quantitatively using a thermal conductivity detector 3 2 2 solution analyses aliquots of solution taken from the batch sorption experiments were analyzed using three methods samples 30 40 ml total were diluted 1 8 with milli q water and kept at 4 c in a refrigerator before they were analyzed for toc using a shimadzu toc vcph instrument fresh dilution and rinse water was obtained each day from an elix 5 water system with milli q filtration to minimize co2 absorption from the atmosphere standard solutions were prepared from dried and desiccated reagents potassium hydrogen phthalate for tc npoc non purgeable organic carbon and sodium bicarbonate sodium carbonate for ic poc inorganic carbon purgeable organic carbon and were analyzed before each sample set acid reagents phosphoric and hydrochloric acids were monitored and replenished or replaced as necessary samples were analyzed in sets of 12 to 15 using an auto sampler and each sample was subsampled 3 to 5 times for each of the following analyses tc ic npoc and poc before the analysis results were compiled total phosphorous tp concentrations of water samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes using a thermo icap6300 duo icp oes instrument as with the toc method samples were diluted 1 8 with milli q water and kept at 4 c in a refrigerator before they were analyzed for tp yttrium y was used during the analyses as an internal standard to correct for matrix effects the quantitation of dpp in solution was performed using a 3200 qtrap tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode an agilent 1260 auto sampler injected 40 μl of sample and an agilent 1200 binary pump set to flow 700 μl min of 1 1 water methanol was used to carry the sample to the mass spectrometer samples were introduced to the mass spectrometer via electrospray ionization esi in negative ion mode two reactions were monitored quantitation was done using the transition 249 1 93 1 dpp h oph and confirmed with the transition 249 1 65 0 dpp h ophoh external standards were prepared the day of analysis samples under 100 ppm were quantitated using a calibration curve with six points covering 0 to 100 ppm and samples over 100 ppm were quantitated using a separate calibration curve with six points covering 0 to 800 ppm 4 results discussion 4 1 sorption behavior of dpp most aryl phosphates are characterized by high log kow and log koc values indicating that they are highly hydrophobic and lipophilic prone to partition onto organic matter in sediment and likely to accumulate in fatty tissue boethling and cooper 1985 saeger et al 1979 conducted the most extensive study and found that aryl phosphates generally exhibited very low water solubility sw for tpp 1 9 mg l and high log octanol water partitioning coefficients log kow for tpp log kow 4 63 other aryl phosphates with the dpp moiety including isodecyl diphenyl phosphate iddp tertbutylphenyl diphenyl phosphate tbdp 2 ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate ehdp isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate ipdp and cresyl diphenyl phosphate cdp exhibited comparable results saeger et al 1979 which were in good agreement with a similar study conducted by renberg et al 1980 muir et al 1980 reported the log organic carbon partitioning coefficient log koc for tpp to be 4 17 huckins et al 1991 investigated the sorption of tpp onto top soil 5 sand 77 silt 18 clay organic carbon fraction foc 1 12 and measured log koc to be 3 93 muir and grift 1981 reported the distribution coefficient kd for suspended matter within river water was 12 389 l kg for ehdp however based on the pka 3 88 christ et al 2011 and molecular structure of dpp it was unclear to us whether the sorption of dpp would be dominated by protonation deprotonation processes and therefore exhibit a ph dependence on sorption or be similar to other aryl phosphates and be dominated by hydrophobicity and correlate with foc to that end we tested whether the sorption of dpp onto sediment or soil has a ph dependence within an environmentally relevant range between ph 5 and 9 the three independent analytical techniques used to determine the concentration of dpp in solution ms ms toc and tp were consistent with each other within the experimentally tested range of solution concentrations and ph dpp exhibits a low degree of sorption onto organic rich clay dominated sediment mor stgm glc with linear distribution coefficient kd values ranging from 2 0 to 12 0 l kg fig 1a to c to very low degrees of sorption onto predominantly sandy material hfo fluv with kd values almost an order of magnitude lower 0 1 to 0 5 l kg fig 1d and e the ratio of dpp solid concentrations cs to those remaining in solution c after equilibrium remained constant as a function of increasing total dpp concentration and the linear kd method was therefore used to model our sorption data fig s4 this is consistent with the high solubility of dpp in water relative to other aryl phosphates the kd for most of the sediments glc stgm hfo and fluv tested do not appear to be affected by changes in ph remaining constant within the uncertainties calculated for the experiments within the tested ph range of approximately 5 to 9 1 fig 1b to e because of the uncertainties in the calculated kd values it is not possible to determine with certainty whether there is a ph dependence on sorption using the three analytical techniques used in this study this is also consistent with the reported pka of dpp 3 88 christ et al 2011 suggesting that the proton active phosphoryl functional dpp would remain largely deprotonated within the tested ph range rather based on our experimental results sorption of dpp onto these sediments appears to be dominated by hydrophobicity and therefore controlled by the foc of the soil using our sorption data a consistent log koc value of 2 30 0 42 1σ was calculated table 1 our calculated values of log koc are also consistent with estimates derived from kow and mci determinations us epa 2012 despite the past research outlined above the sorption behavior of diphenyl phosphate onto sediments has not been studied extensively muir and grift 1981 found that the kd value for suspended matter within river water for dpp was 337 l kg a reported value for the log koc of dpp of 2 292 using a calculated kow log kow 2 88 method or 2 426 using the molecular connectivity index mci method came from a software program called epi suite us epa 2012 these estimates are consistent with the estimated higher water solubility limit sw 513 03 mg l all methods of estimation indicate that dpp will have a low sorption potential approximately two orders of magnitude lower koc values compared to other aryl phosphates and thus is likely to be mobile in near surface environments unlike the other sediments the moraine sediment does appear to exhibit some ph dependence on the calculated kd values within the tested range of ph from 5 6 to 7 9 there appears to be a decrease in sorption with increasing ph fig 1a this trend is seen most readily in the ms ms data fig 1a it is unclear why the moraine appears to exhibit this ph dependence but we hypothesize it may have to do with the mineralogy of the clay in this soil type kaolinite is the dominant clay mineral in the moraine soil as ph increases the clays in the soil become increasingly negative thus repelling the deprotonated and negatively charged functional group in dpp 4 2 groundwater transport a variety of aryl phosphates have been found in soil and water samples especially those near major industrialized sites e g sheldon and hites 1979 williams et al 1982 ishikawa et al 1985 fukushima et al 1992 martínez carballo et al 2007 with recent findings of dpp in wastewater in spain rodil et al 2012 and in flowback water from alberta he et al 2017 there is potential for dpp to be introduced into the environment to assess the potential environmental impacts of a dpp release at or into the near subsurface an analysis of retardation factors eq 1 was conducted we assumed that a linear sorption model was valid for dpp concentrations up to 500 mg l the retardation factor eq 1 was calculated using the following 1 r 1 ρ b n k d where r is the retardation factor ρb is the dry bulk density m l3 n is the total porosity and kd is the distribution coefficient l3 m determined from our dpp sorption experiments to assess the impact to groundwater systems dpp may pose we calculated a number of retardation factors for each type of soil observed and collected from the fox creek area by varying certain soil parameters for this analysis we assumed that organic rich clay soils had a dry bulk density of 1 3 g cm3 arshad et al 1996 and a range of porosities between 0 5 and 0 8 freeze and cherry 1979 terzaghi et al 1996 obrzud and truty 2018 the range of kd values was taken from our experiments with mor glc and stgm and ranged from 1 86 and 12 70 l kg we constructed an array of porosities between 0 5 and 0 8 testing every 0 01 value in between similarly we constructed an array of kd values between 1 86 and 12 70 l kg testing every 0 01 value in between in total 31 porosities and 1085 kd values were tested resulting in 33 635 different retardation factors for high organics clay dominated soils we found that retardation factors for these clay dominated soils varied dramatically ranging from between 4 02 and 34 02 however the stagnant moraine soil exhibited less of a range varying only between 4 02 and 12 99 for more sandy material we assumed that the dry bulk density was 1 7 g cm3 das 2008 and had a range of porosities between 0 25 and 0 45 das 2008 the range of kd values was taken from our experiments with hfo and fluv and ranged from 0 1 and 0 48 l kg using a similar frequency of values above 21 porosities and 39 kd values were tested resulting in 819 different retardation factors for sandy materials we found that the retardation factors for more sandy rich materials varied less than clay dominated soils varying between 1 38 and 4 26 for comparison we conducted a similar analysis on retardation factors for other aryl phosphates including tpp and ehdp for tpp log koc values ranged from 3 40 to 4 17 l kg huckins et al 1991 anderson et al 1993 brooke et al 2009 other aryl phosphates with the dpp moiety such as ehdp log koc 3 98 cdp log koc 3 94 iddp log koc 3 84 ipdp log koc 3 77 and tbdp log koc 3 68 were not tested due to their similarity to tpp brooke et al 2009 to calculate retardation factors from koc we used the following equivalence equation eq 2 2 k d f oc k oc where kd is the distribution coefficient l3 m foc is the fraction of organic carbon in the soil and koc is the organic carbon partitioning coefficient l3 m eq 2 was then substituted into eq 1 to calculate r we found that for tpp the retardation factors for each soil varied greatly but was consistently one or more orders of magnitude higher than for dpp table 2 this is consistent with the greater hydrophobic nature of tpp compared to dpp brooke et al 2009 comparing the log koc values for the other aryl phosphates this analysis suggests that the other aryl phosphates with the dpp moiety would exhibit retardation factors near the median value of tpp still suggesting stronger sorption when compared to dpp 4 3 toxicity of dpp the toxicities of a variety of aryl phosphates including dpp have not been extensively studied toxicity data for these compounds are limited in terms of both number and quality this study focuses mainly on acute toxicity of aryl phosphates to fish embryos due to the lack of available toxicological data or information on dpp we conducted 96 h lc50 experiments with dpp for zebrafish embryos and determined the value to be 49 98 7 06 mg l fig 2 using the us epa ecosar v2 0 software program we estimated a fish 96 h lc50 of 33 5 mg l and a chronic value chv of 3 6 mg l mayo bean et al 2017 these values are far higher than those found in fpw samples from the fox creek area ab canada which were estimated to be approximately 0 0037 mg l 3 7 μg l and above those found by rodil et al 2012 in their wastewater samples 0 01 mg l direct comparison of our reported lc50 on zebrafish embryos with values reported above is difficult however it may shed light on the relative magnitude of its toxicity triphenyl phosphate tpp is among the most extensively studied with studies on zebrafish indicating that tpp may result in developmental toxicity oliveri et al 2015 isales et al 2015 jarema et al 2015 cardiotoxicity mcgee et al 2013 du et al 2015 endocrine disruption liu et al 2012 and bioaccumulation in tissues and organs wang et al 2017 table 3 lists some 96 h lc50 values for various aryl phosphates on various fish species our results suggest that dpp is significantly less toxic than tpp but its toxicity is comparable to some of the experimentally determined values for other aryl phosphates such as iddp and ipdp table 3 su et al 2014 studied the cytotoxic effects of tpp and dpp on chicken embryonic hepatocytes it has been found that dpp had less cytotoxic effect on chicken embryonic hepatocytes than its parent product tpp but had a stronger ability to alter gene expression among the gene expression alterations that were significantly down regulated were those associated with thyroid hormone regulation glucose and fatty acid metabolism and lipid cholesterol metabolism su et al 2014 wang et al 2016 detected amounts of dpp at significantly higher concentrations in the liver and intestine up to 3 to 3 5 times than its parent tpp in adult zebrafish muir and grift 1981 studied the uptake and bioaccumulation of dpp in rainbow trout they found that the bioconcentration factor bcf for dpp was between 0 29 and 2 5 muir and grift 1981 indicating that it weakly bioaccumulates calculated bcf determined by bcfbaf v3 01 was 5 501 l kg somewhat consistent with the muir and grift 1981 study results van den eede et al 2016 speculated that because dpp is highly polar it is likely to be cleared from the human body rapidly and has less potential to penetrate tissues by passive diffusion our discussion above has focused mainly on short term acute effects on fish but long term chronic effects may also be present using the us epa ecosar v2 0 program we can estimate a chv of 3 6 mg l that may result in significant toxic potential for a longer term exposure for other aquatic species a daphnid 48 h lc50 and chv were estimated to be 20 6 and 2 5 mg l respectively whereas a 96 h lc50 and chv for green algae as a representative aquatic plant can be estimated to be 21 5 and 6 7 mg l respectively these lc50 s and chv s are both lower than those estimated for fish this may indicate that dpp is less acutely toxic to aquatic ecosystems than other aryl phosphates although longer term studies species sensitivity distribution studies and the effects of sub lethal longer term exposures remain to be investigated therefore the toxic potential of dpp on aquatic ecosystems remains unclear and requires further study 5 summary conclusions this study aimed to determine the sorption behavior of diphenyl phosphate dpp an emerging contaminant under a variety of environmentally relevant ph conditions and with both synthetic and natural sediment samples also evaluated was the potential environmental impact dpp may have if released into the groundwater batch sorption experiments using a synthetic representative groundwater composition and five different sediment types were conducted to determine the distribution coefficients kd of dpp for each soil little toxicity data exists for dpp so the 96 h lc50 for dpp on zebrafish embryos was determined to assess if dpp may be toxic to aquatic ecosystems our results show that dpp has a low to very low degree of sorption with kd ranging from approximately 2 to 12 l kg for clay rich soil types moraine glaciolacustrine clay stagnant moraine and down to approximately 0 1 to 0 4 l kg for sand rich materials hfo coated sand fluvial sand within the tested ph range 5 to 9 most of the materials tested showed no significant ph dependence on sorption and neither the freudlich nor langmuir equations were used or required to fit the data normalized to foc the log koc value for dpp in this study was 2 30 0 43 1σ we reason that the sorption of dpp onto the sediment type is dominated and controlled by its foc the one exception the clay rich moraine showed a decreasing trend of sorption with increasing ph we hypothesize that because the moraine was dominated by clays which become increasingly negative with increasing ph the resulting repulsion of the deprotonated dpp molecule may have reduced sorption at the higher ph analysis of the retardation factors of dpp compared to other tpp and other aryl phosphates showed that transport of dpp for various soil types is consistently lower than other aryl phosphates for more sandy soils the transport of dpp is near conservative r is between 1 38 and 4 26 in some cases for more clay and organic rich soils retardation factors range from approximately 4 to 34 which is at least an order of magnitude less than other aryl phosphates for the same soil type by conducting dpp toxicity assays we determined that the 96 h lc50 for zebrafish embryos was 50 mg l taken together with the cytotoxicity study of su et al 2014 on chicken embryonic hepatocytes this suggests that dpp has the potential to impact aquatic ecosystems and possibly other non aquatic organisms future studies should expand and focus on characterizing the toxicity of dpp on other organisms including aquatic avian and mammalian species they should also address both chronic and acute effects because of its low sorption potential coupled with its known toxicity dpp may pose a

1602,wastewater recovered from hydraulic fracturing is referred to as flowback and produced water fpw and is often saline contains numerous organic and inorganic constituents and may pose threats to groundwater resources hundreds of spills of fpw have been reported to the alberta energy regulator each year recently samples of fpw derived from hydraulic fracturing of the duvernay formation ab were found to contain a previously unidentified class of aryl phosphates including diphenyl phosphate dpp triphenyl phosphate tpp and others aryl phosphates are also used in a variety of other industries and their constituents can be found in flame retardants plasticizers lubricants hydraulic fluids and oxidizers many of these aryl phosphates break down into dpp therefore it is important to determine the environmental fate and potential impact of dpp if spilled in the near surface as dpp is an emerging contaminant in soil and groundwater systems this study was aimed at determining 1 the sorption behavior of dpp onto various surficial sediments collected within the fox creek ab region and 2 the toxicity of dpp toward aquatic ecosystems we report that the sorption of dpp onto both clay rich soils and sandy sediment was low compared to that of other aryl phosphates with an average log koc value of 2 30 0 42 1σ therefore the transport of dpp in groundwater would be rapid due to its low degree of sorption on surficial materials we also determined the acute 96 h lc50 of dpp on zebrafish embryos to be 50 0 7 1 mg l su et al 2014 studied the toxic effects of dpp and tpp on chicken embryonic hepatocytes and found that dpp had less cytotoxic effects than tpp but altered more gene transcripts from the results our study we infer that dpp may pose an environmental risk to aquatic ecosystems if released into the environment keywords aryl phosphate sorption flowback batch experiments aquatic toxicity 1 introduction diphenyl phosphate dpp c12h11po4 is a major environmental degradation product and metabolite of several aryl phosphate esters including triphenyl phosphate tpp 2 ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate ehdp and others that include the dpp moiety howard and deo 1979 muir and grift 1981 david and seiber 1999a su et al 2014 wang et al 2016 aryl phosphate esters are used in the manufacture of a variety of products including but not limited to flame retardants reemtsma et al 2008 van der veen and de boer 2012 plasticizers reemtsma et al 2008 wei et al 2015 lubricants andresen et al 2004 and hydraulic fluids williams and lebel 1981 david and seiber 1999b therefore it is important to study the environmental fate and transport of aryl phosphates due to their wide spread use and potential for toxicity in the environment aryl phosphates have been found to contaminate soil and water at a number of locales worldwide especially those near major industrialized sites e g sheldon and hites 1979 williams et al 1982 ishikawa et al 1985 fukushima et al 1992 martínez carballo et al 2007 rodil et al 2012 studying the northwest region of spain between november 2007 and september 2008 monitored the presence of 53 compounds including some aryl phosphate esters in wastewater surface water and drinking water it was found that dpp was widespread being present in many of the studied samples whereas tpp was found in only one sample rodil et al 2012 more recently he et al 2017 analyzed the organic and inorganic chemistry of flowback and produced water fpw collected from hydraulic fracturing operations in the region of fox creek alberta canada of the numerous chemical compounds identified in this fpw a group of aryl phosphates including tpp and dpp were identified the authors did not conclude that there was a purpose for adding aryl phosphates to the injected hydraulic fracturing fluids however they did identify an additive known as irgafos 168 a triphenyl phosphite that is sometimes added to hydraulic fracturing fluids as a processing stabilizer and secondary antioxidant the aryl phosphates in these samples were presumed to be downhole oxidation products of this additive hundreds of spills of fpw are reported to the alberta energy regulator aer each year aer 2016 similarly the us environmental protection agency epa conducted an extensive study of hydraulic fracturing related spills in 11 states and out of the 464 spills studied over a 6 year period approximately 48 of the spilled materials were fpw us epa 2016 clearly there is a possibility of introducing aryl phosphates from hydraulic fracturing operations including dpp into the environment the environmental fate of many aryl phosphates has not been extensively studied some work has been done to determine their sorption behavior and environmental fate studies by saeger et al 1979 renberg et al 1980 muir and grift 1981 huckins et al 1991 and anderson et al 1993 all concluded that the aryl phosphates studied including tpp and others that had the dpp moiety exhibited low water solubility and high partitioning to the organic matter or sediment fraction muir and grift 1981 and anderson et al 1993 both concluded that tpp degraded to dpp over the course of their experiments and that dpp was the main degradation product studies on the toxicity of aryl phosphates are also limited su et al 2014 has conducted the only known study on the cytotoxic effects of dpp using chicken embryonic hepatocytes wherein the authors found that dpp had less cytotoxic effects than its parent tpp however the toxicity to common aquatic organisms representative of those likely to be found in regions where for example hydraulic fracturing wastewater handling occurs is unknown currently it is unclear how changes in soil e g mineralogy fraction of organic carbon foc or solution chemistry e g ph impact the sorption behavior of dpp the goals of the present study were two fold first we investigated how dpp would interact in near surface environments characterizing the sorption characteristics and modeling transport of dpp in a variety of natural soils collected from the region we also used synthetic hydrous ferrous oxide hfo coated sand across a wide range of ph 5 to 9 and solid to dpp concentration ratios to understand the sorption behavior and transport potential of dpp in groundwater and soil environments second we investigated the potential for adverse effects of dpp a major environmental degradation product of commonly used aryl phosphates muir and grift 1981 su et al 2014 on zebrafish embryo acute toxicity 2 materials 2 1 aqueous solutions for the simulated groundwater used in the batch sorption experiments an electrolyte solution containing approximately 1000 mg l cl and 500 mg l hco3 was made by adding nacl and nahco3 to milli q distilled water the simulated groundwater composition was based on a representative groundwater sample collected in the fox creek area 500 mg l hco3 table s2 as well as representative fpw samples 100 000 mg l cl collected in the same region table s1 in supplementary materials of he et al 2017 we assumed an approximate 100 1 cl dilution of fpw with groundwater to simplify the experiments no other cations or anions were considered because they were not in high abundance in either sample stock solutions were made just prior to use in each experiment the presence of hco3 serves a dual purpose bicarbonate is both a common anion found in many shallow groundwater samples and acts as a ph buffer for the experiments a portion of the electrolyte solution was then segregated after which dpp was added such that the concentration of the stock solution was approximately 500 mg l measurements of the stock and electrolyte solutions were made gravimetrically 2 2 sediments two broad classes of unconsolidated sediment were used in this study 1 synthetic hydrous ferric oxide hfo coated sand and 2 representative surficial sediments collected in the fox creek area ab canada the procedure for making the hfo coated sand is outlined in the supplementary materials the surficial sediments were collected at locations around the fox creek area corresponding with major soil types found in the region pawley and atkinson 2013 utting 2013 collected sediment types studied included glaciolacustrine clay glc moraine mor stagnant moraine stgm and fluvial sand fluv grain size distributions of these collected soil types are given in tables s3 and s4 samples of moraine are dark brown to black in color samples of glaciolacustrine clay and stagnant moraine are a beige color fig s1 x ray diffraction xrd and tn tc toc total nitrogen total carbon total organic carbon results for the surficial sediment collected are given in table s5 the results show that the moraine soil has the highest toc content 8 92 and is mostly comprised of clay minerals muscovite and kaolinite the glaciolacustrine clay and stagnant moraine are composed of more feldspars albite and orthoclase and less clay minerals predominantly muscovite with a lower toc content glc 1 64 stgm 0 66 compared to the moraine samples the fluvial sand was dominantly comprised of quartz with minor amounts of feldspar clay minerals muscovite and kaolinite and some carbonates and pyrite not surprisingly analyses of the fluvial sand indicate that it has the lowest toc 0 23 and tn 0 02 of all the collected samples 3 methods 3 1 experimental methods 3 1 1 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments on the five sediments studied here closely followed the methods reported in roy et al 1992 and zachara and streile 1991 a constant solids to solution simulated groundwater spiked with dpp ratio of 1 4 2 5 g sand was applied to hfo coated sand and fluvial sand and 1 50 0 2 g sediment was used for clay dominated sediment types experiments were conducted in polypropylene vials the ph of each vial was adjusted by adding small volumes of either concentrated hcl or naoh from 0 1 m to 5 m to the solution until the ph of the solution was within 0 05 of the desired target additionally the mass of each vial was measured before and after the ph probe was placed into solution to record any solution losses due to ph measurements each tube was then placed on a rotator for approximately 24 h our kinetics data indicate that dpp sorption reached equilibrium before 8 h for all sediment types see supplementary materials after this equilibration time the ph of each tube was measured and recorded and the sample was then centrifuged for 40 min at 10 000g the supernatant was then extracted from each vial using a plastic pipette tip unfiltered to be analyzed for dpp total organic carbon toc and total phosphorous tp in solution 3 1 2 zebrafish embryo toxicity assays zebrafish embryo toxicity tests were conducted to assess the potential for adverse effects of dpp on aquatic organisms such as fish exposures were conducted under semi static conditions in 50 ml glass beakers at 25 1 c under a 16 h 8 h light dark cycle seven concentrations of dpp 3 1 6 3 12 5 25 50 100 200 mg l and one control water group using dilution water were tested exposure solutions were prepared by dissolving dpp powder into dilution water prior to exposure the dilution water was moderately hard water see supplementary materials each exposure beaker contained 30 ml of exposure solution control water and half of the exposure solution was changed daily to begin an experiment 10 fertilized embryos 1 h post fertilization hpf were randomly selected and placed into each exposure beaker during the 96 h exposure period any dead embryos observed were removed immediately all the exposures were repeated for three replications in total 30 embryos were tested for each exposure control group at the end of exposure the half lethal concentration lc50 was calculated using the toxicity relationship analysis program trap v1 21 erickson 2010 3 2 analytical methods 3 2 1 soil analyses we conducted xrd analyses to determine the mineralogical makeup of the soil samples samples were run in a rigaku ultima iv with a cobalt source with data collected from a 2θ range from 5 to 90 the jade 9 5 analysis package ks analytical systems was used to fit the resultant diffraction patterns soil analyses for tn total nitrogen tc total carbon and toc total organic carbon were determined using dry flash combustion following the method outlined by nelson and sommers 1996 and bremmer 1996 using a costech model ea 4010 elemental analyzer a known mass of soil was placed in a combustion chamber containing cr iii oxide and cobaltous ic oxide silver catalysts upon the addition of oxygen into the combustion chamber the temperature was increased from approximately 1020 c to between 1800 and 2000 c during combustion the nitrogen n and carbon c in the sample is converted into n2 or nox which is later reduced to n2 and co2 respectively the n2 and co2 gases are then collected separated run through a chromatographic column and detected quantitatively using a thermal conductivity detector 3 2 2 solution analyses aliquots of solution taken from the batch sorption experiments were analyzed using three methods samples 30 40 ml total were diluted 1 8 with milli q water and kept at 4 c in a refrigerator before they were analyzed for toc using a shimadzu toc vcph instrument fresh dilution and rinse water was obtained each day from an elix 5 water system with milli q filtration to minimize co2 absorption from the atmosphere standard solutions were prepared from dried and desiccated reagents potassium hydrogen phthalate for tc npoc non purgeable organic carbon and sodium bicarbonate sodium carbonate for ic poc inorganic carbon purgeable organic carbon and were analyzed before each sample set acid reagents phosphoric and hydrochloric acids were monitored and replenished or replaced as necessary samples were analyzed in sets of 12 to 15 using an auto sampler and each sample was subsampled 3 to 5 times for each of the following analyses tc ic npoc and poc before the analysis results were compiled total phosphorous tp concentrations of water samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes using a thermo icap6300 duo icp oes instrument as with the toc method samples were diluted 1 8 with milli q water and kept at 4 c in a refrigerator before they were analyzed for tp yttrium y was used during the analyses as an internal standard to correct for matrix effects the quantitation of dpp in solution was performed using a 3200 qtrap tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode an agilent 1260 auto sampler injected 40 μl of sample and an agilent 1200 binary pump set to flow 700 μl min of 1 1 water methanol was used to carry the sample to the mass spectrometer samples were introduced to the mass spectrometer via electrospray ionization esi in negative ion mode two reactions were monitored quantitation was done using the transition 249 1 93 1 dpp h oph and confirmed with the transition 249 1 65 0 dpp h ophoh external standards were prepared the day of analysis samples under 100 ppm were quantitated using a calibration curve with six points covering 0 to 100 ppm and samples over 100 ppm were quantitated using a separate calibration curve with six points covering 0 to 800 ppm 4 results discussion 4 1 sorption behavior of dpp most aryl phosphates are characterized by high log kow and log koc values indicating that they are highly hydrophobic and lipophilic prone to partition onto organic matter in sediment and likely to accumulate in fatty tissue boethling and cooper 1985 saeger et al 1979 conducted the most extensive study and found that aryl phosphates generally exhibited very low water solubility sw for tpp 1 9 mg l and high log octanol water partitioning coefficients log kow for tpp log kow 4 63 other aryl phosphates with the dpp moiety including isodecyl diphenyl phosphate iddp tertbutylphenyl diphenyl phosphate tbdp 2 ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate ehdp isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate ipdp and cresyl diphenyl phosphate cdp exhibited comparable results saeger et al 1979 which were in good agreement with a similar study conducted by renberg et al 1980 muir et al 1980 reported the log organic carbon partitioning coefficient log koc for tpp to be 4 17 huckins et al 1991 investigated the sorption of tpp onto top soil 5 sand 77 silt 18 clay organic carbon fraction foc 1 12 and measured log koc to be 3 93 muir and grift 1981 reported the distribution coefficient kd for suspended matter within river water was 12 389 l kg for ehdp however based on the pka 3 88 christ et al 2011 and molecular structure of dpp it was unclear to us whether the sorption of dpp would be dominated by protonation deprotonation processes and therefore exhibit a ph dependence on sorption or be similar to other aryl phosphates and be dominated by hydrophobicity and correlate with foc to that end we tested whether the sorption of dpp onto sediment or soil has a ph dependence within an environmentally relevant range between ph 5 and 9 the three independent analytical techniques used to determine the concentration of dpp in solution ms ms toc and tp were consistent with each other within the experimentally tested range of solution concentrations and ph dpp exhibits a low degree of sorption onto organic rich clay dominated sediment mor stgm glc with linear distribution coefficient kd values ranging from 2 0 to 12 0 l kg fig 1a to c to very low degrees of sorption onto predominantly sandy material hfo fluv with kd values almost an order of magnitude lower 0 1 to 0 5 l kg fig 1d and e the ratio of dpp solid concentrations cs to those remaining in solution c after equilibrium remained constant as a function of increasing total dpp concentration and the linear kd method was therefore used to model our sorption data fig s4 this is consistent with the high solubility of dpp in water relative to other aryl phosphates the kd for most of the sediments glc stgm hfo and fluv tested do not appear to be affected by changes in ph remaining constant within the uncertainties calculated for the experiments within the tested ph range of approximately 5 to 9 1 fig 1b to e because of the uncertainties in the calculated kd values it is not possible to determine with certainty whether there is a ph dependence on sorption using the three analytical techniques used in this study this is also consistent with the reported pka of dpp 3 88 christ et al 2011 suggesting that the proton active phosphoryl functional dpp would remain largely deprotonated within the tested ph range rather based on our experimental results sorption of dpp onto these sediments appears to be dominated by hydrophobicity and therefore controlled by the foc of the soil using our sorption data a consistent log koc value of 2 30 0 42 1σ was calculated table 1 our calculated values of log koc are also consistent with estimates derived from kow and mci determinations us epa 2012 despite the past research outlined above the sorption behavior of diphenyl phosphate onto sediments has not been studied extensively muir and grift 1981 found that the kd value for suspended matter within river water for dpp was 337 l kg a reported value for the log koc of dpp of 2 292 using a calculated kow log kow 2 88 method or 2 426 using the molecular connectivity index mci method came from a software program called epi suite us epa 2012 these estimates are consistent with the estimated higher water solubility limit sw 513 03 mg l all methods of estimation indicate that dpp will have a low sorption potential approximately two orders of magnitude lower koc values compared to other aryl phosphates and thus is likely to be mobile in near surface environments unlike the other sediments the moraine sediment does appear to exhibit some ph dependence on the calculated kd values within the tested range of ph from 5 6 to 7 9 there appears to be a decrease in sorption with increasing ph fig 1a this trend is seen most readily in the ms ms data fig 1a it is unclear why the moraine appears to exhibit this ph dependence but we hypothesize it may have to do with the mineralogy of the clay in this soil type kaolinite is the dominant clay mineral in the moraine soil as ph increases the clays in the soil become increasingly negative thus repelling the deprotonated and negatively charged functional group in dpp 4 2 groundwater transport a variety of aryl phosphates have been found in soil and water samples especially those near major industrialized sites e g sheldon and hites 1979 williams et al 1982 ishikawa et al 1985 fukushima et al 1992 martínez carballo et al 2007 with recent findings of dpp in wastewater in spain rodil et al 2012 and in flowback water from alberta he et al 2017 there is potential for dpp to be introduced into the environment to assess the potential environmental impacts of a dpp release at or into the near subsurface an analysis of retardation factors eq 1 was conducted we assumed that a linear sorption model was valid for dpp concentrations up to 500 mg l the retardation factor eq 1 was calculated using the following 1 r 1 ρ b n k d where r is the retardation factor ρb is the dry bulk density m l3 n is the total porosity and kd is the distribution coefficient l3 m determined from our dpp sorption experiments to assess the impact to groundwater systems dpp may pose we calculated a number of retardation factors for each type of soil observed and collected from the fox creek area by varying certain soil parameters for this analysis we assumed that organic rich clay soils had a dry bulk density of 1 3 g cm3 arshad et al 1996 and a range of porosities between 0 5 and 0 8 freeze and cherry 1979 terzaghi et al 1996 obrzud and truty 2018 the range of kd values was taken from our experiments with mor glc and stgm and ranged from 1 86 and 12 70 l kg we constructed an array of porosities between 0 5 and 0 8 testing every 0 01 value in between similarly we constructed an array of kd values between 1 86 and 12 70 l kg testing every 0 01 value in between in total 31 porosities and 1085 kd values were tested resulting in 33 635 different retardation factors for high organics clay dominated soils we found that retardation factors for these clay dominated soils varied dramatically ranging from between 4 02 and 34 02 however the stagnant moraine soil exhibited less of a range varying only between 4 02 and 12 99 for more sandy material we assumed that the dry bulk density was 1 7 g cm3 das 2008 and had a range of porosities between 0 25 and 0 45 das 2008 the range of kd values was taken from our experiments with hfo and fluv and ranged from 0 1 and 0 48 l kg using a similar frequency of values above 21 porosities and 39 kd values were tested resulting in 819 different retardation factors for sandy materials we found that the retardation factors for more sandy rich materials varied less than clay dominated soils varying between 1 38 and 4 26 for comparison we conducted a similar analysis on retardation factors for other aryl phosphates including tpp and ehdp for tpp log koc values ranged from 3 40 to 4 17 l kg huckins et al 1991 anderson et al 1993 brooke et al 2009 other aryl phosphates with the dpp moiety such as ehdp log koc 3 98 cdp log koc 3 94 iddp log koc 3 84 ipdp log koc 3 77 and tbdp log koc 3 68 were not tested due to their similarity to tpp brooke et al 2009 to calculate retardation factors from koc we used the following equivalence equation eq 2 2 k d f oc k oc where kd is the distribution coefficient l3 m foc is the fraction of organic carbon in the soil and koc is the organic carbon partitioning coefficient l3 m eq 2 was then substituted into eq 1 to calculate r we found that for tpp the retardation factors for each soil varied greatly but was consistently one or more orders of magnitude higher than for dpp table 2 this is consistent with the greater hydrophobic nature of tpp compared to dpp brooke et al 2009 comparing the log koc values for the other aryl phosphates this analysis suggests that the other aryl phosphates with the dpp moiety would exhibit retardation factors near the median value of tpp still suggesting stronger sorption when compared to dpp 4 3 toxicity of dpp the toxicities of a variety of aryl phosphates including dpp have not been extensively studied toxicity data for these compounds are limited in terms of both number and quality this study focuses mainly on acute toxicity of aryl phosphates to fish embryos due to the lack of available toxicological data or information on dpp we conducted 96 h lc50 experiments with dpp for zebrafish embryos and determined the value to be 49 98 7 06 mg l fig 2 using the us epa ecosar v2 0 software program we estimated a fish 96 h lc50 of 33 5 mg l and a chronic value chv of 3 6 mg l mayo bean et al 2017 these values are far higher than those found in fpw samples from the fox creek area ab canada which were estimated to be approximately 0 0037 mg l 3 7 μg l and above those found by rodil et al 2012 in their wastewater samples 0 01 mg l direct comparison of our reported lc50 on zebrafish embryos with values reported above is difficult however it may shed light on the relative magnitude of its toxicity triphenyl phosphate tpp is among the most extensively studied with studies on zebrafish indicating that tpp may result in developmental toxicity oliveri et al 2015 isales et al 2015 jarema et al 2015 cardiotoxicity mcgee et al 2013 du et al 2015 endocrine disruption liu et al 2012 and bioaccumulation in tissues and organs wang et al 2017 table 3 lists some 96 h lc50 values for various aryl phosphates on various fish species our results suggest that dpp is significantly less toxic than tpp but its toxicity is comparable to some of the experimentally determined values for other aryl phosphates such as iddp and ipdp table 3 su et al 2014 studied the cytotoxic effects of tpp and dpp on chicken embryonic hepatocytes it has been found that dpp had less cytotoxic effect on chicken embryonic hepatocytes than its parent product tpp but had a stronger ability to alter gene expression among the gene expression alterations that were significantly down regulated were those associated with thyroid hormone regulation glucose and fatty acid metabolism and lipid cholesterol metabolism su et al 2014 wang et al 2016 detected amounts of dpp at significantly higher concentrations in the liver and intestine up to 3 to 3 5 times than its parent tpp in adult zebrafish muir and grift 1981 studied the uptake and bioaccumulation of dpp in rainbow trout they found that the bioconcentration factor bcf for dpp was between 0 29 and 2 5 muir and grift 1981 indicating that it weakly bioaccumulates calculated bcf determined by bcfbaf v3 01 was 5 501 l kg somewhat consistent with the muir and grift 1981 study results van den eede et al 2016 speculated that because dpp is highly polar it is likely to be cleared from the human body rapidly and has less potential to penetrate tissues by passive diffusion our discussion above has focused mainly on short term acute effects on fish but long term chronic effects may also be present using the us epa ecosar v2 0 program we can estimate a chv of 3 6 mg l that may result in significant toxic potential for a longer term exposure for other aquatic species a daphnid 48 h lc50 and chv were estimated to be 20 6 and 2 5 mg l respectively whereas a 96 h lc50 and chv for green algae as a representative aquatic plant can be estimated to be 21 5 and 6 7 mg l respectively these lc50 s and chv s are both lower than those estimated for fish this may indicate that dpp is less acutely toxic to aquatic ecosystems than other aryl phosphates although longer term studies species sensitivity distribution studies and the effects of sub lethal longer term exposures remain to be investigated therefore the toxic potential of dpp on aquatic ecosystems remains unclear and requires further study 5 summary conclusions this study aimed to determine the sorption behavior of diphenyl phosphate dpp an emerging contaminant under a variety of environmentally relevant ph conditions and with both synthetic and natural sediment samples also evaluated was the potential environmental impact dpp may have if released into the groundwater batch sorption experiments using a synthetic representative groundwater composition and five different sediment types were conducted to determine the distribution coefficients kd of dpp for each soil little toxicity data exists for dpp so the 96 h lc50 for dpp on zebrafish embryos was determined to assess if dpp may be toxic to aquatic ecosystems our results show that dpp has a low to very low degree of sorption with kd ranging from approximately 2 to 12 l kg for clay rich soil types moraine glaciolacustrine clay stagnant moraine and down to approximately 0 1 to 0 4 l kg for sand rich materials hfo coated sand fluvial sand within the tested ph range 5 to 9 most of the materials tested showed no significant ph dependence on sorption and neither the freudlich nor langmuir equations were used or required to fit the data normalized to foc the log koc value for dpp in this study was 2 30 0 43 1σ we reason that the sorption of dpp onto the sediment type is dominated and controlled by its foc the one exception the clay rich moraine showed a decreasing trend of sorption with increasing ph we hypothesize that because the moraine was dominated by clays which become increasingly negative with increasing ph the resulting repulsion of the deprotonated dpp molecule may have reduced sorption at the higher ph analysis of the retardation factors of dpp compared to other tpp and other aryl phosphates showed that transport of dpp for various soil types is consistently lower than other aryl phosphates for more sandy soils the transport of dpp is near conservative r is between 1 38 and 4 26 in some cases for more clay and organic rich soils retardation factors range from approximately 4 to 34 which is at least an order of magnitude less than other aryl phosphates for the same soil type by conducting dpp toxicity assays we determined that the 96 h lc50 for zebrafish embryos was 50 mg l taken together with the cytotoxicity study of su et al 2014 on chicken embryonic hepatocytes this suggests that dpp has the potential to impact aquatic ecosystems and possibly other non aquatic organisms future studies should expand and focus on characterizing the toxicity of dpp on other organisms including aquatic avian and mammalian species they should also address both chronic and acute effects because of its low sorption potential coupled with its known toxicity dpp may pose a

1603,hydraulic fracturing in shale tight gas reservoirs creates fracture network systems that can intersect pre existing subsurface flow pathways e g fractures faults or abandoned wells this way hydraulic fracturing operations could pose environmental risks to shallow groundwater systems this paper explores the long term 30 years flow and transport of fracturing fluids into overburden layers and groundwater aquifers through a leaky abandoned well using the geological setting of north german basin as a case study a three dimensional model consisting of 15 sedimentary layers with three hydrostratigraphic units representing the hydrocarbon reservoir overburden and the aquifer is built the model considers one perforation location at the first section of the horizontal part of the well and a discrete hydraulic fracture intersecting an abandoned well a sensitivity analysis is carried out to quantify and understand the influence of a broad spectrum of field possibilities reservoir properties overburden properties abandoned well properties and its proximity to hydraulic fractures on the flow of fracturing fluid to shallower permeable strata the model results suggest the spatial properties of the abandoned well as well as its distance from the hydraulic fracture are the most important factors influencing the vertical flow of fracturing fluid it is observed that even for various field set tings only a limited amount of fracturing fluid can reach the aquifer in a long term period keywords fracturing fluid hydraulic fracturing abandoned well numerical modeling north

provide efficient pathways for fluid flow from reservoir to production wells reagan et al 2015 the development of unconventional reservoirs requires stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing

perforated locations in a wellbore at a bottom hole pressure higher than the minimum principal stress shapiro et al 2006 tatomir et al 2018 hydraulic fracturing enhances local permeability by creating new fractures improving fracture fracture interaction re opening and further propagation of pre existing fractures wang et al 2016 hydraulic fracturing operations could imply a variety of environmental risks vengosh et al 2014 a common concern is the upward migration of contaminants e g hf fluid and formation fluids from hydrocarbon bearing formations towards shallow aquifers lange et al 2013 tatomir et al 2018 however the upward migration of contaminants is generally constrained by the sedimentary basin characteristics such as thickness of low permeable overburden and a low vertical hydraulic gradient the driving force furthermore the vertical movement of contaminants is bounded by the density of formation fluids and the limits of hydraulic fracturing e g injection pressure and operation duration this in turn affects fracture aperture growth fracture propagation pressure propagation and stimulated volume of the reservoir flewelling and sharma 2014 kreitler 1989 the presence of natural preferential pathways such as faults and fractures or anthropogenic pathways such as leaky wells and a driving force are vital components that can inadvertently affect the

abandoned wells remain unplugged gass et al 1997 kang et al 2015 and adequate documentation on their locations and spatial characteristics are rarely available nordbotten et al 2004 unplugged or improperly plugged abandoned wells provide preferential pathways for transport of fluids to the overlying aquifers and thus poses threats to groundwater systems brownlow et al 2016a reagan et al 2015 tatomir et al 2018 a couple of research projects have investigated groundwater contamination resulting from shale gas development however a few studies addressed the potential contamination transport through leaky abandoned wells e g reagan et al 2015 brownlow et al 2016a the objective of this study is to build a three dimensional field scale generic model to explore the long term flow of hf fluid through an abandoned well as affected by fracturing operation fig 1 the reservoir of interest is the posidonia shale of the north german basin we study a wide range of field configurations and rank the significance of key parameters such as abandoned well permeability and its proximity to hydraulic fractures on vertical flow of hf fluid 2 the north german basin the reservoir of interest is situated within the north german basin ngb which is part of the central european basin system walter 2007 the development of the ngb system was initiated in the late carboniferous to permian owing to rifting subsidence and associated volcanism subsequent to the variscan orogenesis betz et al 1987 ziegler 1990 the reservoir is the organic rich lower jurassic posidonia shale the domain consists of 15 layers of varying thickness that include three hydrostratigraphic zones representing the hydrocarbon reservoir overburden and aquifer the depth information and hydraulic parameters for each layer are listed in table 1 3 model setup and descriptions a three dimensional model with a vertical dimension of 1735 m lateral extent of 2500 m and width of 1200 m is constructed to study flow and transport of hf fluid to overlying layers through a leaky abandoned well the graphical illustration of the conceptual model is presented in fig 2 the sedimentary layers are assumed to be homogeneous the depth varying relationships were applied to calculate temperature and salinity throughout the domain to better reflect the uniqueness of the study area the average ground temperature in germany is 8 2 c schulz et al 2007 assuming an average geothermal gradient of 0 04 c m kissinger et al 2014 the temperature gradient induces differences in fluid density thus driving groundwater flow saiers and barth 2012 the average vertical salinity gradient of 0 15 g lm which is in the range reported for the ngb kissinger et al 2017 magri et al 2005 tesmer et al 2007 wolfgramm et al 2011 wolfgramm and seibt 2008 is considered in the entire domain we do not take into account the lateral variation of salinity therefore any regional or local change in salinity gradients is ignored the atmospheric pressure is assigned to the top of the model domain a constant head pressure boundary which incorporates hydrostatic pressure and reservoir pressure gradient is imposed along the lateral sides of the domain the initial steady state condition in the overburden and reservoir layer is calculated in the same manner as the side pressure boundary conditions a no flow boundary is set at bottom of the domain overpressure is a common feature of shale gas formations which is mainly due to the combination of very low permeability and the generation of significant internal gas soltanzadeh and hawkes 2009 hence the shale is considered overpressurized with a pressure gradient equal to 13 kpa m gassiat et al 2013 the overburden and reservoir pore fluid properties e g density and viscosity depend upon certain factors such as temperature pressure and fluid composition e g salt concentration in the water phase the density function of p t salinity and dynamic viscosity function of t salinity of the brine are calculated using batzle and wang 1992 equations this study does not reflect the conditions which normally are expected under real operation conditions commonly the total hf fluid injection volume is divided among more fractures along the horizontal well however we work in the assumption that these fractures intersect a pre existing network of fractures or a fault zone so that the fracturing fluid is concentrated in a single fracture therefore we do not model a stimulated reservoir volume srv but rather a fully developed discrete fracture within the shale reservoir is considered the fracture is modeled as a lower dimensional geometric object a straight planar height fixed fracture confined and horizontally extending through the reservoir layer is assumed the hydraulic fracture has a half elliptic cross section strike of n45 e and dip of 45 towards southwest the abandoned well hits the middle of the hydraulic fracture plane the well is centered vertically in the domain having a higher permeability compared to the adjacent formation we modeled the abandoned well and the entire fractured degraded formation parallel to the casing as a planer fracture with a rectangular cross section the planar fracture has a width of 0 5 m and thickness of 0 14 m corresponding to a circular cross section of a well with radius of 0 15 m hydraulic fracturing is usually conducted in multiple stages to produce fracture networks for each stage a certain proportion of the well casing is perforated for connecting the well to the reservoir the highly pressurized fracturing fluid containing proppants and other additives is then injected into the reservoir through the perforated area to create the fracture network king 2012 this model however does not incorporate an actual fracturing operation in terms of fracture propagation dilatation and fracture network creation the model assumes a perforation location at the first segment of the horizontal well from which fh fluid is injected into the reservoir the perforation location is directly connected to the fracture and hence the hf fluid is directly injected in the fracture fracturing fluid is a water based chemical mixture comprising a base fluid e g water brine friction reducers scale inhibitors corrosion inhibitors surfactants and other additives kekacs et al 2015 the model considers the hf fluid components as a pseudo component i e a conservative tracer dissolved in the water phase this means the model does not account for sorption and biological chemical degradation processes we acknowledge that modeling hf fluid as an inert tracer represents a conservative less favorable scenario and leads to an overestimation of contamination distribution in the aquifer kissinger et al 2013 the hf fluid is tracked by means of the concentration of its dissolved chemicals in addition this model takes into account buoyancy resulting from the density difference between the hf fluid and the brine schwartz 2016 suggests that through a certain transport distance the probability of simultaneous migration of liquid and methane gas is relatively low owing to the contrast in their physical and chemical properties therefore this study does not consider multiphase processes which require full representation of fluid and gas migration the focus is solely on the transport of a water based fluid in a fully saturated porous media the transport of hf fluid through the domain is calculated using the single phase version of darcy s law the system contains a single phase flow of non compressible fluids which consists of two components i e brine and a tracer with the exception of gas phase the model neglects the interaction of hf fluid with the porous media the numerical tool comsol multiphysics 5 2a is utilized in developing and implementing the mathematical model wang et al 2011 comsol uses finite element approach in solving the partial differential equations and it is applicable for representing and accommodating complexities of real reservoir geometry and its geological objects the time dependent solution of the equations is accomplished through a fully coupled solution approach with small time steps a complex unstructured free triangular finite element grid was developed for discretization of the domain the applied mesh influences the precision and computational scale thus making it a vital component in the finite element modeling in practice the compatibility of the mesh density and computing capacity should be considered for the solution to satisfy the precision requirement the abandoned well and its neighboring area were assigned a finer mesh to better simulate the upward movement of fluids through the permeable pathway and to avoid numerical problems due to large permeability contrasts as determined by precision requirement the mesh gets coarser towards boundaries of the model the adopted mesh allowed explicitly the capture of distinctive fluid flow features in the domain 3 1 base case scenario the base case scenario considers geological setting of the north german basin to systematically explore the leakage of contaminants from a shale gas reservoir through a leaky abandoned well into shallow aquifers to realistically represent the lifetime of a typical horizontal well each simulation comprises six different temporal periods namely 1 reservoir initial condition prior to fracturing 2 injection of hf fluid into the reservoir 3 shut in period 4 first production period 5 second production period and 6 post production period the first period models the steady state initial conditions through the system prior to operation afterwards the model utilizes the initial conditions generated from the first run to simulate the injection of hf fluid during the injection period fluid is injected into the reservoir from the perforation location at a constant rate of 3 15 m 3 min for 2 5 days birdsell et al 2015 this is equivalent to injection volumes of 11356 m 3 brownlow et al 2016a stage 3 represents a 5 day shut in period in which there is neither injection nor abstraction of fluid in the domain afterwards first and second productions periods are modeled to last interruptedly for 2 and 13 years respectively the production rate is 16 m 3 d during the first production period and it is lowered to 3 2 m 3 d in the second period the second production period represents the production decline throughout life of the well in stage 6 the production is stopped and no fluid enters or leaves the domain this stage models the continued migration of hf fluid into the shallow aquifers until 15 years after the production period the parameters values selected for the base scenario are chosen to better understand the leakage of hf fluid through an abandoned well and may not realistically reflect an actual fracturing operation table 2 summarizes the input parameters for the numerical simulations the data needed for modeling the abandoned well properties e g permeability are gathered from literature relating to hf fluid methane and co2 leakage models e g gasda et al 2008 nordbotten et al 2004 the parameters for sensitivity analysis were selected based on results from literature e g reagan et al 2015 taherdangkoo et al 2017 birdsell et al 2015 aimed at revealing the most influential factors determining upward migration of contaminants in the subsurface table 3 presents the base case parameters and their ranges of variations for the parametric study 3 2 parametric study a parametric study is designed for a wide spectrum of field configurations to examine the extent of contaminant i e hf fluid migration from a hydrocarbon bearing formation into the shallower permeable strata through an abandoned well the impact of injection rate reservoir and overburden properties salinity and abandoned well properties is evaluated the parametric study applies one at a time oat method morris 1991 in analyzing the influence of changing the values of each chosen parameter oat method has a limited use in exploratory modeling as it does not explore all the possible combinations between input variables and it usually provides a local sensitivity measurement however oat is a simple easy to implement and computationally cheap method thus providing relevant observations as it exposes the independent effects of each parameter iooss and lemaître 2015 the north german basin geology is considered as the baseline where each parameter is changed at a time 3 2 1 hf injection rate the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing treatment depends on several factors such as injection rate injection depth injection pressure and hf fluid properties e g viscosity wang et al 2016 concluded that fluid injection rate influences treating pressure corresponding stimulated reservoir volume and hydrocarbon production we changed injection rate to capture the full range of its potential influence on hf fluid flow the hf fluid injection rate varies between 3 05 to 4 16 m 3 min thus corresponding to a total injection volume of between 11000 and 15000 m 3 birdsell et al 2015 brownlow et al 2016a myers 2012 3 2 2 shale properties shale gas formations possess specific features such as heterogeneity low matrix porosity and permeability wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2012 the formation characteristics play important roles in gas production from shale gas reservoirs the shale s effective porosity and permeability reduce during production due to pore pressure reduction within the reservoir however we consider constant values for reservoir porosity and permeability during the entire simulation period we examined the effect of porosity and permeability of the rock matrix over a range reported in literature the shale porosity and permeability variation range from 1 to 5 and 1 10 21 to1 10 18 m 2 respectively 3 2 3 shale overpressure overpressure occurs when pore fluid pressure is higher than normal hydrostatic fluid pressure at a specific depth bowers 2002 overpressure in subsurface rocks could be produced through three main mechanisms namely increase in compressive stress change in pore fluid volume and fluid buoyancy osborne and swarbrick 1997 osborne and swarbrick 1997 concluded that disequilibrium compaction and gas generation are the most probable mechanisms for producing pressure anomalies in low permeable sediments disequilibrium compaction is a common overpressuring mechanism in thick low permeable sequences e g shale and clay with continued rapid burial overpressure is a transient phenomenon except when it is due to topography ligtenberg 2005 osborne and swarbrick 1997 in our model the overpressure is considered as an initial condition prior to fracturing birdsell et al 2015 we applied overpressure only within the shale and not in its overlying formations we acknowledge that the applied approach does not reflect the actual overpressure within the shale the overpressure varies from 10 to 13 kpa m brownlow et al 2016a gassiat et al 2013 to understand its effect on migration of hf fluid into shallow permeable layers 3 2 4 overburden properties the depth and physical properties of overburden layers play a critical role in flow and transport of hf fluid towards shallower strata gassiat et al 2013 taherdangkoo et al 2017 the depth to shale gas formations in sedimentary basins varies between 1 to 4 5 km with an average depth of 2 9 km eia 2011a gassiat et al 2013 the permeability of sedimentary layers also changes over a wide range gleeson et al 2011 the significance of these parameters was evaluated through a scenario which considers one overburden layer with averaged values calculated from the ngb data the overburden thickness ranges from 900 to 2900 m and overburden permeability range from 1 10 17 to 1 10 15 m 2 3 2 5 salinity salinity increases with depth in sedimentary basins ferguson et al 2018 a change in the initial distribution of salinity could influence the vertical flow of hf fluid taherdangkoo et al 2017 we assumed three different salt distributions within the domain prior to the operation to understand its significance in the upward migration of hf fluids the vertical salinity gradient of 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 g lm are considered 3 2 6 abandoned wellbore integrity there is limited information available on the quality of the sealing materials used for old abandoned wells and hence the hydraulic parameters e g permeability of the degraded barrier system is largely unknown nogues et al 2011 previous modeling studies suggested a range of effective permeability for evaluating the vertical migration of fluids through a leaky wellbore bai and reinicke 2013 celia et al 2005 ebigbo et al 2007 gasda et al 2008 nogues et al 2011 nordbotten et al 2005 nordbotten et al 2004 pawar et al 2009 herein the effective wellbore permeability is the primary parameter of interest and it averages the permeability of the entire fractured degraded formation parallel to the casing we consider a wide range of possible wellbore permeabilities based on the wellbore integrity of old wells that were drilled completed and abandoned using different technologies the model is run to simulate a 30 year period under the assumption that wellbore properties of the abandoned well remained constant through the entire simulation period an open wellbore has permeability values between 2 10 13 and 1 10 11 m 2 while in a properly sealed well permeabilities span between 1 10 17 to 1 10 13 m 2 3 2 7 proximity of hf to abandoned well frac hit is a common occurrence in oil and gas fields with a high density of production wells and even multiple frac hits may materialize lawal et al 2013 however in some cases the abandoned well may not be affected by fracturing the abandoned well can be close or at a large distance from the operation therefore it is important to explore the influence of the abandoned well proximity to hydraulic fractures on the upward flow of fluids to shallower aquifers the study is conducted by varying the lateral distance of the abandoned well from the fracture the fracture well proximity is varied between 5 to 15 m 3 2 8 influence of well production hydrocarbon production affects fluid flow behavior within the hydrocarbon bearing formation brownlow et al 2016a flewelling and sharma 2014 production leads to large scale depressurization in the reservoir which drives fluid to flow downward rather than upward the influence of well production on the upward flow of hf fluid is explored through a scenario which does not take into account production from the horizontal well in this case hf fluid remains in the domain during the entire simulation period the aim is to explore the long term contaminant distribution in the absence of an active production well 4 results and discussion 4 1 base case scenario the spatial distribution of hf fluid in the y z plane at x 1250 m at the end of injection and shut in periods is shown in fig 3 a b the spread of hf fluid within the fracture flow through the abandoned well and its rise through the overburden layers is displayed the red arrows display the direction of total fluid flow in the domain fig 4 a b compares the concentration of hf fluid dissolved chemicals along the abandoned well at the end of each simulation period the y axis represents depth of the domain from the aquifer base to bottom of the reservoir the posidonia shale and its overlying layer i e m jurassic claystone 3 layer host the bulk of hf fluid during the first two periods the vertical migration of the fluid is relatively low and it is primarily due to the shale overpressure fracturing pressure and upward buoyancy the induced overpressure is dissipated in the reservoir during the shut in period however the reservoir pressure still remains higher than the conditions prior to injection as apparent from fig 3 a b the total fluid flow direction is upward at the end of the injection period and it is mostly downward at the end of the shut in period the hf fluid reaches a maximum height of 252 m from fracture well intersection i e depth of 1468 m from the top at the end of the injection period and it increases to a height of 263 m i e 1457 m depth at the end of the shut in period the short lived shut in period has a minimal influence on the upward movement of fluids the shape of hf fluid plume at the end of injection period is identical to that for the shut in period therefore in fig 4a the iso concentration lines belonging to these periods overlapped note that the flow of hf fluid in each layer depends on the layer physical properties e g permeability the strata heterogeneity decreases the upward movement of hf fluid through the abandoned well the hf fluid is subject to upward buoyancy during the entire simulation which is due to density differences between the injected fluid and brine the induced overpressure is removed from the reservoir at the beginning production the hf fluid does not reach the aquifer at the end of the first production period see fig 5 and it reaches a maximum height of 1250 m from the fracture well intersection i e depth of 470 m from the top boundary the upward flow rate is low due dissolution of hf fluids in formation water and the lateral fluid flow in overburden layers at the end of stage 3 the concentration of dissolved chemicals at fracture well interface is 10 5 kg m 3 6 times lower than the concentration at the end of stage 2 the spatial distribution of hf fluid in the subsurface is displayed in fig 6 the upward hf fluid flow at the aquifer base is negligible prior to 3 years of production fig 5 the fluid reaches the shallow freshwater aquifer one year after the commencement of the second production period the hf fluid flow rate into the aquifer peaked in tenth year and afterwards experienced a steady decline the flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 0 08 m 3 yr at the end of production during production 67 of the injected fluid volume is extracted from the domain hence production plays a vital role in inhibiting substantial vertical migration of hf fluid toward shallow aquifers the production causes large scale depressurization within the reservoir which in turn draws fluids downward rather than upward the upward buoyancy force decreases over time due to dissolution of hf fluid with brine during its transport fracturing fluid extraction from the domain its lateral spreading into the overburden layers and decrease in the buoyancy force explain the decrease in the upward fluid flow along the abandoned well during production and post production periods the pressure build up occurs in the posidonia shale after end of the production the upward flow rate through the abandoned well is much lower during the post production period at the end of the simulation 67 of hf fluid volume is discharged by production 33 remained in the subsurface and 0 02 reached the shallow aquifer fig 6c shows the distribution of hf fluid through the well and the overburden layers at the end of simulation periods 30 years the hf fluid flow rate along the abandoned well at the overburden aquifer interface is 0 07 m 3 yr at the end of simulation 4 2 parametric study the sensitivity analysis is designed to examine field uncertainties and draw a meaningful conclusion for the defined failure scenario a total of 30 simulations aimed at assessing different field scenarios were ran by altering the key parameter values fig 7 a j illustrates hf fluid flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface during 30 years of simulation time the total volume of hf fluid in the system correspondingly increases with the increase in the injection rate thus a higher amount of fluid remains in the subsurface even after the end of production a higher injection rate imposes a higher induced pressure in the reservoir therefore the pressure front propagates a greater distance within the formation this increases the upward flow of fluids through the abandoned well consequently results in more contamination in shallower strata fig 7a presents hf fluid rate at the overburden aquifer interface based on total injected fluid volume v ff when the injection rate increases to 4 16 m 3 min fluid volume of 15000 m 3 the upward fluid flow into the aquifer is 1 75 times higher when compared to the base case scenario fluid volume of 11356 m 3 modeling results indicate that higher injection rates lead to a slightly higher chemical concentration in the shallow aquifers hence the long term influence of hf injection volume on the upward movement of fluids to overlying layers is relatively low the effect of shale properties on hf fluid flow are shown in fig 7 b c the ascent of hf fluid through abandoned well decreases with an increase in the shale permeability this occurs because pressure dissipation across the abandoned well decreases with an increase in the reservoir permeability however it leads to slight changes in the vertical fluid flow at overburden aquifer interface a reduction in the shale porosity also decreases the upward fluid flow it mirrors the same effect that reservoir permeability has on vertical flow of fluids the amount of extracted hf fluid by the well decreases with the decrease in shale permeability the corresponding volume is 76 and 63 for shale permeability of 1 10 18 and 1 10 21 m 2 respectively this shows that fluid flow into overlying aquifers decreases with the increase in hf fluid discharge the changes in shale porosity have insignificant influence on discharge of hf fluid from the domain although the physical properties of the reservoir affect the upward transport of hf fluid to shallower layers their significance on the long term concentration distribution in shallower layers is negligible during the short lived injection period the reservoir overpressure and fracturing injection pressure are the dominant forces for upward fluid flow subsequently large scale depressurization pressure occurs over lifetime of the well thus in the defined failure scenario the reservoir overpressure only has a short term influence on the vertical flow of fluids the long term upward migration of hf fluid through the abandoned well is not dependent on the shale overpressure fig 7 d the result indicates that the overpressure gradient does not have influence on the extracted volume of hf fluid from the domain during the production period note that the significance of shale overpressure on the vertical flow of fluids highly depends on the type of boundary conditions applied birdsell et al 2015 taherdangkoo et al 2017 thus the obtained results regarding the effect of shale overpressure may change by applying different initial and boundary conditions the depth of shale gas formation is an important factor affecting the vertical flow of fluids the hf fluid reaches the aquifer base one year after the operation for an overburden depth of 900 m in this case the flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is two times larger compared to the base case model the hf fluid could not be detected in the aquifer for overburden depth of 2400 and 2900 m fig 7 e the probability of aquifer contamination is slightly higher in shallower shale formations the flow rate at the aquifer base increases with an increase in the permeability of overburden layer fig 7 f the upward hf fluid flow rate into the aquifer is negligible for an averaged overburden permeability of 1 10 17 m 2 a change in the initial distribution of salinity gradient influences the vertical flow of fluids in the domain fig 7 g for a salinity gradient of 0 1 g lm the hf fluid flow rate at the aquifer base is 0 08 m 3 year and the discharge volume during production is 68 of the initial volume for a salinity gradient of 0 2 g lm the flow rate is 0 05 m 3 year and the discharge volume is 66 the upward migration of hf fluid through the abandoned well strongly depends on the effective wellbore permeability fig 7 h the fluid does not migrate upward for wellbore permeabilities equal to or lower than 1 10 13 m 2 in this case hf fluid does not reach the shallow aquifers even after 30 years for well permeability of 1 10 17 m 2 the volume of hf fluid discharged from the model domain by production is 75 of the initially injected volume and the remaining 25 of hf fluid volume is confined deep in the subsurface far from groundwater aquifers hence abandoned wells with low permeabilities i e high wellbore integrity prevent upward fluid flow into overburden layers fig 7e illustrates that a slight change in the wellbore permeability leads to a significant change of flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface thus resulting in an increase in chemical concentration in the aquifer for instance when the wellbore permeability is 2 10 12 m 2 the corresponding flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 3 6 times higher compared to the base case the maximum flow rate into the aquifer is observed for a well permeability of 1 10 11 m 2 27 4 times higher than that for the base case scenario in addition 56 of the injected fluid volume is extracted from the model domain during production period 1 reaches the aquifer and 43 is confined in the subsurface the modeling results suggest that wellbore integrity largely controls the flow of hf fluid into the shallower strata and consequently the contamination distribution into the aquifer the results indicate that the abandoned well has to fail to act as a permeable pathway for flow of fluids increasing the fracture well distance significantly influences the hf fluid arrival at the aquifer base when the fracture well distance is 5 m hf fluid reaches the shallow aquifer 4 years after production fig 7 i at the end of simulation the flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 3 6 times lower when compared to the base case an increase in fracture well distance to 10 m reduces the fluid flow to 0 01 m 3 yr this value is 7 2 times lower compared to the base case model when the production well is 5 m away from the hydraulic fracture 74 of injected fluid volume is extracted during production this value remains constant for a fracture well distance of 10 and 15 m which is due to the minimal effect of the hydraulic fracture to the abandoned well when the abandoned well is 15 m away from the fracture hf fluid cannot be detected in the aquifer the model results indicate that the proximity of hydraulic fracture to the abandoned well is the second most influential parameter on the vertical flow of fluids to shallower strata when well fracture distance is large enough most of hf fluid is discharged from the domain and the possibility of upward flow is largely inhibited the scenario that does not consider production leads to a higher contaminant distribution in the shallow aquifers fig 7 j at the end of simulation the flow rate into the aquifer is 10 times higher compared to the base case this indicates the production from the reservoir significantly reduces contamination treats to groundwater aquifers the modeling results suggest that the wellbore integrity of the abandoned well and its distance from fracturing operation are the most influential parameters determining the vertical flow of hf fluid through an abandoned well the hf fluid injection rate and overburden and reservoir properties also have impacts on vertical fluid flow towards shallow aquifers it is evident that hf fluid does not reach the aquifer within a short time frame the modeling results show limited vertical transport of fluids through the abandoned well under different field possibilities however a thorough evaluation of hydrogeological conditions and production history of a suggested field is required prior to hydraulic fracturing operation to minimize the risk to groundwater aquifers 5 conclusions this research focuses on the numerical simulation of fracturing fluid flow and transport from a hydrocarbon bearing formation towards shallow aquifers through an abandoned well the models are based on permeability and stratigraphy data of the geological sequence in the north german basin we conducted a parametric study to examine the influence of key factors such as overburden and reservoir properties abandoned well permeability and its proximity to hydraulic fractures on the vertical flow of fracturing fluid through an abandoned well numerical modeling results revealed the following during the injection period fracturing pressure and reservoir overpressure are the main driving forces for vertical movement of hf fluid during the shut in period the pressure is dissipated across the reservoir thereafter the fracturing pressure is removed and large scale depressurization occurs over time via production from the horizontal well the upward buoyancy is an important mechanism for upward flow of fluids to shallower strata during production and post production periods the production extracts a significant amount of injected hf fluid 67 of total volume from the domain thus reducing the probability of hf fluid flow to overlying layers when production is not incorporated in the model the flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 10 times higher than that of the base case this indicates that neglecting the effect of well production leads to the overestimation of fluid flow through the well and consequently contamination distribution in the aquifer the influence of reservoir physical properties and hf injection volume on the vertical migration of fluids is inconsequential over the long term the significance of shale overpressure highly depends on the type of applied boundary conditions the strata heterogeneity decreases the upward migration of fluids through the abandoned well the probability of upwards migration of hf fluid is lower in sedimentary basins with high salinity the combined effect of well production and dissolution of hf fluid with formation water significantly decreases the upward movement of hf fluid towards shallower strata we suggest that further modeling studies take into account these important effects most notably increasing abandoned well permeability significantly increases the upward fluid rate to shallow aquifers when well permeability is set at 1 10 11 m 2 hf fluid rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 27 4 times higher than the base case the hf fluid does not reach the aquifers for wellbore permeability lower than 1 10 13 m 2 therefore wellbore integrity is considered as the most important factor controlling the leakage of fluids through an abandoned well it is concluded that only a defected wellbore could act as a permeable pathway for movement of fluids to overlying layers the proximity of fracturing to the abandoned well is the second most influential parameter influencing the upward flow of fluids the hf fluid cannot be detected in the aquifer when the abandoned well is 15 m away from the hydraulic fracture however the findings for an abandoned well with a permeability of 1 10 13 m 2 and the fracture well distance of 15 m may change with different geological settings the short term probability of shallow aquifer contamination resulting from fracturing is negligible even in the presence of a leaky abandoned well model results show that hf fluid reaches the aquifer three years after production the long term simulation reveals that the risks hydraulic fracturing pose to shallow aquifers

1603,hydraulic fracturing in shale tight gas reservoirs creates fracture network systems that can intersect pre existing subsurface flow pathways e g fractures faults or abandoned wells this way hydraulic fracturing operations could pose environmental risks to shallow groundwater systems this paper explores the long term 30 years flow and transport of fracturing fluids into overburden layers and groundwater aquifers through a leaky abandoned well using the geological setting of north german basin as a case study a three dimensional model consisting of 15 sedimentary layers with three hydrostratigraphic units representing the hydrocarbon reservoir overburden and the aquifer is built the model considers one perforation location at the first section of the horizontal part of the well and a discrete hydraulic fracture intersecting an abandoned well a sensitivity analysis is carried out to quantify and understand the influence of a broad spectrum of field possibilities reservoir properties overburden properties abandoned well properties and its proximity to hydraulic fractures on the flow of fracturing fluid to shallower permeable strata the model results suggest the spatial properties of the abandoned well as well as its distance from the hydraulic fracture are the most important factors influencing the vertical flow of fracturing fluid it is observed that even for various field set tings only a limited amount of fracturing fluid can reach the aquifer in a long term period keywords fracturing fluid hydraulic fracturing abandoned well numerical modeling north german basin groundwater contamination 1 introduction unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs such as shale tight gas reservoirs are characterized by low permeabilities and even natural fractures do not provide efficient pathways for fluid flow from reservoir to production wells reagan et al 2015 the development of unconventional reservoirs requires stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing

perforated locations in a wellbore at a bottom hole pressure higher than the minimum principal stress shapiro et al 2006 tatomir et al 2018 hydraulic fracturing enhances local permeability by creating new fractures improving fracture fracture interaction re opening and further propagation of pre existing fractures wang et al 2016 hydraulic fracturing operations could imply a variety of environmental risks vengosh et al 2014 a common concern is the upward migration of contaminants e g hf fluid and formation fluids from hydrocarbon bearing formations towards shallow aquifers lange et al 2013 tatomir et al 2018 however the upward migration of contaminants is generally constrained by the sedimentary basin characteristics such as thickness of low permeable overburden and a low vertical hydraulic gradient the driving force furthermore the vertical movement of contaminants is bounded by the density of formation fluids and the limits of hydraulic fracturing e g injection pressure and operation duration this in turn affects fracture aperture growth fracture propagation pressure propagation and stimulated volume of the reservoir flewelling and sharma 2014 kreitler 1989 the presence of natural preferential pathways such as faults and fractures or anthropogenic pathways such as leaky wells and a driving force are vital components that can inadvertently affect the

wellbore with the aim of isolating different intervals including water and hydrocarbon bearing zones the wellbore barrier system comprises a cement sheath located along the annulus between the outer casing and host rock cement outer casing bond and cement host rock bond gasda et al 2013a manceau et al 2015 radonjic and kupresan 2014 wellbore integrity could be impaired by poor well construction i e improper cementing and completion cement degradation casing failure and formation damage around the wellbore the outside of the casing could be damaged from production and injection activities during the lifetime of the well all of the above named failure scenarios could provide pathways for vertical fluid flow into overlying layers carroll et al 2016 gasda et al 2013a however the most probable source of contaminant transport is through permeable flow paths outside the casing dusseault and jackson 2014 well abandonment practice varies from well to well and depends on several factors such as well depth well diameter casing condition casing material hydrological setting local regulations etc aller 1990 kelm and faul 1999 in order to properly evaluate the probability of contaminant leakage through an abandoned well a detailed description of well completion and abandonment operations must be considered data needed for such evaluation could be provided from field and laboratory experiments gasda et al 2013b many wells in mature oil and gas fields were drilled and abandoned before today s rigorous plugging standards evans 2009 nordbotten et al 2004 in addition many of old abandoned wells remain unplugged gass et al 1997 kang et al 2015 and adequate documentation on their locations and spatial characteristics are rarely available nordbotten et al 2004 unplugged or improperly plugged abandoned wells provide preferential pathways for transport of fluids to the overlying aquifers and thus poses threats to groundwater systems brownlow et al 2016a reagan et al 2015 tatomir et al 2018 a couple of research projects have investigated groundwater contamination resulting from shale gas development however a few studies addressed the potential contamination transport through leaky abandoned wells e g reagan et al 2015 brownlow et al 2016a the objective of this study is to build a three dimensional field scale generic model to explore the long term flow of hf fluid through an abandoned well as affected by fracturing operation fig 1 the reservoir of interest is the posidonia shale of the north german basin we study a wide range of field configurations and rank the significance of key parameters such as abandoned well permeability and its proximity to hydraulic fractures on vertical flow of hf fluid 2 the north german basin the reservoir of interest is situated within the north german basin ngb which is part of the central european basin system walter 2007 the development of the ngb system was initiated in the late carboniferous to permian owing to rifting subsidence and associated volcanism subsequent to the variscan orogenesis betz et al 1987 ziegler 1990 the reservoir is the organic rich lower jurassic posidonia shale the domain consists of 15 layers of varying thickness that include three hydrostratigraphic zones representing the hydrocarbon reservoir overburden and aquifer the depth information and hydraulic parameters for each layer are listed in table 1 3 model setup and descriptions a three dimensional model with a vertical dimension of 1735 m lateral extent of 2500 m and width of 1200 m is constructed to study flow and transport of hf fluid to overlying layers through a leaky abandoned well the graphical illustration of the conceptual model is presented in fig 2 the sedimentary layers are assumed to be homogeneous the depth varying relationships were applied to calculate temperature and salinity throughout the domain to better reflect the uniqueness of the study area the average ground temperature in germany is 8 2 c schulz et al 2007 assuming an average geothermal gradient of 0 04 c m kissinger et al 2014 the temperature gradient induces differences in fluid density thus driving groundwater flow saiers and barth 2012 the average vertical salinity gradient of 0 15 g lm which is in the range reported for the ngb kissinger et al 2017 magri et al 2005 tesmer et al 2007 wolfgramm et al 2011 wolfgramm and seibt 2008 is considered in the entire domain we do not take into account the lateral variation of salinity therefore any regional or local change in salinity gradients is ignored the atmospheric pressure is assigned to the top of the model domain a constant head pressure boundary which incorporates hydrostatic pressure and reservoir pressure gradient is imposed along the lateral sides of the domain the initial steady state condition in the overburden and reservoir layer is calculated in the same manner as the side pressure boundary conditions a no flow boundary is set at bottom of the domain overpressure is a common feature of shale gas formations which is mainly due to the combination of very low permeability and the generation of significant internal gas soltanzadeh and hawkes 2009 hence the shale is considered overpressurized with a pressure gradient equal to 13 kpa m gassiat et al 2013 the overburden and reservoir pore fluid properties e g density and viscosity depend upon certain factors such as temperature pressure and fluid composition e g salt concentration in the water phase the density function of p t salinity and dynamic viscosity function of t salinity of the brine are calculated using batzle and wang 1992 equations this study does not reflect the conditions which normally are expected under real operation conditions commonly the total hf fluid injection volume is divided among more fractures along the horizontal well however we work in the assumption that these fractures intersect a pre existing network of fractures or a fault zone so that the fracturing fluid is concentrated in a single fracture therefore we do not model a stimulated reservoir volume srv but rather a fully developed discrete fracture within the shale reservoir is considered the fracture is modeled as a lower dimensional geometric object a straight planar height fixed fracture confined and horizontally extending through the reservoir layer is assumed the hydraulic fracture has a half elliptic cross section strike of n45 e and dip of 45 towards southwest the abandoned well hits the middle of the hydraulic fracture plane the well is centered vertically in the domain having a higher permeability compared to the adjacent formation we modeled the abandoned well and the entire fractured degraded formation parallel to the casing as a planer fracture with a rectangular cross section the planar fracture has a width of 0 5 m and thickness of 0 14 m corresponding to a circular cross section of a well with radius of 0 15 m hydraulic fracturing is usually conducted in multiple stages to produce fracture networks for each stage a certain proportion of the well casing is perforated for connecting the well to the reservoir the highly pressurized fracturing fluid containing proppants and other additives is then injected into the reservoir through the perforated area to create the fracture network king 2012 this model however does not incorporate an actual fracturing operation in terms of fracture propagation dilatation and fracture network creation the model assumes a perforation location at the first segment of the horizontal well from which fh fluid is injected into the reservoir the perforation location is directly connected to the fracture and hence the hf fluid is directly injected in the fracture fracturing fluid is a water based chemical mixture comprising a base fluid e g water brine friction reducers scale inhibitors corrosion inhibitors surfactants and other additives kekacs et al 2015 the model considers the hf fluid components as a pseudo component i e a conservative tracer dissolved in the water phase this means the model does not account for sorption and biological chemical degradation processes we acknowledge that modeling hf fluid as an inert tracer represents a conservative less favorable scenario and leads to an overestimation of contamination distribution in the aquifer kissinger et al 2013 the hf fluid is tracked by means of the concentration of its dissolved chemicals in addition this model takes into account buoyancy resulting from the density difference between the hf fluid and the brine schwartz 2016 suggests that through a certain transport distance the probability of simultaneous migration of liquid and methane gas is relatively low owing to the contrast in their physical and chemical properties therefore this study does not consider multiphase processes which require full representation of fluid and gas migration the focus is solely on the transport of a water based fluid in a fully saturated porous media the transport of hf fluid through the domain is calculated using the single phase version of darcy s law the system contains a single phase flow of non compressible fluids which consists of two components i e brine and a tracer with the exception of gas phase the model neglects the interaction of hf fluid with the porous media the numerical tool comsol multiphysics 5 2a is utilized in developing and implementing the mathematical model wang et al 2011 comsol uses finite element approach in solving the partial differential equations and it is applicable for representing and accommodating complexities of real reservoir geometry and its geological objects the time dependent solution of the equations is accomplished through a fully coupled solution approach with small time steps a complex unstructured free triangular finite element grid was developed for discretization of the domain the applied mesh influences the precision and computational scale thus making it a vital component in the finite element modeling in practice the compatibility of the mesh density and computing capacity should be considered for the solution to satisfy the precision requirement the abandoned well and its neighboring area were assigned a finer mesh to better simulate the upward movement of fluids through the permeable pathway and to avoid numerical problems due to large permeability contrasts as determined by precision requirement the mesh gets coarser towards boundaries of the model the adopted mesh allowed explicitly the capture of distinctive fluid flow features in the domain 3 1 base case scenario the base case scenario considers geological setting of the north german basin to systematically explore the leakage of contaminants from a shale gas reservoir through a leaky abandoned well into shallow aquifers to realistically represent the lifetime of a typical horizontal well each simulation comprises six different temporal periods namely 1 reservoir initial condition prior to fracturing 2 injection of hf fluid into the reservoir 3 shut in period 4 first production period 5 second production period and 6 post production period the first period models the steady state initial conditions through the system prior to operation afterwards the model utilizes the initial conditions generated from the first run to simulate the injection of hf fluid during the injection period fluid is injected into the reservoir from the perforation location at a constant rate of 3 15 m 3 min for 2 5 days birdsell et al 2015 this is equivalent to injection volumes of 11356 m 3 brownlow et al 2016a stage 3 represents a 5 day shut in period in which there is neither injection nor abstraction of fluid in the domain afterwards first and second productions periods are modeled to last interruptedly for 2 and 13 years respectively the production rate is 16 m 3 d during the first production period and it is lowered to 3 2 m 3 d in the second period the second production period represents the production decline throughout life of the well in stage 6 the production is stopped and no fluid enters or leaves the domain this stage models the continued migration of hf fluid into the shallow aquifers until 15 years after the production period the parameters values selected for the base scenario are chosen to better understand the leakage of hf fluid through an abandoned well and may not realistically reflect an actual fracturing operation table 2 summarizes the input parameters for the numerical simulations the data needed for modeling the abandoned well properties e g permeability are gathered from literature relating to hf fluid methane and co2 leakage models e g gasda et al 2008 nordbotten et al 2004 the parameters for sensitivity analysis were selected based on results from literature e g reagan et al 2015 taherdangkoo et al 2017 birdsell et al 2015 aimed at revealing the most influential factors determining upward migration of contaminants in the subsurface table 3 presents the base case parameters and their ranges of variations for the parametric study 3 2 parametric study a parametric study is designed for a wide spectrum of field configurations to examine the extent of contaminant i e hf fluid migration from a hydrocarbon bearing formation into the shallower permeable strata through an abandoned well the impact of injection rate reservoir and overburden properties salinity and abandoned well properties is evaluated the parametric study applies one at a time oat method morris 1991 in analyzing the influence of changing the values of each chosen parameter oat method has a limited use in exploratory modeling as it does not explore all the possible combinations between input variables and it usually provides a local sensitivity measurement however oat is a simple easy to implement and computationally cheap method thus providing relevant observations as it exposes the independent effects of each parameter iooss and lemaître 2015 the north german basin geology is considered as the baseline where each parameter is changed at a time 3 2 1 hf injection rate the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing treatment depends on several factors such as injection rate injection depth injection pressure and hf fluid properties e g viscosity wang et al 2016 concluded that fluid injection rate influences treating pressure corresponding stimulated reservoir volume and hydrocarbon production we changed injection rate to capture the full range of its potential influence on hf fluid flow the hf fluid injection rate varies between 3 05 to 4 16 m 3 min thus corresponding to a total injection volume of between 11000 and 15000 m 3 birdsell et al 2015 brownlow et al 2016a myers 2012 3 2 2 shale properties shale gas formations possess specific features such as heterogeneity low matrix porosity and permeability wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2012 the formation characteristics play important roles in gas production from shale gas reservoirs the shale s effective porosity and permeability reduce during production due to pore pressure reduction within the reservoir however we consider constant values for reservoir porosity and permeability during the entire simulation period we examined the effect of porosity and permeability of the rock matrix over a range reported in literature the shale porosity and permeability variation range from 1 to 5 and 1 10 21 to1 10 18 m 2 respectively 3 2 3 shale overpressure overpressure occurs when pore fluid pressure is higher than normal hydrostatic fluid pressure at a specific depth bowers 2002 overpressure in subsurface rocks could be produced through three main mechanisms namely increase in compressive stress change in pore fluid volume and fluid buoyancy osborne and swarbrick 1997 osborne and swarbrick 1997 concluded that disequilibrium compaction and gas generation are the most probable mechanisms for producing pressure anomalies in low permeable sediments disequilibrium compaction is a common overpressuring mechanism in thick low permeable sequences e g shale and clay with continued rapid burial overpressure is a transient phenomenon except when it is due to topography ligtenberg 2005 osborne and swarbrick 1997 in our model the overpressure is considered as an initial condition prior to fracturing birdsell et al 2015 we applied overpressure only within the shale and not in its overlying formations we acknowledge that the applied approach does not reflect the actual overpressure within the shale the overpressure varies from 10 to 13 kpa m brownlow et al 2016a gassiat et al 2013 to understand its effect on migration of hf fluid into shallow permeable layers 3 2 4 overburden properties the depth and physical properties of overburden layers play a critical role in flow and transport of hf fluid towards shallower strata gassiat et al 2013 taherdangkoo et al 2017 the depth to shale gas formations in sedimentary basins varies between 1 to 4 5 km with an average depth of 2 9 km eia 2011a gassiat et al 2013 the permeability of sedimentary layers also changes over a wide range gleeson et al 2011 the significance of these parameters was evaluated through a scenario which considers one overburden layer with averaged values calculated from the ngb data the overburden thickness ranges from 900 to 2900 m and overburden permeability range from 1 10 17 to 1 10 15 m 2 3 2 5 salinity salinity increases with depth in sedimentary basins ferguson et al 2018 a change in the initial distribution of salinity could influence the vertical flow of hf fluid taherdangkoo et al 2017 we assumed three different salt distributions within the domain prior to the operation to understand its significance in the upward migration of hf fluids the vertical salinity gradient of 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 g lm are considered 3 2 6 abandoned wellbore integrity there is limited information available on the quality of the sealing materials used for old abandoned wells and hence the hydraulic parameters e g permeability of the degraded barrier system is largely unknown nogues et al 2011 previous modeling studies suggested a range of effective permeability for evaluating the vertical migration of fluids through a leaky wellbore bai and reinicke 2013 celia et al 2005 ebigbo et al 2007 gasda et al 2008 nogues et al 2011 nordbotten et al 2005 nordbotten et al 2004 pawar et al 2009 herein the effective wellbore permeability is the primary parameter of interest and it averages the permeability of the entire fractured degraded formation parallel to the casing we consider a wide range of possible wellbore permeabilities based on the wellbore integrity of old wells that were drilled completed and abandoned using different technologies the model is run to simulate a 30 year period under the assumption that wellbore properties of the abandoned well remained constant through the entire simulation period an open wellbore has permeability values between 2 10 13 and 1 10 11 m 2 while in a properly sealed well permeabilities span between 1 10 17 to 1 10 13 m 2 3 2 7 proximity of hf to abandoned well frac hit is a common occurrence in oil and gas fields with a high density of production wells and even multiple frac hits may materialize lawal et al 2013 however in some cases the abandoned well may not be affected by fracturing the abandoned well can be close or at a large distance from the operation therefore it is important to explore the influence of the abandoned well proximity to hydraulic fractures on the upward flow of fluids to shallower aquifers the study is conducted by varying the lateral distance of the abandoned well from the fracture the fracture well proximity is varied between 5 to 15 m 3 2 8 influence of well production hydrocarbon production affects fluid flow behavior within the hydrocarbon bearing formation brownlow et al 2016a flewelling and sharma 2014 production leads to large scale depressurization in the reservoir which drives fluid to flow downward rather than upward the influence of well production on the upward flow of hf fluid is explored through a scenario which does not take into account production from the horizontal well in this case hf fluid remains in the domain during the entire simulation period the aim is to explore the long term contaminant distribution in the absence of an active production well 4 results and discussion 4 1 base case scenario the spatial distribution of hf fluid in the y z plane at x 1250 m at the end of injection and shut in periods is shown in fig 3 a b the spread of hf fluid within the fracture flow through the abandoned well and its rise through the overburden layers is displayed the red arrows display the direction of total fluid flow in the domain fig 4 a b compares the concentration of hf fluid dissolved chemicals along the abandoned well at the end of each simulation period the y axis represents depth of the domain from the aquifer base to bottom of the reservoir the posidonia shale and its overlying layer i e m jurassic claystone 3 layer host the bulk of hf fluid during the first two periods the vertical migration of the fluid is relatively low and it is primarily due to the shale overpressure fracturing pressure and upward buoyancy the induced overpressure is dissipated in the reservoir during the shut in period however the reservoir pressure still remains higher than the conditions prior to injection as apparent from fig 3 a b the total fluid flow direction is upward at the end of the injection period and it is mostly downward at the end of the shut in period the hf fluid reaches a maximum height of 252 m from fracture well intersection i e depth of 1468 m from the top at the end of the injection period and it increases to a height of 263 m i e 1457 m depth at the end of the shut in period the short lived shut in period has a minimal influence on the upward movement of fluids the shape of hf fluid plume at the end of injection period is identical to that for the shut in period therefore in fig 4a the iso concentration lines belonging to these periods overlapped note that the flow of hf fluid in each layer depends on the layer physical properties e g permeability the strata heterogeneity decreases the upward movement of hf fluid through the abandoned well the hf fluid is subject to upward buoyancy during the entire simulation which is due to density differences between the injected fluid and brine the induced overpressure is removed from the reservoir at the beginning production the hf fluid does not reach the aquifer at the end of the first production period see fig 5 and it reaches a maximum height of 1250 m from the fracture well intersection i e depth of 470 m from the top boundary the upward flow rate is low due dissolution of hf fluids in formation water and the lateral fluid flow in overburden layers at the end of stage 3 the concentration of dissolved chemicals at fracture well interface is 10 5 kg m 3 6 times lower than the concentration at the end of stage 2 the spatial distribution of hf fluid in the subsurface is displayed in fig 6 the upward hf fluid flow at the aquifer base is negligible prior to 3 years of production fig 5 the fluid reaches the shallow freshwater aquifer one year after the commencement of the second production period the hf fluid flow rate into the aquifer peaked in tenth year and afterwards experienced a steady decline the flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 0 08 m 3 yr at the end of production during production 67 of the injected fluid volume is extracted from the domain hence production plays a vital role in inhibiting substantial vertical migration of hf fluid toward shallow aquifers the production causes large scale depressurization within the reservoir which in turn draws fluids downward rather than upward the upward buoyancy force decreases over time due to dissolution of hf fluid with brine during its transport fracturing fluid extraction from the domain its lateral spreading into the overburden layers and decrease in the buoyancy force explain the decrease in the upward fluid flow along the abandoned well during production and post production periods the pressure build up occurs in the posidonia shale after end of the production the upward flow rate through the abandoned well is much lower during the post production period at the end of the simulation 67 of hf fluid volume is discharged by production 33 remained in the subsurface and 0 02 reached the shallow aquifer fig 6c shows the distribution of hf fluid through the well and the overburden layers at the end of simulation periods 30 years the hf fluid flow rate along the abandoned well at the overburden aquifer interface is 0 07 m 3 yr at the end of simulation 4 2 parametric study the sensitivity analysis is designed to examine field uncertainties and draw a meaningful conclusion for the defined failure scenario a total of 30 simulations aimed at assessing different field scenarios were ran by altering the key parameter values fig 7 a j illustrates hf fluid flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface during 30 years of simulation time the total volume of hf fluid in the system correspondingly increases with the increase in the injection rate thus a higher amount of fluid remains in the subsurface even after the end of production a higher injection rate imposes a higher induced pressure in the reservoir therefore the pressure front propagates a greater distance within the formation this increases the upward flow of fluids through the abandoned well consequently results in more contamination in shallower strata fig 7a presents hf fluid rate at the overburden aquifer interface based on total injected fluid volume v ff when the injection rate increases to 4 16 m 3 min fluid volume of 15000 m 3 the upward fluid flow into the aquifer is 1 75 times higher when compared to the base case scenario fluid volume of 11356 m 3 modeling results indicate that higher injection rates lead to a slightly higher chemical concentration in the shallow aquifers hence the long term influence of hf injection volume on the upward movement of fluids to overlying layers is relatively low the effect of shale properties on hf fluid flow are shown in fig 7 b c the ascent of hf fluid through abandoned well decreases with an increase in the shale permeability this occurs because pressure dissipation across the abandoned well decreases with an increase in the reservoir permeability however it leads to slight changes in the vertical fluid flow at overburden aquifer interface a reduction in the shale porosity also decreases the upward fluid flow it mirrors the same effect that reservoir permeability has on vertical flow of fluids the amount of extracted hf fluid by the well decreases with the decrease in shale permeability the corresponding volume is 76 and 63 for shale permeability of 1 10 18 and 1 10 21 m 2 respectively this shows that fluid flow into overlying aquifers decreases with the increase in hf fluid discharge the changes in shale porosity have insignificant influence on discharge of hf fluid from the domain although the physical properties of the reservoir affect the upward transport of hf fluid to shallower layers their significance on the long term concentration distribution in shallower layers is negligible during the short lived injection period the reservoir overpressure and fracturing injection pressure are the dominant forces for upward fluid flow subsequently large scale depressurization pressure occurs over lifetime of the well thus in the defined failure scenario the reservoir overpressure only has a short term influence on the vertical flow of fluids the long term upward migration of hf fluid through the abandoned well is not dependent on the shale overpressure fig 7 d the result indicates that the overpressure gradient does not have influence on the extracted volume of hf fluid from the domain during the production period note that the significance of shale overpressure on the vertical flow of fluids highly depends on the type of boundary conditions applied birdsell et al 2015 taherdangkoo et al 2017 thus the obtained results regarding the effect of shale overpressure may change by applying different initial and boundary conditions the depth of shale gas formation is an important factor affecting the vertical flow of fluids the hf fluid reaches the aquifer base one year after the operation for an overburden depth of 900 m in this case the flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is two times larger compared to the base case model the hf fluid could not be detected in the aquifer for overburden depth of 2400 and 2900 m fig 7 e the probability of aquifer contamination is slightly higher in shallower shale formations the flow rate at the aquifer base increases with an increase in the permeability of overburden layer fig 7 f the upward hf fluid flow rate into the aquifer is negligible for an averaged overburden permeability of 1 10 17 m 2 a change in the initial distribution of salinity gradient influences the vertical flow of fluids in the domain fig 7 g for a salinity gradient of 0 1 g lm the hf fluid flow rate at the aquifer base is 0 08 m 3 year and the discharge volume during production is 68 of the initial volume for a salinity gradient of 0 2 g lm the flow rate is 0 05 m 3 year and the discharge volume is 66 the upward migration of hf fluid through the abandoned well strongly depends on the effective wellbore permeability fig 7 h the fluid does not migrate upward for wellbore permeabilities equal to or lower than 1 10 13 m 2 in this case hf fluid does not reach the shallow aquifers even after 30 years for well permeability of 1 10 17 m 2 the volume of hf fluid discharged from the model domain by production is 75 of the initially injected volume and the remaining 25 of hf fluid volume is confined deep in the subsurface far from groundwater aquifers hence abandoned wells with low permeabilities i e high wellbore integrity prevent upward fluid flow into overburden layers fig 7e illustrates that a slight change in the wellbore permeability leads to a significant change of flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface thus resulting in an increase in chemical concentration in the aquifer for instance when the wellbore permeability is 2 10 12 m 2 the corresponding flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 3 6 times higher compared to the base case the maximum flow rate into the aquifer is observed for a well permeability of 1 10 11 m 2 27 4 times higher than that for the base case scenario in addition 56 of the injected fluid volume is extracted from the model domain during production period 1 reaches the aquifer and 43 is confined in the subsurface the modeling results suggest that wellbore integrity largely controls the flow of hf fluid into the shallower strata and consequently the contamination distribution into the aquifer the results indicate that the abandoned well has to fail to act as a permeable pathway for flow of fluids increasing the fracture well distance significantly influences the hf fluid arrival at the aquifer base when the fracture well distance is 5 m hf fluid reaches the shallow aquifer 4 years after production fig 7 i at the end of simulation the flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 3 6 times lower when compared to the base case an increase in fracture well distance to 10 m reduces the fluid flow to 0 01 m 3 yr this value is 7 2 times lower compared to the base case model when the production well is 5 m away from the hydraulic fracture 74 of injected fluid volume is extracted during production this value remains constant for a fracture well distance of 10 and 15 m which is due to the minimal effect of the hydraulic fracture to the abandoned well when the abandoned well is 15 m away from the fracture hf fluid cannot be detected in the aquifer the model results indicate that the proximity of hydraulic fracture to the abandoned well is the second most influential parameter on the vertical flow of fluids to shallower strata when well fracture distance is large enough most of hf fluid is discharged from the domain and the possibility of upward flow is largely inhibited the scenario that does not consider production leads to a higher contaminant distribution in the shallow aquifers fig 7 j at the end of simulation the flow rate into the aquifer is 10 times higher compared to the base case this indicates the production from the reservoir significantly reduces contamination treats to groundwater aquifers the modeling results suggest that the wellbore integrity of the abandoned well and its distance from fracturing operation are the most influential parameters determining the vertical flow of hf fluid through an abandoned well the hf fluid injection rate and overburden and reservoir properties also have impacts on vertical fluid flow towards shallow aquifers it is evident that hf fluid does not reach the aquifer within a short time frame the modeling results show limited vertical transport of fluids through the abandoned well under different field possibilities however a thorough evaluation of hydrogeological conditions and production history of a suggested field is required prior to hydraulic fracturing operation to minimize the risk to groundwater aquifers 5 conclusions this research focuses on the numerical simulation of fracturing fluid flow and transport from a hydrocarbon bearing formation towards shallow aquifers through an abandoned well the models are based on permeability and stratigraphy data of the geological sequence in the north german basin we conducted a parametric study to examine the influence of key factors such as overburden and reservoir properties abandoned well permeability and its proximity to hydraulic fractures on the vertical flow of fracturing fluid through an abandoned well numerical modeling results revealed the following during the injection period fracturing pressure and reservoir overpressure are the main driving forces for vertical movement of hf fluid during the shut in period the pressure is dissipated across the reservoir thereafter the fracturing pressure is removed and large scale depressurization occurs over time via production from the horizontal well the upward buoyancy is an important mechanism for upward flow of fluids to shallower strata during production and post production periods the production extracts a significant amount of injected hf fluid 67 of total volume from the domain thus reducing the probability of hf fluid flow to overlying layers when production is not incorporated in the model the flow rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 10 times higher than that of the base case this indicates that neglecting the effect of well production leads to the overestimation of fluid flow through the well and consequently contamination distribution in the aquifer the influence of reservoir physical properties and hf injection volume on the vertical migration of fluids is inconsequential over the long term the significance of shale overpressure highly depends on the type of applied boundary conditions the strata heterogeneity decreases the upward migration of fluids through the abandoned well the probability of upwards migration of hf fluid is lower in sedimentary basins with high salinity the combined effect of well production and dissolution of hf fluid with formation water significantly decreases the upward movement of hf fluid towards shallower strata we suggest that further modeling studies take into account these important effects most notably increasing abandoned well permeability significantly increases the upward fluid rate to shallow aquifers when well permeability is set at 1 10 11 m 2 hf fluid rate at the overburden aquifer interface is 27 4 times higher than the base case the hf fluid does not reach the aquifers for wellbore permeability lower than 1 10 13 m 2 therefore wellbore integrity is considered as the most important factor controlling the leakage of fluids through an abandoned well it is concluded that only a defected wellbore could act as a permeable pathway for movement of fluids to overlying layers the proximity of fracturing to the abandoned well is the second most influential parameter influencing the upward flow of fluids the hf fluid cannot be detected in the aquifer when the abandoned well is 15 m away from the hydraulic fracture however the findings for an abandoned well with a permeability of 1 10 13 m 2 and the fracture well distance of 15 m may change with different geological settings the short term probability of shallow aquifer contamination resulting from fracturing is negligible even in the presence of a leaky abandoned well model results show that hf fluid reaches the aquifer three years after production the long term simulation reveals that the risks hydraulic fracturing pose to shallow aquifers are low i e 0 02 of injected fluid reach to the aquifer at the of simulation time acknowledgment we acknowledge the funding received from the european union s horizon 2020 research and innovation

1604,the impact of fracture geometry and aperture distribution on fluid movement and on non reactive solute transport was investigated experimentally and numerically in single fractures for this purpose a hydrothermally altered and an unaltered granite drill core with axial fractures were investigated using three injection and three extraction locations at top and bottom of the fractured cores different dipole flow fields were examined the conservative tracer amino g breakthrough curves were measured using fluorescence spectroscopy based on 3 d digital data obtained by micro computed tomography 2 5 d numerical models were generated for both fractures by mapping the measured aperture distributions to the 2 d fracture geometries x y plane fluid flow and tracer transport were simulated using comsol multiphysics by means of numerical simulations and tomographic imaging experimentally observed breakthrough curves can be understood and qualitatively reproduced the experiments and simulations suggest that fluid flow in the altered fracture is governed by the 2 d fracture geometry in the x y plane while fluid flow in the unaltered fracture seems to be controlled by the aperture distribution moreover we demonstrate that in our case simplified parallel plate models fail to describe the experimental findings and that pronounced tailings can be attributed to complex internal heterogeneities the results presented implicate the necessity to incorporate complex domain geometries governing fluid flow and mass transport into transport modeling keywords natural

diffusion due to a developing concentration gradient natural rock fractures possess complex geometries with rough and irregular fracture surfaces asperities highly variable aperture distributions and contact areas asperity contacts of different sizes between the opposite surfaces brown et al 1998 durham et al 2001 hakami and larsson 1996 fracture and fracture network solute transport is directly affected by spatial heterogeneities inducing complex flow fields flow channeling is a typical fracture flow feature which is provoked by strongly pronounced aperture distribution variabilities resulting in preferential flow paths of lower hydraulic resistance bodin et al 2003 huber et al 2012 keller et al 1999 moreno et al 1988 neretnieks et al 1982 tsang and neretnieks 1998 with respect to the entire fracture elevated flow velocities prevail in those regions brown et al 1998 in close proximity to these channels depending on the geometry and given hydraulics there are often hardly accessible areas for the main flow low flow zones where features like recirculation zones may form boutt et al 2006 solutes or particles may reach those areas by hydrodynamic dispersion and or molecular diffusion the increased residence time of solutes and colloids and therefore increased time scales for chemical and physical interaction with the fracture surface may then lead to higher retardation and retention e g sorption kinetics reduction kinetics or matrix diffusion in consequence the residence time distributions in systems described above show much more pronounced tailings numerous analytical and numerical approaches are postulated to describe mass transport in single fractures and fracture networks a very simplified and elementary model of a single fracture is a smooth parallel plate simplification with a constant aperture louis 1969 oda 1986 parsons 1966 snow 1965 in this case the hydraulic fracture conductivity volumetric flow is a cubic function of the aperture snow 1965 witherspoon et al 1980 neglecting rough fracture surfaces and tortuous flow paths these geometrically simplified models cannot describe the flow dynamics brown 1987 sisavath et al 2003 and overestimate fracture flow rates konzuk and kueper 2004 nicholl et al 1999 consequently this parallel plate approach is rather applicable for smooth and wide fractures in order to simulate precisely the fluid flow in rough and heterogeneous fracture geometries complex equations such as the non linear navier stokes equations are used which fully describes the motion of newtonian fluids in a continuum media batchelor 1967 wilkes and bike 1999 since high computational and numerical efforts are necessary to solve the navier stokes equations numerous simplified assumption e g the local cubic law zimmerman and yeo 2000 or the stokes equation zimmerman et al 1991 are often applied to describe the fluid flow in fractured media but such simplifications are only valid under certain criteria and requirements which require an explicit knowledge of acceptable limitations which are not always easy to determine brush and thomson 2003 the isolated impact of fracture geometry and aperture distribution is less well investigated and a distinction between the contribution of hydrodynamic dispersion and diffusion to low velocity zones is challenging cardenas et al 2007 due to this lack of information tailing effects in the residence time distribution are often attributed to reactive interaction with the fracture surface or to matrix diffusion however effects of fracture geometry and hydrodynamic condition were found to be of influence and even more important with increasing reynolds number e g in 2 d numerical modeling of fluid flow and mass transport in a ct scanned fracture cardenas et al 2007 here velocity contrasts are generated by geometry triggered features like eddies boutt et al 2006 inferred the trapping of colloids in intra fracture recirculation zones from 2 d numerical simulations for an aperture of 3 5 mm with the upper fracture surface being rough while the lower side was considered flat 3 d models indicated that flow heterogeneity and additional dispersion are generated by asperity contacts and surface roughness even for small reynolds numbers re 0 001 zou et al 2017 however direct comparison of experimental data and numerical simulations of the same setting e g huber et al 2012 tenchine and gouze 2005 are rare which creates a lack in benchmarking of these numerical simulations a crucial step to tackle this is high resolution scanning of the fracture geometry in particular for laboratory experiments tomographic methods such as computed tomography μ ct represents a non destructive way to image the internal often complex structure of fractured media keller 1998 and can be implemented in 2 d or 3 d numerical models huber et al 2012 petchsingto and karpyn 2009 due to the lack of direct comparison in the present study we investigate the impact of fracture geometry in the x y plane and of aperture distribution on solute transport experimentally and numerically for this purpose a hydrothermally altered and an unaltered natural granitic fracture were utilized due to the alteration process the surface and fracture features e g roughness and aperture distribution were expected to differ significantly between both drill cores sausse 2002 in order to induce different dipole flow fields and to investigate the impact of spatially variable apertures on flow and solute transport the injection and extraction locations of the conservative fluorescent solute tracer amino g were systematically varied for two flow rates 24 or 12 ml h μ ct scans of both fractures provided the basis for 2 5 d numerical models on fluid flow and solute transport to which the experimental results were compared here the term 2 5 d describes a 2 d model geometry in the x y plane which was extended by the aperture distribution in z direction via the mapping of an interpolation function to the 2 d geometry therefore the aperture distribution was not part of the geometry itself rather it was considered hydrodynamically by resistance forces in the fluid flow simulation moreover an additional model including matrix diffusion was generated to investigate any matrix diffusion effects on the residence time behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 fractured drill core samples and flow cell preparation both fractures were sampled from drill cores of the well eps 1 at the enhanced geothermal system egs reference site at soultz sous forêts france which is located about 70 km north of strasbourg at the nne ssw trending western boundary of upper rhine graben at soultz sous forêts three naturally fractured granitic reservoirs with permeabilities of about 3e 17 to 3e 16 m2 schill et al 2017 and locally up to 3e 14 m2 kohl et al 1997 occur underneath the cenozoic and mesozoic sedimentary cover below 1400 m depth the paleozoic granitic basement is characterized by a grey porphyritic monzogranite down to about 4000 4500 m where it is penetrated by grey fine grained two mica granite hydrothermal alteration occurring mainly on fracture surfaces via natural fluid circulation within the reservoir resulted in secondary phase formation such as clays illite smectite tosudite calcite secondary quartz and sulfide genter et al 2009 genter et al 2003 two granite drill cores of diameters of 78 0 0 4 mm were selected while one drill core showed a distinct hydrothermal alteration the second one was macroscopically unaltered care was taken that only sections with single axial fractures were chosen the hydrothermal porphyroid red granite sample length l 93 4 0 3 mm with moderate to high alteration was extracted from 1462 m depth the standard porphyroid granite sample l 92 9 0 3 mm with a minor pervasive alteration was taken from 1957 m depth genter and traineau 1991 further details are summarized in the supporting information si 1 prior to emplacing the granite fractures in acrylic glass tubes polymethyl methacrylate pmma trademark plexiglas the two fracture sides were cleaned to remove loose particles debris and dust using compressed air in the next step the sutures at the long sides of the cores were sealed using two component glue uhu epoxy adhesives 2 component care was taken to prevent as much as possible the intrusion of the resin into the fracture by always placing the core side upside down during the application of several thin layers of glue the sealing of the opposite open core side was done after the glue has been hardened completely on the first side this sealing procedure minimizes any unwanted intrusion of the bedding material acrylic glass glue into the fracture while preparing the flow cell the sealed core was emplaced inside an acrylic glass cylinder and the remaining space between the cylindrical sides of the core and the internal surface of the cylinder was filled up with acrylic glass glue two endcaps with three inlets outlets each were assembled at the open sides both top and bottom of the fracture fig 1a b between the fracture inlet outlet and the cap a 1 mm thick elastic plastic foil mipolan was placed to keep the fracture flow cell leak proof to minimize any artificial dispersion the tubing was placed directly above the fracture 2 2 fracture characterization and model generation to study the impact of fracture geometry and aperture distribution both fractures were characterized by μ ct μ ct delivers detailed information on the fracture geometry and aperture distribution under μm resolution specific analyses of the granite rock porosity were not undertaken 2 2 1 μ ct measurement and fracture segmentation routine the μ ct measurements were carried out at the federal institute for materials research and testing bam berlin after emplacing the fractures in acrylic glass setups the granite cores were scanned with a ge xs 300 device dxr 250 2 k detector general electric usa with following scan parameters 280 kv 90 μa 0 5 mm cu pre filter 3000 angel steps by 360 rotation the reconstructed voxel dimension is 60 8 μm with the whole sample in the field of view the raw data quality is high but contains medium beam hardening effects based on the μ ct datasets of both drill cores 3 d digital models for both fractures were generated using segmentation routines to get segmentable binary structural spatial data of the fracture within the sample it was necessary to remove beam hardening effects and noise this was done by a specially developed method for details see jovanović et al 2013 khan et al 2015 low noise removal was done with a 3 d non local means filter buades et al 2005 implemented in the geodict software package geometric models and predictions of properties geodict 2015 after correction of the reconstructed raw data 2 k 16bit datasets the fracture was segmented by watershed thresholding segmentation procedure using the 3 d software avizo fei visualization sciences group france 2 2 2 model preprocessing the segmented 3 d fracture geometry from avizo was exported in the standard triangulation language format short stl without any mesh error correction errors like e g overlapping triangles low quality triangles etc for further preprocessing due to the resulting voxel size of 60 μm parts smaller than the resolution are not interpreted as part of the open fracture space and are therefore not exported as geometry the low μ ct scan resolution in relation to the spatial fracture aperture dimensions resulted in erroneous segments in the uncorrected stl mesh e g flat elements without an extension in z direction and torn patches using the finite element pre processor hypermesh hyperworks altair engineering usa an envelope around the fracture geometry was generated using the built in shrinkwrap meshing option yielding a watertight error free and closed triangular surface mesh around the 3 d body the shrinkwrap option artificially inflated the original geometry and thus the aperture distribution depending on the maximum element size chosen in the meshing algorithm this compromise had to be taken to obtain the necessary watertight surface mesh without altering the natural geometry substantially moreover the resulting fracture geometry and surface roughness of the watertight mesh was smoothed slightly by this procedure this watertight stl mesh was further remeshed to improve element quality and remove any leftover mesh errors with the help of the software 3 matic research 11 0 materialise mimics innovation suite 19 0 belgium with the aforementioned steps complete error free triangulated 3 d models with inlet and outlet of both cores were obtained the experimental tubing locations for inducing different dipole flow fields are implicitly included in the 3 d model by placing cylinders of 0 75 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length at their respective positions at the fracture model inlets outlets this was done to establish a fully developed flow profile before entering the fracture while keeping an isolated injection point into the fracture these 3 d models served as the base for the creation of the 2 5 d models used in the numerical simulations to obtain the aperture distribution and the 2 d model geometry in the x y plane a fracture midplane was created which is located precisely in the middle of both main fracture planes by automatically calculating the distance between the main fracture planes on each node of the triangular mesh the aperture distribution was obtained within 3 matic the midplane was geometrically transformed from 3 d to 2 d by projection onto the x y plane the 2 d midplane was imported afterwards into comsol multiphysics comsol ab stockholm sweden comsol 2017 for the numerical model generation and simulation setup in order to compensate the artificial increase of the aperture distribution by the shrink wrapping step explained above the mean aperture of the original uncorrected stl mesh from avizo was compared to the mean aperture of the stl mesh after the shrink wrapping yielding the factor to scale down the aperture values consequently the aperture distribution used in comsol had the same mean aperture value as determined by μ ct the aperture values of the tubing remained unaffected since for this study the aperture distribution was considered hydrodynamically in the modeling its implementation in comsol is explained in detail in the governing equations and boundary conditions section section 2 2 4 we are aware that those corrections and error minimizing steps which were essential to obtain functional models may lead to a loss of geometric information of the μ ct dataset e g unavoidable smoothing of edges however we disbelieve that those important steps changed the fracture geometry and aperture distribution fundamentally therefore decisive changes or consequences due to those steps are not assumed 2 2 3 characterized fractures 2 2 3 1 altered fracture fig 2 shows the aperture distribution mapped to the fracture geometry the altered fracture model is featured by a highly complex geometry with irregular boundaries and heterogeneously distributed asperity contacts the width of the altered fracture model varies between 66 0 0 1 and 76 7 0 1 mm and the length is 87 3 0 1 mm without the cylinders inlet and outlet tubes the model shows to be 6 mm shorter compared to the total fracture length this is most likely attributed to the μ ct measurement procedure within the given resolution of 60 μm both fracture sides are touching each other at some areas in the model those touching areas are hydraulically unavailable because all apertures smaller than 60 μm are interpreted as nonexistent however a possible presence of apertures smaller than the resolution cannot be excluded the irregular shape of the fracture borders is maybe partly an artifact of the utilized glue in order to seal the fracture along its sides as expected the aperture field shows a heterogeneous distribution with apertures from 0 theoretically calculated to 1 013 mm with a mean aperture of 0 162 mm fig 3 the major amount of the aperture values 66 is between 0 075 and 0 175 mm 24 bigger and 10 smaller the total void volume of the fracture is 0 9 ml area and volume were evaluated by surface integration of the geometry and the aperture data respectively using the height height function plawsky et al 2008 the correlation length λ was calculated to be 3 58 0 30 mm this results in a λ l ratio of 0 04 with l being the characteristic flow length here length of drill core therefore after the studies of e g guo et al 2016 or tsang and neretnieks 1998 local fluid flow channels may occur but might not have a significant impact on the fluid flow all data are summarized in table 1 2 2 3 2 unaltered fracture the geometry of the unaltered fracture is less complex compared to the altered one see fig 2 in addition the number of contact areas is less abundant and the sizes are significantly smaller the spatial dimensions are 91 8 0 1 mm in length and between 64 0 0 1 mm and 74 0 0 1 mm in width this is a deviation to the original fracture of 1 1 mm in length the 3 d model shows a step in the lower part of fracture at the right side above the right inlet see red ellipse in the supporting information fig si 2a this geometrical feature cannot be resolved in the 2 d model due to the missing z dimension in contrast to the altered fracture the mean aperture is more than two times bigger with a value of 0 357 mm 79 of all apertures are between 0 255 and 0 435 mm 11 bigger and 10 smaller fig 3 consequently the total void volume of the fracture is with 2 2 ml more than twice as high as already mentioned for the altered fracture channeling might not have a significant impact of the fluid flow since the correlation length is 4 77 0 30 mm resulting in a λ l ratio of 0 05 fracture properties are summarized in table 1 2 2 4 governing equations and boundary conditions flow and transport modeling was performed using version 5 2a of the finite element code comsol multiphysics modeling software since there was already the compromise in simulating in 2 5 d instead of 3 d and since acceptable limitations to use simplified model approaches are not easy to determine focus was laid on a highly accurate simulation of the flow which justifies the application of the navier stokes equations in comsol the navier stokes equations were solved using the laminar flow module in which steady state laminar flow of an incompressible single phase newtonian fluid of constant viscosity is expressed by two equations in vector form i the momentum balance equation 1 ρ u u pi η u u t f ii the continuity equation 2 ρ u 0 where ρ kg m3 denotes the fluid density u m s the fluid velocity vector p pa the fluid pressure i the identity matrix η kg ms the fluid dynamic viscosity and f kg m2s2 the body force term applied to the fluid given the large number of experiments due to the change of the inlet and outlet locations and considering necessary computational times simulating the highly complex geometrical structures in 3 d in this study a 2 5 d simulation approach was applied despite the reduction in dimensionality from 3 d to 2 d and thus a loss in geometric information the model approach used in this work still tried to incorporate as much as possible geometric information from the μ ct datasets fractures possess extreme gradients in spatial scales with apertures much smaller μm to mm scale than the fracture length and width cm to m scale a navier stokes flow model in the x y plane perpendicular to the fracture z direction aperture distribution fails to describe the flow correctly if it assumes a unit height in z direction e g default 1 m in many flow solvers which is orders of magnitude larger than the actual fracture height this is because the impact of the boundaries top and bottom wall perpendicular to the flow direction is not considered appropriately in such approaches therefore in this study in order to model in 2 d and to consider the impact of the fracture aperture on the fluid flow the navier stokes equations with the so called shallow channel approximation available in comsol were applied bruus 2007 this approximation adds an additional resistance term eq 3 to the momentum equation of the navier stokes equations representing the influence of the aperture a m this term introduces the resistance of the top and bottom wall to the fluid flow 3 f sca 12 ηu a z 2 where f sca kg m2s2 is the resistance force the measured and re calculated as mentioned above aperture distribution was imported into comsol to be used as a variable a in an interpolation function a x y which is applied in the shallow channel approximation the interpolation function maps the aperture distribution onto the 2 d fracture geometry fig 2 the shallow channel approximation shows similarities to the local cubic law brush and thomson 2003 since both are vertical averaged fluid flow descriptions but the shallow channel approximation considers explicitly the shear forces by variabilities of ux and uy and inertia terms although the resulting model incorporated the aperture distribution the full geometrical information in z direction was still lacking e g the tortuosity perpendicular to the flow direction nevertheless the use of the aperture distribution measured by μ ct in the 2 d model was clearly more realistic compared to models using a simple mean aperture a normal inflow velocity boundary condition was applied at the inlet and a pressure boundary condition prescribed gauge pressure 0 pa suppress backflow at the outlet the applied velocity was calculated based on the tubing radius and applied mass flow 24 ml h or 12 ml h in the experiments which results in a flow velocity of 0 015 or 0 0075 m s in the modeling and the experiments the injection was always at the bottom the fracture walls were treated as no slip boundary conditions which specify the velocity at the walls as zero u 0 using the dimensionless reynolds number re the fluid dynamics of the flow in the fracture eq 4 and in the inlet and outlet pipes eq 5 are characterized as 4 re u l v or 5 re q d v a where l m is the characteristic length here the arithmetic mean of the aperture ν m2 s the kinematic viscosity q m3 s the volumetric flow rate d m the inner diameter of the pipe and a m the pipe s cross sectional area fluid flow through a narrow rough fracture can be classified as laminar when re 100 for re 100 a turbulent hydraulic flow regime prevails kohl et al 1997 the stationary flow field was used in the transient solute transport simulation by a one way coupling approach for solving the solute transport the time dependent convection diffusion equation was used 6 c t d c u c 0 where c kg m3 is the total concentration t s is the time d m2 s is the diffusion coefficient and u m s2 is the mass species velocity the dimensionless péclet number pe describes the ratio between molecular diffusion and convection on the solute transport pe is defined as 7 pe u l d where u m s is the mean flow velocity l m indicates the characteristic length which is in fractures generally equal to the mean aperture in the case of pe 1 convection dominates however for pe 1 the solute transport is mainly controlled by diffusion the tracer was introduced at the inlet of the model using the experimental injection function as described below by using the experimental injection function as model input mixing and dilution effects in the experimental setup before the fracture were implicitly incorporated however possible dispersion after the fracture cannot be considered in the simulation as it was considered before the fracture before tracer injection the initial tracer concentration in the fracture was c 0 the numerical mesh used consists of purely triangular elements a part of the mesh is depicted in the supporting information fig si 3 the mesh was created in an adapted way with a finer mesh resolution near the model boundaries the mesh was refined until a mesh independent solution of the flow field was achieved 1 deviation between two refined model simulations was deemed sufficient in parallel it was assured that the mesh had at least twice the number of elements than the number of aperture values imported to avoid numerical instabilities of the interpolation function in areas of high aperture value gradients the direct solver pardiso parallel sparse direct solver was chosen for flow and solute transport calculations with a relative tolerance of 1e 8 for the flow and 1e 6 for the transport respectively in order to obtain the btcs a boundary probe which defines the location of the concentration measurement over time was applied at the respective outlet the time steps were taken automatically by the solver to reach convergence in dependence on the set tolerance the simulation time was chosen long enough for each model btc to reach at least c c 0 of 1e 4 in the btc tailing in addition in order to test the potential occurrence and importance of matrix diffusion on the solute transport a separate simple parallel plate matrix diffusion model with 0 1 2 5 5 and 10 matrix porosity has been applied detailed information on the model generation and the obtained results can be found in the supporting information si 8 2 3 experimental setup conditions and procedure conservative solute tracer

bashar and tellam 2011 the solute tracer was measured continuously by fluorescence spectroscopy luminescence spectrometer 55 perkin elmer usa using a flow through cuvette of 100 μl hellma analytics germany in order to determine a suitable background electrolyte solution remaining parts of the granite cores used in the transport experiments were crushed using a jaw crusher bb50 retsch germany the composition of 30 ml milli q water after equilibration with 10 g of the crushed material of a size of about 1 mm was measured after 7 and 30 days using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 8300dv perkin elmer usa and ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1100 thermo scientific inc usa based on the resulting major cation and anion composition two synthetic background electrolyte solutions were prepared table 2 prior to the transport experiments both cores were flushed from the bottom to the top for two months with the respective background electrolyte at 5 ml h using a peristaltic pump reglo digital ms 4 8 ismatec germany for chemical equilibration a complete saturation of the fracture was assumed and air entrapments in the fracture were prevented by vibrating the flow cells frequently and by changing the applied fluid flow rate a scheme of the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 whenever possible peek polyether ether ketone tubing of 0 75 mm inner diameter was used in order to minimize potential interaction e g sorption and dispersion the peristaltic pump injected the background electrolyte out of its reservoir into the fracture via a

time dependent measurements at a constant wavelength excitation wavelength λ ex 350 nm and emission wavelength λ em 445 nm of amino g were acquired using bl studio software time drive the data interval was set to δt 3 s the eluate was collected and weighed at the outlet of the setup after passing the fluorescence detection spectroscopy to assure constant flow rate and ph the initial mean concentration c 0 was determined by injecting the tracer solution directly into the flow through cuvette using a syringe before and after every experiment in the transport experiments a tracer volume of 4 ml was injected at constant flow rates of 24 or 12 ml h which resulted in tracer injection durations of 10 or 20 min respectively after injecting the tracer pulse the flow was switched to tracer free background electrolyte keeping the set flow rate until the initial background level was reached a linear calibration curve was applied to convert the fluorescence intensity into concentration it was assumed that the comparably high flow velocities used in the experiments compensated possible pulsation effect generated from the peristaltic pump in order to obtain solely the experimental injection function as input for the numerical model and to quantify the dead volume of the setup before signal detection the fracture flow cell was removed from the setup and tracer experiments as described above with a tracer pulse of 4 ml were performed to be more precise the tracer was injected with either 24 or 12 ml h into the experimental setup and the time between start of the injection and first detection by the fluorescence spectrometer was converted to the dead volume of the tubing in the experimental setup the dead volume of the setup before signal detection has been quantified to be 610 40 μl the resulting btcs for the two different flow rates chosen were later directly applied as injection functions in the numerical modeling to implicitly include any artificial dispersion caused by the experimental setup in order to correct the experimental and numerical breakthrough curves for the dead volume the breakthrough curve s base line before the inclining limb was shortened by the quantified dead volume thus the whole btcs were shifted to smaller times 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluid flow modeling the modelled flow regimes in both fractures with the flow rate of 24 ml h are depicted in figs 5 and 6 the displayed color range indicates high flow velocities in red and low flow velocities in blue the highest flow velocities predominate in the inlet and outlet tubes which is due to the small cross section area of the tubing compared to the bigger cross section area of the fracture for better visibility of the flow field the color range is limited to flow velocities between 0 and 1e 3 m s the maximum flow velocities are depicted on the right side of the upright arrows numbers at top and bottom of the images depict the numbering of the inlets and outlets for each fracture in order to describe the respective inlet and outlet combinations the numbers of inlet and outlet are separated by a hyphen within the text in order to distinguish the fractures an a for altered or a u for unaltered are placed in front when using for example the combination inlet 1 and outlet 1 of the altered fracture this results in the text in a1 1 and in figures mentioning the fracture in 1 1 the morphologic complexity of both fractures clearly affects the flow fields the flow field in the altered core is strongly influenced by the fracture geometry fig 5 in particular by the numerous asperity contacts in the case of the middle inlet position the flow is forced to move to the left side and pass a bottleneck between two asperity contacts which results in high flow velocities in this area the same applies to the left inlet fluid flow induced through the right inlet however is limited at the left side by a large contact area and thus the flow is forced to the right fracture boundary there are regions in the upper half of the fracture where the flow velocity increases again the impact of the applied dipole flow field becomes especially obvious in the inlet outlet combinations at the long boundaries of the fracture a1 1 and a3 3 one half of the fracture is dominated by high flow velocities while the flow velocities in the other half of the fracture remain very low the difference is most striking in the case of a3 3 in the cases a3 1 a3 2 and a3 3 the region beneath in front of the bottleneck is most likely only accessible for the solutes by diffusion the same applies to the corner areas of the fracture in contrast to the altered fracture the flow in the unaltered fracture shows to have less flow velocity variations fig 6 because of the fully open fracture the dipole flow field can evolve in its more characteristic shape the flow velocity distribution in the unaltered fracture is obviously more affected by the aperture distribution than by the fracture geometry model derived values over all dipole configurations are averaged in table 3 the mean flow velocity values are directly extracted from the model the mean flow velocity of the altered core is higher compared to the unaltered one which can be explained by the different mean apertures and the total volumes of both fractures as mentioned above the reynolds numbers for those flow rates are in the range of laminar flow and the mean péclet number shows clearly advection controlled systems a table of the flow velocities and reynolds numbers for each case can be found in the supporting information si 4 with table si 4a and table si 4b 3 2 solute transport experiments and modeling the variation of injection and extraction location with three inlets and outlets for each fracture results in nine separate experimental cases before investigating the experimental and model results in detail all experimental results are solely shown in fig 7 for both flow rates per fracture in all cases the tracer is recovered quantitatively 98 2 within the uncertainties given the btcs of the altered fracture are more irregular and broader compared to the btcs of the unaltered fracture however except a1 1 a2 3 and a3 3 the variations between the different btcs are quite narrow in contrast a bigger spreading is visible within the btcs of the unaltered fracture and the overall maximum c c 0 is slightly higher max c c 0 0 94 3 2 1 altered fracture generally speaking a good agreement can be seen by comparing the corresponding experimental and model btcs fig 8 in the cases of a1 2 a1 3 a2 2 and a2 3 the tailing is well described by the model however the modelled btcs show to be more pronounced for the extraction out of outlet 1 a1 1 a2 1 the injection through inlet 3 results in the simulations in more irregular shaped tailings and the formation of secondary peaks or shoulders a3 1 and a3 2 shoulder after 4000 s 24 ml h and 8000 s 12 ml h a3 3 secondary peak after 2000 s 24 ml h and 4000 s 12 ml h those peaks indicate additional flow paths in the fracture e g due to an increase in residence time of the tracer caused by diffusion dispersion processes in the bottleneck area see figs 2 and 5 information on the secondary peak formation and images of the solute transport simulation for two examples are provided in the supporting information fig si 6a since a dispersion in the tubing after the fracture was not considered in the simulation dispersion and mixing in this short kept tubing section might explain the absence of a secondary peak in the experimental btc tailing the modelled btcs from inlet 1 and inlet 2 are nearly congruent when extracting through the same outlet this might be due to the wide area before the bottleneck and the bottleneck itself resulting in nearly identical tracer flow paths for those cases such a clear congruency as seen in the modeling cannot be observed by comparing the respective experimental results see fig 7 there are no obvious differences observed between the obtained btcs with 12 ml h and 24 ml h for one inlet outlet combination experimentally and numerically this can be seen in an additional presentation of the btcs in the supporting information fig si 5a therefore the tracer transport behavior is insensitive to the flow rate within the experimental conditions chosen the quality of correlation of the experimental and the modelled btcs is shown in fig 9 by means of a comparison of the time of the first arrival the time of the peak maximum and the time of 50 recovery symbols of those times which are directly on the line through origin with the slope 1 represent the perfect agreement for the respective time between experiment x axis and model y axis symbols above the line represent an earlier event in the experiment compared to the model and vice versa when the symbol is located below the line the experiments scatter around the line of origin as expected the experiments and models along the long sides of the fracture a1 1 and a3 3 show both the earliest first arrival and in the case of the experiment a3 3 the earliest peak and 50 recovery the time of the first arrival for the majority of simulations is later than in the experiments the travel times follow the geometry of the fracture which means that the shortest way through the fracture leads to faster travel times this explains the fast travel times for a3 3 in this specific case the inlet outlet combination and the geometry of the fracture with a large asperity contact between inlet 2 and inlet 3 cause the highest flow velocities near the right fracture boundary concentrating the tracer cloud in this region moreover this dependence on the geometry results in the irregular shape of the experimental btcs fig 7 the presented btcs fig 8 the snapshots of solute transport fig si 6a and the evaluation of the three defined times t 1st arrival t peak t 50 recovered fig 9 lead to the conclusion that the flow through the altered fracture is well reproduced by the model and is clearly controlled by the complex fracture geometry 3 2 2 unaltered fracture in contrast to the altered fracture there is less agreement between the experimental and the modelled btcs of the unaltered fracture fig 10 the model overestimates the tailing and the first arrival is shifted to longer residence times for the majority of the modelled combinations those observations in the modelled btcs indicate that the fracture is less well described as was the case for the altered fracture in addition both cases along the boundaries of the fracture u1 1 and u3 3 show secondary peaks in the tailing region which are not visible in the experimental btcs this indicates the already mentioned additional dispersion in the tubing after the fracture which was not considered in the simulation in contrast to the modeling results the majority of the experimental btcs shows a less pronounced tailing between c c 0 1e 1 to 1e 3 comparable to the altered fracture experiments there are no obvious differences between the obtained btcs with 12 ml h and 24 ml h which can be seen in an additional presentation of the btcs in the supporting information fig si 5b moreover images of the solute transport simulation are provided in the supporting information for two examples as well fig si 6b the comparison of distinct times of simulation and experiment are shown in fig 11 the major amount of the data points are located above the line of origin which means that the experiments reach the specific times earlier compared to the simulation despite the well described tailing region fig 10 the largest deviation compared to the experimental result shows case u3 1 the simulation represents a significant positive time shift however considering the position of the inlet and outlet the experimental result shows comparable small specific times it might be that the model overestimates the impact of the flow distance through the fracture the fact that all simulations tend to longer residence times in the fracture leads to the conclusion that either the fracture geometry or the fracture aperture distribution or both are not entirely captured by the model by comparing the experimental results with each other see fig 7 and in contrast to the altered fracture experiments there is less variation in the shape and the tailing of the btcs however the variation between the btcs shows a larger spreading both observations might be attributed to the more homogenous fracture the small amount of contact zones and the bigger aperture however the experiments do not follow the excepted travel time based on the position of the inlets and outlets which is not captured in the modeling see for example case u3 1 in fig 10 this deviation might be caused by the missing tortuosity in the 2 5 d model approach 3 3 impact of aperture distribution and geometry additionally to the 2 5 d model results presented above the modeling is extended by performing simulations with decreasing model complexity based on parallel plate models by using the mean fracture aperture value of each fracture see table 1 the purpose of those simulations is i to obtain a reference breakthrough curve without the impact of geometry and aperture distribution and ii to investigate the impact of fracture aperture distribution fracture geometry and asperity contacts therefore three approaches have been made to simplify the actual 2 5 d model 1 real 2 d fracture geometry in the x y plane which includes the asperity contacts 2 real fracture geometry in the x y plane but without asperity contacts creating fully open fractures and 3 a simple parallel plate model with rectangular fracture geometry in x y plane and without asperity contacts in all approaches the interpolation function which implemented the aperture distribution to the 2 d geometry is replaced by the mean aperture value fig si 7 in the supporting information visualizes the different model approaches the different simulations are done for two cases for each fracture one simulation which shows a good agreement with the respective experimental tailing and one simulation that shows distinct deviations e g a secondary peak or pronounced shoulder are chosen in the case of the altered fracture a1 3 and a3 3 are selected and in the case of the unaltered core u1 1 and u3 1 are chosen the 2 5 d simulations with 24 ml h are used for this comparison each change and each decrease in complexity from the initial model alters the fracture volume or the geometry in order to consider this impact the applied flow velocity at the inlet is adjusted in order to obtain the same mean fluid flow velocity in the models maximum deviation of the resulting mean flow velocity is 5e 7 m s the biggest adjustment in the applied velocity at the inlet needs to be done for the rectangular parallel plate model for the altered fracture from 1 5e 2 m s to 2 2e 2 m s fig 12 shows the direct comparison of the four model approaches with the experimental btcs in all examined cases the decrease in complexity of the models results in less pronounced tailings furthermore the first arrival of the tracer is affected by means of a shift to longer travel times which caused an increase in the offset based on the deviation between each model approach the isolated effect of the simplification can be investigated in the case of the well matching simulations a1 3 and u3 1 by reducing the aperture distribution to the mean aperture a significant deviation in the tailing at c c 0 1e 2 can be observed the tailing is less pronounced and smoother compared to the initial model approach black line for the less matching two cases a3 3 and u3 1 this deviation appears already at c c 0 1e 1 accompanied by a distinct reduction of the secondary peak thus the secondary peaks for both fractures are caused by the implemented aperture distribution and are not attributed to the model geometry however for a3 3 a new shoulder forms after 4000 s which resembles the shoulder after 4000 s in a3 1 and a3 2 fig 8 in the case of the altered core this shoulder is clearly an artifact derived by the fracture geometry more exactly by the bottleneck feature already described in the case of the unaltered core u3 1 and u1 1 the high impact of aperture distribution on the modeling can be seen when comparing the btc of the initial model approach black line with the btc applying the mean aperture alternating dotted and dashed blue marking this impact is less intense for the altered fracture due to the low number of asperity contacts in the unaltered core only a minor deviation can be seen with a further simplification of the model since both curves are nearly congruent alternating dotted blue and dashed green marking this deviation is larger in the case of the altered core due to the high number of asperity contacts furthermore the deviation towards the next simplification the reduction to a rectangular parallel plate is again more pronounced in the altered fracture simulations those observations lead to the conclusion that the flow through the altered core is governed by the fracture geometry and to a minor extent by the aperture distribution however the flow through the unaltered core clearly shows to be more influenced by its aperture distribution since the mean aperture is more than two times bigger and the fracture geometry is quite homogeneous lacking any major asperity contacts with each reduction there are i adjustments in the applied flow velocity ii less pronounced tailings and iii time shifts in the first arrival to longer travel times despite some observed deviations especially in the case of the unaltered fracture the utilization of the aperture distribution resulting in the 2 5 d model approach presented shows the best matching results the parallel plate approaches cannot reproduce the observed tailings as well as the model approach containing the aperture distribution however alongside with this model approach the next best result is archived by reducing the aperture distribution to the mean aperture while keeping the asperity contacts and the fracture geometry in the x y plane additionally with the help of the matrix diffusion model which can be found in the supporting information fig si 8c it can be proved independently that the obtained btcs in the experiments are attributed to the complex spatial heterogeneities since the matrix diffusion models fail to describe the experimental btcs moreover using a double logarithmic scale for presenting the breakthrough curves it can be shown that the declining limbs of the btcs are significant steeper than they would be under the influence of matrix diffusion where a power law slope of 1 5 is often referred to carrera et al 1998 see figs si 5a and si 5b thus a significant influence of matrix diffusion on the solute transport can be excluded under the given experimental setting 4 summary and conclusions in this work the impact of fracture geometry in the x y plane and of aperture distribution on solute transport was investigated on two differently altered fractured granitic drill cores by scanning the drill cores using μ ct the internal structures of the fractures are accessible showing the altered fracture to be more complex in geometry with a smaller mean aperture compared to the unaltered one in contrast the unaltered fracture showed to have a geometry with a minor number of asperity contacts and a larger mean aperture the obtained μ ct data served as input for 2 5 d flow and transport models of both fractures with the help of three injection and three extraction spots for each fracture different dipole flow fields were induced the solute transport through both fractures could be qualitatively and partly quantitatively predicted based on the 2 5 d modeling approach already by comparing the experimental data from the altered and the unaltered fracture the btcs of the transport experiments through the altered fracture were less homogenous compared to the ones through the unaltered fracture which confirmed the tomographic imaging in the case of the altered fracture there was good agreement between modelled and experimental btcs we concluded that fluid flow through this fracture was overall dominated by the complex fracture geometry in the x y plane e g the high number of contact points this has been proven by model simplifications the btcs for the different experimental cases through the unaltered fracture showed less deviation but a wider spreading between each other the large aperture might decrease the impact of fracture wall interaction and the fully open fracture might be the reason for the uniformity of the btcs the modelled btcs showed to be more irregular compared to the experimental ones with an overestimation in the tailing region we concluded that the fluid flow in this fracture was majorly influenced by the aperture distribution and less by the fracture geometry in the x y plane by simplifying the models we could qualitatively show that the congruency of the modelled solute transport with the experimental data decreases the decrease in complexity resulted in less pronounced and more even formed tailings of the derived btcs without the occurrence of secondary peaks it was obvious that the formation of the secondary peaks in the model btcs was affiliated to the implemented aperture distribution we conclude that the fluid flow and the mass transport in both fractures showed clear differences the fracture geometry and the aperture distribution are needed to describe precisely fluid flow and mass transport to understand mechanisms prevailing in natural rough fractures which feature asperity contacts or aperture distribution dominates surely depends on the investigated fracture moreover we showed the importance of tomographic imaging for the generation of 3 d and 2 d numeric models despite the simplification from a fully 3 d to a 2 5 d model the presented results provide a step forward in understanding and

1604,the impact of fracture geometry and aperture distribution on fluid movement and on non reactive solute transport was investigated experimentally and numerically in single fractures for this purpose a hydrothermally altered and an unaltered granite drill core with axial fractures were investigated using three injection and three extraction locations at top and bottom of the fractured cores different dipole flow fields were examined the conservative tracer amino g breakthrough curves were measured using fluorescence spectroscopy based on 3 d digital data obtained by micro computed tomography 2 5 d numerical models were generated for both fractures by mapping the measured aperture distributions to the 2 d fracture geometries x y plane fluid flow and tracer transport were simulated using comsol multiphysics by means of numerical simulations and tomographic imaging experimentally observed breakthrough curves can be understood and qualitatively reproduced the experiments and simulations suggest that fluid flow in the altered fracture is governed by the 2 d fracture geometry in the x y plane while fluid flow in the unaltered fracture seems to be controlled by the aperture distribution moreover we demonstrate that in our case simplified parallel plate models fail to describe the experimental findings and that pronounced tailings can be attributed to complex internal heterogeneities the results presented implicate the necessity to incorporate complex domain geometries governing fluid flow and mass transport into transport modeling keywords natural fracture geometry solute transport experiments micro computed tomography numerical simulation 1 introduction fractures or shear zones are dominant structures for fluid flow and mass transport in crystalline rock of low or negligible matrix permeability a full comprehension and prediction of fluid flow and coupled mass transport is of paramount importance for many applications of geoengineering ranging from low flow rates as expected in the nuclear waste disposal far field geckeis et al 2004 vilks and bachinski 1996 to high flow rates e g in geothermal systems schill et al 2017 in this respect the quantification of fluid flow in fractures is crucial and was extensively studied for decades bodin et al 2003 brown 1987 sahimi 2011 tsang 1984 witherspoon et al 1980 zimmerman et al 2004 in general mass solute and particulate transport through fractured media is accompanied by hydrodynamic dispersion roux et al 1998 including i taylor dispersion due to the parabolic velocity profile induced by friction between two no slip fracture walls ii macrodispersion due to spatial heterogeneities resulting in flow channeling bodin et al 2003 and iii molecular diffusion due to a developing concentration gradient natural rock fractures possess complex geometries with rough and irregular fracture surfaces asperities highly variable aperture distributions and contact areas asperity contacts of different sizes between the opposite surfaces brown et al 1998 durham et al 2001 hakami and larsson 1996 fracture and fracture network solute transport is directly affected by spatial heterogeneities inducing complex flow fields flow channeling is a typical fracture flow feature which is provoked by strongly pronounced aperture distribution variabilities resulting in preferential flow paths of lower hydraulic resistance bodin et al 2003 huber et al 2012 keller et al 1999 moreno et al 1988 neretnieks et al 1982 tsang and neretnieks 1998 with respect to the entire fracture elevated flow velocities prevail in those regions brown et al 1998 in close proximity to these channels depending on the geometry and given hydraulics there are often hardly accessible areas for the main flow low flow zones where features like recirculation zones may form boutt et al 2006 solutes or particles may reach those areas by hydrodynamic dispersion and or molecular diffusion the increased residence time of solutes and colloids and therefore increased time scales for chemical and physical interaction with the fracture surface may then lead to higher retardation and retention e g sorption kinetics reduction kinetics or matrix diffusion in consequence the residence time distributions in systems described above show much more pronounced tailings numerous analytical and numerical approaches are postulated to describe mass transport in single fractures and fracture networks a very simplified and elementary model of a single fracture is a smooth parallel plate simplification with a constant aperture louis 1969 oda 1986 parsons 1966 snow 1965 in this case the hydraulic fracture conductivity volumetric flow is a cubic function of the aperture snow 1965 witherspoon et al 1980 neglecting rough fracture surfaces and tortuous flow paths these geometrically simplified models cannot describe the flow dynamics brown 1987 sisavath et al 2003 and overestimate fracture flow rates konzuk and kueper 2004 nicholl et al 1999 consequently this parallel plate approach is rather applicable for smooth and wide fractures in order to simulate precisely the fluid flow in rough and heterogeneous fracture geometries complex equations such as the non linear navier stokes equations are used which fully describes the motion of newtonian fluids in a continuum media batchelor 1967 wilkes and bike 1999 since high computational and numerical efforts are necessary to solve the navier stokes equations numerous simplified assumption e g the local cubic law zimmerman and yeo 2000 or the stokes equation zimmerman et al 1991 are often applied to describe the fluid flow in fractured media but such simplifications are only valid under certain criteria and requirements which require an explicit knowledge of acceptable limitations which are not always easy to determine brush and thomson 2003 the isolated impact of fracture geometry and aperture distribution is less well investigated and a distinction between the contribution of hydrodynamic dispersion and diffusion to low velocity zones is challenging cardenas et al 2007 due to this lack of information tailing effects in the residence time distribution are often attributed to reactive interaction with the fracture surface or to matrix diffusion however effects of fracture geometry and hydrodynamic condition were found to be of influence and even more important with increasing reynolds number e g in 2 d numerical modeling of fluid flow and mass transport in a ct scanned fracture cardenas et al 2007 here velocity contrasts are generated by geometry triggered features like eddies boutt et al 2006 inferred the trapping of colloids in intra fracture recirculation zones from 2 d numerical simulations for an aperture of 3 5 mm with the upper fracture surface being rough while the lower side was considered flat 3 d models indicated that flow heterogeneity and additional dispersion are generated by asperity contacts and surface roughness even for small reynolds numbers re 0 001 zou et al 2017 however direct comparison of experimental data and numerical simulations of the same setting e g huber et al 2012 tenchine and gouze 2005 are rare which creates a lack in benchmarking of these numerical simulations a crucial step to tackle this is high resolution scanning of the fracture geometry in particular for laboratory experiments tomographic methods such as computed tomography μ ct represents a non destructive way to image the internal often complex structure of fractured media keller 1998 and can be implemented in 2 d or 3 d numerical models huber et al 2012 petchsingto and karpyn 2009 due to the lack of direct comparison in the present study we investigate the impact of fracture geometry in the x y plane and of aperture distribution on solute transport experimentally and numerically for this purpose a hydrothermally altered and an unaltered natural granitic fracture were utilized due to the alteration process the surface and fracture features e g roughness and aperture distribution were expected to differ significantly between both drill cores sausse 2002 in order to induce different dipole flow fields and to investigate the impact of spatially variable apertures on flow and solute transport the injection and extraction locations of the conservative fluorescent solute tracer amino g were systematically varied for two flow rates 24 or 12 ml h μ ct scans of both fractures provided the basis for 2 5 d numerical models on fluid flow and solute transport to which the experimental results were compared here the term 2 5 d describes a 2 d model geometry in the x y plane which was extended by the aperture distribution in z direction via the mapping of an interpolation function to the 2 d geometry therefore the aperture distribution was not part of the geometry itself rather it was considered hydrodynamically by resistance forces in the fluid flow simulation moreover an additional model including matrix diffusion was generated to investigate any matrix diffusion effects on the residence time behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 fractured drill core samples and flow cell preparation both fractures were sampled from drill cores of the well eps 1 at the enhanced geothermal system egs reference site at soultz sous forêts france which is located about 70 km north of strasbourg at the nne ssw trending western boundary of upper rhine graben at soultz sous forêts three naturally fractured granitic reservoirs with permeabilities of about 3e 17 to 3e 16 m2 schill et al 2017 and locally up to 3e 14 m2 kohl et al 1997 occur underneath the cenozoic and mesozoic sedimentary cover below 1400 m depth the paleozoic granitic basement is characterized by a grey porphyritic monzogranite down to about 4000 4500 m where it is penetrated by grey fine grained two mica granite hydrothermal alteration occurring mainly on fracture surfaces via natural fluid circulation within the reservoir resulted in secondary phase formation such as clays illite smectite tosudite calcite secondary quartz and sulfide genter et al 2009 genter et al 2003 two granite drill cores of diameters of 78 0 0 4 mm were selected while one drill core showed a distinct hydrothermal alteration the second one was macroscopically unaltered care was taken that only sections with single axial fractures were chosen the hydrothermal porphyroid red granite sample length l 93 4 0 3 mm with moderate to high alteration was extracted from 1462 m depth the standard porphyroid granite sample l 92 9 0 3 mm with a minor pervasive alteration was taken from 1957 m depth genter and traineau 1991 further details are summarized in the supporting information si 1 prior to emplacing the granite fractures in acrylic glass tubes polymethyl methacrylate pmma trademark plexiglas the two fracture sides were cleaned to remove loose particles debris and dust using compressed air in the next step the sutures at the long sides of the cores were sealed using two component glue uhu epoxy adhesives 2 component care was taken to prevent as much as possible the intrusion of the resin into the fracture by always placing the core side upside down during the application of several thin layers of glue the sealing of the opposite open core side was done after the glue has been hardened completely on the first side this sealing procedure minimizes any unwanted intrusion of the bedding material acrylic glass glue into the fracture while preparing the flow cell the sealed core was emplaced inside an acrylic glass cylinder and the remaining space between the cylindrical sides of the core and the internal surface of the cylinder was filled up with acrylic glass glue two endcaps with three inlets outlets each were assembled at the open sides both top and bottom of the fracture fig 1a b between the fracture inlet outlet and the cap a 1 mm thick elastic plastic foil mipolan was placed to keep the fracture flow cell leak proof to minimize any artificial dispersion the tubing was placed directly above the fracture 2 2 fracture characterization and model generation to study the impact of fracture geometry and aperture distribution both fractures were characterized by μ ct μ ct delivers detailed information on the fracture geometry and aperture distribution under μm resolution specific analyses of the granite rock porosity were not undertaken 2 2 1 μ ct measurement and fracture segmentation routine the μ ct measurements were carried out at the federal institute for materials research and testing bam berlin after emplacing the fractures in acrylic glass setups the granite cores were scanned with a ge xs 300 device dxr 250 2 k detector general electric usa with following scan parameters 280 kv 90 μa 0 5 mm cu pre filter 3000 angel steps by 360 rotation the reconstructed voxel dimension is 60 8 μm with the whole sample in the field of view the raw data quality is high but contains medium beam hardening effects based on the μ ct datasets of both drill cores 3 d digital models for both fractures were generated using segmentation routines to get segmentable binary structural spatial data of the fracture within the sample it was necessary to remove beam hardening effects and noise this was done by a specially developed method for details see jovanović et al 2013 khan et al 2015 low noise removal was done with a 3 d non local means filter buades et al 2005 implemented in the geodict software package geometric models and predictions of properties geodict 2015 after correction of the reconstructed raw data 2 k 16bit datasets the fracture was segmented by watershed thresholding segmentation procedure using the 3 d software avizo fei visualization sciences group france 2 2 2 model preprocessing the segmented 3 d fracture geometry from avizo was exported in the standard triangulation language format short stl without any mesh error correction errors like e g overlapping triangles low quality triangles etc for further preprocessing due to the resulting voxel size of 60 μm parts smaller than the resolution are not interpreted as part of the open fracture space and are therefore not exported as geometry the low μ ct scan resolution in relation to the spatial fracture aperture dimensions resulted in erroneous segments in the uncorrected stl mesh e g flat elements without an extension in z direction and torn patches using the finite element pre processor hypermesh hyperworks altair engineering usa an envelope around the fracture geometry was generated using the built in shrinkwrap meshing option yielding a watertight error free and closed triangular surface mesh around the 3 d body the shrinkwrap option artificially inflated the original geometry and thus the aperture distribution depending on the maximum element size chosen in the meshing algorithm this compromise had to be taken to obtain the necessary watertight surface mesh without altering the natural geometry substantially moreover the resulting fracture geometry and surface roughness of the watertight mesh was smoothed slightly by this procedure this watertight stl mesh was further remeshed to improve element quality and remove any leftover mesh errors with the help of the software 3 matic research 11 0 materialise mimics innovation suite 19 0 belgium with the aforementioned steps complete error free triangulated 3 d models with inlet and outlet of both cores were obtained the experimental tubing locations for inducing different dipole flow fields are implicitly included in the 3 d model by placing cylinders of 0 75 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length at their respective positions at the fracture model inlets outlets this was done to establish a fully developed flow profile before entering the fracture while keeping an isolated injection point into the fracture these 3 d models served as the base for the creation of the 2 5 d models used in the numerical simulations to obtain the aperture distribution and the 2 d model geometry in the x y plane a fracture midplane was created which is located precisely in the middle of both main fracture planes by automatically calculating the distance between the main fracture planes on each node of the triangular mesh the aperture distribution was obtained within 3 matic the midplane was geometrically transformed from 3 d to 2 d by projection onto the x y plane the 2 d midplane was imported afterwards into comsol multiphysics comsol ab stockholm sweden comsol 2017 for the numerical model generation and simulation setup in order to compensate the artificial increase of the aperture distribution by the shrink wrapping step explained above the mean aperture of the original uncorrected stl mesh from avizo was compared to the mean aperture of the stl mesh after the shrink wrapping yielding the factor to scale down the aperture values consequently the aperture distribution used in comsol had the same mean aperture value as determined by μ ct the aperture values of the tubing remained unaffected since for this study the aperture distribution was considered hydrodynamically in the modeling its implementation in comsol is explained in detail in the governing equations and boundary conditions section section 2 2 4 we are aware that those corrections and error minimizing steps which were essential to obtain functional models may lead to a loss of geometric information of the μ ct dataset e g unavoidable smoothing of edges however we disbelieve that those important steps changed the fracture geometry and aperture distribution fundamentally therefore decisive changes or consequences due to those steps are not assumed 2 2 3 characterized fractures 2 2 3 1 altered fracture fig 2 shows the aperture distribution mapped to the fracture geometry the altered fracture model is featured by a highly complex geometry with irregular boundaries and heterogeneously distributed asperity contacts the width of the altered fracture model varies between 66 0 0 1 and 76 7 0 1 mm and the length is 87 3 0 1 mm without the cylinders inlet and outlet tubes the model shows to be 6 mm shorter compared to the total fracture length this is most likely attributed to the μ ct measurement procedure within the given resolution of 60 μm both fracture sides are touching each other at some areas in the model those touching areas are hydraulically unavailable because all apertures smaller than 60 μm are interpreted as nonexistent however a possible presence of apertures smaller than the resolution cannot be excluded the irregular shape of the fracture borders is maybe partly an artifact of the utilized glue in order to seal the fracture along its sides as expected the aperture field shows a heterogeneous distribution with apertures from 0 theoretically calculated to 1 013 mm with a mean aperture of 0 162 mm fig 3 the major amount of the aperture values 66 is between 0 075 and 0 175 mm 24 bigger and 10 smaller the total void volume of the fracture is 0 9 ml area and volume were evaluated by surface integration of the geometry and the aperture data respectively using the height height function plawsky et al 2008 the correlation length λ was calculated to be 3 58 0 30 mm this results in a λ l ratio of 0 04 with l being the characteristic flow length here length of drill core therefore after the studies of e g guo et al 2016 or tsang and neretnieks 1998 local fluid flow channels may occur but might not have a significant impact on the fluid flow all data are summarized in table 1 2 2 3 2 unaltered fracture the geometry of the unaltered fracture is less complex compared to the altered one see fig 2 in addition the number of contact areas is less abundant and the sizes are significantly smaller the spatial dimensions are 91 8 0 1 mm in length and between 64 0 0 1 mm and 74 0 0 1 mm in width this is a deviation to the original fracture of 1 1 mm in length the 3 d model shows a step in the lower part of fracture at the right side above the right inlet see red ellipse in the supporting information fig si 2a this geometrical feature cannot be resolved in the 2 d model due to the missing z dimension in contrast to the altered fracture the mean aperture is more than two times bigger with a value of 0 357 mm 79 of all apertures are between 0 255 and 0 435 mm 11 bigger and 10 smaller fig 3 consequently the total void volume of the fracture is with 2 2 ml more than twice as high as already mentioned for the altered fracture channeling might not have a significant impact of the fluid flow since the correlation length is 4 77 0 30 mm resulting in a λ l ratio of 0 05 fracture properties are summarized in table 1 2 2 4 governing equations and boundary conditions flow and transport modeling was performed using version 5 2a of the finite element code comsol multiphysics modeling software since there was already the compromise in simulating in 2 5 d instead of 3 d and since acceptable limitations to use simplified model approaches are not easy to determine focus was laid on a highly accurate simulation of the flow which justifies the application of the navier stokes equations in comsol the navier stokes equations were solved using the laminar flow module in which steady state laminar flow of an incompressible single phase newtonian fluid of constant viscosity is expressed by two equations in vector form i the momentum balance equation 1 ρ u u pi η u u t f ii the continuity equation 2 ρ u 0 where ρ kg m3 denotes the fluid density u m s the fluid velocity vector p pa the fluid pressure i the identity matrix η kg ms the fluid dynamic viscosity and f kg m2s2 the body force term applied to the fluid given the large number of experiments due to the change of the inlet and outlet locations and considering necessary computational times simulating the highly complex geometrical structures in 3 d in this study a 2 5 d simulation approach was applied despite the reduction in dimensionality from 3 d to 2 d and thus a loss in geometric information the model approach used in this work still tried to incorporate as much as possible geometric information from the μ ct datasets fractures possess extreme gradients in spatial scales with apertures much smaller μm to mm scale than the fracture length and width cm to m scale a navier stokes flow model in the x y plane perpendicular to the fracture z direction aperture distribution fails to describe the flow correctly if it assumes a unit height in z direction e g default 1 m in many flow solvers which is orders of magnitude larger than the actual fracture height this is because the impact of the boundaries top and bottom wall perpendicular to the flow direction is not considered appropriately in such approaches therefore in this study in order to model in 2 d and to consider the impact of the fracture aperture on the fluid flow the navier stokes equations with the so called shallow channel approximation available in comsol were applied bruus 2007 this approximation adds an additional resistance term eq 3 to the momentum equation of the navier stokes equations representing the influence of the aperture a m this term introduces the resistance of the top and bottom wall to the fluid flow 3 f sca 12 ηu a z 2 where f sca kg m2s2 is the resistance force the measured and re calculated as mentioned above aperture distribution was imported into comsol to be used as a variable a in an interpolation function a x y which is applied in the shallow channel approximation the interpolation function maps the aperture distribution onto the 2 d fracture geometry fig 2 the shallow channel approximation shows similarities to the local cubic law brush and thomson 2003 since both are vertical averaged fluid flow descriptions but the shallow channel approximation considers explicitly the shear forces by variabilities of ux and uy and inertia terms although the resulting model incorporated the aperture distribution the full geometrical information in z direction was still lacking e g the tortuosity perpendicular to the flow direction nevertheless the use of the aperture distribution measured by μ ct in the 2 d model was clearly more realistic compared to models using a simple mean aperture a normal inflow velocity boundary condition was applied at the inlet and a pressure boundary condition prescribed gauge pressure 0 pa suppress backflow at the outlet the applied velocity was calculated based on the tubing radius and applied mass flow 24 ml h or 12 ml h in the experiments which results in a flow velocity of 0 015 or 0 0075 m s in the modeling and the experiments the injection was always at the bottom the fracture walls were treated as no slip boundary conditions which specify the velocity at the walls as zero u 0 using the dimensionless reynolds number re the fluid dynamics of the flow in the fracture eq 4 and in the inlet and outlet pipes eq 5 are characterized as 4 re u l v or 5 re q d v a where l m is the characteristic length here the arithmetic mean of the aperture ν m2 s the kinematic viscosity q m3 s the volumetric flow rate d m the inner diameter of the pipe and a m the pipe s cross sectional area fluid flow through a narrow rough fracture can be classified as laminar when re 100 for re 100 a turbulent hydraulic flow regime prevails kohl et al 1997 the stationary flow field was used in the transient solute transport simulation by a one way coupling approach for solving the solute transport the time dependent convection diffusion equation was used 6 c t d c u c 0 where c kg m3 is the total concentration t s is the time d m2 s is the diffusion coefficient and u m s2 is the mass species velocity the dimensionless péclet number pe describes the ratio between molecular diffusion and convection on the solute transport pe is defined as 7 pe u l d where u m s is the mean flow velocity l m indicates the characteristic length which is in fractures generally equal to the mean aperture in the case of pe 1 convection dominates however for pe 1 the solute transport is mainly controlled by diffusion the tracer was introduced at the inlet of the model using the experimental injection function as described below by using the experimental injection function as model input mixing and dilution effects in the experimental setup before the fracture were implicitly incorporated however possible dispersion after the fracture cannot be considered in the simulation as it was considered before the fracture before tracer injection the initial tracer concentration in the fracture was c 0 the numerical mesh used consists of purely triangular elements a part of the mesh is depicted in the supporting information fig si 3 the mesh was created in an adapted way with a finer mesh resolution near the model boundaries the mesh was refined until a mesh independent solution of the flow field was achieved 1 deviation between two refined model simulations was deemed sufficient in parallel it was assured that the mesh had at least twice the number of elements than the number of aperture values imported to avoid numerical instabilities of the interpolation function in areas of high aperture value gradients the direct solver pardiso parallel sparse direct solver was chosen for flow and solute transport calculations with a relative tolerance of 1e 8 for the flow and 1e 6 for the transport respectively in order to obtain the btcs a boundary probe which defines the location of the concentration measurement over time was applied at the respective outlet the time steps were taken automatically by the solver to reach convergence in dependence on the set tolerance the simulation time was chosen long enough for each model btc to reach at least c c 0 of 1e 4 in the btc tailing in addition in order to

time dependent measurements at a constant wavelength excitation wavelength λ ex 350 nm and emission wavelength λ em 445 nm of amino g were acquired using bl studio software time drive the data interval was set to δt 3 s the eluate was collected and weighed at the outlet of the setup after passing the fluorescence detection spectroscopy to assure constant flow rate and ph the initial mean concentration c 0 was determined by injecting the tracer solution directly into the flow through cuvette using a syringe before and after every experiment in the transport experiments a tracer volume of 4 ml was injected at constant flow rates of 24 or 12 ml h which resulted in tracer injection durations of 10 or 20 min respectively after injecting the tracer pulse the flow was switched to tracer free background electrolyte keeping the set flow rate until the initial background level was reached a linear calibration curve was applied to convert the fluorescence intensity into concentration it was assumed that the comparably high flow velocities used in the experiments compensated possible pulsation effect generated from the peristaltic pump in order to obtain solely the experimental injection function as input for the numerical model and to quantify the dead volume of the setup before signal detection the fracture flow cell was removed from the setup and tracer experiments as described above with a tracer pulse of 4 ml were performed to be more precise the tracer was injected with either 24 or 12 ml h into the experimental setup and the time between start of the injection and first detection by the fluorescence spectrometer was converted to the dead volume of the tubing in the experimental setup the dead volume of the setup before signal detection has been quantified to be 610 40 μl the resulting btcs for the two different flow rates chosen were later directly applied as injection functions in the numerical modeling to implicitly include any artificial dispersion caused by the experimental setup in order to correct the experimental and numerical breakthrough curves for the dead volume the breakthrough curve s base line before the inclining limb was shortened by the quantified dead volume thus the whole btcs were shifted to smaller times 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluid flow modeling the modelled flow regimes in both fractures with the flow rate of 24 ml h are depicted in figs 5 and 6 the displayed color range indicates high flow velocities in red and low flow velocities in blue the highest flow velocities predominate in the inlet and outlet tubes which is due to the small cross section area of the tubing compared to the bigger cross section area of the fracture for better visibility of the flow field the color range is limited to flow velocities between 0 and 1e 3 m s the maximum flow velocities are depicted on the right side of the upright arrows numbers at top and bottom of the images depict the numbering of the inlets and outlets for each fracture in order to describe the respective inlet and outlet combinations the numbers of inlet and outlet are separated by a hyphen within the text in order to distinguish the fractures an a for altered or a u for unaltered are placed in front when using for example the combination inlet 1 and outlet 1 of the altered fracture this results in the text in a1 1 and in figures mentioning the fracture in 1 1 the morphologic complexity of both fractures clearly affects the flow fields the flow field in the altered core is strongly influenced by the fracture geometry fig 5 in particular by the numerous asperity contacts in the case of the middle inlet position the flow is forced to move to the left side and pass a bottleneck between two asperity contacts which results in high flow velocities in this area the same applies to the left inlet fluid flow induced through the right inlet however is limited at the left side by a large contact area and thus the flow is forced to the right fracture boundary there are regions in the upper half of the fracture where the flow velocity increases again the impact of the applied dipole flow field becomes especially obvious in the inlet outlet combinations at the long boundaries of the fracture a1 1 and a3 3 one half of the fracture is dominated by high flow velocities while the flow velocities in the other half of the fracture remain very low the difference is most striking in the case of a3 3 in the cases a3 1 a3 2 and a3 3 the region beneath in front of the bottleneck is most likely only accessible for the solutes by diffusion the same applies to the corner areas of the fracture in contrast to the altered fracture the flow in the unaltered fracture shows to have less flow velocity variations fig 6 because of the fully open fracture the dipole flow field can evolve in its more characteristic shape the flow velocity distribution in the unaltered fracture is obviously more affected by the aperture distribution than by the fracture geometry model derived values over all dipole configurations are averaged in table 3 the mean flow velocity values are directly extracted from the model the mean flow velocity of the altered core is higher compared to the unaltered one which can be explained by the different mean apertures and the total volumes of both fractures as mentioned above the reynolds numbers for those flow rates are in the range of laminar flow and the mean péclet number shows clearly advection controlled systems a table of the flow velocities and reynolds numbers for each case can be found in the supporting information si 4 with table si 4a and table si 4b 3 2 solute transport experiments and modeling the variation of injection and extraction location with three inlets and outlets for each fracture results in nine separate experimental cases before investigating the experimental and model results in detail all experimental results are solely shown in fig 7 for both flow rates per fracture in all cases the tracer is recovered quantitatively 98 2 within the uncertainties given the btcs of the altered fracture are more irregular and broader compared to the btcs of the unaltered fracture however except a1 1 a2 3 and a3 3 the variations between the different btcs are quite narrow in contrast a bigger spreading is visible within the btcs of the unaltered fracture and the overall maximum c c 0 is slightly higher max c c 0 0 94 3 2 1 altered fracture generally speaking a good agreement can be seen by comparing the corresponding experimental and model btcs fig 8 in the cases of a1 2 a1 3 a2 2 and a2 3 the tailing is well described by the model however the modelled btcs show to be more pronounced for the extraction out of outlet 1 a1 1 a2 1 the injection through inlet 3 results in the simulations in more irregular shaped tailings and the formation of secondary peaks or shoulders a3 1 and a3 2 shoulder after 4000 s 24 ml h and 8000 s 12 ml h a3 3 secondary peak after 2000 s 24 ml h and 4000 s 12 ml h those peaks indicate additional flow paths in the fracture e g due to an increase in residence time of the tracer caused by diffusion dispersion processes in the bottleneck area see figs 2 and 5 information on the secondary peak formation and images of the solute transport simulation for two examples are provided in the supporting information fig si 6a since a dispersion in the tubing after the fracture was not considered in the simulation dispersion and mixing in this short kept tubing section might explain the absence of a secondary peak in the experimental btc tailing the modelled btcs from inlet 1 and inlet 2 are nearly congruent when extracting through the same outlet this might be due to the wide area before the bottleneck and the bottleneck itself resulting in nearly identical tracer flow paths for those cases such a clear congruency as seen in the modeling cannot be observed by comparing the respective experimental results see fig 7 there are no obvious differences observed between the obtained btcs with 12 ml h and 24 ml h for one inlet outlet combination experimentally and numerically this can be seen in an additional presentation of the btcs in the supporting information fig si 5a therefore the tracer transport behavior is insensitive to the flow rate within the experimental conditions chosen the quality of correlation of the experimental and the modelled btcs is shown in fig 9 by means of a comparison of the time of the first arrival the time of the peak maximum and the time of 50 recovery symbols of those times which are directly on the line through origin with the slope 1 represent the perfect agreement for the respective time between experiment x axis and model y axis symbols above the line represent an earlier event in the experiment compared to the model and vice versa when the symbol is located below the line the experiments scatter around the line of origin as expected the experiments and models along the long sides of the fracture a1 1 and a3 3 show both the earliest first arrival and in the case of the experiment a3 3 the earliest peak and 50 recovery the time of the first arrival for the majority of simulations is later than in the experiments the travel times follow the geometry of the fracture which means that the shortest way through the fracture leads to faster travel times this explains the fast travel times for a3 3 in this specific case the inlet outlet combination and the geometry of the fracture with a large asperity contact between inlet 2 and inlet 3 cause the highest flow velocities near the right fracture boundary concentrating the tracer cloud in this region moreover this dependence on the geometry results in the irregular shape of the experimental btcs fig 7 the presented btcs fig 8 the snapshots of solute transport fig si 6a and the evaluation of the three defined times t 1st arrival t peak t 50 recovered fig 9 lead to the conclusion that the flow through the altered fracture is well reproduced by the model and is clearly controlled by the complex fracture geometry 3 2 2 unaltered fracture in contrast to the altered fracture there is less agreement between the experimental and the modelled btcs of the unaltered fracture fig 10 the model overestimates the tailing and the first arrival is shifted to longer residence times for the majority of the modelled combinations those observations in the modelled btcs indicate that the fracture is less well described as was the case for the altered fracture in addition both cases along the boundaries of the fracture u1 1 and u3 3 show secondary peaks in the tailing region which are not visible in the experimental btcs this indicates the already mentioned additional dispersion in the tubing after the fracture which was not considered in the simulation in contrast to the modeling results the majority of the experimental btcs shows a less pronounced tailing between c c 0 1e 1 to 1e 3 comparable to the altered fracture experiments there are no obvious differences between the obtained btcs with 12 ml h and 24 ml h which can be seen in an additional presentation of the btcs in the supporting information fig si 5b moreover images of the solute transport simulation are provided in the supporting information for two examples as well fig si 6b the comparison of distinct times of simulation and experiment are shown in fig 11 the major amount of the data points are located above the line of origin which means that the experiments reach the specific times earlier compared to the simulation despite the well described tailing region fig 10 the largest deviation compared to the experimental result shows case u3 1 the simulation represents a significant positive time shift however considering the position of the inlet and outlet the experimental result shows comparable small specific times it might be that the model overestimates the impact of the flow distance through the fracture the fact that all simulations tend to longer residence times in the fracture leads to the conclusion that either the fracture geometry or the fracture aperture distribution or both are not entirely captured by the model by comparing the experimental results with each other see fig 7 and in contrast to the altered fracture experiments there is less variation in the shape and the tailing of the btcs however the variation between the btcs shows a larger spreading both observations might be attributed to the more homogenous fracture the small amount of contact zones and the bigger aperture however the experiments do not follow the excepted travel time based on the position of the inlets and outlets which is not captured in the modeling see for example case u3 1 in fig 10 this deviation might be caused by the missing tortuosity in the 2 5 d model approach 3 3 impact of aperture distribution and geometry additionally to the 2 5 d model results presented above the modeling is extended by performing simulations with decreasing model complexity based on parallel plate models by using the mean fracture aperture value of each fracture see table 1 the purpose of those simulations is i to obtain a reference breakthrough curve without the impact of geometry and aperture distribution and ii to investigate the impact of fracture aperture distribution fracture geometry and asperity contacts therefore three approaches have been made to simplify the actual 2 5 d model 1 real 2 d fracture geometry in the x y plane which includes the asperity contacts 2 real fracture geometry in the x y plane but without asperity contacts creating fully open fractures and 3 a simple parallel plate model with rectangular fracture geometry in x y plane and without asperity contacts in all approaches the interpolation function which implemented the aperture distribution to the 2 d geometry is replaced by the mean aperture value fig si 7 in the supporting information visualizes the different model approaches the different simulations are done for two cases for each fracture one simulation which shows a good agreement with the respective experimental tailing and one simulation that shows distinct deviations e g a secondary peak or pronounced shoulder are chosen in the case of the altered fracture a1 3 and a3 3 are selected and in the case of the unaltered core u1 1 and u3 1 are chosen the 2 5 d simulations with 24 ml h are used for this comparison each change and each decrease in complexity from the initial model alters the fracture volume or the geometry in order to consider this impact the applied flow velocity at the inlet is adjusted in order to obtain the same mean fluid flow velocity in the models maximum deviation of the resulting mean flow velocity is 5e 7 m s the biggest adjustment in the applied velocity at the inlet needs to be done for the rectangular parallel plate model for the altered fracture from 1 5e 2 m s to 2 2e 2 m s fig 12 shows the direct comparison of the four model approaches with the experimental btcs in all examined cases the decrease in complexity of the models results in less pronounced tailings furthermore the first arrival of the tracer is affected by means of a shift to longer travel times which caused an increase in the offset based on the deviation between each model approach the isolated effect of the simplification can be investigated in the case of the well matching simulations a1 3 and u3 1 by reducing the aperture distribution to the mean aperture a significant deviation in the tailing at c c 0 1e 2 can be observed the tailing is less pronounced and smoother compared to the initial model approach black line for the less matching two cases a3 3 and u3 1 this deviation appears already at c c 0 1e 1 accompanied by a distinct reduction of the secondary peak thus the secondary peaks for both fractures are caused by the implemented aperture distribution and are not attributed to the model geometry however for a3 3 a new shoulder forms after 4000 s which resembles the shoulder after 4000 s in a3 1 and a3 2 fig 8 in the case of the altered core this shoulder is clearly an artifact derived by the fracture geometry more exactly by the bottleneck feature already described in the case of the unaltered core u3 1 and u1 1 the high impact of aperture distribution on the modeling can be seen when comparing the btc of the initial model approach black line with the btc applying the mean aperture alternating dotted and dashed blue marking this impact is less intense for the altered fracture due to the low number of asperity contacts in the unaltered core only a minor deviation can be seen with a further simplification of the model since both curves are nearly congruent alternating dotted blue and dashed green marking this deviation is larger in the case of the altered core due to the high number of asperity contacts furthermore the deviation towards the next simplification the reduction to a rectangular parallel plate is again more pronounced in the altered fracture simulations those observations lead to the conclusion that the flow through the altered core is governed by the fracture geometry and to a minor extent by the aperture distribution however the flow through the unaltered core clearly shows to be more influenced by its aperture distribution since the mean aperture is more than two times bigger and the fracture geometry is quite homogeneous lacking any major asperity contacts with each reduction there are i adjustments in the applied flow velocity ii less pronounced tailings and iii time shifts in the first arrival to longer travel times despite some observed deviations especially in the case of the unaltered fracture the utilization of the aperture distribution resulting in the 2 5 d model approach presented shows the best matching results the parallel plate approaches cannot reproduce the observed tailings as well as the model approach containing the aperture distribution however alongside with this model approach the next best result is archived by reducing the aperture distribution to the mean aperture while keeping the asperity contacts and the fracture geometry in the x y plane additionally with the help of the matrix diffusion model which can be found in the supporting information fig si 8c it can be proved independently that the obtained btcs in the experiments are attributed to the complex spatial heterogeneities since the matrix diffusion models fail to describe the experimental btcs moreover using a double logarithmic scale for presenting the breakthrough curves it can be shown that the declining limbs of the btcs are significant steeper than they would be under the influence of matrix diffusion where a power law slope of 1 5 is often referred to carrera et al 1998 see figs si 5a and si 5b thus a significant influence of matrix diffusion on the solute transport can be excluded under the given experimental setting 4 summary and conclusions in this work the impact of fracture geometry in the x y plane and of aperture distribution on solute transport was investigated on two differently altered fractured granitic drill cores by scanning the drill cores using μ ct the internal structures of the fractures are accessible showing the altered fracture to be more complex in geometry with a smaller mean aperture compared to the unaltered one in contrast the unaltered fracture showed to have a geometry with a minor number of asperity contacts and a larger mean aperture the obtained μ ct data served as input for 2 5 d flow and transport models of both fractures with the help of three injection and three extraction spots for each fracture different dipole flow fields were induced the solute transport through both fractures could be qualitatively and partly quantitatively predicted based on the 2 5 d modeling approach already by comparing the experimental data from the altered and the unaltered fracture the btcs of the transport experiments through the altered fracture were less homogenous compared to the ones through the unaltered fracture which confirmed the tomographic imaging in the case of the altered fracture there was good agreement between modelled and experimental btcs we concluded that fluid flow through this fracture was overall dominated by the complex fracture geometry in the x y plane e g the high number of contact points this has been proven by model simplifications the btcs for the different experimental cases through the unaltered fracture showed less deviation but a wider spreading between each other the large aperture might decrease the impact of fracture wall interaction and the fully open fracture might be the reason for the uniformity of the btcs the modelled btcs showed to be more irregular compared to the experimental ones with an overestimation in the tailing region we concluded that the fluid flow in this fracture was majorly influenced by the aperture distribution and less by the fracture geometry in the x y plane by simplifying the models we could qualitatively show that the congruency of the modelled solute transport with the experimental data decreases the decrease in complexity resulted in less pronounced and more even formed tailings of the derived btcs without the occurrence of secondary peaks it was obvious that the formation of the secondary peaks in the model btcs was affiliated to the implemented aperture distribution we conclude that the fluid flow and the mass transport in both fractures showed clear differences the fracture geometry and the aperture distribution are needed to describe precisely fluid flow and mass transport to understand mechanisms prevailing in natural rough fractures which feature asperity contacts or aperture distribution dominates surely depends on the investigated fracture moreover we showed the importance of tomographic imaging for the generation of 3 d and 2 d numeric models despite the simplification from a fully 3 d to a 2 5 d model the presented results provide a step forward in understanding and
