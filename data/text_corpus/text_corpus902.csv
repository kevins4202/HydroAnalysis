4510,northern shaanxi a major coal base in china is facing water scarcity soil erosion and ecological deterioration we chose the kuye and tuwei rivers as the study area in which many underground mining bases have operated in these catchments since the late 1980s the objective of this study was to quantify the anthropogenic impacts of runoff on the main rivers in the mining region first trend analysis and change point detection were used to examine changes in the magnitude of annual runoff then the contributions of precipitation changes and human activities to runoff changes were distinguished linear regression and comparative analysis were used to quantify the extents of human impacts on the runoff in two representative catchments the results showed that the annual runoff in both catchments decreased significantly at the 99 confidence level during 1960 2016 the significant change in the runoff occurred in 1997 in the kuye river kyh catchment because of coal mining while it occurred in 1980 in the tuwei river twh catchment due to soil and water conservation measures the contribution of human activities to the runoff change was estimated to account for 91 and 42 in the kyh catchment and twh catchment respectively whereas climate change accounted for 9 and 58 respectively moreover by reconstructing the time series of runoff we surmise that anthropogenic interventions lead to a decrease in the average annual runoff by 168 344 million m3 in the kyh catchment and 152 million m3 in the twh catchment respectively during the descending period 1997 2016 keywords human activities mining region trend analysis change point 1 introduction human activities have profoundly influenced water resource patterns and water balance around the world jiang et al 2015 many studies have been conducted to study the impacts of different human activities such as urbanization deforestation irrigation water and soil conservation stormwater management and land use change on regional hydrology coe et al 2009 chen et al 2010 du et al 2012 baker and miller 2013 shi et al 2013 bell et al 2016 erban and gorelick 2016 cai et al 2018 among the numerous human activities large scale mining is a major activity that can reshape the underlying surface and hydrogeologic conditions thereby dramatically impacting water resources at local and regional scales qiang et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 research on water resources in mining districts presently concentrates on the quality of surface water or groundwater graupner et al 2014 arkoc et al 2016 buzatu et al 2016 and some environmental impact assessments related to water quantity issues have also been conducted dobson et al 1977 implemented a nationwide assessment of projected water quantity impacts of the national energy plan across america bester vermeulen 2010 carried out a detailed investigation on the hydrogeologic parameters of the different aquifers and pre mining water quantity in the waterberg coalfield south africa and howladar et al 2017 ascertained the intensity of drainage from the barapukuria coal mine over several decades from the perspective of quantitative analysis this study focused on the impacts of human activities especially coal mining on the runoff in mining areas currently coal is the major primary energy source in china accounting for approximately 59 of the total consumption of primary energy in 2018 nbs of china 2019 during the four decades of the chinese economic reform the rapid socio economic development has remarkably boosted energy consumption from 571 million tons of coal equivalent tce in 1978 to 4 64 billion tce in 2018 it is expected that coal will account for 50 of the total primary energy consumption by 2030 and will continue to be a major source of energy in china until at least 2050 chinese academy of engineering cae 2011 meanwhile energy and water resources are closely connected office u s g a et al 2010 scanlon et al 2017 water is used in the entire process of fuel production and power generation such as for coal production and washing as well as coal fired power generation however energy is the necessary foundation of water exploitation and consumption including water utilization and treatment since china has become the largest global producer and consumer of fuels energy safety and water resource security have attracted wide public attention wang et al 2014 bp 2016 china is currently facing a series of nationwide water issues such as limited water resources uneven temporal and spatial distributions and degradation of water quality yu 2011 zheng et al 2016 the major developing industries related to coal mining are highly energy intensive and water consuming which could exacerbate the water crisis of the local environment to satisfy the energy demands of industrial development the nea has proposed that fourteen large scale coal bases be built across china during the period of the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 national energy administration nea 2012 shang et al 2016 fig 1 however most of the coal bases planned by the nea are located in arid or semiarid regions that encounter severe water shortages in 2016 more than half of the raw coal was produced from china s west region an area comprising three large provinces namely shaanxi inner mongolia and gansu the regional per capita water resource only reaches one tenth of the global average notably the shendong coal base and the northern shaanxi coal base are situated in the water scarce area of the northwest inland basin fig 1 therefore gaining insight into the runoff changes of major rivers near large coal mines is of referential significance for the water security issues caused by human activities in inland basins hydrological time series are a sequence of observations of hydrologic characteristics in chronological order and can be characterized by variability and oscillation kottegoda 1980 there is a consensus that variations in long term hydrological time series embody the combined effects of climate change and human activities zhang et al 2012 fischer et al 2017 there are a great number of measured hydrological processes that have been interfered with and are not representative of natural processes therefore the records of annual runoff contain the responses of runoff to both climate change and human activities three main types of methods used to separate hydrological impacts of human activities from climate change or to detect trends and change points table 1 i the statistical technique is commonly used to analyze the trend and abrupt change of hydrological characteristics with simple linear regression capable of establishing a relationship between hydrometeorology and the variable of interest usually runoff and precipitation wu et al 2017 ii elasticity based methods the most widely used of which is the budyko framework utilize the elasticity of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to understand relationships between water balance and climate zhang et al 2008 and iii hydrological models simulate the hydrological cycle through generalizing the physical process in the catchment the statistical analysis of a hydrological series is an effective way to understand the variations of hydrological processes pelletier and turcotte 2015 when the climate and underlying surface conditions remain relatively stable the hydrological sequence is consistent and continuous in the catchment otherwise the hydrological sequence will exhibit nonperiodic components in the form of trends monotonic increases decreases or fluctuations or the change point phenomena leading to a change in consistency and statistical characteristics thus one of the crucial steps in analyzing the driving factors of runoff variation is to determine the trends and identify the change points in hydrological series the objective of this study was to identify the impacts of human activities and climate change on runoff changes of catchments in the coal mining regions of northern shaanxi to obtain more confidence in the detection of trends and abrupt changes various methods were applied to distinguish the contributions of climate change and human activities to the runoff change by calculating the slope change ratio of the cumulative quantity finally simple regression analysis combined with the double mass curve dmc was performed to reconstruct the time series of the runoff under natural conditions and the method of assessing the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity scraq was used to quantitatively analyze the impacts of human activities on the runoff change in a mining region wang et al 2012 compared to a recent study using the hydrological model simhyd pml to estimate the coal mining impacts on runoff in an overlapping catchment luan et al 2020 our research might not explicitly explain such effects in terms of mechanism but relatively dependable results can be obtained through the combination and comparison of various commonly used statistical techniques and quantitative evaluation in the study this work will provide a scientific basis for sustainable coal mining and water resource management in mining areas 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the northern shaanxi region is a major component of the loess plateau fig 2 the region includes yulin city and yanan city withatotallandmassof92500km2 andan elevation range from470 to 1911meters the northern shaanxi region is a loess hilly and gully landform with sparse vegetation loessial soil and dark loessial soil are typical soil types in the study area and are highly erosion prone and permeable zhao et al 2012 2019 thus the region is one of the areas with serious levels of soil erosion and desertification in china zhao et al 2013 moreover the area has an aridandsemiaridtemperatecontinentalmonsoonclimate with average annual precipitation ranging of 400 600 mm and 65 of the precipitationoccursmainlyinthe summer jun to sep li et al 2017 in addition thespatialdistributionofrainfallhasadecreasing gradient fromthesouth to the north the average annual water resources in the northern shaanxi region correspond to 4540 million cubic meters with the surface water groundwater and available water resources accounting for 3620 2900 and 1956 million cubic meters respectively due to the serious water shortage water resources have become a major limiting factor in the local development of the economy and society three primary tributaries of the middle reaches of the yellow river including the kuye river the tuwei river and the wuding river are situated in northern shaanxi the kuye river flows through the shendong mining district which is one of the earliest intensively exploited large coal bases in china and the tuwei river is the major water supply source for the yushen mining area and possesses chemical coal industrial zones compared with the other two catchments the mining scale of the wuding river catchment is relatively small and the mining period is late relevant statistics suggest that the output of raw coal was approximately 6 million tons in 2015 which is much lower than those of the coal mines in other catchments to investigate the impacts of mining activities on runoff the kuye river kyh catchment and tuwei river trh catchment were selected as representatives of the study areas land use change in the study area is presented in table 2 showing that the variation of land use types of the kyh catchment is greater than that of the twh catchment during 1985 2011 notably the area of water bodies and farmland decrease by half while the construction land increased dramatically in the kyh catchment the kyh catchment drains an area of 8706 km2 with a mainstream length of 242 km the kuye river originatesfromthe bading gully in inner mongolia and flows from northwest to southeast into the yellow river the catchment is located in arid and semiarid areas with a fragile ecological environment sparse vegetation and significant soil erosion the upper reaches of the catchment belong mainly to windy and sandy areas while the lower reaches are loess hilly and gully regions the annual average precipitation is 410 mm and the local multiyear average runoff is approximately 558 million cubic meters m3 accounting for 3 5 of the average multiannual runoff of the middle reaches of the yellow river kong et al 2016 in total there are four hydrological stations in the catchment among which the wenjiachuan station is located where the kuye river flowsintotheyellowriver themain sourceofrunoff isprecipitation and its annual change is closely coupled with precipitation coal mining began in the early 1980s in the kyh catchment in the 1980s the average coal mine output was 0 29 million tons by the 1990s the output rose to approximately 5 2 million tons in the first 5 years of the 21st century coal production increased rapidly to 540 million tons fig 3 the shendong coalfield s reserves account for 1 4 ofthetotalreserves inchina and are partly located in the kyh catchment the twh catchment is located in northwest china with a total drainage area of 3294 km2 and a mainstream length of 140 km which originates from shenmucounty and converges with the yellow river the entire watershed is composed of a windy desert area and a hilly area its terrain slopes from the west to the southeast with an average elevation of 1000 1200 m the annual average precipitation is approximately 400 mm and the average annual runoff is 380 million m3 in the watershed fig 4 60 of which occurs from june to august there are two hydrological stations in the twh catchment the gaojiabao station is in the upper and middle reaches and the gaojiachuan station is in the lower reaches in addition there are abundant coal resources in the catchment which are distributed mainly throughout the windy desert area 2 2 data sources in this study the characteristics of runoff variation were analyzed based on the records of annual runoff from the hydrologic yearbook of the yellow river basin during 1960 2016 the precipitation data were derived from daily records that were obtained from hydrological stations within the study region because the stations used in the study are uniformly distributed over the whole catchment fig 2 they can reflect the regional features of the precipitation variability in the study area thus the average precipitation in the basin was calculated by area weighted averaging the data regarding coal production were obtained from local coal related departments and statistical offices such as the bureau of coal work safety of shaanxi province and the yulin provincial bureau of statistics bai 2015 the location of hydrometric stations and the mined out area are summarized in table 3 3 methodology the basic method for separating the impacts of human activities on hydrology is to determine a rational reference period and reconstruct the hydrological time series based on this period thus the choice of reference period is particularly crucial to the reliability of the research subjective judgment and statistical analysis are two commonly used ways in the former an earlier period is selected in which human activities have little influence on the basin as a benchmark based on the relevant literature for example zheng et al 2019 calculated the contribution of human activities to sediment decreases by comparing the water discharge and sediment load during two periods the latter identifies the change point through statistical analysis of a long term hydrological series and the series is then divided into two sections by the change point a pre change period reference period and a post change period descending period statistical analysis is a more scientifically defensible method and has been widely used in earlier studies table 4 thus we chose the latter to ascertain the reference period the computational procedure of the methods used in the study is summarized in appendix a 3 1 trend analysis 3 1 1 mann kendall test the nonparametric mann kendall mk test is widely applied to detect monotonic trends in hydrometeorological time series mann 1945 kendall 1975 however this approach is based on uncorrelated data otherwise the results could be influenced by the persistence of time series zhao et al 2019 to remove the effect of autocorrelation in the mk test the trend free pre whitening tfpw method with sen s slope estimator was employed in this study sen 1968 song et al 2015 the detailed procedure of the mk test can be found in the study of yue et al 2002 moreover the mann kendall sneyers mks rank test is also used to perform trend analysis and change point detection zhang et al 2011 the null hypothesis states that the data are derived from a population with independent realizations and identical distribution the alternative hypothesis states that the data follow a monotonic trend the test statistic is calculated as follows s k i 1 k r i 1 with r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j j 1 2 3 i 2 where r i are the sequential data and the statistic s is approximately normally distributed as follows 3 uf k s k e s k v a r s k with v a r s k k k 1 2 k 5 72 5 e s k k k 1 4 where uf k is the forward sequence and the backward sequence ub k is calculated by repeating the abovementioned process but with the reverse data series when uf k 0 this result indicates that the sequence has a rising trend otherwise the opposite result reflects a decreasing trend if uf k and ub k intersect at a point that does not exceed the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence interval simultaneously the intersection is the position where the mutation occurs otherwise the change point should be detected with other methods 3 1 2 spearman s rho test spearman s rho test is a rank based nonparametric method used for trend analysis in a time series if there is no trend and all observations are independent all rank orderings are equally likely yue et al 2002 therefore it is also applied to verify the absence of trends with uniform power for linear and nonlinear trends shadmani et al 2012 3 2 change point detection 3 2 1 the precipitation runoff double mass curve the dmc is a practical and straightforward method for hydrometeorological series analysis which has been widely applied in previous studies to identify the impacts of human activities gao et al 2017 runoff is primarily affected by climate and human activities when human activities cause little disturbance to a river the runoff changes mainly with the local precipitation the runoff and precipitation gradually accumulate within the same amount of time and two cumulative values of relevant variables are plotted with a horizontal and vertical coordinate in a rectangular coordinate system an inflection point can be used to analyze the phasic variation of the variables 3 2 2 the pettitt test the approach is derived from the mann whitney two sample test which is commonly applied to detect abrupt changes in a hydrological series with continuous data pettitt 1979 because the consistency of the statistical distribution of the data is influenced by the length of the sequence this method is not applicable to the series whose change point at the front and end of the sequence 3 2 3 standard normal homogeneity test the standard normal homogeneity test snht is widely applied in climatic time series analysis for single change point detection in this method it is easier to detect the change point at the beginning and end of the time series whereas the buishand u and the pettitt tests are more sensitive to abrupt changes in the middle of the series toreti et al 2011 3 2 4 lee heghinian method this method is based on the bayesian theory which is suitable for testing sequences with mutations in mean values it is assumed that the population distribution obeys a normal distribution and that the prior distribution of abrupt changes is uniformly distributed lee heghinian 1977 3 3 quantification of the impacts of human activities on water resources 3 3 1 distinguishing the contributions of different factors to runoff change while our research aimed to assess the effects of human activities on regional hydrologic systems the role of climate change should not be ignored before analyzing the impacts of human activities on runoff we applied the method of scraq to preliminarily calculate the contribution rates of climate change and human activities to runoff changes the linear relationships between the cumulative runoff and time and the linear relationship between the cumulative precipitation and time were established and their equations were then divided into two periods based on the change point the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative runoff and time are s rb and s ra for the two periods before and after the change point respectively the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative precipitation and time are s pb and s pa for the two periods before and after the change point respectively the slopes are obtained by the following equations 6 r sr 100 s ra s rb s rb 7 r sp 100 s pa s pb s pb when slope increase when the value of r sr r sp is positive otherwise the slope decreases the contribution rate of climate change to the runoff change c p and the contribution rate of human activities to the runoff change c h can be expressed as follows 8 c p 100 r sp r sr 9 c h 1 c p 4 reference analysis a reference analysis was adopted to estimate the runoff without the intervention of anthropic activities i e restore the runoff series by using the data from neighboring hydrologic stations that have similar conditions to those of the kyh catchment there are certain principles to consider when selecting a reference basin two comparative basins must be in the same climate area and have long term observation data in addition the areas of the two basins should not have too large of a difference using this method the disturbance of climate change on the runoff can be ignored to a certain degree there are two major rivers near the kyh catchment the tuwei river and huangfuchuan river which both converge to the yellow river the runoff of the huangfuchuan river is quite low because it frequently dries up throughout the year in addition to being severely affected by human activities after 1979 wang et al 2012 thus it should not be regarded as a reference basin although some coal mines are active in the twh catchment large scale production only began after 2000 and the output was considerably smaller than that of the kyh catchment moreover the extent of land use change of the twh catchment is less than that of the kyh catchment table 3 the gaojiachuan station was selected as the reference station since it is located where the tuwei river enters the yellow river to further verify the availability and rationality of applying the reference analysis the concept of the hydrologic similarity between two catchments was assessed by the degree of hydrologic similarity proposed by qi et al 2007 in terms of the selection of sub indicators the variables included in studies related to catchment classification were included in the evaluation ali et al 2012 pagliero et al 2019 table 5 the hydrologic condition can be regarded as similar only when the degree of hydrologic similarity between two catchments is greater than 0 6 otherwise a reference analysis cannot be adopted qi et al 2007 10 s i m a i l a r a b i 1 n β i q u i 11 q u i y r y r y s y r where q u i is the degree of hydrologic similarity for the i th index y r is the sub indicator of catchment a y s is the sub indicator of catchment b s i m a i l a r a b is the degree of hydrologic similarity between catchments a and b and β i is the weight of the i th index this study uses the averaging weight to restore the runoff series of the kyh catchment during the period intensively influenced by human activities the following equation can be used 12 q q r k 1 k 2 where q is the multiyear mean annual runoff of a restored catchment for the kyh catchment during the descending period q r is the multiyear mean annual runoff of a reference basin during the reference period k 1 is the ratio between the drainage areas of the kyh catchment and the twh catchment and k 2 is the ratio between the average annual precipitation of two catchments 4 0 1 regression analysis as mentioned above the dmc of precipitation and runoff can reveal whether human activities cause trending changes and abrupt changes in runoff we combined the results from the dmc with other results from the change point detection to divide the runoff series into different stages the reference period was set and linear regression was used to fit the dmc in the reference period based on the regression equation the runoff can be calculated by using precipitation data during the large scale coal mining period of each basin the restored series can be regarded as the runoff under conditions with fewer human disturbances the following equation is used 13 δ w human w h w n 14 η δ w human w n 100 where δ w human is the influence of human activities on the runoff w h are the observations w n is the runoff under natural conditions and η is the magnitude of the impacts of human activities on the runoff 5 results and discussion 5 1 runoff trends and change points in the kyh catchment and kyh catchment the mk statistics of annual runoff in the kyh catchment and twh catchment were 5 29 and 7 66 respectively this result indicates that the runoff of the two basins had a statistically significant downward trend at the 99 confidence level fig 5 shows that the value of uf k had been negative which means that the annual runoff was decreasing in the kyh catchment however this downtrend was not distinct in the 1960s and 1970s and the curve of uf k had been fluctuating until the late 1980s the curve of uf k began to descend continuously once the critical value had been exceeded the tendency change of the runoff in the twh catchment resembles that in the kyh catchment the differencewas that the decline occurred a decade earlier than that in the kyh catchment moreover the decreasing trend in the two catchments was further proven by sen s slope which was 0 11 and 0 05 in the kyh catchment and twh catchment respectively according to spearman s rho test the values of the t statistic were calculated and compared with corresponding critical values at the 1 significance level the values of t for the kyh catchment and twh catchment were 5 01 and 6 47 respectively both of which far exceeded the critical value of 2 66 above all the results from the trend analysis indicate that there was a significant decreasing trend of the runoff during 1960 2016 in both the kyh catchment and twh catchment to implement the change point detection the series of annual runoff was analyzed using the mks rank test dmc pettitt s test snht and lee heghinian method the test statistics of various approaches and change points are presented in table 6 since the intersection point between the two curves exceeded the critical value 2 58 for both basins fig 5 the result of change point detection was not significant and the change point of the runoff series could not be identified by the mks rank test except for the result of the twh catchment from the mks rank test it is obvious that the year of abrupt change obtained from most methods was identical and at the 99 confidence level i e 1997 in the kyh catchment and 1980 in the twh catchment in addition there were two abrupt changes that were detected in the twh catchment by the dmc the dmc slope first dropped sharply after 1976 and further declined after 1997 therefore the two decreases in the dmc slope implied that the level of human activities increased after 1976 and became further enhanced after 1997 given the analysis above the runoff of the kuye river and the tuwei river was continuously decreasing during 1960 2016 the most distinct mutation of the runoff series occurred in 1997 in the kyh catchment and around 1980 in the twh catchment since those approaches have the same mechanism i e to calculate the maximum statistic the annual statistics of each method were plotted to determine whether more potential change points exist fig 7 it is evident that another peak occurred in the late 1990s in the twh catchment while its value was less than that in 1980 to a certain extent soil and water conservation is capable of changing the precipitation infiltration and runoff conditions leading to a decrease in runoff during the period xu 2011 shi et al 2013 large scale conservation measures had been implemented in the twh catchment since the late 1970s and statistics showed that the area affected by soil and water conservation increased from 229 15 km2 in 1979 to 1140 93 km2 in 1996 and accounted for the increase in the drainage area proportion from 7 to 35 1 meanwhile the increased grassland area by conservation measures accounted for the increase in the drainage area proportion from 5 82 in 1979 to 32 58 in 1996 according to the observations from the soil and water conservation experimental station of the yellow river conservancy commission in suide county when the forest coverage was 30 50 and 70 the runoff was reduced by 53 86 and 94 respectively bai 2015 moreover numerous studies have shown that runoff generation significantly decreases with vegetation coverage increase in the soil erosion region of china liu 2014 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016a b the period of vigorously launched soil and water conservation coincided with the time when the runoff mutation occurred in the twh catchment therefore we conjectured that the large scale soil and water conservation measures implemented after 1979 specifically the rapid increases in grassland areas was most likely the main reasons for the abrupt changes in the runoff of the twh catchment coal exploitation in northern shaanxi began in the 1980s and has significantly ramped up since the late 1990s fig 3 the aforementioned results indicated that the runoff had significantly declined since the late 1990s in the kyh catchment which is consistent with the time that extensive regional coal mining was launched furthermore a nonparametric technique spearman s rank correlation coefficient was applied to evaluate the statistical dependence between the annual runoff and coal production we obtained a correlation coefficient of 0 585 p 0 001 for the kyh catchment and 0 232 for the twh catchment p 0 253 suggesting that coal production has a moderate negative correlation with the annual runoff in the kyh catchment and no correlation in the twh catchment the result implies the limited impact of mining activities on the runoff in the twh catchment considering an order of magnitude discrepancy between the coal production of two catchments long term large scale coal mining has a particularly profound impact on the hydrologic responses in mining areas wang et al 2017a 2017b generally the influence of mining on water resources comes mainly from two aspects exploration and production asexploitationincreases undergroundmined outareas gradually expand and even collapse which may enlarge the regional structural fissures in the upper goaf subsurface waters in the fissured bedrock may begin to discharge in the mine pits rather than in the river courses wang et al 2016 meanwhile surface water from channels also flows into the pit along fissures the aforementioned process accelerates theprocessofsurface water conversion topit water leading to a significant reduction in the surface base flow the water level of the underground aquifer is continuously reduced and a depression cone is formed which eventually reducessurface water and lowers the water table in addition coal mining has changed the water holding capacity of surface soil resulting in loose surface soils and widening bare rock areas thereby intensifying soil erosion in mining areas accelerating the trend of land desertification and deteriorating the ecological environment however all the industrial chains of coal bases belong to high water consuming projects specifically the coal chemical industry a coal chemical project with an output of one million tons usually consumes tens of millions of tons of water each year several studies have proven that rivers have frequently dried up and groundwater levels have been declining in areas with significant coal mining li et al 2016 guo et al 2017 hence coal mining is considered one of the main reasons for the reduction in water resources in a mining region moreover the cause may have been the runoff reduction due to the following aspects generally mine development is usually complexly intertwined with other human activities first more than half of the kyh catchment is in shenmu county which is an important water source for yulin city a significant increase in population was observed along with the rapid developments of society and economy in northern shaanxi namely the population increased from 1 2 million to 3 9 million during 1950 2015 this result indicated that water consumption for residential use would also correspondingly increase second the area of water and soil conservation had increased since the 1980s in the kyh catchment which accounted for the increase in the proportion of the area of shenmu county from 18 in 1980 to 42 in 2003 which then remained at approximately 3100 km2 third regional coal exploitation required a corresponding transport infrastructure and other supporting construction large amounts of rock and soil were excavated and accumulated which could aggravate the water loss and soil erosion considering a series of changes brought by mining activities it is believed that the main reason for the decline in runoff is the occurrence of coal mining and human activities from 1997 to 2016 in the kyh catchment 5 2 the impact of mining related human activities on runoff we divided the series of accumulation into two stages namely the reference period 1960 1996 for the kyh catchment 1960 1980 for the twh catchment and the descending period 1997 2016 for the kyh catchment 1981 2016 for the twh catchment and established linear equations for each period as shown in fig 8 a b c d the correlation coefficients of the equations were larger than 0 97 in each stage which illustrates that the fitting degree of the regression model is extremely high the results from eq 8 and 9 reveal that during the descending period climate change and human activities contributed 9 and 91 respectively to the runoff change in the kyh catchment and 58 and 42 to that in the twh catchment these results indicate that the impacts of human activities on runoff were significantly larger compared with the climate impact during the period of large scale coal mining in the kyh catchment and the runoff changes were relatively less affected by human activities in the twh catchment these results were similar to the results from other related studies the results also provide the basis for selecting the reference basin in section 3 4 2 liu et al 2013 guo et al 2014 bai et al 2014 the degree of hydrologic similarity between the two catchments is 0 765 which means that the kyh catchment and the twh catchment are quite similar with respect to the hydrologic condition of watersheds therefore it is reasonable to compare the two catchments with respect to restoration of the runoff of one of the catchments in a post change period based on the results from the abovementioned change point detection the runoff series of the kyh catchment was divided into two stages the reference period 1960 1996 and the descending period 1997 2016 during the reference period the average ratio of the annual runoff between the two hydrologic stations was 1 75 which was close to the ratio of the drainage areas of the two rivers this finding illustrated that restoring the runoff series by the ratio of the drainage areas is relatively reliable the average annual runoff was 406 million m3 in the wenjiachuan station during the descending period which was 168 million m3 on average larger than the annual observations considering that the cumulative coal production in the twh catchment was only approximately 1 5 of the output in the kyh catchment after 2000 the results indicated that the decrease in runoff was caused mainly by intensive coal mining the results of the regression analysis reveal that the impacts of human activities increased in 2000 in the kyh catchment fluctuated approximately 70 and then reached the highest level in 2008 fig 9 in the descending period the annual runoff decreased by an average of 3 44 m3 per year and the magnitude of the impacts was 68 which was higher than the result calculated by the ratio of the basin areas there were two change points in the precipitation runoff dmc of the twh catchment fig 6b based on the above analysis results the runoff series was divided into three parts the period from 1960 to 1975 from 1976 to 1996 and from 1997 to 2016 as mentioned above large scale soil and water conservation projects were launched in the 1970s in the basin and this research focused on the impact of coal mining on the runoff thus to eliminate the influences of soil and water conservation on runoff the reference period and the descending period were set as the periods from 1976 1996 and 1997 2016 respectively the linear regression results indicated that the impacts of human activities on the runoff gradually increased over time during the descending period the annual runoff decreased by an average of 1 52 m3 per year and the magnitude of the impacts was 35 in general the impacts of human activities in the twh catchment were notably lower than those in the kyh catchment however the extents to which the two rivers were influenced had begun to become similar since 2010 which was most likely caused by the further increase in coal production in the twh catchment furthermore to investigate the role of climate change in runoff change the mks rank test was conducted to analyze the trends and determine whether abrupt changes occurred in the precipitation series fig 10 although the uf k and ub k curves intersected both of their points of intersection occurred after 2005 which was much later than the time when an abrupt change had occurred in the runoff in addition the uf k curves generally fluctuated near the critical value of a given confidence level based on the previous conclusions we further inferred that the decreasing trend of runoff was caused by the intensive human activities in the kyh catchment and was a joint result due to human activities and climate change in the twh catchment numerous shallow buried coal fields are distributed across the entire basin and exploit coal seams with large thicknesses during the underground mining process movement and breakage will occur in the overlying strata the fracture zone formed by the destruction of the overlying strata becomes directly linked with the riverbed thereby causing runoff discharge into the goaf and a sharp decrease in the runoff it has been documented that water inflow of nearly twenty large coal mines in the yushen mining area of the northern shaanxi coal base in 2014 reached 101 million m3 and the water inflow in the jinjie coal mine of the shendong base in 2012 was approximately 42 9 million m3 wu et al 2013 in view of the significant impacts of coal mining on regional water resources we are more convinced that the large difference in coal production between the two basins leads to the different contribution rates of human activities to runoff changes 6 conclusion the objective of this study was to quantify the human impacts on the runoff in the coal mining region of northern shaanxi by using various statistical methodologies we identified the trends and change points of the annual runoff of two representative rivers in northern shaanxi over the past several decades the annual runoff levels of the two rivers were significantly reduced during the descending period the main reasons for this decrease were the occurrences of coal mining and soil and water conservation in each basin by calculating the slope change ratio of the cumulative quantity we found that the contribution rates of human activities to the runoff change in the kyh catchment were far higher than those in the twh catchment we also adopted comparative analysis and regression analysis to qualify the impacts of human activities on the runoff the restored series from the comparative analysis showed that the average annual runoff was 406 million m3 in the kyh catchment during the descending period which was 168 million m3 larger than the average of the actual records during the same period the results from the linear regression showed that the annual runoff decreased by averages of 344 million m3 and 152 million m3 per year and the magnitudes of the impacts were 68 and 35 respectively during the descending period in the kyh catchment and twh catchment respectively in general the runoff levels of both rivers changed substantially in recent decades and human activities had a larger effect on the hydrology in the kyh catchment than that in the twh catchment we inferred that the reason for the difference stemmed mainly from the different coal mining scales and intensities in the two basins in the face of future water resource scarcities specifically the reduction in runoff it is essential to propose adaptive management approaches to respond to future uncertainties the latter is important for water resource management moreover an adaptive management approach has large implications for relieving water resource problems caused by the high intensity coal exploitation in similar regions credit authorship contribution statement jinxi song methodology writing original draft funding

4510,northern shaanxi a major coal base in china is facing water scarcity soil erosion and ecological deterioration we chose the kuye and tuwei rivers as the study area in which many underground mining bases have operated in these catchments since the late 1980s the objective of this study was to quantify the anthropogenic impacts of runoff on the main rivers in the mining region first trend analysis and change point detection were used to examine changes in the magnitude of annual runoff then the contributions of precipitation changes and human activities to runoff changes were distinguished linear regression and comparative analysis were used to quantify the extents of human impacts on the runoff in two representative catchments the results showed that the annual runoff in both catchments decreased significantly at the 99 confidence level during 1960 2016 the significant change in the runoff occurred in 1997 in the kuye river kyh catchment because of coal mining while it occurred in 1980 in the tuwei river twh catchment due to soil and water conservation measures the contribution of human activities to the runoff change was estimated to account for 91 and 42 in the kyh catchment and twh catchment respectively whereas climate change accounted for 9 and 58 respectively moreover by reconstructing the time series of runoff we surmise that anthropogenic interventions lead to a decrease in the average annual runoff by 168 344 million m3 in the kyh catchment and 152 million m3 in the twh catchment respectively during the descending period 1997 2016 keywords human

mining is a major activity that can reshape the underlying surface and hydrogeologic conditions thereby dramatically impacting water resources at local and regional scales qiang et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 research on water resources in mining districts presently concentrates on the quality of surface water or groundwater graupner et al 2014 arkoc et al 2016 buzatu et al 2016 and some environmental impact assessments related to water quantity issues have also been conducted dobson et al 1977 implemented a nationwide assessment of projected water quantity impacts of the national energy plan across america bester vermeulen 2010 carried out a detailed investigation on the hydrogeologic parameters of the different aquifers and pre mining water quantity in the waterberg coalfield south africa and howladar et al 2017 ascertained the intensity of drainage from the barapukuria coal mine over several decades from the perspective of quantitative analysis this study focused on the impacts of human activities especially coal mining on the runoff in mining areas currently coal is the major primary energy source in china accounting for approximately 59 of the total consumption of primary energy in 2018 nbs of china 2019 during the four decades of the chinese economic reform the rapid socio economic development has remarkably boosted energy consumption from 571 million tons of coal equivalent tce in 1978 to 4 64 billion tce in 2018 it is expected that coal will account for 50 of the total primary energy consumption by 2030 and will continue to be a major source of energy in china until at least 2050 chinese academy of engineering cae 2011 meanwhile energy and water resources are closely connected office u s g a et al 2010 scanlon et al 2017 water is used in the entire process of fuel production and power generation such as for coal production and washing as well as coal fired power generation however energy is the necessary foundation of water exploitation and consumption including water utilization and treatment since china has become the largest global producer and consumer of fuels energy safety and water resource security have attracted wide public attention wang et al 2014 bp 2016 china is currently facing a series of nationwide water issues such as limited water resources uneven temporal and spatial distributions and degradation of water quality yu 2011 zheng et al 2016 the major developing industries related to coal mining are highly energy intensive and water consuming which could exacerbate the water crisis of the local environment to satisfy the energy demands of industrial development the nea has proposed that fourteen large scale coal bases be built across china during the period of the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 national energy administration nea 2012 shang et al 2016 fig 1 however most of the coal bases planned by the nea are located in arid or semiarid regions that encounter severe water shortages in 2016 more than half of the raw coal was produced from china s west region an area comprising three large provinces namely shaanxi inner mongolia and gansu the regional per capita water resource only reaches one tenth of the global average notably the shendong coal base and the northern shaanxi coal base are situated in the water scarce area of the northwest inland basin fig 1 therefore gaining insight into the runoff changes of major rivers near large coal mines is of referential significance for the water security issues caused by human activities in inland basins hydrological time series are a sequence of observations of hydrologic characteristics in chronological order and can be characterized by variability and oscillation kottegoda 1980 there is a consensus that variations in long term hydrological time series embody the combined effects of climate change and human activities zhang et al 2012 fischer et al 2017 there are a great number of measured hydrological processes that have been interfered with and are not representative of natural processes therefore the records of annual runoff contain the responses of runoff to both climate change and human activities three main types of methods used to separate hydrological impacts of human activities from climate change or to detect trends and change points table 1 i the statistical technique is commonly used to analyze the trend and abrupt change of hydrological characteristics with simple linear regression capable of establishing a relationship between hydrometeorology and the variable of interest usually runoff and precipitation wu et al 2017 ii elasticity based methods the most widely used of which is the budyko framework utilize the elasticity of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to understand relationships between water balance and climate zhang et al 2008 and iii hydrological models simulate the hydrological cycle through generalizing the physical process in the catchment the statistical analysis of a hydrological series is an effective way to understand the variations of hydrological processes pelletier and turcotte 2015 when the climate and underlying surface conditions remain relatively stable the hydrological sequence is consistent and continuous in the catchment otherwise the hydrological sequence will exhibit nonperiodic components in the form of trends monotonic increases decreases or fluctuations or the change point phenomena leading to a change in consistency and statistical characteristics thus one of the crucial steps in analyzing the driving factors of runoff variation is to determine the trends and identify the change points in hydrological series the objective of this study was to identify the impacts of human activities and climate change on runoff changes of catchments in the coal mining regions of northern shaanxi to obtain more confidence in the detection of trends and abrupt changes various methods were applied to distinguish the contributions of climate change and human activities to the runoff change by calculating the slope change ratio of the cumulative quantity finally simple regression analysis combined with the double mass curve dmc was performed to reconstruct the time series of the runoff under natural conditions and the method of assessing the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity scraq was used to quantitatively analyze the impacts of human activities on the runoff change in a mining region wang et al 2012 compared to a recent study using the hydrological model simhyd pml to estimate the coal mining impacts on runoff in an overlapping catchment luan et al 2020 our research might not explicitly explain such effects in terms of mechanism but relatively dependable results can be obtained through the combination and comparison of various commonly used statistical techniques and quantitative evaluation in the study this work will provide a scientific basis for sustainable coal mining and water resource management in mining areas 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the northern shaanxi region is a major component of the loess plateau fig 2 the region includes yulin city and yanan city withatotallandmassof92500km2 andan elevation range from470 to 1911meters the northern shaanxi region is a loess hilly and gully landform with sparse vegetation loessial soil and dark loessial soil are typical soil types in the study area and are highly erosion prone and permeable zhao et al 2012 2019 thus the region is one of the areas with serious levels of soil erosion and desertification in china zhao et al 2013 moreover the area has an aridandsemiaridtemperatecontinentalmonsoonclimate with average annual precipitation ranging of 400 600 mm and 65 of the precipitationoccursmainlyinthe summer jun to sep li et al 2017 in addition thespatialdistributionofrainfallhasadecreasing gradient fromthesouth to the north the average annual water resources in the northern shaanxi region correspond to 4540 million cubic meters with the surface water groundwater and available water resources accounting for 3620 2900 and 1956 million cubic meters respectively due to the serious water shortage water resources have become a major limiting factor in the local development of the economy and society three primary tributaries of the middle reaches of the yellow river including the kuye river the tuwei river and the wuding river are situated in northern shaanxi the kuye river flows through the shendong mining district which is one of the earliest intensively exploited large coal bases in china and the tuwei river is the major water supply source for the yushen mining area and possesses chemical coal industrial zones compared with the other two catchments the mining scale of the wuding river catchment is relatively small and the mining period is late relevant statistics suggest that the output of raw coal was approximately 6 million tons in 2015 which is much lower than those of the coal mines in other catchments to investigate the impacts of mining activities on runoff the kuye river kyh catchment and tuwei river trh catchment were selected as representatives of the study areas land use change in the study area is presented in table 2 showing that the variation of land use types of the kyh catchment is greater than that of the twh catchment during 1985 2011 notably the area of water bodies and farmland decrease by half while the construction land increased dramatically in the kyh catchment the kyh catchment drains an area of 8706 km2 with a mainstream length of 242 km the kuye river originatesfromthe bading gully in inner mongolia and flows from northwest to southeast into the yellow river the catchment is located in arid and semiarid areas with a fragile ecological environment sparse vegetation and significant soil erosion the upper reaches of the catchment belong mainly to windy and sandy areas while the lower reaches are loess hilly and gully regions the annual average precipitation is 410 mm and the local multiyear average runoff is approximately 558 million cubic meters m3 accounting for 3 5 of the average multiannual runoff of the middle reaches of the yellow river kong et al 2016 in total there are four hydrological stations in the catchment among which the wenjiachuan station is located where the kuye river flowsintotheyellowriver themain sourceofrunoff isprecipitation and its annual change is closely coupled with precipitation coal mining began in the early 1980s in the kyh catchment in the 1980s the average coal mine output was 0 29 million tons by the 1990s the output rose to approximately 5 2 million tons in the first 5 years of the 21st century coal production increased rapidly to 540 million tons fig 3 the shendong coalfield s reserves account for 1 4 ofthetotalreserves inchina and are partly located in the kyh catchment the twh catchment is located in northwest china with a total drainage area of 3294 km2 and a mainstream length of 140 km which originates from shenmucounty and converges with the yellow river the entire watershed is composed of a windy desert area and a hilly area its terrain slopes from the west to the southeast with an average elevation of 1000 1200 m the annual average precipitation is approximately 400 mm and the average annual runoff is 380 million m3 in the watershed fig 4 60 of which occurs from june to august there are two hydrological stations in the twh catchment the gaojiabao station is in the upper and middle reaches and the gaojiachuan station is in the lower reaches in addition there are abundant coal resources in the catchment which are distributed mainly throughout the windy desert area 2 2 data sources in this study the characteristics of runoff variation were analyzed based on the records of annual runoff from the hydrologic yearbook of the yellow river basin during 1960 2016 the precipitation data were derived from daily records that were obtained from hydrological stations within the study region because the stations used in the study are uniformly distributed over the whole catchment fig 2 they can reflect the regional features of the precipitation variability in the study area thus the average precipitation in the basin was calculated by area weighted averaging the data regarding coal production were obtained from local coal related departments and statistical offices such as the bureau of coal work safety of shaanxi province and the yulin provincial bureau of statistics bai 2015 the location of hydrometric stations and the mined out area are summarized in table 3 3 methodology the basic method for separating the impacts of human activities on hydrology is to determine a rational reference period and reconstruct the hydrological time series based on this period thus the choice of reference period is particularly crucial to the reliability of the research subjective judgment and statistical analysis are two commonly used ways in the former an earlier period is selected in which human activities have little influence on the basin as a benchmark based on the relevant literature for example zheng et al 2019 calculated the contribution of human activities to sediment decreases by comparing the water discharge and sediment load during two periods the latter identifies the change point through statistical analysis of a long term hydrological series and the series is then divided into two sections by the change point a pre change period reference period and a post change period descending period statistical analysis is a more scientifically defensible method and has been widely used in earlier studies table 4 thus we chose the latter to ascertain the reference period the computational procedure of the methods used in the study is summarized in appendix a 3 1 trend analysis 3 1 1 mann kendall test the nonparametric mann kendall mk test is widely applied to detect monotonic trends in hydrometeorological time series mann 1945 kendall 1975 however this approach is based on uncorrelated data otherwise the results could be influenced by the persistence of time series zhao et al 2019 to remove the effect of autocorrelation in the mk test the trend free pre whitening tfpw method with sen s slope estimator was employed in this study sen 1968 song et al 2015 the detailed procedure of the mk test can be found in the study of yue et al 2002 moreover the mann kendall sneyers mks rank test is also used to perform trend analysis and change point detection zhang et al 2011 the null hypothesis states that the data are derived from a population with independent realizations and identical distribution the alternative hypothesis states that the data follow a monotonic trend the test statistic is calculated as follows s k i 1 k r i 1 with r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j j 1 2 3 i 2 where r i are the sequential data and the statistic s is approximately normally distributed as follows 3 uf k s k e s k v a r s k with v a r s k k k 1 2 k 5 72 5 e s k k k 1 4 where uf k is the forward sequence and the backward sequence ub k is calculated by repeating the abovementioned process but with the reverse data series when uf k 0 this result indicates that the sequence has a rising trend otherwise the opposite result reflects a decreasing trend if uf k and ub k intersect at a point that does not exceed the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence interval simultaneously the intersection is the position where the mutation occurs otherwise the change point should be detected with other methods 3 1 2 spearman s rho test spearman s rho test is a rank based nonparametric method used for trend analysis in a time series if there is no trend and all observations are independent all rank orderings are equally likely yue et al 2002 therefore it is also applied to verify the absence of trends with uniform power for linear and nonlinear trends shadmani et al 2012 3 2 change point detection 3 2 1 the precipitation runoff double mass curve the dmc is a practical and straightforward method for hydrometeorological series analysis which has been widely applied in previous studies to identify the impacts of human activities gao et al 2017 runoff is primarily affected by climate and human activities when human activities cause little disturbance to a river the runoff changes mainly with the local precipitation the runoff and precipitation gradually accumulate within the same amount of time and two cumulative values of relevant variables are plotted with a horizontal and vertical coordinate in a rectangular coordinate system an inflection point can be used to analyze the phasic variation of the variables 3 2 2 the pettitt test the approach is derived from the mann whitney two sample test which is commonly applied to detect abrupt changes in a hydrological series with continuous data pettitt 1979 because the consistency of the statistical distribution of the data is influenced by the length of the sequence this method is not applicable to the series whose change point at the front and end of the sequence 3 2 3 standard normal homogeneity test the standard normal homogeneity test snht is widely applied in climatic time series analysis for single change point detection in this method it is easier to detect the change point at the beginning and end of the time series whereas the buishand u and the pettitt tests are more sensitive to abrupt changes in the middle of the series toreti et al 2011 3 2 4 lee heghinian method this method is based on the bayesian theory which is suitable for testing sequences with mutations in mean values it is assumed that the population distribution obeys a normal distribution and that the prior distribution of abrupt changes is uniformly distributed lee heghinian 1977 3 3 quantification of the impacts of human activities on water resources 3 3 1 distinguishing the contributions of different factors to runoff change while our research aimed to assess the effects of human activities on regional hydrologic systems the role of climate change should not be ignored before analyzing the impacts of human activities on runoff we applied the method of scraq to preliminarily calculate the contribution rates of climate change and human activities to runoff changes the linear relationships between the cumulative runoff and time and the linear relationship between the cumulative precipitation and time were established and their equations were then divided into two periods based on the change point the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative runoff and time are s rb and s ra for the two periods before and after the change point respectively the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative precipitation and time are s pb and s pa for the two periods before and after the change point respectively the slopes are obtained by the following equations 6 r sr 100 s ra s rb s rb 7 r sp 100 s pa s pb s pb when slope increase when the value of r sr r sp is positive otherwise the slope decreases the contribution rate of climate change to the runoff change c p and the contribution rate of human activities to the runoff change c h can be expressed as follows 8 c p 100 r sp r sr 9 c h 1 c p 4 reference analysis a reference analysis was adopted to estimate the runoff without the intervention of anthropic activities i e restore the runoff series by using the data from neighboring hydrologic stations that have similar conditions to those of the kyh catchment there are certain principles to consider when selecting a reference basin two comparative basins must be in the same climate area and have long term observation data in addition the areas of the two basins should not have too large of a difference using this method the disturbance of climate change on the runoff can be ignored to a certain degree there are two major rivers near the kyh catchment the tuwei river and huangfuchuan river which both converge to the yellow river the runoff of the huangfuchuan river is quite low because it frequently dries up throughout the year in addition to being severely affected by human activities after 1979 wang et al 2012 thus it should not be regarded as a reference basin although some coal mines are active in the twh catchment large scale production only began after 2000 and the output was considerably smaller than that of the kyh catchment moreover the extent of land use change of the twh catchment is less than that of the kyh catchment table 3 the gaojiachuan station was selected as the reference station since it is located where the tuwei river enters the yellow river to further verify the availability and rationality of applying the reference analysis the concept of the hydrologic similarity between two catchments was assessed by the degree of hydrologic similarity proposed by qi et al 2007 in terms of the selection of sub indicators the variables included in studies related to catchment classification were included in the evaluation ali et al 2012 pagliero et al 2019 table 5 the hydrologic condition can be regarded as similar only when the degree of hydrologic similarity between two catchments is greater than 0 6 otherwise a reference analysis cannot be adopted qi et al 2007 10 s i m a i l a r a b i 1 n β i q u i 11 q u i y r y r y s y r where q u i is the degree of hydrologic similarity for the i th index y r is the sub indicator of catchment a y s is the sub indicator of catchment b s i m a i l a r a b is the degree of hydrologic similarity between catchments a and b and β i is the weight of the i th index this study uses the averaging weight to restore the runoff series of the kyh catchment during the period intensively influenced by human activities the following equation can be used 12 q q r k 1 k 2 where q is the multiyear mean annual runoff of a restored catchment for the kyh catchment during the descending period q r is the multiyear mean annual runoff of a reference basin during the reference period k 1 is the ratio between the drainage areas of the kyh catchment and the twh catchment and k 2 is the ratio between the average annual precipitation of two catchments 4 0 1 regression analysis as mentioned above the dmc of precipitation and runoff can reveal whether human activities cause trending changes and abrupt changes in runoff we combined the results from the dmc with other results from the change point detection to divide the runoff series into different stages the reference period was set and linear regression was used to fit the dmc in the reference period based on the regression equation the runoff can be calculated by using precipitation data during the large scale coal mining period of each basin the restored series can be regarded as the runoff under conditions with fewer human disturbances the following equation is used 13 δ w human w h w n 14 η δ w human w n 100 where δ w human is the influence of human activities on the runoff w h are the observations w n is the runoff under natural conditions and η is the magnitude of the impacts of human activities on the runoff 5 results and discussion 5 1 runoff trends and change points in the kyh catchment and kyh catchment the mk statistics of annual runoff in the kyh catchment and twh catchment were 5 29 and 7 66 respectively this result indicates that the runoff of the two basins had a statistically significant downward trend at the 99 confidence level fig 5 shows that the value of uf k had been negative which means that the annual runoff was decreasing in the kyh catchment however this downtrend was not distinct in the 1960s and 1970s and the curve of uf k had been fluctuating until the late 1980s the curve of uf k began to descend continuously once the critical value had been exceeded the tendency change of the runoff in the twh catchment resembles that in the kyh catchment the differencewas that the decline occurred a decade earlier than that in the kyh catchment moreover the decreasing trend in the two catchments was further proven by sen s slope which was 0 11 and 0 05 in the kyh catchment and twh catchment respectively according to spearman s rho test the values of the t statistic were calculated and compared with corresponding critical values at the 1 significance level the values of t for the kyh catchment and twh catchment were 5 01 and 6 47 respectively both of which far exceeded the critical value of 2 66 above all the results from the trend analysis indicate that there was a significant decreasing trend of the runoff during 1960 2016 in both the kyh catchment and twh catchment to implement the change point detection the series of annual runoff was analyzed using the mks rank test dmc pettitt s test snht and lee heghinian method the test statistics of various approaches and change points are presented in table 6 since the intersection point between the two curves exceeded the critical value 2 58 for both basins fig 5 the result of change point detection was not significant and the change point of the runoff series could not be identified by the mks rank test except for the result of the twh catchment from the mks rank test it is obvious that the year of abrupt change obtained from most methods was identical and at the 99 confidence level i e 1997 in the kyh catchment and 1980 in the twh catchment in addition there were two abrupt changes that were detected in the twh catchment by the dmc the dmc slope first dropped sharply after 1976 and further declined after 1997 therefore the two decreases in the dmc slope implied that the level of human activities increased after 1976 and became further enhanced after 1997 given the analysis above the runoff of the kuye river and the tuwei river was continuously decreasing during 1960 2016 the most distinct mutation of the runoff series occurred in 1997 in the kyh catchment and around 1980 in the twh catchment since those approaches have the same mechanism i e to calculate the maximum statistic the annual statistics of each method were plotted to determine whether more potential change points exist fig 7 it is evident that another peak occurred in the late 1990s in the twh catchment while its value was less than that in 1980 to a certain extent soil and water conservation is capable of changing the precipitation infiltration and runoff conditions leading to a decrease in runoff during the period xu 2011 shi et al 2013 large scale conservation measures had been implemented in the twh catchment since the late 1970s and statistics showed that the area affected by soil and water conservation increased from 229 15 km2 in 1979 to 1140 93 km2 in 1996 and accounted for the increase in the drainage area proportion from 7 to 35 1 meanwhile the increased grassland area by conservation measures accounted for the increase in the drainage area proportion from 5 82 in 1979 to 32 58 in 1996 according to the observations from the soil and water conservation experimental station of the yellow river conservancy commission in suide county when the forest coverage was 30 50 and 70 the runoff was reduced by 53 86 and 94 respectively bai 2015 moreover numerous studies have shown that runoff generation significantly decreases with vegetation coverage increase in the soil erosion region of china liu 2014 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016a b the period of vigorously launched soil and water conservation coincided with the time when the runoff mutation occurred in the twh catchment therefore we conjectured that the large scale soil and water conservation measures implemented after 1979 specifically the rapid increases in grassland areas was most likely the main reasons for the abrupt changes in the runoff of the twh catchment coal exploitation in northern shaanxi began in the 1980s and has significantly ramped up since the late 1990s fig 3 the aforementioned results indicated that the runoff had significantly declined since the late 1990s in the kyh catchment which is consistent with the time that extensive regional coal mining was launched furthermore a nonparametric technique spearman s rank correlation coefficient was applied to evaluate the statistical dependence between the annual runoff and coal production we obtained a correlation coefficient of 0 585 p 0 001 for the kyh catchment and 0 232 for the twh catchment p 0 253 suggesting that coal production has a moderate negative correlation with the annual runoff in the kyh catchment and no correlation in the twh catchment the result implies the limited impact of mining activities on the runoff in the twh catchment considering an order of magnitude discrepancy between the coal production of two catchments long term large scale coal mining has a particularly profound impact on the hydrologic responses in mining areas wang et al 2017a 2017b generally the influence of mining on water resources comes mainly from two aspects exploration and production asexploitationincreases undergroundmined outareas gradually expand and even collapse which may enlarge the regional structural fissures in the upper goaf subsurface waters in the fissured bedrock may begin to discharge in the mine pits rather than in the river courses wang et al 2016 meanwhile surface water from channels also flows into the pit along fissures the aforementioned process accelerates theprocessofsurface water conversion topit water leading to a significant reduction in the surface base flow the water level of the underground aquifer is continuously reduced and a depression cone is formed which eventually reducessurface water and lowers the water table in addition coal mining has changed the water holding capacity of surface soil resulting in loose surface soils and widening bare rock areas thereby intensifying soil erosion in mining areas accelerating the trend of land desertification and deteriorating the ecological environment however all the industrial chains of coal bases belong to high water consuming projects specifically the coal chemical industry a coal chemical project with an output of one million tons usually consumes tens of millions of tons of water each year several studies have proven that rivers have frequently dried up and groundwater levels have been declining in areas with significant coal mining li et al 2016 guo et al 2017 hence coal mining is considered one of the main reasons for the reduction in water resources in a mining region moreover the cause may have been the runoff reduction due to the following aspects generally mine development is usually complexly intertwined with other human activities first more than half of the kyh catchment is in shenmu county which is an important water source for yulin city a significant increase in population was observed along with the rapid developments of society and economy in northern shaanxi namely the population increased from 1 2 million to 3 9 million during 1950 2015 this result indicated that water consumption for residential use would also correspondingly increase second the area of water and soil conservation had increased since the 1980s in the kyh catchment which accounted for the increase in the proportion of the area of shenmu county from 18 in 1980 to 42 in 2003 which then remained at approximately 3100 km2 third regional coal exploitation required a corresponding transport infrastructure and other supporting construction large amounts of rock and soil were excavated and accumulated which could aggravate the water loss and soil erosion considering a series of changes brought by mining activities it is believed that the main reason for the decline in runoff is the occurrence of coal mining and human activities from 1997 to 2016 in the kyh catchment 5 2 the impact of mining related human activities on runoff we divided the series of accumulation into two stages namely the reference period 1960 1996 for the kyh catchment 1960 1980 for the twh catchment and the descending period 1997 2016 for the kyh catchment 1981 2016 for the twh catchment and established linear equations for each period as shown in fig 8 a b c d the correlation coefficients of the equations were larger than 0 97 in each stage which illustrates that the fitting degree of the regression model is extremely high the results from eq 8 and 9 reveal that during the descending period climate change and human activities contributed 9 and 91 respectively to the runoff change in the kyh catchment and 58 and 42 to that in the twh catchment these results indicate that the impacts of human activities on runoff were significantly larger compared with the climate impact during the period of large scale coal mining in the kyh catchment and the runoff changes were relatively less affected by human activities in the twh catchment these results were similar to the results from other related studies the results also provide the basis for selecting the reference basin in section 3 4 2 liu et al 2013 guo et al 2014 bai et al 2014 the degree of hydrologic similarity between the two catchments is 0 765 which means that the kyh catchment and the twh catchment are quite similar with respect to the hydrologic condition of watersheds therefore it is reasonable to compare the two catchments with respect to restoration of the runoff of one of the catchments in a post change period based on the results from the abovementioned change point detection the runoff series of the kyh catchment was divided into two stages the reference period 1960 1996 and the descending period 1997 2016 during the reference period the average ratio of the annual runoff between the two hydrologic stations was 1 75 which was close to the ratio of the drainage areas of the two rivers this finding illustrated that restoring the runoff series by the ratio of the drainage areas is relatively reliable the average annual runoff was 406 million m3 in the wenjiachuan station during the descending period which was 168 million m3 on average larger than the annual observations considering that the cumulative coal production in the twh catchment was only approximately 1 5 of the output in the kyh catchment after 2000 the results indicated that the decrease in runoff was caused mainly by intensive coal mining the results of the regression analysis reveal that the impacts of human activities increased in 2000 in the kyh catchment fluctuated approximately 70 and then reached the highest level in 2008 fig 9 in the descending period the annual runoff decreased by an average of 3 44 m3 per year and the magnitude of the impacts was 68 which was higher than the result calculated by the ratio of the basin areas there were two change points in the precipitation runoff dmc of the twh catchment fig 6b based on the above analysis results the runoff series was divided into three parts the period from 1960 to 1975 from 1976 to 1996 and from 1997 to 2016 as mentioned above large scale soil and water conservation projects were launched in the 1970s in the basin and this research focused on the impact of coal mining on the runoff thus to eliminate the influences of soil and water conservation on runoff the reference period and the descending period were set as the periods from 1976 1996 and 1997 2016 respectively the linear regression results indicated that the impacts of human activities on the runoff gradually increased over time during the descending period the annual runoff decreased by an average of 1 52 m3 per year and the magnitude of the impacts was 35 in general the impacts of human activities in the twh catchment were notably lower than those in the kyh catchment however the extents to which the two rivers were influenced had begun to become similar since 2010 which was most likely caused by the further increase in coal production in the twh catchment furthermore to investigate the role of climate change in runoff change the mks rank test was conducted to analyze the trends and determine whether abrupt changes occurred in the precipitation series fig 10 although the uf k and ub k curves intersected both of their points of intersection occurred after 2005 which was much later than the time when an abrupt change had occurred in the runoff in addition the uf k curves generally fluctuated near the critical value of a given confidence level based on the previous conclusions we further inferred that the decreasing trend of runoff was caused by the intensive human activities in the kyh catchment and was a joint result due to human activities and climate change in the twh catchment numerous shallow buried coal fields are distributed across the entire basin and exploit coal seams with large thicknesses during the underground mining process movement and breakage will occur in the overlying strata the fracture zone formed by the destruction of the overlying strata becomes directly linked with the riverbed thereby causing runoff discharge into the goaf and a sharp decrease in the runoff it has been documented that water inflow of nearly twenty large coal mines in the yushen mining area of the northern shaanxi coal base in 2014 reached 101 million m3 and the water inflow in the jinjie coal mine of the shendong base in 2012 was approximately 42 9 million m3 wu et al 2013 in view of the significant impacts of coal mining on regional water resources we are more convinced that the large difference in coal production between the two basins leads to the different contribution rates of human activities to runoff changes 6 conclusion the objective of this study was to quantify the human impacts on the runoff in the coal mining region of northern shaanxi by using various statistical methodologies we identified the trends and change points of the annual runoff of two representative rivers in northern shaanxi over the past several decades the annual runoff levels of the two rivers were significantly reduced during the descending period the main reasons for this decrease were the occurrences of coal mining and soil and water conservation in each basin by calculating the slope change ratio of the cumulative quantity we found that the contribution rates of human activities to the runoff change in the kyh catchment were far higher than those in the twh catchment we also adopted comparative analysis and regression analysis to qualify the impacts of human activities on the runoff the restored series from the comparative analysis showed that the average annual runoff was 406 million m3 in the kyh catchment during the descending period which was 168 million m3 larger than the average of the actual records during the same period the results from the linear regression showed that the annual runoff decreased by averages of 344 million m3 and 152 million m3 per year and the magnitudes of the impacts were 68 and 35 respectively during the descending period in the kyh catchment and twh catchment respectively in general the runoff levels of both rivers changed substantially in recent decades and human activities had a larger effect on the hydrology in the kyh catchment than that in the twh catchment we inferred that the reason for the difference stemmed mainly from the different coal mining scales and intensities in the two basins in the face of future water resource scarcities specifically the reduction in runoff it is essential to propose adaptive management approaches to respond to future uncertainties the latter is important for water resource management moreover an adaptive management approach has large implications for relieving water resource problems caused by the high intensity coal exploitation in similar regions credit authorship contribution statement jinxi song methodology writing original draft funding

4511,we assess the impact of increasing the resolution of hydrologic modeling calibration of selected model parameters and assimilation of streamflow observation toward event based urban flood modeling and prediction using wrf hydro in the dallas fort worth area dfw we use quantitative precipitation estimates at 500 m 1 min resolution from the collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere radar network for observed rainfall stepwise line search for calibration and fixed lag smoothing for data assimilation da the model domain is a 144 6 km2 area comprising 3 urban catchments in arlington and grand prairie in the middle of dfw it is shown that event specific calibration of 6 wrf hydro parameters is largely successful in simulating hydrographs at the catchment outlets particularly for the most important rising limbs but less so for attenuated peaks or fast receding falling limbs a spatial resolution of at least 250 m was necessary for the land surface model lsm to delineate small catchments and hence to capture catchment wide rainfall with acceptable accuracy simulations at selected combinations of resolutions 250 and 125 m for the lsm and 250 125 50 m for the routing models showed mixed results the overall results indicate that in the absence of resolution specific prescription and calibration of channel routing parameters a resolution of 250 m for both the lsm and routing models is a good choice in terms of performance and computational requirements and that in the absence of high quality calibration and continuous simulation of streamflow da is necessary to initialize wrf hydro for event based high resolution urban flood prediction keywords urban flood high resolution precipitation hydrologic modeling prediction data assimilation 1 introduction with the implementation of the national water model nwm the national weather service nws has made a step change advance in operational water forecasting by enabling high resolution 1 hr 1 km for land surface and 250 m for routing hydrologic modeling across the us nws 2020 as a part of the nwm initiative the nws has been mandated to provide forecasts at even higher spatiotemporal resolutions when and where such information is demanded such as in large urban areas for flood warning and areas of high value infrastructure susceptible to landslides or impacted by forest fires graziano et al 2017 the value of high resolution products and services depends not only on the hydrologic and hydraulic models but also on the quality of the forcings model parameters initial conditions ic and boundary conditions at the commensurate resolutions in the dfw area the collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere casa program operates a network of x band radars to provide a suite of meteorological hydrometeorological and hydrologic products for severe weather and flash flood monitoring and prediction chandrasekar et al 2013 the network currently consists of 7 radars located at addison arlington cleburne denton fort worth mesquite and midlothian tx a salient feature of the above operation is that the radar rainfall data are available at a very high resolution of 500 m and 1 min the casa quantitative precipitation estimates qpe are currently input to the nws hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm koren et al 2004 nws 2009 to produce a suite of hydrologic products at the same resolution in real time rafieeinasab et al 2015 habibi et al 2016 habibi and seo 2018 the characteristic spatial scale of natural and man made physiographic features in the study area suggests that a further increase in hydrologic model resolution may improve the information content of the model output habibi et al 2019 there is also an ever increasing demand for higher resolution hydrologic products for enhanced spatio temporal specificity the purpose of this work is to assess using wrf hydro how increasing the resolution of hydrologic modeling calibration of selected model parameters and assimilating locally available observations of precipitation and streamflow may improve flood modeling and prediction toward high resolution water forecasting in urban areas real time continuous operation of high resolution models is computationally very expensive particularly for large areas habibi et al 2019 a more practical approach is likely to be event based operation with robust initialization as such our assessment is carried out in the context of event based modeling and prediction the event based paradigm meant that most conventional calibration methods which rely on time continuous observations of precipitation and streamflow and sequential da methods which employ recursive state updating may not be applicable or desirable to that end we employ multi event averaging of event specific parameter optimization results for calibration and reduced rank fixed lag smoothing for da the new contributions of this paper are selective calibration of wrf hydro for urban flood modeling and prediction improving simulation of highly peaked hydrographs with the addition of a conditional bias cb penalty and assessment of the impacts of different spatio temporal resolutions of rainfall runoff and routing models of ics and land cover and of assimilation of streamflow observations for initialization of wrf hydro toward event based operation of high resolution urban flood prediction this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the study area data used and the hydrologic models used section 3 describes the methods used in the experiment design calibration and da section 4 describes the experiments and presents the results section 5 provides the conclusions and future research recommendations 2 study area data and hydrologic models used here we describe the study area data used and hydrologic models used 2 1 study area the study area comprises the johnson 40 2 km2 cottonwood 32 3 km2 and fish 54 6 km2 creek catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in the dallas fort worth dfw area of tx see fig 1 a b these basins have been used in previous studies of high resolution hydrologic modeling and sensing rafieeinasab et al 2015 norouzi 2016 habibi et al 2016 2019 the johnson cottonwood and fish creek catchments referred to herein as jc cc and fc respectively are highly urbanized with impervious fractions of 0 48 0 37 and 0 31 respectively habibi et al 2019 see fig 1a hydroclimatologically the study basins are particularly challenging for hydrologic modeling and prediction due to very short memory in the surface and soil water storages recent assessment of the streamflow prediction skill of the nws operational hydrologic models indicates that the study region has the smallest predictability among the 138 basins assessed in 8 different river forecast centers rfc service areas across large sections of the us alizadeh et al 2020 2 2 data used the casa qpe products have been extensively evaluated chandrasekar et al 2012 chen et al 2017 cifelli et al 2018 comparative evaluation of different radar based qpe products rafieeinasab et al 2014 2015 showed that the casa qpe is generally more accurate for larger precipitation amounts in the study area whereas the multisensor precipitation estimator mpe seo et al 2010 estimates do better for smaller amounts the casa qpe operation recently began fusing the qpe from the x band radar network with that from the wsr 88d in burleson tx chen and chandrasekar 2015 the rainfall estimates used in this study are the resulting fused qpe product for details the reader is referred to chandrasekar 2017 because the casa network has been in continuous operation only for several years a long period of time continuous data is not available in this study we used the 5 recent events of varying magnitude listed in table 1 fig 2 shows the total rainfall maps for the 4 largest events all other forcings for wrf hydro are from the near real time north american land data assimilation system nldas phase 2 forcing and model output produced operationally at the environmental modeling center of the noaa nws national centers for environmental prediction cosgrove et al 2003 networks of alert sensors operated by the cities of arlington and grand prairie provide water level observations in the study area including at the catchment outlets the observations are based on pressure transducers located at the channel bottom to estimate discharge from stage observations we used rating curves derived by norouzi 2016 at the outlets of the 3 catchments see fig 1a based on the numerical modeling approach of kean and smith 2004 kean and smith 2005 and kean and smith 2010 2 3 hydrologic model used the hydrologic model used is wrf hydro version 5 0 2 gochis et al 2018 for urban flood modelling the most important components are the rainfall runoff terrain or hillslope routing and channel routing models below we describe only the core model dynamics that are directly relevant to the development of this work 2 4 rainfall runoff model the rainfall runoff option used in this work is the simple water balance model swb of schaake et al 1996 which is used by the nwm also as in moore 1985 and the scs curve number method usda 1986 the swb models the average runoff depth over a grid box or a catchment q s as schaake et al 1996 1 q s p x 2 p x i c 2 where p x and i c denote the average precipitation depth and infiltration capacity over the grid box the infiltration capacity i c in eq 1 is modeled as schaake et al 1996 2 i c d x 1 e k t where d x denotes the maximum water holding capacity of the soil column k denotes the decay coefficient and t denotes the time elapsed eq 2 is analogous to the potential infiltration depth f of the horton infiltration model horton 1941 without the constant infiltration rate due to gravity 3 f f o k 1 e k t where f 0 denotes the initial potential infiltration rate due to suction pressure and k denotes the decay rate one may hence interpret the maximum soil water holding capacity d x as representing f 0 k in eq 2 where 1 k represents the time scale of decay of potential infiltration rate the maximum water holding capacity d x in eq 2 is modeled as schaake et al 1996 4 d x i 1 4 δ z i θ sat θ i where δ z i denotes the thickness of the i th soil layer θ sat denotes the saturation soil water content i e porosity and θ i denotes the initial soil water content in the i th soil layer eq 4 is analogous to the total infiltration depth in the green ampt infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 5 f z f θ sat θ init where z f denotes the depth to the wetting front and θ init denotes the vertically uniform initial soil water content as shown above the surface runoff component of the swb may be considered as a combination of the scs method for runoff ratio and the horton infiltration equation without the gravity term for time decay in potential infiltration rate in which the maximum water holding capacity is prescribed by the depth integrated soil pore space given the antecedent soil water content the study area is highly urbanized accurate high resolution depiction of land cover is hence very important rafieeinasab et al 2015 norouzi 2016 habibi et al 2016 wrf hydro uses the united states geological survey s usgs 24 category land cover product loveland et al 1995 see fig 1c to parameterize the land surface model lsm in this work we use the usgs s national land cover database wickham et al 2020 for higher resolution depiction see fig 1d and compare with the usgs 24 category land cover 2 5 terrain routing model the terrain or hillslope routing option used in this work is the diffusive wave model the mass balance equation is given by 6 h t q x x q y y i e where h denotes the water depth q x and q y denote the specific discharge along the x and y directions respectively and i e denotes the excess precipitation or surface runoff depth given by the rainfall runoff model though expressed as a 2d model eq 6 is solved only along the steepest descending direction referred to as the d8 option in wrf hydro gochis et al 2018 the momentum balance equation is given by 7 h x s ox s fx n ov q x h 5 3 2 where s ox denotes the terrain or channel bed slope s fx denotes the friction slope and n ov denotes the manning s friction coefficient for the hillslope the last equality in eq 7 follows from the manning s equation under the wide channel assumption akan and houghtalen 2013 in wrf hydro s ox is calculated based on the dem data and n ov is prescribed according to land cover as such the choice of the land cover data impacts terrain routing 2 6 channel routing model the channel routing option used in this work is the gridded diffusive wave model which solves the following mass and momentum balance equations 8 a t q x q l 9 h x s o s f nq a r 2 3 2 where a denotes the wetted channel cross sectional area q denotes the flow rate q l denotes the lateral inflow from eqs 6 and 7 h denotes the water depth s o denotes the channel bed slope n denotes the manning s roughness coefficient for the channel bed and r denotes the hydraulic radius of the channel cross section the resulting finite difference equation is solved iteratively using the newton raphson method gochis et al 2018 the channels are delineated based on the national hydrographic dataset plus version 2 nhdplusv2 moore et al 2019 the channel routing model assumes trapezoidal cross section for which two additional parameters the channel bottom width and side slope are necessary 10 q 1 n a r 2 3 s f 1 2 1 n b w z h h 5 3 b w 2 h 1 z 2 2 3 s f 1 2 where b w denotes the channel bottom width z denotes the channel side slope and h denotes the water depth wrf hydro prescribes the above parameters stream order specifically i e channels of the same strahler stream order share the same parameter values for channel routing gochis et al 2018 3 methods to assess how the resolution of hydrologic modeling calibration and da may impact urban flood modeling and prediction using wrf hydro we designed and carried out a set of simulation experiments in this section we describe the experiment design calibration and da 3 1 design of experiments table 2 shows the combinations of resolutions considered in this work the casa qpe is available at 500 m 1 min resolution rafieeinasab et al 2015 report that a resolution of 500 m and 15 min or higher is necessary for streamflow prediction at the outlets of the study basins using casa qpe and hl rdhm koren et al 2004 to assess how higher spatial resolution of hydrologic modeling may improve flood simulation in the study area we disaggregate the 500 m qpe to qpes at nominal resolutions of 250 m and 125 m by remapping the casa qpe on a lat lon grid to a lambert conformal conic grid for ingest by wrf hydro for the remapping we used the conserve method available for esmf ncar 2020 in addition to assess possible gains from higher temporal resolution modeling we aggregated the native resolution 1 min casa qpe to 10 min accumulations with the above choices the lsm was run at 3 different spatial resolutions of 500 250 and 125 m with a common native temporal qpe resolution for the spatial resolution experiment and at two different temporal resolutions of 1 and 10 min with a common spatial resolution of 250 m for the temporal resolution experiment in the above experiments the resolution of the routing models was fixed at 250 m the limited number of combinations of resolutions represent a compromise between the computational requirements and the range of resolutions that are most likely to be of operational interest in the study area it was observed in the early stages of the spatial resolution experiment that the mean areal precipitation map calculated at 500 m resolution is significantly different from that at 250 m or 125 m the differences were traced to the coarseness of 500 m grid boxes in delineating small catchments in wrf hydro significant errors in precipitation volume often translate into significant errors in peak flow and time to peak flow as such we excluded 500 m resolution from further consideration for routing we initially considered 25 m resolution as well it was discovered in the early stages however that the number of stream segments at this resolution for the study domain exceeds the maximum allowed by wrf hydro for this reason we excluded 25 m from further consideration for routing though limited in number the resulting combinations allow comparisons of the lsm resolutions of 250 m and 125 m given the common routing model resolution of 125 m and of the routing model resolutions of 250 m 125 m and 50 m given the common lsm resolution of 125 m 3 2 calibration wrf hydro employs a large number of parameters for rainfall runoff and routing modeling most of them are modeled as spatially varying and specified by spatial maps or lookup tables of the relevant physiographic variables due to the computational cost it is impractical to calibrate a large number of parameters the approach taken in this work is to identify only the most influential and adjust them up or down with multiplicative scaling factors over the entire catchment thus maintaining the prescribed spatial variations and physiographic relationships gupta et al 2003 examination of the model physics described in eqs 1 through 10 indicates the most influential parameters for the rainfall runoff and routing models are likely to be the potential infiltration rate decay coefficient k in eq 2 the manning s friction coefficient for overland flow n ov in eq 7 and the 4 channel routing parameters of the manning s friction coefficient n the bottom width b w the side slope z and the initial water depth h the above 6 parameters k n ov n b w z and h are denoted in wrf hydro as refdk s f c r o u g h rmannn bw chsslp and hlink respectively which are used below extensive sensitivity analysis involving all rainfall runoff and routing parameters confirm the above choices the decay coefficient k in eq 2 is coded in wrf hydro as 11 k r e f k d t dksat refdk dt 86400 where dksat denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity refdkdt and refdk are parameters for surface runoff gochis et al 2018 and dt denotes the time step in seconds both refkdt and refdk are calibratable parameters because adjusting refdkt has the same effect as adjusting refdk 1 for k it is not necessary in practice to calibrate both as such we calibrate only refdk in this work note in eq 11 that if refdk increases or decreases k decreases or increases and hence the infiltration capacity decreases or increases given the maximum water holding capacity d x respectively accordingly one may consider refdk as controlling the runoff ratio all other parameters in the lsm are set to the wrf hydro default gochis et al 2018 for the terrain routing model n ov is by far the most important in wrf hydro n ov is prescribed according to the usgs 24 category land cover loveland et al 1995 in this work we use the national land cover database nlcd wickham et al 2020 and the same default land cover dependent values of n ov in the calibration process we apply a single multiplicative adjustment factor to the spatially varying n ov for the entire catchment calibration of channel routing parameters presents a particular challenge as elaborated below there are a total of 4 parameters b w z and n and the initial condition h to be determined in the calibration process whereas the only source of information available is observed streamflow at the catchment outlet for most natural channels the cross sections are not trapezoidal it is hence difficult to prescribe b w and z externally based on physiographic information particularly for small streams given the above picture we opted to assess first the impact of changes in each channel routing parameter via a series of idealized sensitivity analysis using the recently developed general analytical solution for nonlinear reservoir nazari and seo 2020 in this analysis we prescribe an impulse as the upstream hydrograph and route it through a nonlinear reservoir which is modeled as a hydraulically equivalent trapezoidal channel as in wrf hydro we then visually examine the shape of the downstream hydrographs and assess the impact of changes in each of the 4 parameters to the downstream hydrograph the results indicate that changes in each of the 4 routing parameters often produce similar effects that the shape of the outlet hydrograph is least sensitive to changes in z and that in addition to n both b w and h shape the outlet hydrograph to a significant degree in particular the upper and lower parts of the falling limb the above findings suggest that one may be able to prescribe z externally and calibrate only the other three in this work we chose to calibrate all 4 parameters to assess empirically the degree of under determinedness in each for calibration we initially considered the shuffled complex evolution sce duan et al 1992 and the stepwise line search sls kuzmin et al 2008 due to excessive computational requirement of sce however we chose sls as the main calibration technique see kuzmin et al 2008 for comparison once the parameter space is defined we use latin hypercube sampling lhs tang 1993 to run wrf hydro with the randomly sampled parameter values from which a small number of best performing parameter sets is retained we then run sls using the parameter sets retained above as starting points visually examine the resulting hydrographs and choose the best the original sls minimizes the multi scale objective function consisting of normalized root mean square error of simulated flow at multiple time scales of aggregation such as hourly daily weekly monthly etc the hydrologic response time of the study basins on the other hand is sub daily for which the multiscale objective function is not necessary a second modification to sls deals with the objective function itself as elaborated below arguably the two most important variables for urban flood prediction are the peak flow and time to peak flow i e the time until the peak flow occurs relative to some reference time of user s interest the hydrographs for the study basins are often characterized by high degrees of peakedness due to fast surface runoff over urban and semi dry land surfaces commonly used objective functions for calibration such as the mean squared error mse of simulated flow or its variable transform is not very effective in simulating very sharp peaks due to the typically very small number of observations associated with peak flows to address the above we combine the mean error me mse and type ii conditional bias cb for the objective function as follows the last of which is specifically to improve simulation of peaked hydrographs j 1 n σ i 1 n o i 1 n σ i 1 n s i 2 1 n i 1 n o i s i 2 12 α 1 n k k n k o k mid 1 n k i 1 n k s i o k min o i o k max 2 where o i and s i denote the observed and simulated flows at timestep i n denotes the total number of o i s i pairs in the calibration period α denotes the weight given to the conditional bias penalty term k denotes the number of subintervals dividing the range of observed flow o k min and o k max denote the lower and upper bounds of the k th subinterval n k denotes the number of observed flow within the k th subinterval o k mid denotes the mid point between o k min and o k max i e o k mid o k min o k max o k min 2 and s i o k min o i o k max denotes the i th simulated flow for which the verifying observed flow falls in the k th subinterval the three terms in eq 12 represent the me the mse and the mean of the type ii cb squared respectively the first term may appear redundant in that reducing cb is a sufficient condition for reducing me in practice however the cb penalty may not be effective across all ranges of flow due to small sample size in certain sub ranges our experience indicates that a sub range of 10 cms and α 2 generally yield satisfactory results for the study basins we note here that the last two terms in eq 12 represent a sample statistic for the objective function used in cb penalized optimal linear estimation for improved estimation of extremes brown and seo 2013 seo 2012 seo et al 2014 kim et al 2018 seo et al 2018a 2018b shen et al 2019 lee et al 2019 jozaghi et al 2019 though the number of parameters calibrated is small it is still computationally too expensive to perform resolution specific calibration for all combinations of resolutions see table 2 the alternative strategy adopted in this work is to calibrate using sls lhs at the lowest spatial resolution i e 250 m for both the lsm and routing models and use the resulting parameter values as the starting point for calibration at the next higher resolution using sls only for the routing model resolution of 50 m however the above strategy could not be used due to excessively large computational requirements see table 3 instead we borrow the calibration results at 250 m lsm and 125 m routing models and assess parameter transferability from 125 m to 50 m for routing event specific calibration is bound to overfit the specific event at hand to avoid dependent evaluation based on overfitted parameters we averaged the middle 3 parameter values out of the 5 from event specific calibration the rationale for dropping the largest and the smallest values is to avoid large biases arising from possible extremes the average parameter values thus obtained are referred to as the non event specific calibration results 3 3 assimilation of streamflow observations hydrologic and hydraulic processes are heavily controlled by complex local physiography the models may not capture the fixed boundary conditions the ics or the physical processes occurring over certain ranges of scale in addition the precipitation input may have significant systematic or random errors or the hydrologic model may lack adequate calibration in such situations the model states may become too unrealistic to produce skillful predictions especially when the hydrometeorological or hydrologic conditions depart from the historically observed for this reason some form of state updating manual or automatic is generally necessary for real time flood forecasting wmo 1992 with high resolution models however manual da is not viable due to the very large dimensionality lee et al 2011 lee and seo 2014 in this work we assess how assimilating streamflow observations at the catchment outlet may be used to initialize wrf hydro for event based prediction for the da method we use the fixed lag formulation seo et al 2003 2009 of the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 2003 the motivation for the fixed lag smoother is to support forecaster supervised on demand initialization of wrf hydro whether da was previously run or not we note here that enkf is implemented in openda van velzen et al 2016 rakovec et al 2015 which is integrated with the nws s community hydrologic prediction system roe et al 2010 the main operational river forecast system at the rfcs as such there already exists an operational tool for implementation of the proposed method the control variables i e the variables to be updated or adjusted via da include the multiplicative adjustment factor β p to precipitation p x applicable uniformly to the precipitation over the entire catchment p x and over the entire assimilation window see eq 13 and the multiplicative adjustment factor β θ to soil moisture β θ applicable uniformly to all 4 soil moisture layers θ i i 1 4 and valid at the beginning of the assimilation window see eq 14 13 q s β p p x 2 p x i c 2 β p 0 14 d x i 1 4 δ z i θ sat β θ θ i β θ 0 i 1 4 the simulated streamflow observations are then augmented to the state vector to render the observation equation linear lorentzen and naevdal 2011 rafieeinasab et al 2014 lee et al 2019 as formulated above the da problem amounts to solving for the two adjustment factors in each assimilation cycle such that the simulated streamflow at the catchment outlet tracks the observed if sequential estimation is desired the control variables may be propagated from one assimilation cycle to the next based e g on the first order autogressive 1 model lee et al 2019 different variations of the above da approach have been used successfully with both lumped and distributed hydrologic models in both operational and research settings in the us and elsewhere lee et al 2011 2012 2015 2016 lee and seo 2014 kim et al 2014 mazzoleni et al 2018 noh et al 2018 rafieeinasab et al 2014 riazi et al 2016 seo et al 2003 2009 an important difference between the above formulation and the previous formulations of fixed lag smoothing is that the former does not include additive errors to runoff i e later inflow into channels the reason for this departure is that the addition requires modifications to the wrf hydro source code because there is no guarantee a priori that the model dynamics admit the error added flows the above modifications may produce numerical instabilities that are difficult to diagnose or control the lack of additive error in the control vector means that the da formulation is strongly constrained rather than weakly constrained lee et al 2016 and hence more likely to render the smoother more susceptible to model structural or parametric errors in addition to the assimilation window length and ensemble size it is necessary to prescribe several uncertainty parameters for the smoother the observation error variances for precipitation and streamflow and mean and variance or alternatively median and coefficient of variation of each of β θ and β p in this work the above da parameters were prescribed following lee et al 2019 using the homoscedastic model and lognormal distribution for β θ and β p and were estimated based on limited sensitivity analysis rafieeinasab et al 2015 lee et al 2019 due to the strongly constrained nature of the da formulation however the performance of da is likely to benefit significantly from more rigorous estimation of the da parameters 4 results our assessment consisted of the 5 experiments described below we use peak flow and time to peak flow errors as the primary performance measures by far the two most important for urban flood prediction liu et al 2011 rafieeinasab et al 2014 4 1 experiment 1 event specific vs non event specific calibration fig 3 shows examples of event specific black vs non event specific red calibration results at 250 m resolution for both the lsm and routing models additional results are presented in fig 10 in the context of da the temporal resolution of qpe is 1 min the event specific results are based on calibrating the 6 parameters specifically for each event the non event specific results are based on dropping the largest and smallest values from the 5 event specific results and averaging only the middle 3 it is important to point out that in event specific calibration rekft reflects the soil moisture ics note in eqs 2 and 4 that changing refdk has effects similar to changing the maximum water holding capacity of the soil d x which is a function of the initial soil water content event specific calibration of refdk is hence subject to event to event variability of antecedent soil moisture conditions the averaging of the 3 middle parameter values from the event specific results is an attempt to dampen or average out this variability in the ics to illustrate fig 4 a shows the event specific result for the multiplicative factor to rmannn or f a c r m a n n n significant event to event variations are seen particularly for less impervious cc and fc see fig 1 fig 4b shows the non event specific result from averaging the middle 3 parameter values in fig 4a note that jc which has the largest impervious fraction see fig 1 has significantly smaller rmannn than cc and fc and that little adjustment from the wrf hydro default was needed for the least impervious fc the event specific results indicate that the calibration strategy is mostly successful in simulating hydrographs for the most important rising limbs for a number of cases however the simulated hydrographs do not recede as quickly as the observed a likely contributing factor is that wrf hydro does not model storm drains while the impact of storm drains is not very significant for large events rafieeinasab et al 2015 in lower flow conditions the impact is likely to be larger habibi and seo 2018 of the 15 cases i e from 5 events for 3 basins significant differences were observed for 10 cases between the event specific and non even specific results comparison of the parameter values between the two indicates that significant differences exist most often in refdk followed by rmannn and s f c r o u g h for bw hlink and chsslp significant differences were observed only in a few cases the large event to event variability of refdk is not surprising in that in event specific calibration this parameter can effectively control dynamically varying runoff ratio as explained above of the 15 non event specific cases 6 and 3 cases show over and under simulation of runoff volume resulting in over and under simulation of peak flows and too early and late rises to peak flows respectively fig 5 a shows the simulated peak flows from event specific black and non event specific red calibration vs the observed fig 5b shows the associated time to peak flow since the beginning of the rising limb vs the observed in fig 5b the absolute magnitude of the time to peak flow is of little importance because the beginning of the rising limb can be anywhere and only the departure of the time to peak flow from the diagonal is of interest in fig 5 the jc feb 2018 event was excluded due to lack of observed peak flow shown for reference in fig 5a and fig 5b are the lines of 10 20 and 30 percent errors in peak flow and of 1 2 and 3 hr errors in time to peak flow respectively harmel et al 2006 report streamflow measurement errors of 42 19 10 6 and 3 for small watersheds for the worst typical maximum typical average typical minimum and the best case scenarios respectively di baldassarre and montanari 2009 report that the overall error affecting river discharge observations ranges from 6 2 to 42 8 at the 95 confidence level with an average value of 25 6 the 10 to 30 percent error lines in fig 5a hence provide a sense of the magnitude of the errors in simulated peak flow relative to possible observational errors empirical unit hydrographs for jc cc and fc show time to peak values of 0 75 3 and 2 75 hrs respectively rafieeinasab et al 2015 an error in time to peak flow on the order of the time to peak values hence indicates poor performance fig 5 indicates that most case specific calibration results have less than 10 error in peak flow and less than an hour of time to peak flow error but that for about 5 cases the non event specific results suffer from significantly larger errors all 5 cases of excessively large peak flow or time to peak flow errors are associated with significant volume errors except for the fc may 2019 case for which a less than accurate simulation of the rising limb is responsible for the large time to peak flow error the above results indicate that high quality initialization is necessary for event based urban flood prediction using wrf hydro in experiment 5 we assess how da may help address the situation 4 2 experiment 2 impact of temporal resolution of precipitation in this experiment we assess how the temporal resolution of precipitation input may impact the quality of streamflow simulation by forcing the lsm with 1 min average of 10 min qpe vs the native 1 min qpe for 10 min qpe we aggregate the 1 min casa qpe to 10 min accumulations and run the lsm at 1 min timestep using the 1 min average over each 10 min period for comparison we also ran the lsm at 10 min timestep using 10 min qpe in this experiment we use the parameter values obtained from the event specific calibration to reduce hydrologic uncertainty the common spatial resolution used is 250 m for both the lsm and routing models examination of the results for all cases indicates that the differences in simulated hydrographs due to 1 min vs 10 min qpe are very small except for the may 2019 event which we elaborate below fig 6 shows the simulated vs observed hydrographs at the outlet of jc for the may 2019 event the simulation of the second rise for this double peaked event is cut short due to missing casa qpe to identify possible causes for the disparate response in simulated streamflow we examined the map time series for all cases it is observed that the map values for the second peak of the may 2019 event are significantly smaller than those for all other events because runoff generation may be considered as thresholding rainfall such that little runoff occurs for rain rate below some threshold and almost all excess rainfall runs off for rain rate above the threshold see subsection 2 4 norouzi et al 2019 one may look for a threshold rain rate above and below which the runoff response is very different examination of the map hyetographs and the associated hydrographs for the may 2019 event points to a threshold of about 0 5 mm for this event the maximum 1 min map associated with the second peak was well above 0 5 mm for all three basins the maximum 1 min average of 10 min map on the other hand was well below 0 5 mm for jc and cc and stayed above 0 5 mm only for a single 10 min period for fc the above findings indicate that the swb used for rainfall runoff modelling in wrf hydro is sensitive to the temporal resolution of precipitation for moderate precipitation amounts due to the increased nonlinearity in runoff generation see eqs 1 2 and 11 4 3 experiment 3 impact of spatial resolutions of rainfall runoff modelling and routing in this experiment we compare the quality of the outlet simulations for peak flow and time to peak flow among the resolutions of 250 m 125 m and 50 m for routing with a common lsm resolution of 125 m and between the resolutions of 250 m and 125 m for lsm with a common routing model resolution of 125 m the 250 m lsm and 250 m routing model simulations referred to herein as the 250 m 250 m results are based on event specific calibration using sls with lhs one may hence consider the above calibration as based on quasi global optimization the 250 m lsm and 125 m routing simulations referred to herein as the 250 m 125 m results are based on event specific calibration using only sls in which the local search is started with the 250 m 250 m results one may hence consider the above calibration as local optimization of a priori parameter values from a coarser resolution as mentioned in section 3 it was not possible to calibrate at the 250 m lsm and 50 m routing resolution due to excessive computational requirements see table 3 the 250 m lsm and 50 m routing simulations referred to herein as the 250 m 50 m results are based on the parameter values borrowed from the 250 m 125 m results one may hence consider the above results as based solely on a priori parameter values transferred from a coarser resolution because the level of calibration is different from one resolution to another it is not very meaningful to compare the non event specific results for this reason we focus below on the event specific results only fig 7 a and b show the simulated peak flow vs the observed and the simulated time to peak flow vs the observed respectively as in fig 5 we overlay the 10 20 and 30 percent error lines in fig 7a and of 1 2 and 3 h of timing error lines in fig 7b to help assess the magnitude of the errors fig 7 indicates that the 250 m 250 m and 250 m 125 m results both of which are calibrated scale specifically are very similar and that for a number of events the 250 m 50 m results are not as good as the above two the above observations are perhaps not very surprising in that one may expect scale specific calibration to perform better than using parameter values borrowed from a lower resolution the magnitude of the errors in the 250 m 50 m results however is surprisingly large for a number of events to trace the potential sources of the error we examined the spatially distributed channel routing parameters including the channel grid flow accumulation flow direction and stream order at all resolutions it is seen that whereas the differences between 250 and 125 m are relatively small there are large differences between 50 m and the coarser resolutions to illustrate fig 8 a and b show the histograms of the stream order in the model domain at resolutions of 125 m and 50 m respectively the histogram at 250 m is similar to that at 125 m in the figure the frequency for the stream order of zero represents the number of grid boxes that do not contain any channel segments as one may expect at 50 m resolution the channel network is much denser and has more higher order streams wrf hydro prescribes the channel routing parameters according to the stream order as such changes in the channel density or stream order are very likely to change the conveyance characteristics of the channel network the above findings suggest that a combination of resolution specific prescription of the channel routing parameters and their calibration is likely to be necessary to benefit from very high resolution modeling using wrf hydro we also compared the 250 m 125 m results with the 125 m 125 m to assess the impact of increasing the lsm resolution as with the 250 m 125 m results the 125 m 125 m results are based on scale specific local optimization using sls in which the parameter values from the 250 m 125 m results are used as the starting point the comparison indicates that the 125 m 125 m results improve the peak flow prediction over the 250 m 125 m for the study basins but only marginally 4 4 experiment 4 impact of quality of ics in this experiment we assess how the quality of the ics of the rainfall runoff model may impact the accuracy of streamflow prediction a potential source of the ics in real time event based operation of wrf hydro is the warm states of the nwm a direct use in this experiment of the nwm warm states however is not likely to allow clear attribution at least for two reasons the first is that the usgs 24 category land cover see fig 1c and the mrms qpe zhang et al 2011 2016 used in nwm are of coarser resolution than those used in this work the second is that the model parameter values used in the nwm gochis et al 2019 are not the same as those used in wrf hydro in this work as such the ics from the nwm analysis are not likely to transfer cleanly to wrf hydro as implemented in this work as evidenced in experiments 1 through 3 above as a compromise we emulate the nwm analysis by running wrf hydro using the usgs 24 category land cover and nldas precipitation cosgrove et al 2003 in place of the nlcd land cover and casa qpe respectively the nldas precipitation has a much lower resolution than the 1 km 1 hr mrms qpe used by the nwm it is hence possible that the results from this experiment may somewhat inflate the positive impact of higher resolution precipitation the above experiment design nonetheless completely removes all model parametric uncertainties and hence makes possible unambiguous attribution in this experiment we start running wrf hydro at least several hours before the prediction time using the nldas precipitation and usgs 24 category land cover where the lower resolution nldas precipitation is disaggregated uniformly in space and time to a resolution of 250 m and 1 min the prediction time is chosen where the observed hydrograph begins to rise this is also when streamflow response is most sensitive to the ics at the prediction time we switch to the casa qpe and nlcd land cover for simulation over the forecast horizon for the above comparison run we assume average soil moisture conditions for the lsm and pre storm conditions for the hillslopes and channel routing models as obtained from event specific calibration see subsection 4 1 in the baseline run we run the model at 250 m 1 min resolution using the casa qpe and nlcd land cover for the entire simulation period any differences in the two simulated hydrographs over the forecast horizon are hence due solely to the ics valid at the prediction time fig 9 a shows the simulated vs observed peak flow for the nlcd black and usgs 24 category red land cover all other conditions are the same as in the baseline 250 m 250 m simulation the positive impact of higher resolution land cover is readily seen note that the differences are the smallest for jc which is identified mostly as urban by the usgs 24 category land cover in agreement with the nlcd see fig 1c d fig 9b shows the simulated vs observed peak flow for the casa black and nldas red qpe forced ics all other conditions are the same as in the baseline 250 m 250 m simulation note the very significant positive impact of higher resolution qpe particularly for cc and fc for feb 2018 and sep 2018 the two largest events among the five see fig 2 and table 1 examination of timing errors associated with fig 9a and 9b shows similarly positive impact of higher resolution qpe and to a lesser extent land cover 4 5 experiment 5 impact of updating ics via da in this experiment we assess how da may potentially be used to initialize wrf hydro for event based prediction in the real world it is generally not possible to schedule pre storm warmup runs as described in the 4th experiment instead it is necessary to be able to initialize the model on demand often without the aid of any a priori information the fixed lag smoother solved using enkf in this work is aimed at supporting such an operation for high resolution runs enkf is computationally expensive in this work all ensemble runs were made at the coarsest spatial resolution of 250 m for both the lsm and routing models limited sensitivity analysis suggests that a small ensemble size of 12 is generally acceptable for ensemble mean prediction owing to the very low dimensionality of the da formulation we then use the non event specific calibration results to emulate realistic model parametric uncertainty and predict streamflow with and without da due to the small sample size quantitative verification was not possible instead we critically examine the da aided predictions for those 5 cases for which the non event specific calibration results compare least favorably with the event specific in experiment 1 see fig 3 by far the largest potential value of da in urban flood prediction is improving peak flow and time to peak flow predictions when the streams first respond to rainfall accordingly we focus specifically on da aided predictions when the hydrograph begins to rise this is also the time when the degrees of freedom for signal for da rodgers 2000 is greatly reduced due to the generally reduced predictive skill of rainfall runoff and routing models and hence streamflow observations carry larger information content relative to the model prediction zupanski et al 2007 zupanski 2009 fig 10 shows the streamflow predictions without da red da aided ensemble predictions cyan the associated ensemble mean predictions blue ensemble streamflow analysis from da green and the verifying observed hydrographs empty blue circles for 4 of the 5 cases for which non event specific calibration produced very poor simulations in experiment 1 the case not shown in fig 10 due to space limitations is jc apr 2019 which is by far the smallest event of the 5 and is hence of lesser interest in the figure the vertical gray line indicates the prediction time which also marks the end of the assimilation window the horizontal extent of the ensemble analysis green shows the size of the assimilation window all streamflow and precipitation observations valid within the assimilation window are assimilated in these runs to update the soil moisture states valid at the prediction time all da results are based on single assimilation cycles to emulate on demand operation without the potential benefit of any previous da cycles the results indicate that da improves prediction for all 5 cases over the da unaided base predictions for the fc jan 2017 and cc feb 2018 events for which non event specific calibration very significantly over and under predict respectively da greatly improves prediction as noted in section 3 the primary source of error in peak flow or time to peak flow is the error in runoff volume the results indicate that da is largely able to reduce runoff volume errors by providing wrf hydro with high quality ics fig 10 shows however that the ensembles are significantly underspread in the recession limb due to lack of accounting of structural and parametric uncertainties and that wrf hydro is not able to reproduce the bimodal or attenuated peaks or the fast receding falling limbs in fc jan 2017 fig 10a and fc feb 2018 fig 10c the above results indicate that overall the fixed lag smoother is very effective in reducing runoff volume errors and hence errors in peak flow and time to peak flow 5 conclusions and future research recommendations we assess the impact of increasing the resolution of hydrologic modeling calibration of selected model parameters and assimilation of streamflow observations toward event based high resolution urban flood modeling and prediction using wrf hydro in the dallas fort worth area dfw we use quantitative precipitation estimates qpe at 500 m 1 min resolution from the collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere casa operation for observed rainfall the stepwise line search for calibration and ensemble kalman filter enkf implementation of fixed lag smoothing for data assimilation da the model domain is a 144 6 km2 area comprising 3 urban catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in the middle of dfw the main findings conclusions and recommendations follow below event specific calibration of the 6 wrf hydro parameters identified in this work is largely successful in simulating hydrographs in the study area in particular the most important rising limbs it is less successful however for attenuated peaks or fast receding falling limbs a novel element in the above calibration is the inclusion of a conditional bias penalty in the objective function to improve simulation specifically of highly peaked hydrograph a spatial resolution of at least 250 m is necessary for the land surface model lsm to delineate small catchments and hence to capture catchment wide rainfall with acceptable accuracy increasing the resolution of the lsm from 250 m to 125 m showed marginal improvement the same resolution increase for the routing models showed little improvement increasing the routing resolution further to 50 m using parameter values borrowed from 125 m on the other hand increased errors for a number of cases due to large changes in channel grid and stream order the above findings suggest that to benefit from very high resolution modeling using wrf hydro a combination of resolution specific prescription and calibration of the channel routing parameters is likely to be necessary the high resolution casa qpe and the national land cover database nlcd land cover showed very significant and significant positive impact on streamflow simulation compared to the lower resolution north american land data assimilation system nldas qpe and usgs 24 category land cover respectively the above points out the importance of resolution consistent high quality initialization of wrf hydro for event based operation the enkf implementation of fixed lag smoother significantly reduced peak flow errors under realistic parametric uncertainty for predictions made when streams first respond to rainfall the da aided ensemble predictions are however significantly underspread in the recession limb due to lack of accounting of structural and parametric uncertainties the overall results suggest that in the absence of resolution specific prescription and calibration of channel routing parameters a resolution of 250 m for both the lsm and routing models is a good choice in terms of performance and computational requirements recall that the national water model currently runs routing at 250 m over the continental us the results also suggest that in the absence of high quality calibration and continuous simulation of streamflow da is

4511,we assess the impact of increasing the resolution of hydrologic modeling calibration of selected model parameters and assimilation of streamflow observation toward event based urban flood modeling and prediction using wrf hydro in the dallas fort worth area dfw we use quantitative precipitation estimates at 500 m 1 min resolution from the collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere radar network for observed rainfall stepwise line search for calibration and fixed lag smoothing for data assimilation da the model domain is a 144 6 km2 area comprising 3 urban catchments in arlington and grand prairie in the middle of dfw it is shown that event specific calibration of 6 wrf hydro parameters is largely successful in simulating hydrographs at the catchment outlets particularly for the most important rising limbs but less so for attenuated peaks or fast receding falling limbs a spatial resolution of at least 250 m was necessary for the land surface model lsm to delineate small catchments and hence to capture catchment wide rainfall with acceptable accuracy simulations at selected combinations of resolutions 250 and 125 m for the lsm and 250 125 50 m for the routing models showed mixed results the overall results indicate that in the absence of resolution specific prescription and calibration of channel routing parameters a resolution of 250 m for both the lsm and routing models is a good choice in terms of performance and computational requirements and that in the absence of high quality calibration and continuous simulation of streamflow da is necessary to initialize wrf hydro for event based high resolution urban flood prediction keywords urban flood high resolution precipitation hydrologic modeling prediction data assimilation 1 introduction with the implementation of the national water model nwm the national weather service nws has made a step change advance in operational water forecasting by enabling high resolution 1 hr 1 km for land surface and 250 m for routing hydrologic modeling across the us nws 2020 as a part of the nwm initiative the nws has been mandated to provide forecasts at even higher spatiotemporal resolutions when and where such information is demanded such as in large urban areas for flood warning and areas of high value infrastructure susceptible to landslides or impacted by forest fires graziano et al 2017 the value of high resolution products and services depends not only on the hydrologic and hydraulic models but also on the quality of the forcings model parameters initial conditions ic and boundary conditions at the commensurate resolutions in the dfw area the collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere casa program operates a network of x band radars to provide a suite of meteorological hydrometeorological and hydrologic products for severe weather and flash flood monitoring and prediction chandrasekar et al 2013 the network currently consists of 7 radars located at addison arlington cleburne denton fort worth mesquite and midlothian tx a salient feature of the above operation is that the radar rainfall data are available at a very high resolution of 500 m and 1 min the casa quantitative precipitation estimates qpe are currently input to the nws hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm koren et al 2004 nws 2009 to produce a suite of hydrologic products at the same resolution in real time rafieeinasab et al 2015 habibi et al 2016 habibi and seo 2018 the characteristic spatial scale of natural and man made physiographic features in the study area suggests that a further increase in hydrologic model resolution may improve the information content of the model output habibi et al 2019 there is also an ever increasing demand for higher resolution hydrologic products for enhanced spatio temporal specificity the purpose of this work is to assess using wrf hydro how increasing the resolution of hydrologic modeling calibration of selected model parameters and assimilating locally available observations of precipitation and streamflow may improve flood modeling and prediction toward high resolution water forecasting in urban areas real time continuous operation of high resolution models is computationally very expensive particularly for large areas habibi et al 2019 a more practical approach is likely to be event based operation with robust initialization as such our assessment is carried out in the context of event based modeling and prediction the event based paradigm meant that most conventional calibration methods which rely on time continuous observations of precipitation and streamflow and sequential da methods which employ recursive state updating may not be applicable or desirable to that end we employ multi event averaging of event specific parameter optimization results for calibration and reduced rank fixed lag smoothing for da the new contributions of this paper are selective calibration of wrf hydro for urban flood modeling and prediction improving simulation of highly peaked hydrographs with the addition of a conditional bias cb penalty and assessment of the impacts of different spatio temporal resolutions of rainfall runoff and routing models of ics and land cover and of assimilation of streamflow observations for initialization of wrf hydro toward event based operation of high resolution urban flood prediction this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the study area data used and the hydrologic models used section 3 describes the methods used in the experiment design calibration and da section 4 describes the experiments and presents the results section 5 provides the conclusions and future research recommendations 2 study area data and hydrologic models used here we describe the study area data used and hydrologic models used 2 1 study area the study area comprises the johnson 40 2 km2 cottonwood 32 3 km2 and fish 54 6 km2 creek catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in the dallas fort worth dfw area of tx see fig 1 a b these basins have been used in previous studies of high resolution hydrologic modeling and sensing rafieeinasab et al 2015 norouzi 2016 habibi et al 2016 2019 the johnson cottonwood and fish creek catchments referred to herein as jc cc and fc respectively are highly urbanized with impervious fractions of 0 48 0 37 and 0 31 respectively habibi et al 2019 see fig 1a hydroclimatologically the study basins are particularly challenging for hydrologic modeling and prediction due to very short memory in the surface and soil water storages recent assessment of the streamflow prediction skill of the nws operational hydrologic models indicates that the study region has the smallest predictability among the 138 basins assessed in 8 different river forecast centers rfc service areas across large sections of the us alizadeh et al 2020 2 2 data used the casa qpe products have been extensively evaluated chandrasekar et al 2012 chen et al 2017 cifelli et al 2018 comparative evaluation of different radar based qpe products rafieeinasab et al 2014 2015 showed that the casa qpe is generally more accurate for larger precipitation amounts in the study area whereas the multisensor precipitation estimator mpe seo et al 2010 estimates do better for smaller amounts the casa qpe operation recently began fusing the qpe from the x band radar network with that from the wsr 88d in burleson tx chen and chandrasekar 2015 the rainfall estimates used in this study are the resulting fused qpe product for details the reader is referred to chandrasekar 2017 because the casa network has been in continuous operation only for several years a long period of time continuous data is not available in this study we used the 5 recent events of varying magnitude listed in table 1 fig 2 shows the total rainfall maps for the 4 largest events all other forcings for wrf hydro are from the near real time north american land data assimilation system nldas phase 2 forcing and model output produced operationally at the environmental modeling center of the noaa nws national centers for environmental prediction cosgrove et al 2003 networks of alert sensors operated by the cities of arlington and grand prairie provide water level observations in the study area including at the catchment outlets the observations are based on pressure transducers located at the channel bottom to estimate discharge from stage observations we used rating curves derived by norouzi 2016 at the outlets of the 3 catchments see fig 1a based on the numerical modeling approach of kean and smith 2004 kean and smith 2005 and kean and smith 2010 2 3 hydrologic model used the hydrologic model used is wrf hydro version 5 0 2 gochis et al 2018 for urban flood modelling the most important components are the rainfall runoff terrain or hillslope routing and channel routing models below we describe only the core model dynamics that are directly relevant to the development of this work 2 4 rainfall runoff model the rainfall runoff option used in this work is the simple water balance model swb of schaake et al 1996 which is used by the nwm also as in moore 1985 and the scs curve number method usda 1986 the swb models the average runoff depth over a grid box or a catchment q s as schaake et al 1996 1 q s p x 2 p x i c 2 where p x and i c denote the average precipitation depth and infiltration capacity over the grid box the infiltration capacity i c in eq 1 is modeled as schaake et al 1996 2 i c d x 1 e k t where d x denotes the maximum water holding capacity of the soil column k denotes the decay coefficient and t denotes the time elapsed eq 2 is analogous to the potential infiltration depth f of the horton infiltration model horton 1941 without the constant infiltration rate due to gravity 3 f f o k 1 e k t where f 0 denotes the initial potential infiltration rate due to suction pressure and k denotes the decay rate one may hence interpret the maximum soil water holding capacity d x as representing f 0 k in eq 2 where 1 k represents the time scale of decay of potential infiltration rate the maximum water holding capacity d x in eq 2 is modeled as schaake et al 1996 4 d x i 1 4 δ z i θ sat θ i where δ z i denotes the thickness of the i th soil layer θ sat denotes the saturation soil water content i e porosity and θ i denotes the initial soil water content in the i th soil layer eq 4 is analogous to the total infiltration depth in the green ampt infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 5 f z f θ sat θ init where z f denotes the depth to the wetting front and θ init denotes the vertically uniform initial soil water content as shown above the surface runoff component of the swb may be considered as a combination of the scs method for runoff ratio and the horton infiltration equation without the gravity term for time decay in potential infiltration rate in which the maximum water holding capacity is prescribed by the depth integrated soil pore space given the antecedent soil water content the study area is highly urbanized accurate high resolution depiction of land cover is hence very important rafieeinasab et al 2015 norouzi 2016 habibi et al 2016 wrf hydro uses the united states geological survey s usgs 24 category land cover product loveland et al 1995 see fig 1c to parameterize the land surface model lsm in this work we use the usgs s national land cover database wickham et al 2020 for higher resolution depiction see fig 1d and compare with the usgs 24 category land cover 2 5 terrain routing model the terrain or hillslope routing option used in this work is the diffusive wave model the mass balance equation is given by 6 h t q x x q y y i e where h denotes the water depth q x and q y denote the specific discharge along the x and y directions respectively and i e denotes the excess precipitation or surface runoff depth given by the rainfall runoff model though expressed as a 2d model eq 6 is solved only along the steepest descending direction referred to as the d8 option in wrf hydro gochis et al 2018 the momentum balance equation is given by 7 h x s ox s fx n ov q x h 5 3 2 where s ox denotes the terrain or channel bed slope s fx denotes the friction slope and n ov denotes the manning s friction coefficient for the hillslope the last equality in eq 7 follows from the manning s equation under the wide channel assumption akan and houghtalen 2013 in wrf hydro s ox is calculated based on the dem data and n ov is prescribed according to land cover as such the choice of the land cover data impacts terrain routing 2 6 channel routing model the channel routing option used in this work is the gridded diffusive wave model which solves the following mass and momentum balance equations 8 a t q x q l 9 h x s o s f nq a r 2 3 2 where a denotes the wetted channel cross sectional area q denotes the flow rate q l denotes the lateral inflow from eqs 6 and 7 h denotes the water depth s o denotes the channel bed slope n denotes the manning s roughness coefficient for the channel bed and r denotes the hydraulic radius of the channel cross section the resulting finite difference equation is solved iteratively using the newton raphson method gochis et al 2018 the channels are delineated based on the national hydrographic dataset plus version 2 nhdplusv2 moore et al 2019 the channel routing model assumes trapezoidal cross section for which two additional parameters the channel bottom width and side slope are necessary 10 q 1 n a r 2 3 s f 1 2 1 n b w z h h 5 3 b w 2 h 1 z 2 2 3 s f 1 2 where b w denotes the channel bottom width z denotes the channel side slope and h denotes the water depth wrf hydro prescribes the above parameters stream order specifically i e channels of the same strahler stream order share the same parameter values for channel routing gochis et al 2018 3 methods to assess how the resolution of hydrologic modeling calibration and da may impact urban flood modeling and prediction using wrf hydro we designed and carried out a set of simulation experiments in this section we describe the experiment design calibration and da 3 1 design of experiments table 2 shows the combinations of resolutions considered in this work the casa qpe is available at 500 m 1 min resolution rafieeinasab et al 2015 report that a resolution of 500 m and 15 min or higher is necessary for streamflow prediction at the outlets of the study basins using casa qpe and hl rdhm koren et al 2004 to assess how higher spatial resolution of hydrologic modeling may improve flood simulation in the study area we disaggregate the 500 m qpe to qpes at nominal resolutions of 250 m and 125 m by remapping the casa qpe on a lat lon grid to a lambert conformal conic grid for ingest by wrf hydro for the remapping we used the conserve method available for esmf ncar 2020 in addition to assess possible gains from higher temporal resolution modeling we aggregated the native resolution 1 min casa qpe to 10 min accumulations with the above choices the lsm was run at 3 different spatial resolutions of 500 250 and 125 m with a common native temporal qpe resolution for the spatial resolution experiment and at two different temporal resolutions of 1 and 10 min with a common spatial resolution of 250 m for the temporal resolution experiment in the above experiments the resolution of the routing models was fixed at 250 m the limited number of combinations of resolutions represent a compromise between the computational requirements and the range of resolutions that are most likely to be of operational interest in the study area it was observed in the early stages of the spatial resolution experiment that the mean areal precipitation map calculated at 500 m resolution is significantly different from that at 250 m or 125 m the differences were traced to the coarseness of 500 m grid boxes in delineating small catchments in wrf hydro significant errors in precipitation volume often translate into significant errors in peak flow and time to peak flow as such we excluded 500 m resolution from further consideration for routing we initially considered 25 m resolution as well it was discovered in the early stages however that the number of stream segments at this resolution for the study domain exceeds the maximum allowed by wrf hydro for this reason we excluded 25 m from further consideration for routing though limited in number the resulting combinations allow comparisons of the lsm resolutions of 250 m and 125 m given the common routing model resolution of 125 m and of the routing model resolutions of 250 m 125 m and 50 m given the common lsm resolution of 125 m 3 2 calibration wrf hydro employs a large number of parameters for rainfall runoff and routing modeling most of them are modeled as spatially varying and specified by spatial maps or lookup tables of the relevant physiographic variables due to the computational cost it is impractical to calibrate a large number of parameters the approach taken in this work is to identify only the most influential and adjust them up or down with multiplicative scaling factors over the entire catchment thus maintaining the prescribed spatial variations and physiographic relationships gupta et al 2003 examination of the model physics described in eqs 1 through 10 indicates the most influential parameters for the rainfall runoff and routing models are likely to be the potential infiltration rate decay coefficient k in eq 2 the manning s friction coefficient for overland flow n ov in eq 7 and the 4 channel routing parameters of the manning s friction coefficient n the bottom width b w the side slope z and the initial water depth h the above 6 parameters k n ov n b w z and h are denoted in wrf hydro as refdk s f c r o u g h rmannn bw chsslp and hlink respectively which are used below extensive sensitivity analysis involving all rainfall runoff and routing parameters confirm the above choices the decay coefficient k in eq 2 is coded in wrf hydro as 11 k r e f k d t dksat refdk dt 86400 where dksat denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity refdkdt and refdk are parameters for surface runoff gochis et al 2018 and dt denotes the time step in seconds both refkdt and refdk are calibratable parameters because adjusting refdkt has the same effect as adjusting refdk 1 for k it is not necessary in practice to calibrate both as such we calibrate only refdk in this work note in eq 11 that if refdk increases or decreases k decreases or increases and hence the infiltration capacity decreases or increases given the maximum water holding capacity d x respectively accordingly one may consider refdk as controlling the runoff ratio all other parameters in the lsm are set to the wrf hydro default gochis et al 2018 for the terrain routing model n ov is by far the most important in wrf hydro n ov is prescribed according to the usgs 24 category land cover loveland et al 1995 in this work we use the national land cover database nlcd wickham et al 2020 and the same default land cover dependent values of n ov in the calibration process we apply a single multiplicative adjustment factor to the spatially varying n ov for the entire catchment calibration of channel routing parameters presents a particular challenge as elaborated below there are a total of 4 parameters b w z and n and the initial condition h to be determined in the calibration process whereas the only source of information available is observed streamflow at the catchment outlet for most natural channels the cross sections are not trapezoidal it is hence difficult to prescribe b w and z externally based on physiographic information particularly for small streams given the above picture we opted to assess first the impact of changes in each channel routing parameter via a series of idealized sensitivity analysis using the recently developed general analytical solution for nonlinear reservoir nazari and seo 2020 in this analysis we prescribe an impulse as the upstream hydrograph and route it through a nonlinear reservoir which is modeled as a hydraulically equivalent trapezoidal channel as in wrf hydro we then visually examine the shape of the downstream hydrographs and assess the impact of changes in each of the 4 parameters to the downstream hydrograph the results indicate that changes in each of the 4 routing parameters often produce similar effects that the shape of the outlet hydrograph is least sensitive to changes in z and that in addition to n both b w and h shape the outlet hydrograph to a significant degree in particular the upper and lower parts of the falling limb the above findings suggest that one may be able to prescribe z externally and calibrate only the other three in this work we chose to calibrate all 4 parameters to assess empirically the degree of under determinedness in each for calibration we initially considered the shuffled complex evolution sce duan et al 1992 and the stepwise line search sls kuzmin et al 2008 due to excessive computational requirement of sce however we chose sls as the main calibration technique see kuzmin et al 2008 for comparison once the parameter space is defined we use latin hypercube sampling lhs tang 1993 to run wrf hydro with the randomly sampled parameter values from which a small number of best performing parameter sets is retained we then run sls using the parameter sets retained above as starting points visually examine the resulting hydrographs and choose the best the original sls minimizes the multi scale objective function consisting of normalized root mean square error of simulated flow at multiple time scales of aggregation such as hourly daily weekly monthly etc the hydrologic response time of the study basins on the other hand is sub daily for which the multiscale objective function is not necessary a second modification to sls deals with the objective function itself as elaborated below arguably the two most important variables for urban flood prediction are the peak flow and time to peak flow i e the time until the peak flow occurs relative to some reference time of user s interest the hydrographs for the study basins are often characterized by high degrees of peakedness due to fast surface runoff over urban and semi dry land surfaces commonly used objective functions for calibration such as the mean squared error mse of simulated flow or its variable transform is not very effective in simulating very sharp peaks due to the typically very small number of observations associated with peak flows to address the above we combine the mean error me mse and type ii conditional bias cb for the objective function as follows the last of which is specifically to improve simulation of peaked hydrographs j 1 n σ i 1 n o i 1 n σ i 1 n s i 2 1 n i 1 n o i s i 2 12 α 1 n k k n k o k mid 1 n k i 1 n k s i o k min o i o k max 2 where o i and s i denote the observed and simulated flows at timestep i n denotes the total number of o i s i pairs in the calibration period α denotes the weight given to the conditional bias penalty term k denotes the number of subintervals dividing the range of observed flow o k min and o k max denote the lower and upper bounds of the k th subinterval n k denotes the number of observed flow within the k th subinterval o k mid denotes the mid point between o k min and o k max i e o k mid o k min o k max o k min 2 and s i o k min o i o k max denotes the i th simulated flow for which the verifying observed flow falls in the k th subinterval the three terms in eq 12 represent the me the mse and the mean of the type ii cb squared respectively the first term may appear redundant in that reducing cb is a sufficient condition for reducing me in practice however the cb penalty may not be effective across all ranges of flow due to small sample size in certain sub ranges our experience indicates that a sub range of 10 cms and α 2 generally yield satisfactory results for the study basins we note here that the last two terms in eq 12 represent a sample statistic for the objective function used in cb penalized optimal linear estimation for improved estimation of extremes brown and seo 2013 seo 2012 seo et al 2014 kim et al 2018 seo et al 2018a 2018b shen et al 2019 lee et al 2019 jozaghi et al 2019 though the number of parameters calibrated is small it is still computationally too expensive to perform resolution specific calibration for all combinations of resolutions see table 2 the alternative strategy adopted in this work is to calibrate using sls lhs at the lowest spatial resolution i e 250 m for both the lsm and routing models and use the resulting parameter values as the starting point for calibration at the next higher resolution using sls only for the routing model resolution of 50 m however the above strategy could not be used due to excessively large computational requirements see table 3 instead we borrow the calibration results at 250 m lsm and 125 m routing models and assess parameter transferability from 125 m to 50 m for routing event specific calibration is bound to overfit the specific event at hand to avoid dependent evaluation based on overfitted parameters we averaged the middle 3 parameter values out of the 5 from event specific calibration the rationale for dropping the largest and the smallest values is to avoid large biases arising from possible extremes the average parameter values thus obtained are referred to as the non event specific calibration results 3 3 assimilation of streamflow observations hydrologic and hydraulic processes are heavily controlled by complex local physiography the models may not capture the fixed boundary conditions the ics or the physical processes occurring over certain ranges of scale in addition the precipitation input may have significant systematic or random errors or the hydrologic model may lack adequate calibration in such situations the model states may become too unrealistic to produce skillful predictions especially when the hydrometeorological or hydrologic conditions depart from the historically observed for this reason some form of state updating manual or automatic is generally necessary for real time flood forecasting wmo 1992 with high resolution models however manual da is not viable due to the very large dimensionality lee et al 2011 lee and seo 2014 in this work we assess how assimilating streamflow observations at the catchment outlet may be used to initialize wrf hydro for event based prediction for the da method we use the fixed lag formulation seo et al 2003 2009 of the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 2003 the motivation for the fixed lag smoother is to support forecaster supervised on demand initialization of wrf hydro whether da was previously run or not we note here that enkf is implemented in openda van velzen et al 2016 rakovec et al 2015 which is integrated with the nws s community hydrologic prediction system roe et al 2010 the main operational river forecast system at the rfcs as such there already exists an operational tool for implementation of the proposed method the control variables i e the variables to be updated or adjusted via da include the multiplicative adjustment factor β p to precipitation p x applicable uniformly to the precipitation over the entire catchment p x and over the entire assimilation window see eq 13 and the multiplicative adjustment factor β θ to soil moisture β θ applicable uniformly to all 4 soil moisture layers θ i i 1 4 and valid at the beginning of the assimilation window see eq 14 13 q s β p p x 2 p x i c 2 β p 0 14 d x i 1 4 δ z i θ sat β θ θ i β θ 0 i 1 4 the simulated streamflow observations are then augmented to the state vector to render the observation equation linear lorentzen and naevdal 2011 rafieeinasab et al 2014 lee et al 2019 as formulated above the da problem amounts to solving for the two adjustment factors in each assimilation cycle such that the simulated streamflow at the catchment outlet tracks the observed if sequential estimation is desired the control variables may be propagated from one assimilation cycle to the next based e g on the first order autogressive 1 model lee et al 2019 different variations of the above da approach have been used successfully with both lumped and distributed hydrologic models in both operational and research settings in the us and elsewhere lee et al 2011 2012 2015 2016 lee and seo 2014 kim et al 2014 mazzoleni et al 2018 noh et al 2018 rafieeinasab et al 2014 riazi et al 2016 seo et al 2003 2009 an important difference between the above formulation and the previous formulations of fixed lag smoothing is that the former does not include additive errors to runoff i e later inflow into channels the reason for this departure is that the addition requires modifications to the wrf hydro source code because there is no guarantee a priori that the model dynamics admit the error added flows the above modifications may produce numerical instabilities that are difficult to diagnose or control the lack of additive error in the control vector means that the da formulation is strongly constrained rather than weakly constrained lee et al 2016 and hence more likely to render the smoother more susceptible to model structural or parametric errors in addition to the assimilation window length and ensemble size it is necessary to prescribe several uncertainty parameters for the smoother the observation error variances for precipitation and streamflow and mean and variance or alternatively median and coefficient of variation of each of β θ and β p in this work the above da parameters were prescribed following lee et al 2019 using the homoscedastic model and lognormal distribution for β θ and β p and were estimated based on limited sensitivity analysis rafieeinasab et al 2015 lee et al 2019 due to the strongly constrained nature of the da formulation however the performance of da is likely to benefit significantly from more rigorous estimation of the da parameters 4 results our assessment consisted of the 5 experiments described below we use peak flow and time to peak flow errors as the primary performance measures by far the two most important for urban flood prediction liu et al 2011 rafieeinasab et al 2014 4 1 experiment 1 event specific vs non event specific calibration fig 3 shows examples of event specific black vs non event specific red calibration results at 250 m resolution for both the lsm and routing models additional results are presented in fig 10 in the context of da the temporal resolution of qpe is 1 min the event specific results are based on calibrating the 6 parameters specifically for each event the non event specific results are based on dropping the largest and smallest values from the 5 event specific results and averaging only the middle 3 it is important to point out that in event specific calibration rekft reflects the soil moisture ics note in eqs 2 and 4 that changing refdk has effects similar to changing the maximum water holding capacity of the soil d x which is a function of the initial soil water content event specific calibration of refdk is hence subject to event to event variability of antecedent soil moisture conditions the averaging of the 3 middle parameter values from the event specific results is an attempt to dampen or average out this variability in the ics to illustrate fig 4 a shows the event specific result for the multiplicative factor to rmannn or f a c r m a n n n significant event to event variations are seen particularly for less impervious cc and fc see fig 1 fig 4b shows the non event specific result from averaging the middle 3 parameter values in fig 4a note that jc which has the largest impervious fraction see fig 1 has significantly smaller rmannn than cc and fc and that little adjustment from the wrf hydro default was needed for the least impervious fc the event specific results indicate that the calibration strategy is mostly successful in simulating hydrographs for the most important rising limbs for a number of cases however the simulated hydrographs do not recede as quickly as the observed a likely contributing factor is that wrf hydro does not model storm drains while the impact of storm drains is not very significant for large events rafieeinasab et al 2015 in lower flow conditions the impact is likely to be larger habibi and seo 2018 of the 15 cases i e from 5 events for 3 basins significant differences were observed for 10 cases between the event specific and non even specific results comparison of the parameter values between the two indicates that significant differences exist most often in refdk followed by rmannn and s f c r o u g h for bw hlink and chsslp significant differences were observed only in a few cases the large event to event variability of refdk is not surprising in that in event specific calibration this parameter can effectively control dynamically varying runoff ratio as explained above of the 15 non event specific cases 6 and 3 cases show over and under simulation of runoff volume resulting in over and under simulation of peak flows and too early and late rises to peak flows respectively fig 5 a shows the simulated peak flows from event specific black and non event specific red calibration vs the observed fig 5b shows the associated time to peak flow since the beginning of the rising limb vs the observed in fig 5b the absolute magnitude of the time to peak flow is of little importance because the beginning of the rising limb can be anywhere and only the departure of the time to peak flow from the diagonal is of interest in fig 5 the jc feb 2018 event was excluded due to lack of observed peak flow shown for reference in fig 5a and fig 5b are the lines of 10 20 and 30 percent errors in peak flow and of 1 2 and 3 hr errors in time to peak flow respectively harmel et al 2006 report streamflow measurement errors of 42 19 10 6 and 3 for small watersheds for the worst typical maximum typical average typical minimum and the best case scenarios respectively di baldassarre and montanari 2009 report that the overall error affecting river discharge observations ranges from 6 2 to 42 8 at the 95 confidence level with an average value of 25 6 the 10 to 30 percent error lines in fig 5a hence provide a sense of the magnitude of the errors in simulated peak flow relative to possible observational errors empirical unit hydrographs for jc cc and fc show time to peak values of 0 75 3 and 2 75 hrs respectively rafieeinasab et al 2015 an error in time to peak flow on the order of the time to peak values hence indicates poor performance fig 5 indicates that most case specific calibration results have less than 10 error in peak flow and less than an hour of time to peak flow error but that for about 5 cases the non event specific results suffer from significantly larger errors all 5 cases of excessively large peak flow or time to peak flow errors are associated with significant volume errors except for the fc may 2019 case for which a less than accurate simulation of the rising limb is responsible for the large time to peak flow error the above results indicate that high quality initialization is necessary for event based urban flood prediction using wrf hydro in experiment 5 we assess how da may help address the situation 4 2 experiment 2 impact of temporal resolution of precipitation in this experiment we assess how the temporal resolution of precipitation input may impact the quality of streamflow simulation by forcing the lsm with 1 min average of 10 min qpe vs the native 1 min qpe for 10 min qpe we aggregate the 1 min casa qpe to 10 min accumulations and run the lsm at 1 min timestep using the 1 min average over each 10 min period for comparison we also ran the lsm at 10 min timestep using 10 min qpe in this experiment we use the parameter values obtained from the event specific calibration to reduce hydrologic uncertainty the common spatial resolution used is 250 m for both the lsm and routing models examination of the results for all cases indicates that the differences in simulated hydrographs due to 1 min vs 10 min qpe are very small except for the may 2019 event which we elaborate below fig 6 shows the simulated vs observed hydrographs at the outlet of jc for the may 2019 event the simulation of the second rise for this double peaked event is cut short due to missing casa qpe to identify possible causes for the disparate response in simulated streamflow we examined the map time series for all cases it is observed that the map values for the second peak of the may 2019 event are significantly smaller than those for all other events because runoff generation may be considered as thresholding rainfall such that little runoff occurs for rain rate below some threshold and almost all excess rainfall runs off for rain rate above the threshold see subsection 2 4 norouzi et al 2019 one may look for a threshold rain rate above and below which the runoff response is very different examination of the map hyetographs and the associated hydrographs for the may 2019 event points to a threshold of about 0 5 mm for this event the maximum 1 min map associated with the second peak was well above 0 5 mm for all three basins the maximum 1 min average of 10 min map on the other hand was well below 0 5 mm for jc and cc and stayed above 0 5 mm only for a single 10 min period for fc the above findings indicate that the swb used for rainfall runoff modelling in wrf hydro is sensitive to the temporal resolution of precipitation for moderate precipitation amounts due to the increased nonlinearity in runoff generation see eqs 1 2 and 11 4 3 experiment 3 impact of spatial resolutions of rainfall runoff modelling and routing in this experiment we compare the quality of the outlet simulations for peak flow and time to peak flow among the resolutions of 250 m 125 m and 50 m for routing with a common lsm resolution of 125 m and between the resolutions of 250 m and 125 m for lsm with a common routing model resolution of 125 m the 250 m lsm and 250 m routing model simulations referred to herein as the 250 m 250 m results are based on event specific calibration using sls with lhs one may hence consider the above calibration as based on quasi global optimization the 250 m lsm and 125 m routing simulations referred to herein as the 250 m 125 m results are based on event specific calibration using only sls in which the local search is started with the 250 m 250 m results one may hence consider the above calibration as local optimization of a priori parameter values from a coarser resolution as mentioned in section 3 it was not possible to calibrate at the 250 m lsm and 50 m routing resolution due to excessive computational requirements see table 3 the 250 m lsm and 50 m routing simulations referred to herein as the 250 m 50 m results are based on the parameter values borrowed from the 250 m 125 m results one may hence consider the above results as based solely on a priori parameter values transferred from a coarser resolution because the level of calibration is different from one resolution to another it is not very meaningful to compare the non event specific results for this reason we focus below on the event specific results only fig 7 a and b show the simulated peak flow vs the observed and the simulated time to peak flow vs the observed respectively as in fig 5 we overlay the 10 20 and 30 percent error lines in fig 7a and of 1 2 and 3 h of timing error lines in fig 7b to help assess the magnitude of the errors fig 7 indicates that the 250 m 250 m and 250 m 125 m results both of which are calibrated scale specifically are very similar and that for a number of events the 250 m 50 m results are not as good as the above two the above observations are perhaps not very surprising in that one may expect scale specific calibration to perform better than using parameter values borrowed from a lower resolution the magnitude of the errors in the 250 m 50 m results however is surprisingly large for a number of events to trace the potential sources of the error we examined the spatially distributed channel routing parameters including the channel grid flow accumulation flow direction and stream order at all resolutions it is seen that whereas the differences between 250 and 125 m are relatively small there are large differences between 50 m and the coarser resolutions to illustrate fig 8 a and b show the histograms of the stream order in the model domain at resolutions of 125 m and 50 m respectively the histogram at 250 m is similar to that at 125 m in the figure the frequency for the stream order of zero represents the number of grid boxes that do not contain any channel segments as one may expect at 50 m resolution the channel network is much denser and has more higher order streams wrf hydro prescribes the channel routing parameters according to the stream order as such changes in the channel density or stream order are very likely to change the conveyance characteristics of the channel network the above findings suggest that a combination of resolution specific prescription of the channel routing parameters and their calibration is likely to be necessary to benefit from very high resolution modeling using wrf hydro we also compared the 250 m 125 m results with the 125 m 125 m to assess the impact of increasing the lsm resolution as with the 250 m 125 m results the 125 m 125 m results are based on scale specific local optimization using sls in which the parameter values from the 250 m 125 m results are used as the starting point the comparison indicates that the 125 m 125 m results improve the peak flow prediction over the 250 m 125 m for the study basins but only marginally 4 4 experiment 4 impact of quality of ics in this experiment we assess how the quality of the ics of the rainfall runoff model may impact the accuracy of streamflow prediction a potential source of the ics in real time event based operation of wrf hydro is the warm states of the nwm a direct use in this experiment of the nwm warm states however is not likely to allow clear attribution at least for two reasons the first is that the usgs 24 category land cover see fig 1c and the mrms qpe zhang et al 2011 2016 used in nwm are of coarser resolution than those used in this work the second is that the model parameter values used in the nwm gochis et al 2019 are not the same as those used in wrf hydro in this work as such the ics from the nwm analysis are not likely to transfer cleanly to wrf hydro as implemented in this work as evidenced in experiments 1 through 3 above as a compromise we emulate the nwm analysis by running wrf hydro using the usgs 24 category land cover and nldas precipitation cosgrove et al 2003 in place of the nlcd land cover and casa qpe respectively the nldas precipitation has a much lower resolution than the 1 km 1 hr mrms qpe used by the nwm it is hence possible that the results from this experiment may somewhat inflate the positive impact of higher resolution precipitation the above experiment design nonetheless completely removes all model parametric uncertainties and hence makes possible unambiguous attribution in this experiment we start running wrf hydro at least several hours before the prediction time using the nldas precipitation and usgs 24 category land cover where the lower resolution nldas precipitation is disaggregated uniformly in space and time to a resolution of 250 m and 1 min the prediction time is chosen where the observed hydrograph begins to rise this is also when streamflow response is most sensitive to the ics at the prediction time we switch to the casa qpe and nlcd land cover for simulation over the forecast horizon for the above comparison run we assume average soil moisture conditions for the lsm and pre storm conditions for the hillslopes and channel routing models as obtained from event specific calibration see subsection 4 1 in the baseline run we run the model at 250 m 1 min resolution using the casa qpe and nlcd land cover for the entire simulation period any differences in the two simulated hydrographs over the forecast horizon are hence due solely to the ics valid at the prediction time fig 9 a shows the simulated vs observed peak flow for the nlcd black and usgs 24 category red land cover all other conditions are the same as in the baseline 250 m 250 m simulation the positive impact of higher resolution land cover is readily seen note that the differences are the smallest for jc which is identified mostly as urban by the usgs 24 category land cover in agreement with the nlcd see fig 1c d fig 9b shows the simulated vs observed peak flow for the casa black and nldas red qpe forced ics all other conditions are the same as in the baseline 250 m 250 m simulation note the very significant positive impact of higher resolution qpe particularly for cc and fc for feb 2018 and sep 2018 the two largest events among the five see fig 2 and table 1 examination of timing errors associated with fig 9a and 9b shows similarly positive impact of higher resolution qpe and to a lesser extent land cover 4 5 experiment 5 impact of updating ics via da in this experiment we assess how da may potentially be used to initialize wrf hydro for event based prediction in the real world it is generally not possible to schedule pre storm warmup runs as described in the 4th experiment instead it is necessary to be able to initialize the model on demand often without the aid of any a priori information the fixed lag smoother solved using enkf in this work is aimed at supporting such an operation for high resolution runs enkf is computationally expensive in this work all ensemble runs were made at the coarsest spatial resolution of 250 m for both the lsm and routing models limited sensitivity analysis suggests that a small ensemble size of 12 is generally acceptable for ensemble mean prediction owing to the very low dimensionality of the da formulation we then use the non event specific calibration results to emulate realistic model parametric uncertainty and predict streamflow with and without da due to the small sample size quantitative verification was not possible instead we critically examine the da aided predictions for those 5 cases for which the non event specific calibration results compare least favorably with the event specific in experiment 1 see fig 3 by far the largest potential value of da in urban flood prediction is improving peak flow and time to peak flow predictions when the streams first respond to rainfall accordingly we focus specifically on da aided predictions when the hydrograph begins to rise this is also the time when the degrees of freedom for signal for da rodgers 2000 is greatly reduced due to the generally reduced predictive skill of rainfall runoff and routing models and hence streamflow observations carry larger information content relative to the model prediction zupanski et al 2007 zupanski 2009 fig 10 shows the streamflow predictions without da red da aided ensemble predictions cyan the associated ensemble mean predictions blue ensemble streamflow analysis from da green and the verifying observed hydrographs empty blue circles for 4 of the 5 cases for which non event specific calibration produced very poor simulations in experiment 1 the case not shown in fig 10 due to space limitations is jc apr 2019 which is by far the smallest event of the 5 and is hence of lesser interest in the figure the vertical gray line indicates the prediction time which also marks the end of the assimilation window the horizontal extent of the ensemble analysis green shows the size of the assimilation window all streamflow and precipitation observations valid within the assimilation window are assimilated in these runs to update the soil moisture states valid at the prediction time all da results are based on single assimilation cycles to emulate on demand operation without the potential benefit of any previous da cycles the results indicate that da improves prediction for all 5 cases over the da unaided base predictions for the fc jan 2017 and cc feb 2018 events for which non event specific calibration very significantly over and under predict respectively da greatly improves prediction as noted in section 3 the primary source of error in peak flow or time to peak flow is the error in runoff volume the results indicate that da is largely able to reduce runoff volume errors by providing wrf hydro with high quality ics fig 10 shows however that the ensembles are significantly underspread in the recession limb due to lack of accounting of structural and parametric uncertainties and that wrf hydro is not able to reproduce the bimodal or attenuated peaks or the fast receding falling limbs in fc jan 2017 fig 10a and fc feb 2018 fig 10c the above results indicate that overall the fixed lag smoother is very effective in reducing runoff volume errors and hence errors in peak flow and time to peak flow 5 conclusions and future research recommendations we assess the impact of increasing the resolution of hydrologic modeling calibration of selected model parameters and assimilation of streamflow observations toward event based high resolution urban flood modeling and prediction using wrf hydro in the dallas fort worth area dfw we use quantitative precipitation estimates qpe at 500 m 1 min resolution from the collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere casa operation for observed rainfall the stepwise line search for calibration and ensemble kalman filter enkf implementation of fixed lag smoothing for data assimilation da the model domain is a 144 6 km2 area comprising 3 urban catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in the middle of dfw the main findings conclusions and recommendations follow below event specific calibration of the 6 wrf hydro parameters identified in this work is largely successful in simulating hydrographs in the study area in particular the most important rising limbs it is less successful however for attenuated peaks or fast receding falling limbs a novel element in the above calibration is the inclusion of a conditional bias penalty in the objective function to improve simulation specifically of highly peaked hydrograph a spatial resolution of at least 250 m is necessary for the land surface model lsm to delineate small catchments and hence to capture catchment wide rainfall with acceptable accuracy increasing the resolution of the lsm from 250 m to 125 m showed marginal improvement the same resolution increase for the routing models showed little improvement increasing the routing resolution further to 50 m using parameter values borrowed from 125 m on the other hand increased errors for a number of cases due to large changes in channel grid and stream order the above findings suggest that to benefit from very high resolution modeling using wrf hydro a combination of resolution specific prescription and calibration of the channel routing parameters is likely to be necessary the high resolution casa qpe and the national land cover database nlcd land cover showed very significant and significant positive impact on streamflow simulation compared to the lower resolution north american land data assimilation system nldas qpe and usgs 24 category land cover respectively the above points out the importance of resolution consistent high quality initialization of wrf hydro for event based operation the enkf implementation of fixed lag smoother significantly reduced peak flow errors under realistic parametric uncertainty for predictions made when streams first respond to rainfall the da aided ensemble predictions are however significantly underspread in the recession limb due to lack of accounting of structural and parametric uncertainties the overall results suggest that in the absence of resolution specific prescription and calibration of channel routing parameters a resolution of 250 m for both the lsm and routing models is a good choice in terms of performance and computational requirements recall that the national water model currently runs routing at 250 m over the continental us the results also suggest that in the absence of high quality calibration and continuous simulation of streamflow da is necessary to initialize wrf hydro for event based operation for high resolution urban flood prediction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4512,the potential impacts of climate change on the water resources of the narmada basin in central india has been investigated using the soil and water assessment tool swat the existing dams in the river basin have been incorporated in the model setups calibration and validation the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment datasets for south asia cordex sa at 0 5 0 5 resolution for four time horizons viz 1970 05 historical 2006 40 near term 2041 70 mid term and 2071 99 end term under representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 has been used to investigate the changes in the future climate and simulation of future streamflow the proposed dams have also been incorporated for modeling the future developmental scenarios the scenario analysis based on the projected climate variables has led to the inference that the change in the precipitation pattern coupled with the warming trends maybe contributing towards higher variability in water availability a future scenario of lower water availability and higher water demands thus calls for optimal utilization of available water resources in the future so that the higher water demands can be satisfied with lower anticipated future flows various alternatives were explored for devising adaptation strategies using the engineering technical solutions in which the optimal water resources management approaches were explored using the simulation only and the genetic algorithm based simulation optimization approaches the simulation optimization framework based integrated reservoir operation of four reservoirs has led to better reservoir performance and the number of irrigation failures has decreased substantially from 92 to 12 during 2006 40 86 to 22 during 2041 70 and 89 to 10 during 2071 99 the hydropower failures have also decreased considerably from 202 to 96 during 2006 40 192 to 28 during 2041 70 and 179 to 67 during 2071 99 under the rcp8 5 scenario there were no failures in meeting the domestic water supply and environment flow demands this may be an important adaptation measure to address the issues of climate change impacts on the water resources in the future in the narmada basin keywords climate change reservoir operation simulation optimization narmada 1 introduction the global warming and the associated climate change are unequivocal and as per the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc guidelines the global surface temperature for the end of the 21st century is likely to exceed 1 5 c relative to the average over 1850 1900 for most rcp scenarios dankers and feyen 2008 ipcc 2013 water resources are one of the key sectors driving the agriculture dominated indian economy the climate change impacts on water resources are ought to affect the agriculture sector and livelihood of the rural masses very few studies have been carried for the assessment of climate change impacts on the water availability of indian basins with appropriate solutions to address these issues most of the reported works investigated the trends in the climate data particularly precipitation and temperature goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta and rajeevan 2008 rajeevan et al 2008 kumar et al 2010 dash et al 2011 panda et al 2013 2014 the climate change impact on the future water resources have been evaluated by many researchers by driving the hydrological models with the future climate datasets from global climate models gcms and or regional climate models rcms arnell 2003 jha 2004 milly et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 fujihara et al 2007 bae

the water resources development scenario in madhya pradesh m p india is an interesting case as many river basins are proposed to undergo major development activities an unprecedented development phase in terms of hydro infrastructural development is being planned narmada basin is one such basin where 30 major projects are being planned to tap the vast potential of the river system an assessment of the future water availability is necessary to ascertain the sustainability of these planned projects under the scenarios of climate change related impacts and associated uncertainties however very few studies have been carried out for the assessment of climate change impacts in the narmada basin gosain et al 2006 2011 both these studies have projected a considerable decrease in precipitation and water yield during the future time horizons most of the studies have not considered the basin interventions dams in their climate change impact assessments moreover appropriate adaptation strategies need to be devised to provide meaningful solutions to the stakeholders and policymakers reservoir management strategies considering the optimal utilization of future water resources as a climate change adaptation tool is an emerging area of interest the impact of climate change on the reservoir management has been reported by very few researchers christensen et al 2004 vicuña et al 2011 rehana and mujumdar 2012 huaringa alvarez et al 2014 pao shan et al 2014 vonk et al 2014 payne et al 2004 reported that climate change would result in alterations in reservoir operation policies in columbia river basin they suggested that the earlier reservoir refill combined with greater storage allocations can reduce climate change impacts to a great extent hoanh et al 2010 studied the impacts of climate change and development on the flow regimes in the mekong river basin they reported an increase in the mean annual temperature by 0 7 c an increasing trend in the mean annual rainfall except in cambodia and mekong delta leading to an increase in the river flow during both wet and dry seasons in the lower mekong basin and increased inflows due to higher snowmelt rates in the upper mekong basin ghosh et al 2010 investigated the climate change impact on stream flows for the mahanadi river in odisha india under possible future climate change scenarios raje and mujamdar 2010 studied the climate change impacts on reservoir performance for the multipurpose hirakud reservoir on the mahanadi river and suggested revision of reservoir rules for floods in basins with increasing probability of droughts li et al 2010a li et al 2010b investigated the climate change impacts on the future stream flows and reservoir performance in north american priare watershed using system dynamics they projected higher peak flow events and abundant water resources in the future with no changes in the current reservoir operation rules minville et al 2010 studied the climate change impacts and their uncertainty on reservoir operations in the peribonka water resource system in quebec canada the results projected an increase in the annual reservoir inflow and a decrease in the annual hydropower production and suggested new adapted rules for operation lauri et al 2012 studied the impacts of climate change and development in mekong river basin using a distributed hydrological model and an optimization approach for reservoir operation and reported that the operation of large reservoirs was expected to have a larger impact on the hydrology than the impacts of climate change o neil et al 2013 after investigating the climate change impacts on hydropower operations in 54 reservoirs in the connecticut river basin reported that new reservoir operation policies would be required to factor in the climate change impacts and uncertainties gohari et al 2014 studied optimum reservoir operation changes and the adaptation of surface water supply under climate change in zayandeh rud river basin iran and reported decreased annual precipitation and streamflow with increased agricultural demands liu et al 2016 investigated the impacts of climate change on the hydropower potential in china and projected a change in the gross hydropower potential ghp in the range of 1 7 to 6 and 2 2 to 5 4 in the developed hydropower potential dhp they advocated the need for consideration of climate change assessments in the planning for hydropower development and operations soundharajan et al 2016 used a monte carlo simulation approach to evaluate the uncertainties in climate change induced variability of reservoirs for the pong reservoir in the beas river basin in india they reported a highly variable required reservoir capacity as the future climate becomes drier the impact of reservoir operation and climate change on the hydrological regime of the sesan and srepok rivers in the lower mekong basin was studied by ngo et al 2018 using climate change scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 they reported that climate change is likely to induce considerable changes in the stream flows and the related impacts may have both counterbalancing and reinforcing effects on reservoir operation rungee and kim 2017 carried out the assessment of climate change impacts on reservoir operations for the norris dam of the tennessee valley authority and concluded that the current operation policies will respond to climate change impacts without any risk of dam failure or inundation due to the increased projected runoff ehsani et al 2017 studied various storage capacity options for reservoir operation under a climate change scenario using a neural network based general reservoir operation scheme gops they developed an indicator of the effective degree of regulation edr by dams on water resources and expected it to increase in dry months as a consequence of climate change zamani et al 2017 investigated the climate change impacts on the optimal operation of jarreh reservoir in the south west of iran for the period from 2025 to 2054 and reported an increase in the agricultural water demand along with a considerable reduction in reservoir inflows in the future the modeling results depicted reduced reliability and increased vulnerability of the reservoir in the future abera et al 2018 evaluated the climate change impacts on the streamflow and reported increased inflows except during dry months under future climate scenarios they also studied the operation of the tekese hydropower reservoir in eastern nile and suggested that power storage potential can be increased by 25 30 by optimal reservoir operation policies the water resources management under an uncertain scenario of future water availability coupled with the higher water demands seems to be a challenging task therefore formulation of effective adaptation mechanisms for addressing the climate change associated impacts on water resources is necessary the study aims to investigate the of future water availability in the context of climate change and its related uncertainties so as to suggest appropriate solutions to manage the water resources in the future large number of water resources projects is planned in the study area to create additional storages for meeting the irrigation demands the changes in the rainfall pattern and incidences of higher extreme events and longer dry spells coupled with increased demands for irrigation and plans for water transfer outside the basin calls for a detailed investigation of future water availability so as to ascertain whether these additional storages will be useful to counter the adverse impacts of climate change this study proposes to investigate the impacts of reservoir operation and climate change on the flow regimes of the narmada basin in india explicitly to assess the impact of climate change on future water availability and extreme events swat a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model has been employed to study the impact of climate change using cordex sa climate datasets under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 future climate scenarios various possibilities for water resources management under the future climate change scenarios have been investigated viz i standalone reservoir operation by simulation only approach using nih resyp reservoir simulation model ii standalone reservoir operation by simulation optimisation approach using nih resyp and genetic algorithm optimiser and iii integrated operation of the existing reservoir and the proposed reservoirs by simulation optimisation approach using nih resyp and genetic algorithm optimiser a comparison of these strategies helped to understand that the adoption of the simulation optimisation approach considering the integrated operation of the existing and proposed reservoirs in tandem was the best suited strategy to address the issues of high flows due to extreme rainfall events coupled with long intervening dry spells low flows and droughts 2 material and methods 2 1 upper narmada basin the narmada basin located in madhya pradesh in central india between 72 53 to 81 75 e longitude and 21 33 to 23 75 n latitude extends over an area of 98 796 sq km the snow free perennial narmada river originates in the amarkantak plateau in shahdol district and drains to the arabian sea after traversing 1312 km the basin lies in three states of madhya pradesh maharashtra and gujarat with an aerial extent of 86 2 and 12 respectively the basin has three distinct physiographic zones namely the upper zone comprising of the hilly region the middle zone comprising of the plains region and the lower zone comprising of the lower hilly and lower plains the climate is generally humid with an annual rainfall of 1178 mm the upper zone of the basin mostly comprises shallow red and yellow soils of relatively low fertility while the middle zone comprises of deep black cotton soils which are fertile areas well suited for cultivation the net sown area in the basin is about 45 while about 32 of the basin is forested the index map of the narmada basin is given in fig 1 even though the assessment of the climate change signals in the observed datasets of rainfall and temperature have been carried out for the complete basin the future climate change impact assessments have been limited to narmada basin up to barmanghat as most of the water resources development projects are being planned in this region 2 2 hydrologic modeling 2 2 1 soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a semi distributed watershed model and used for performing simulations on a daily time scale for very long continuous periods arnold et al 1999 it can be used to assess the impacts of alternate management practices land use change and climate change on the water resources sediment and non point pollution in large river basins the spatial variability in the watershed is represented by dividing the basin into multiple sub basins which are further sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus which comprise of homogeneous land use topography soil characteristics and management practices neitsch et al 2002 the modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn model is used to estimate the surface runoff and the land cover is simulated using plant growth models the surface runoff q s u r f is estimated using the procedure and is given by 1 q s u r f p i a 2 p i a s f o r p i a e l s e q s u r f 0 0 where i a is the initial abstraction which includes the surface storage interception and infiltration prior to runoff in mm s is the soil moisture retention parameter in mm which generally varies spatially due to changes in the soil type land use pattern and management practices and varies temporally due to changes in water content the initial abstraction i a is commonly approximated as 0 2s but can vary depending on the soil type the cn is the curve number used for antecedent moisture condition ii amc ii for the day for the give land use land cover and hydrologic soil group the parameter s is related to the curve number cn by the scs equation given by 2 s 25400 c n 254 the retention parameter s varies according to the variation of soil water content in the soil profile the retention parameter s can also be assumed to vary with the accumulated plant evapotranspiration in swat cn is represented as cn2 which is the initial scs curve number for amc ii average condition for a 5 slope and is a function of the soil permeability and land use and varies depending on the antecedent moisture conditions in swat the cn2 can be updated in plant tillage and harvest kill operations the cn1 for amci dry condition and cn3 for amciii wet condition is given by 3 c n 1 c n 2 20 100 c n 2 100 c n 2 e x p 2 533 0 0636 100 c n 2 4 c n 3 c n 2 e x p 0 00673 100 c n 2 the curve number can be adjusted to account for different slopes williams 1995 given by 5 c n 2 s c n 3 c n 2 3 1 2 e x p 13 86 s l p c n 2 where cn2s is curve number for amcii adjusted for slope the overland and channel flow analysis uses manning s roughness coefficient and sediment yield is simulated using the modified universal soil loss equation musle the potential evapotranspiration pet is computed by any one of the three methods viz penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 or hargreaves and samani 1982 the flow calculations in the unsaturated zone use richard s equation whereas darcy s law and the mass conservation of 2d laminar flow are used for simulating the groundwater flow through saturated zone all processes in swat are based on the water balance given by 6 i 1 t p w ia i 1 t q surf e t q lf w seep q rf s h sw t sw o where sw t is the final soil water content on any day i mm sw o is the initial soil water content on a day i mm p is the precipitation amount on day i mm q surf is the surface runoff consequent to the precipitation in mm e t is the evapotranspiration on day i mm q lf is the lateral flow or interflow component mm w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm w ia is the irrigation application amount on day i mm and q rf s h is the return flow or base flow component mm the source of irrigation water can be from river reach reservoir shallow aquifer deep aquifer or a source from outside the watershed the source of irrigation water is specified from reservoir or groundwater depending on the irrigation water availability in the rainfed areas and command areas for this purpose the reservoir number and the sub basin number of the source is given to swat the actual irrigation water requirement in any hydrological response unit hru depends on the water deficit in the soil matrix the irrigation application is triggered by the specified soil water deficit threshold when the total water in the soil profile falls below the field capacity by more than the soil water deficit threshold an irrigation application occurs the amount of water available from the source is then compared to the water specified for an irrigation operation if the available water from the source is less than the water specified for irrigation operation then swat will only apply the available water however if the water availability from the source is more than the irrigation water demand then the irrigation demand is fully satisfied from the source the arcswat extension for arcgis 9 3 has been used for simulating the hydrology in narmada basin up to barmanghat the srtm dem at 90 m resolution land use land cover soil with three slope classes five land use classes and five soil classes have been considered for the derivation of hrus with threshold values for the sub basins as 25 which resulted in 96 sub basins and 232 hrus the meteorological data comprising of gridded daily rainfall and gridded minimum and maximum temperature have been imported into the model framework the reservoir properties along with the monthly outflows from the existing reservoirs viz bargi dam and matiyari dam along with the management operations have been added the model runs have been performed at monthly time steps from 1984 to 2000 with an initial warm up period of 4 years 2 2 2 multisite calibration validation and uncertainty analysis the multi site calibration of the swat model has been carried using the sufi 2 algorithm of swat cup software which combines parameter calibration and uncertainty prediction the input parameters in uncertainty are represented by uniform distributions whereas the model output uncertainty is quantified by the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu the global sensitivity analysis and one at a time sensitivity oat analysis were used to identify the most sensitive parameters and the non sensitive parameters were eliminated based on the p values and t statistic the curve number cn2 is the most sensitive parameter followed by groundwater delay gwdelay groundwater revap coefficient gw revap and threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn the other important parameters include available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc base flow alpha factor alpha bf and soil evaporation compensation factor esco the model parameter and input data uncertainty is represented by the 95ppu band and quantified by the p factor and r factor the 95ppu band ideally gets smaller with subsequent iteration during the calibration process a balance is maintained between the p factor and r factor such that the p factor does not become too small while the r factor remains high the desired parameter ranges are obtained when the p factor and the r factor does not change in the subsequent iterations 2 2 3 swat performance evaluation the model performance has been

to obtain multiple future outcomes in the desired hydrological variables the scenarios are a representation of the alternate possible ways in which the future may unfold the rcps are trajectories of greenhouse gases and pollutants resulting from human activities and land use change and provide a quantitative description of concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere and their radiative forcing in 2100 moss et al 2010 the four rcps viz rcp8 5 rcp6 rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 have been developed by a global community of integrated assessment modeling groups riahi et al 2011 masui et al 2011 thomson et

should be corrected before using the climate data for any impact assessment analysis the dynamic downscaling techniques adds bias to the downscaled climate data argüeso et al 2013 johnson and sharma 2012 piani et al 2010 randall et al 2007 teutschbein and seibert 2010 wood et al 2004 as the runoff response to the precipitation and temperature is non linear the biases in the climate data may lead to incorrect assessments of changes in the streamflow chen et al 2011 haddeland et al 2012 in the present study the quantile mapping qm technique has been used to bias correct the temperature and precipitation the method uses the cumulative density function cdf which maps the cdf of the rcm variable in the historical period 1970 2005 to the observed cdf which is the india meteorological department imd data during the same period 1970 2005 and then applies the same mapping to the cdf of the future rcm variable during near term mid term and end term time horizons the bias correction has been performed separately for each month 2 4 reservoir operation the reservoir simulation can be performed using the reservoir simulation models which require hydraulic particulars of the dam and inflows into the reservoir to estimate probable flow at 50 75 and 90 dependability for different months which is thereafter used for the derivation of initial rule curves the reservoir system package developed at the national institute of hydrology nih resyp has been applied for the monthly reservoir operation based on the initial rule curves derived from monthly reservoir inflows at various probability levels and monthly water demands jain et al 1998 2 4 1 derivation of rule curves bargi dam is a multipurpose reservoir with four types of water demands viz domestic demand environmental flow demand irrigation demand and hydropower demand four rule curves have been devised based on the respective demands and inflows into the reservoir during each month of the simulation period since the mandate of the bargi project is basically to cater to the irrigation demands fulfilling the irrigation demands are more important than meeting the hydropower demands during periods of lower water availability in the dam therefore the hydropower demand is the lowest priority demand as compared to irrigation demand and can be curtailed partially or completely during periods of water shortages however the domestic demands and environmental flow demands have to be satisfied at all times and are the highest priority demands therefore in the order of priorities the domestic demands and environmental flow demands have the highest priority followed by irrigation demands which are at the next priority followed by hydropower demand which has the least priority these priorities are reflected in the four rule curves viz a upper rule curve urc b first middle rule curve fmrc c second middle rule curve smrc and d lower rule curve lrc which have been derived such that there are minimum failures during the reservoir operation the lowest priority demand hydropower demands corresponds to fmrc whereas the highest priority demands domestic and environmental flow demands correspond to lrc the smrc corresponds to the irrigation demands and lies between fmrc and lrc priorities only come into play during periods of water shortages when the decision maker has to allocate water based on the priority of demands the urc basically corresponds to the reservoir fill policy and it has been kept at full reservoir level frl during the monsoon season and then computed based on 50 probable inflows all target demands evaporation losses and uncontrolled spills using the water balance equation as given in eq 12 the urc specifies the uppermost level to which the reservoir can be filled and water is spilled if the water level in the reservoir goes above the urc 12 storage end storage beginning i n f l o w d e m a n d e v a p o r a t i o n s p i l l s the fmrc has been set for the lower priority demand between hydropower and irrigation and the hydropower demand is accorded lowest priority for bargi reservoir the fmrc has been calculated using the 75 probable inflows full target demands evaporation losses and uncontrolled spills as given in eq 13 13 s t o r a g e b e g i n n i n g s t o r a g e e n d i n f l o w d e m a n d e v a p o r a t i o n s p i l l s if the reservoir water level during any month is above urc or fmrc then full supply can be made to meet the targeted demands of all users however if the reservoir water level is located between fmrc and smrc then supply for the hydropower demands have to be curtailed partially based on the specified curtailment factor such that the irrigation demands domestic demands and environmental flow demands are fully satisfied owing to this there shall be failures in meeting hydropower demands the smrc is derived when there are both irrigation and hydropower demands in addition to the domestic and environmental flow demands the smrc has been set for irrigation and has been calculated using the 75 probable inflows demands for irrigation environmental flows and domestic water supplies evaporation losses and uncontrolled spills using eq 13 if the water level in the reservoir is above the smrc releases are made to meet the full irrigation demands however if the reservoir water level is located between smrc and lrc then the hydropower demands are completely curtailed along with partial curtailment in irrigation demands based on the specified curtailment factor such that the domestic demands and environmental flow demands are fully satisfied owing to such situations there shall be failures in complete hydropower demands and few failures in irrigation demands the lrc is critical for water supply for domestic use and environmental flow requirements for the downstream river reaches the lrc has been calculated using the 90 probable inflows demands for environmental flows and domestic water supplies evaporation losses and uncontrolled spills using eq 13 however if the reservoir water level is located below lrc then both hydropower demands and irrigation demands are completely curtailed and only releases are made to satisfy the highest priority demands viz domestic demands and environmental flow demands in such cases there shall be failures in satisfying both hydropower demands and irrigation demands therefore the rule curves are designed in such a manner that the number of failures months during which any demand is not met is limited to a minimum possible the rule curves have been derived both based on the simulation only approach and simulation optimization approach the simulation only approach has been used to derive the best rule curves to obtain minimum failures to meet the various demands under the historical climate and future climate under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios a consistent increase in the number of failures in meeting the irrigation and hydropower demands across the whole time horizon and for all climate models was observed in the future time horizons therefore the simulation optimization framework has been used to derive a set of optimal reservoir operation policies 2 4 2 simulation only approach for operation of bargi reservoir the nih resyp software has been used for the simulation of the bargi reservoir the water demands comprise of irrigation demands hydropower demands domestic demands and environmental flow demands each of these individual demands have been estimated separately the irrigation demands have been estimated based on the cropping pattern and crop water requirement and the hydropower demands estimated based on the water utilized for actual hydropower generation the domestic demands have been estimated based on the water diverted to jabalpur city for drinking water supplies and the environmental flow demands have been estimated as a percentage of inflows into the reservoir during monsoon and non monsoon season 2 4 3 simulation optimisation framework the multi objective genetic algorithm moga which is a search based evolutionary algorithm has been used to generate the pareto optimal sets which eliminates the problems of local optima as genetic algorithms use randomized initialization and stochastic algorithm as the objective of the optimization of a multipurpose reservoir is to obtain solutions for the multi dimensional and multi objective problems the evolutionary algorithms which use the multi member approach is ideal for solving multi objective problems there are very few limited applications of genetic algorithms for optimization of real life water resource systems the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 has been employed in this study for the derivation of optimal rule curves for the multipurpose operation of the reservoir in the moga method firstly the population is initialized within the specified variable ranges after the evaluation of this population based on a non dominated sorting approach the generated alternatives are classified into different fronts the population members are ranked according to their fitness values f rank and are selected for genetic operation on a pair wise comparison to produce an offspring in the generation in this selection process if any pair is having the same rank then the crowded distance values f dist calculated using crowding distance assignment operator provides the basis and helps to maintain diversity in the population deb et al 2002 crossover and mutation operations are performed to change the attributes of the offspring the procedure is repeated for a pre specified number of generations to achieve a diverse set of non dominated solutions possibly attaining true pareto optimal solutions to preserve the best solutions obtained through generations and to speed up the convergence the algorithm uses elitism in which the combination of parents and offspring population are grouped into different fronts and the best individuals selected for the next generation 2 4 3 1 simulation optimisation framework for operation of bargi reservoir the simulation optimization framework based on the genetic algorithm ga is used to derive a set of optimal operation policies for the multipurpose bargi reservoir system in the narmada basin moga has been used to generate a pareto optimal set and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii principle has been used to apply moga for multi purpose reservoir operation problem as it provides an efficient sorting scheme for classifying the population into different fronts and good diversity preserving mechanism for non dominated solutions in the population this simulation optimization framework has been proposed for the standalone operation of the bargi dam the monthly water demands for water supply irrigation hydropower and environmental flow requirements along with the reservoir inflows evaporation area elevation capacity curve and the four initial rule curves were fed to the reservoir operation simulator nih resyp with the highest priority accorded for drinking water supplies and environmental flow requirements followed by irrigation water demands and the lowest priority was given to hydropower water demands the reservoir operation simulator is thereafter linked to the genetic algorithm based optimizer which takes 48 decision variables 4 rule curves 12 months for the bargi dam the objective function is to minimize the number of failures in meeting the domestic irrigation and hydropower demands the number of generations considered during the optimization was 10000 the optimized rule curves of the best simulation is thereafter used for the assessment of the performance of the reservoir operation 2 4 3 2 integrated operation of bargi and proposed reservoirs based on the various options tried for the operation of the bargi reservoir viz the simulation only approach and the simulation optimization approach the performance of the bargi reservoir is projected to deteriorate due to the lower inflows and its high variability in future an adaptive change in the operating rule curves in different time horizons suggested an improvement in the performance of the reservoir nonetheless the reliability of operation deteriorated as compared to the historical time horizon in this case too in such a scenario some other solutions need to be devised as possible adaptation mechanism so that the performance of the bargi reservoir does not get affected to a great extent in future therefore an integrated operation of the reservoir system is envisaged to address the impacts of climate chnage in the future the hypothesis is that if bargi dam along with the few proposed dams being planned upstream are operated on an integrated basis the reservoir operation performance can be improved for the future therefore as a pilot case raghavpur rosra basania and bargi dams were considered for integrated operation to study the effectiveness in improving the future reservoir performance the catchment area up to the upper narmada dam is 1174 83 km2 the free catchment area of raghavpur dam is 2053 17 km2 free catchment area of rosra dam is 1109 0 km2 and free catchment area of basanaia dam is 499 0 km2 the total catchment area up to the bargi dam is 14 556 km2 the swat model has been set up initially with the bargi dam but all the proposed dams were incorporated in swat along with their properties the model runs have been completed with the future climate data of all the six rcm s for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios the probable inflows and the environmental flow requirements have been computed at the raghavpur rosra basania and bargi dams the culturable command area under the various projects are as follows 245 010 ha under bargi dam right bank canal rbc 157000 ha under left bank canal lbc 4000 ha under raghavpur dam and 6000 ha under basania which totals to combined command area of 412 010 ha under the integrated raghavpur rosra basania bargi scheme which is being investigated the hydropower demands are 100 mw at bargi dam 17 mw at raghavpur dam 25 mw at rosra dam and 16 mw at basania dam the gross storage capacities are 3920 mcm for bargi dam 218 7 mcm for raghavpur 460 9 mcm for rosra and 195 mcm for basania dam here it is mentioned that at present the bargi reservoir is operated without any constraints as the domestic water supply demand is limited to 54 mcm from left bank canal lbc irrigation demands for lbc command area of 157 000 ha and hydropower demands for 100 mw power generation as the demands for the rbc are not being utilised due to delay in construction of the canal system however in the integrated operation scheme of the reservoirs the actual demands have been accounted which were much higher for the future viz 170 mcm for water supply demands 4 12 lakh hectares for irrigation hydropower demands for 158 mw power generation industrial demand of 40 mcm and environmental flow demands which have been mandatorily included the probable flows at 50 75 and 90 probability of exceedance have been computed for all the four dams the releases from the upstream located reservoirs raghavpur rosra and basania apart from meeting their high priority demands will also cater to the demands of the bargi reservoir 2 4 4 reservoir performance evaluation the performance of the reservoir has been evaluated based on reliability resilience and vulnerability the time reliability is the probability that a system state lies in the set of satisfactory states given as 14 r t p x t s where p is the probability x t is the system s state in the given time t and s is a set of satisfactory states the time or occurrence based reliability has been estimated by 15 r t 1 f p t p 0 r t 1 f p t p where r t is the estimate of time reliability and f p is the number of failure periods for a particular demand out of the total periods t p similarly the volume reliability has been estimated by 16 r v v s v d where r v is the volume reliability v s is the volume of water supplied released and v d is the volume of water demand the resilience is the ability of the system to recover from failure and a good system design helps the system to recover rapidly from the failure state and return it to a satisfactory state if s denotes the set of satisfactory states and f the set of unsatisfactory states then in the long run the number of transitions from the satisfactory states in s to unsatisfactory states in f must equal to the number of transactions in the reverse direction 17 p x t s a n d x t 1 f p x t f a n d x t 1 s the resilience γ is defined as the conditional probability of a recovery from the failure set in a single time step hashimoto et al 1982 and is given by 18 γ p x t 1 s x t f p x t f a n d x t 1 s p x t f alternatively resilience can also be defined as equal to the inverse of the mean value of the time the system spends in an unsatisfactory state 19 γ 1 m j 1 m d j 1 where d j is the duration of the jth failure event and m is the total number of failure events the vulnerability is a measure of likely damage in a failure event and refers to the likely magnitude of a possible failure although the design is more focussed on maximizing the reliability of the system with the minimum number of operation failures but this is always not feasible and in the process of maximizing the system s reliability and efficiency the vulnerability may also increase the vulnerability is given by 20 ν j f s j e j where e j is the probability of discrete failure x j corresponding to s j which is the most unsatisfactory and severe outcome in a set of unsatisfactory states f 3 results and discussion the multi site calibration has been performed using the daily streamflow data at dindori mohgaon manot patan belkheri and barmanghat from 1988 to 2000 the comparison of the observed and simulated monthly discharges along with the 95ppu band at dindori is given in fig 2 it can be observed that the model can simulate the flows with a reasonable degree of accuracy taking into consideration the uncertainties the model evaluation criteria suggest a very good simulation at dindori with nse of 0 85 very good 0 75 nse 1 00 rsr of 0 39 very good 0 00 rsr 0 50 and pbias of 7 48 very good pbias 10 the model evaluation statistics during the calibration are given in table 1 the model can simulate the flows accurately at manot as the peaks and the rising and recession limbs of the simulated and observed hydrographs closely resemble each other the time to peak and the magnitude of the peak flow has also been simulated satisfactorily the nse of 0 95 and the pbias of 8 91 both indicate a very good simulation similarly the rsr of 0 23 and r2 of 0 96 also indicate a very good simulation at manot the model performance during calibration at mohgaon is rather unsatisfactory with nse of 0 35 less than 0 50 pbias of 37 60 less than 25 and rsr of 0 81 0 70 further investigations were carried out to ascertain the cause for the same and it was found that the simulated and observed discharges were quite different during 1998 and 1999 therefore the rainfall data was checked and the rainfall at all the influencing rain gauges was compared for consistency the rainfall data was consistent at all the influencing rain gauge stations similarly the peak discharges at the mohgaon gauging was investigated in detail for 1998 and 1999 it was observed that peak discharges have not been recorded in the observed discharge data at mohgaon even though the rainfall at the influencing stations was high due to which the model was reporting higher discharges during 1998 and 1999 however the model was run with the independent data for validation since the discharge data during the validation period was free from such discrepancies the model reported better results during the validation phase the model performance at belkheri suggest a very good simulation with nse of 0 90 very good 0 75 nse 1 00 rsr of 0 32 very good 0 00 rsr 0 50 and pbias of 5 80 very good pbias 10 similarly the simulation at dindori also indicates a very good simulation whereas the simulation at patan indicates a satisfactory simulation with nse of 0 63 0 50 nse 0 65 and rsr of 0 61 0 60 rsr 0 70 the model has been able to simulate the flows at barmanghat with considerable accuracy considering the complexities due to the releases from the bargi dam and the irrigation in the command area the nse of 0 79 suggests a very good simulation 0 50 nse 0 65 whereas the rsr of 0 46 0 60 rsr 0 70 and pbias of 13 93 10 pbias 15 also indicates a good simulation the calibrated model has been run with the independent data for the period 2001 to 2005 after incorporating the calibrated parameters the comparison of the observed and simulated flows during validation at mohgaon is given in fig 3 it can be observed that the calibrated model can simulate the monthly flows reasonably well as the rising limbs peaks and the falling limbs of the simulated hydrographs resemble with the observed hydrographs this is also substantiated by the model evaluation statistics at mohgaon with nse of 0 90 rsr of 0 28 and pbias of 5 05 all of which indicate very good performance of the model simulations at mohgaon the model evaluation statistics at dindori nse 0 85 rsr 0 32 pbias 4 56 indicates a very good performance at manot nse 0 97 rsr 0 14 pbias 1 57 also indicates a very good performance whereas the model performance is good at belkheri with nse of 0 70 and rsr of 0 48 the model statistics at patan nse 0 68 rsr 0 51 indicate a satisfactory to good performance whereas the model evaluation statistics at barmanghat nse 0 79 rsr 0 28 pbias 8 33 indicates a very good model performance therefore the model can simulate the flows at all the six gauging sites with a reasonable degree of accuracy both during calibration and validation 3 1 scenario analysis 3 1 1 future temperature scenario the bias corrected future maximum and minimum temperature data have been analyzed further to investigate the temperature patterns during the future time horizons the monthly maximum temperature mmaxt 45 c mmaxt 40 c and mmaxt 35 c and monthly minimum temperature mmint 25 c have been evaluated the extreme events corresponding to mmaxt 45 c are projected to increase steadily in the future time horizons for all rcm s and the number of such events was projected to be substantially higher under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4 as the number of years of analysis was different during various time periods viz 1988 05 18 years 2006 40 35 years 2041 70 30 years and 2071 99 29 years the frequency of occurrence of these events is a better indicator for inter time horizon comparisons the frequency of occurrence of the events with mmaxt 45 c is expected to increase steadily from 1 in 3 5 years during 2006 40 to 1 in 2 60 years during 2071 99 under rcp4 5 scenario whereas under the rcp8 5 scenario it is expected to increase from 1 in 2 69 years during 2006 40 to 1 in 2 26 years during 2071 99 similarly the number of events corresponding to the mmint 25 c is projected to vary between 41 events during 1988 05 65 events during 2006 40 58 events during 2041 70 and 55 events during 2071 99 the temporal variation of the annual maximum temperature amaxt is given in fig 5 which projects a consistent warming trend during all future time horizons similar trends have been observed in the annual minimum temperature amint time series as well 3 1 2 future rainfall scenario the analysis of the bias corrected future rainfall data indicated considerable differences in the rainfall projections of individual rcm s due to the uncertainties involved in the model parameterizations differences in the parent gcm conceptualization and boundary conditions and inadequate representation of the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr pattern in these models however no particular trends have been observed in the annual rainfall arain and seasonal rainfall srain for all future time horizons the comparison of the occurrences of heavy rainfall p 100 mm day very heavy rainfall p 150 mm day extreme rainfall p 200 mm day and 1 day maximum rainfall based on the rcms ensemble mean is given in table 2 only marginal differences in the frequency of occurrence of the heavy very heavy and extreme rainfall events were noted during the future time horizons however the one day maximum rainfall is expected to increase from 258 0 mm during 2006 40 to 286 0 mm during 2041 70 and further increase to 324 5 mm during 2071 99 these projected changes will influence the runoff generation pattern which may have significant implications for the future water availability in the basin 3 1 3 future water availability scenario the swat model setup for the study area has been forced with the bias corrected climate data from the six rcm s for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios separately to simulate the streamflow during three future time horizons the simulations have been carried out with future climate scenarios along with the existing dams being already incorporated in the swat setup the monthly outflows at the existing gauging sites have been used to study the impact of climate change on the water availability scenario and extreme hydrological events in the future since the barmanghat gauging site is located downstream of the bargi dam the flow at barmanghat also incorporates the influence of the storage and release pattern of the bargi dam the annual dependable flow analysis has been carried out for all the six gauging sites based on the simulation outputs considering all the rcm s individually under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the extreme events high flows are characterized by the 5 and 10 dependable flows median flow by the 50 dependable whereas the 75 dependable flow is used for irrigation 90 dependable flow is used for hydropower and 100 dependable flows safe yield is used to design drinking water projects the rcm swat simulated future annual dependable flows during the three future time horizons have been compared with the swat simulated historical flows during 1988 05 to eliminate the swat model uncertainty in the comparisons between the historical and future time horizons these comparisons of annual dependable flow at barmanghat for the rcp8 5 scenario is given in fig 6 the comparison of 90 and the 75 dependable flow indicate significantly lower dependable flows during 2006 40 2041 70 and 2071 99 which may be a cause of concern regarding committed allocations to the various water users a marginal decrease in the future median flows is projected by and extent of 9 3 6 4 and 4 9 during 2006 40 2041 70 and 2071 99 respectively a similar pattern of reduced water availability is predicted at other gauging sites except at dindori another interesting feature is that the frequency of future drought events is projected to be much higher than the frequency of future wet events the increase in the maximum and minimum temperature the reduced high flows median flows and low flows figs 4 6 coupled with an increase in the extreme severe and moderate drought events is an indicator of the water stress in the basin for the future this calls for exploring innovative approaches for effective management of the available water resources by optimal operation of the existing reservoirs and proposed reservoirs to meet the shortfall in the future water availability 3 2 reservoir operation 3 2 1 simulation approach for operation of bargi reservoir under historical climate the operation of the reservoir with the fine tuned rule curves which have been obtained after several simulation runs for minimum failures suggested a reasonably reliable operation of the reservoir and reservoir performance statistics during the historical time horizon 1988 05 as given in table 3 the domestic water demands and environmental flow requirements efr could be met at all times but irrigation demands could not be met on few occasions viz 48 failures occurred with a time and volume reliability of 0 755 and 0 886 respectively however the irrigation failures can be limited to 30 when the supply is curtailed by 75 further there were 98 failures in meeting the hydropower demands with a time and volume reliability of 0 464 and 0 531 respectively 3 2 2 simulation approach for operation of reservoir bargi under future climate scenarios the performance of the bargi reservoir under the projected climate scenario was analyzed considering the same fine tuned rule curves derived based on the historical inflows for simulating the reservoir operation for future time horizons nih resyp has been used independently and not directly coupled with swat the future inflows into the reservoirs derived from swat has thereafter been used as input into nih resyp along with the water demands of various users for the operation of reservoirs both on a standalone basis and integrated basis the comparison of the reservoir operation performance under rcp8 5 during historical and future time horizons is given in table 4 failures to meet domestic water supply demands in the future time horizons were observed which is not an acceptable operational policy also a consistent increase in the failures corresponding to irrigation water supply is seen across all future time horizons and also for all climate models this increase is better understood by considering the percentage change for the number of failures in the historic time horizon as given in fig 7 it can be visualized that the projected failures in meeting the irrigation demands increase steadily from 3 39 during 2006 40 to 8 62 during 2071 99 under rcp4 5 scenario and from 5 18 during 2006 40 to 11 21 during 2071 99 under rcp8 5 scenario similarly the failures in meeting the hydropower demands are also projected to increase at a much higher rate from 4 96 during 2006 40 to 7 04 during 2071 99 under the rcp4 5 scenario and from 6 71 during 2006 40 to 13 37 during 2071 99 under rcp8 5 scenario thus it is very clear that the reservoir performance is expected to deteriorate in all future time horizons if the present operating policy is continued these increased failures in the future were based on the present water demands whereas these demands were expected to increase manifold in the future due to the development of additional command areas in regions outside the narmada basin through inter basin water transfer by the right bank canal of bargi dam this calls for devising appropriate adaptation mechanisms to optimally manage the available water resources in the future so that the reservoir performance is minimally affected and the committed allocations can be made available to the various competing users in the study area without much compromise some of the options which need to be investigated for the optimal performance of reservoir operations could be a to consider a simulation optimization framework for optimizing the rule curves for bargi reservoir in which the rule curves can be optimized through any of the optimization techniques like genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization ant colony optimization and b to consider the integrated operation of the reservoirs in the system along with the proposed dams within a simulation optimization framework for optimizing the combined operation of the reservoirs 3 2 3 simulation optimisation framework for operation of bargi reservoir under historical climate the simulation optimaisation framework has then been applied for the operation of bargi reservoir for historical climate during 1988 05 the number of generations considered during the optimization was 10000 the optimized rule curve of the best simulation is used for the assessment of the performance of the bargi reservoir under the simulation optimization approach during 1988 05 which is given in table 5 the performance has improved largely as compared to the performance under the simulation only approach with the standard operating policy as there were no failures of domestic water supply and environmental flow demands reduction in irrigation failures from 48 to 27 which can further be limited to 20 with curtailment of supply to 75 and reduction in hydropower from 98 to 53 3 2 4 simulation optimisation framework for operation of bargi reservoir under future climate scenarios the performance of the reservoir operation for the future time horizons with the simulation optimization framework under the rcp8 5 is given in table 6 it can be observed that the number of failures obtained by the simulation optimization approach is significantly lower as compared to that using the simulation only approach see table 3 however using this approach also the number of failures have increased consistently for all future time horizons for instance the average irrigation failures have increased from 27 0 to 35 2 for historic 1988 05 and end term 2071 99 respectively similarly the average hydropower supply failures have increased from 53 to a maximum of 83 7 for the historic 1988 05 and end term 2071 99 respectively one of the major concerns is the failure to satisfy domestic water demands particularly during 2006 40 which is not an acceptable operation policy therefore the analysis shows that even though a better reservoir performance can be achieved by operating the bargi dam with the optimized rule curves obtained under the simulation optimization framework nevertheless some of the demands including the highest priority demands cannot be fully satisfied during future time horizons therefore an integrated operation of the proposed reservoirs along with the existing bargi reservoir may be another alternative to help improve the reliability of the water resources management in the future 3 2 5 integrated operation of reservoirs under historical climate a simulation optimization framework has been proposed for the integrated operation of the bargi dam along with the three dams located upstream viz raghavpur dam rosra dam and basania dam the raghavapur dam is located on the most upstream stretch followed by rosra dam basania dam and bargi dam the monthly water demands for domestic water supply irrigation hydropower and environmental flow requirements reservoir inflows evaporation area elevation capacity data and four initial rule curves at bargi dam along with the various demands area elevation capacity table reservoir inflows and initial rules curves at the three upstream dams along with the monthly demand factors were fed to the reservoir operation simulator the simulation optimization framework has been proposed for the integrated reservoir operation as given in fig 8 the objective function is to minimize the number of failures for various demands there were 228 parameters 48 decision variables 4 dams 12 demand factors 3 dams located upstream of bargi dam apart from this the minimum and maximum rule curves for all the four dams and the minimum and maximum demand factors for the 3 dams located upstream of the bargi dam were fed to the genetic algorithm optimizer the modified rule curve obtained from the optimizer goes back to the reservoir operation simulator and the iterative process continues for the specified number of 10 000 generations the optimized rule curves of the best simulation is subsequently used for the assessment of the performance of the integrated reservoir operation the performance of the integrated reservoir operation during 1988 05 is given in table 7 there were no failures of domestic water supply and environmental flow demands with the highest time and volume reliability the irrigation failures in bargi was lower at 14 which can be further reduced to 9 by curtailing the supply to 75 with the time and volume reliability of 0 931 and 0 946 respectively whereas only 68 failures corresponding to hydropower demands were observed with a time and volume reliability of 0 636 and 0 842 respectively the comparison of the number of failures encountered using the various approaches employed for reservoir operation is given in fig 9 the integrated operation of the reservoirs helps to achieve the best performance under the historical climate during 1988 05 it has been observed that the irrigation failures reduced from 48 failures under the bargi dam with a simulation only approach to 27 failures under the bargi dam with a simulation optimization framework which further reduced to 14 under the integrated reservoir operation with the simulation optimization framework this is a considerable enhancement in the reservoir performance for meeting out the irrigation demands most of the time with minimal failures a similar performance has been achieved in satisfying the hydropower demands with a reduction from 98 failures with the bargi simulation only approach to 53 failures with the bargi simulation optimization framework which marginally increased to 68 failures under the integrated simulation optimization framework also the irrigation failures were 107 at raghavpur dam which can be reduced to 16 failures by curtailment factor of 0 75 the irrigation failures were 49 at the basania dam which can be reduced to 15 failures by curtailment factor of 0 75 it is to be noted that the command area under both raghavpur dam 4000 ha and basania dam 6000 ha were considerably less as compared to the command areas of the bargi reservoir 4 07 lakh ha therefore if one plans for a conjunctive use of ground and surface water in the 10000 ha command areas under raghavpur and basania dams the demands from the bargi reservoir can be very well satisfied with the changes in water availability in the context of projected climate change in the future the integrated operation of all these four reservoirs with the main objective of meeting various demands at the bargi reservoir serves the purpose of satisfying the future water demands to the competing water users with minimum number failures as compared to the operation of bargi reservoir only under both simulation only and simulation optimization approaches the reservoir operation performance under four options considered viz bargi dam with simulation only approach integrated operation of four reservoirs with simulation only approach bargi dam with the simulation optimization framework and integrated operation of four reservoirs with simulation optimization framework has demonstrated the advantages which can be derived by adopting the scheme of the integrated operation of reservoirs with the simulation optimization framework the analysis therefore validates the hypothesis that the integrated operation of the reservoirs with the simulation optimization framework can help to achieve better reservoir operational performance it is to be noted here that the higher future water demands at each of the individual dam sites and that of bargi rbc and lbc including the proposed inter basin transfer have been considered for the integrated reservoir operation the integrated reservoir operation with the simulation optimization framework can address the issue of optimal water resources management in the study area wherein the water demand among the competing water users were met with the minimum number of failures based on the priority assigned for the various demands 3 2 6 integrated operation of reservoirs under future climate scenarios the integrated operation of the four reservoirs has been performed for the future time horizons using the simulation optimization framework the optimized rule curves under the simulation optimization framework for the integrated operation of the four reservoir system using ccsm4 based inflows under the rcp8 5 scenario is given in fig 10 a similar exercise has been followed in developing the rule curves for the reservoir operation based on the projected inflows for all time horizons by all rcms for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it is to be noted that with the simulation optimization framework based integrated reservoir operation with access1 0 based inflows under the rcp8 5 scenario the number of irrigation failures have decreased substantially from 92 to 12 during 2006 40 86 to 22 during 2041 70 and 89 to 10 during 2071 99 the hydropower failures have also decreased considerably from 202 to 96 during 2006 40 192 to 28 during 2041 70 and 179 to 67 during 2071 99 a similar performance of the integrated reservoir operation has been observed for all other rcm s a drastic improvement in the performance is seen when the reservoirs were operated in tandem as is reflected by the reduction in failures of domestic water supply irrigation and hydropower demands it can be observed that there were slight variations in the number of failures by different rcm s for the same time horizon due to the differences in the simulated inflow pattern obtained from various rcm s the reservoir operation performance with all three approaches viz a bargi simulation only b bargi simulation optimization and c integrated reservoir operation with the simulation optimization framework using the access1 0 rcm based projected inflows is illustrated in fig 11 the optimal rule curves have been derived for all the six rcms based on the inflows for both scenarios and three future time horizons and the range of the optimized rule curves is given in fig 12 these figures give a clear understanding of the range in which each of the rule curves may vary based on various rcms future climate scenarios and time horizons and can therefore be suitably employed for the optimal integrated operation of the reservoirs it has been observed that under the simulation optimization approach there were no projected failures in meeting the domestic water supply demands in the future during 2006 40 the average number of projected irrigation and hydropower failures respectively is expected to decrease from 98 and 202 under the bargi reservoir operation with the simulation only approach to 28 and 101 with the simulation optimization approach which is expected to further decrease to 30 and 90 under the integrated reservoir operation with the simulation optimization framework similar performance has been observed during 2041 70 and 2071 99 time horizons also it is amply demonstrated that the best performance with minimal failures is achieved under the integrated reservoir operation approach therefore the hypothesis of improved reservoir performance under future climate scenarios through the integrated operation of reservoirs based on the simulation optimization framework can be considered as an adaptation mechanism to help the decision makers to manage the water resources optimally 3 2 7 uncertainty the climate change impacts on the hydrology is generally investigated as a part of modeling chain in which the climate projections from multiple climate models under different greenhouse gas emissions scenario are used as inputs to hydrologic models the high sensitivity of hydrological processes to climate change increases the need for accuracy of climate simulations at the regional scale while there is not much disagreement in projected temperature increases simulated by different gcms for specific scenarios high variability and uncertainty is noticed in projected precipitation trends ipcc 2013 understanding the uncertainties involved in the modelling efforts for the assessment of the climate change impacts on the water resources will help the decision makers to formulate appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies the uncertainties in the modeling chain accrue from uncertainty in global climate models due to their different parameterization schemes uncertainty in the future greenhouse gas emission scenarios which would depend on how the world will evolve in the future uncertainty in the downscaling approaches adopted by different researchers uncertainty in bias correction techniques employed and hydrological model uncertainties to consider climate simulations at the regional scale and to avoid the uncertainties due to different downscaling techniques the dynamically downscaled future climate data of cordex sa simulations for south asia have been used the ensemble modeling approach provides a useful tool to address the uncertainty therefore future climate data from six rcms for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios have been utilized to understand the range of uncertainty across climate models and scenarios the uncertainty in the annual maximum temperature obtained from different rcms for the rcp8 5 scenario is portrayed in fig 5 the uncertainty in the future climate projections gets translated via the hydrologic model and is reflected in the predicted hydrologic variables as seen in fig 6 as such multiple future inflow series were obtained from the hydrologic model simulations which correspond to various rcms 6 rcms and various climate scenarios 2 scenarios the application of these multiple future reservoir inflow series in the reservoir operation simulator and optimizer results in multiple rule curves for different rcms and different scenarios the overall uncertainty is reflected in the rule curves derived for the future operation of the reservoir which is based on six rcms two rcp scenarios and three future time horizons as indicated in fig 12 which depicts the future rules curves for reservoir operation considering all the rcms all future time horizons and all rcp scenarios used in the analysis fig 12 a shows the uncertainty of the urc which is highest in the month of june however the uncertainty is considerably less in the monsoon months july to october when the reservoir is being filled as there is sufficient inflow in the river system to fill the reservoirs and meet the demands thereafter the uncertainty increases in the non monsoon months fig 12 b shows the uncertainty in the fmrc which represents the lowest priority demand i e water demand for hydropower generation which is highest during the monsoon months of august and september and thereafter it is almost uniform in the remaining non monsoon months similarly fig 12 c and d reflect the uncertainty in the smrc and lrc respectively which is highest during august and september 4 conclusion the comprehensive analyses have been carried out to assess the impact of climate change on future water availability and extreme events in the narmada basin the multi site calibration has been performed using swat and daily stream flows at dindori mohgaon manot patan belkheri and barmanghat from 1988 to 2000 the comparison of the observed and simulated flows during the calibration period was found to be satisfactory except at mohgaon the extreme temperature events were projected to increase steadily in the future time horizons for all the rcm s and the number of such events were projected to be substantially higher under the rcp8 5 scenario the one day maximum rainfall is projected to increase from 258 0 mm during 2006 40 to 286 0 mm during 2041 70 and thereafter increase further to 324 5 mm during 2071 99 a lower water availability scenario is projected for the future which is a cause of concern a consistent increase in the failures corresponding to the irrigation water supply is seen across all the future time horizons and also across all climate models therefore the water availability is projected to be under stress in all future time horizons coupled with a higher frequency of extreme events the frequency of drought events is projected to be much higher in comparison to the frequency of wet events appropriate adaptation mechanisms should therefore be devised looking into the scenario of higher rainfall variability lower water availability higher streamflow variability and more extreme events a genetic algorithm based simulation optimization framework has been developed for the multipurpose bargi reservoir system to derive optimal operation policies however all the demands cannot be fully met although better reservoir performance is achieved by operating the bargi dam with the optimized rule curves from the simulation optimization framework out of the many alternatives explored the integrated operation of the bargi dam along with basania rosra and raghavpur dams using the simulation optimization framework seems to be a feasible option as an enhanced reservoir performance for all future time horizons is achieved under the scenario of lower water availability and much higher water demands for inter basin transfer irrigation in additional command areas and additional hydropower generation this will probably serve as an apt adaptation strategy

4512,the potential impacts of climate change on the water resources of the narmada basin in central india has been investigated using the soil and water assessment tool swat the existing dams in the river basin have been incorporated in the model setups calibration and validation the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment datasets for south asia cordex sa at 0 5 0 5 resolution for four time horizons viz 1970 05 historical 2006 40 near term 2041 70 mid term and 2071 99 end term under representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 has been used to investigate the changes in the future climate and simulation of future streamflow the proposed dams have also been incorporated for modeling the future developmental scenarios the scenario analysis based on the projected climate variables has led to the inference that the change in the precipitation pattern coupled with the warming trends maybe contributing towards higher variability in water availability a future scenario of lower water availability and higher water demands thus calls for optimal utilization of available water resources in the future so that the higher water demands can be satisfied with lower anticipated future flows various alternatives were explored for devising adaptation strategies using the engineering technical solutions in which the optimal water resources management approaches were explored using the simulation only and the genetic algorithm based simulation optimization approaches the simulation optimization framework based integrated reservoir operation of four reservoirs has led to better reservoir performance and the number of irrigation failures has decreased substantially from 92 to 12 during 2006 40 86 to 22 during 2041 70 and 89 to 10 during 2071 99 the hydropower failures have also decreased considerably from 202 to 96 during 2006 40 192 to 28 during 2041 70 and 179 to 67 during 2071 99 under the rcp8 5 scenario there were no failures in meeting the domestic water supply and environment flow demands this may be an important adaptation measure to address the issues of climate change impacts on the water resources in the future in the narmada basin keywords climate change reservoir operation simulation optimization narmada 1 introduction the global warming and the associated climate change are unequivocal and as per the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc guidelines the global surface temperature for the end of the 21st century is likely to exceed 1 5 c relative to the average over 1850 1900 for most rcp scenarios dankers and feyen 2008 ipcc 2013 water resources are one of the key sectors driving the agriculture dominated indian economy the climate change impacts on water resources are ought to affect the agriculture sector and livelihood of the rural masses very few studies have been carried for the assessment of climate change impacts on the water availability of indian basins with appropriate solutions to address these issues most of the reported works investigated the trends in the climate data particularly precipitation and temperature goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta and rajeevan 2008 rajeevan et al 2008 kumar et al 2010 dash et al 2011 panda et al 2013 2014 the climate change impact on the future water resources have been evaluated by many researchers by driving the hydrological models with the future climate datasets from global climate models gcms and or regional climate models rcms arnell 2003 jha 2004 milly et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 fujihara et al 2007 bae et al 2008 asokan and dutta 2008 acreman et al 2009 praskievicz and chang 2009 ludwig et al 2009 teutschbein and seibert 2010 cloke et al 2010 chung et al 2011 eum and simonovic 2012 meenu et al 2013 the water resources development scenario in madhya pradesh m p india is an interesting case as many river basins are proposed to undergo major development activities an unprecedented development phase in terms of hydro infrastructural development is being planned narmada basin is one such basin where 30 major projects are being planned to tap the vast potential of the river system an assessment of the future water availability is necessary to ascertain the sustainability of these planned projects under the scenarios of climate change related impacts and associated uncertainties however very few studies have been carried out for the assessment of climate change impacts in the narmada basin gosain et al 2006 2011 both these studies have projected a considerable decrease in precipitation and water yield during the future time horizons most of the studies have not considered the basin interventions dams in their climate change impact assessments moreover appropriate adaptation strategies need to be devised to provide meaningful solutions to the stakeholders and policymakers reservoir management strategies considering the optimal utilization of future water resources as a climate change adaptation tool is an emerging area of interest the impact of climate change on the reservoir management has been reported by very few researchers christensen et al 2004 vicuña et al 2011 rehana and mujumdar 2012 huaringa alvarez et al 2014 pao shan et al 2014 vonk et al 2014 payne et al 2004 reported that climate change would result in alterations in reservoir operation policies in columbia river basin they suggested that the earlier reservoir refill combined with greater storage allocations can reduce climate change impacts to a great extent hoanh et al 2010 studied the impacts of climate change and development on the flow regimes in the mekong river basin they reported an increase in the mean annual temperature by 0 7 c an increasing trend in the mean annual rainfall except in cambodia and mekong delta leading to an increase in the river flow during both wet and dry seasons in the lower mekong basin and increased inflows due to higher snowmelt rates in the upper mekong basin ghosh et al 2010 investigated the climate change impact on stream flows for the mahanadi river in odisha india under possible future climate change scenarios raje and mujamdar 2010 studied the climate change impacts on reservoir performance for the multipurpose hirakud reservoir on the mahanadi river and suggested revision of reservoir rules for floods in basins with increasing probability of droughts li et al 2010a li et al 2010b investigated the climate change impacts on the future stream flows and reservoir performance in north american priare watershed using system dynamics they projected higher peak flow events and abundant water resources in the future with no changes in the current reservoir operation rules minville et al 2010 studied the climate change impacts and their uncertainty on reservoir operations in the peribonka water resource system in quebec canada the results projected an increase in the annual reservoir inflow and a decrease in the annual hydropower production and suggested new adapted rules for operation lauri et al 2012 studied the impacts of climate change and development in mekong river basin using a distributed hydrological model and an optimization approach for reservoir operation and reported that the operation of large reservoirs was expected to have a larger impact on the hydrology than the impacts of climate change o neil et al 2013 after investigating the climate change impacts on hydropower operations in 54 reservoirs in the connecticut river basin reported that new reservoir operation policies would be required to factor in the climate change impacts and uncertainties gohari et al 2014 studied optimum reservoir operation changes and the adaptation of surface water supply under climate change in zayandeh rud river basin iran and reported decreased annual precipitation and streamflow with increased agricultural demands liu et al 2016 investigated the impacts of climate change on the hydropower potential in china and projected a change in the gross hydropower potential ghp in the range of 1 7 to 6 and 2 2 to 5 4 in the developed hydropower potential dhp they advocated the need for consideration of climate change assessments in the planning for hydropower development and operations soundharajan et al 2016 used a monte carlo simulation approach to evaluate the uncertainties in climate change induced variability of reservoirs for the pong reservoir in the beas river basin in india they reported a highly variable required reservoir capacity as the future climate becomes drier the impact of reservoir operation and climate change on the hydrological regime of the sesan and srepok rivers in the lower mekong basin was studied by ngo et al 2018 using climate change scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 they reported that climate change is likely to induce considerable changes in the stream flows and the related impacts may have both counterbalancing and reinforcing effects on reservoir operation rungee and kim 2017 carried out the assessment of climate change impacts on reservoir operations for the norris dam of the tennessee valley authority and concluded that the current operation policies will respond to climate change impacts without any risk of dam failure or inundation due to the increased projected runoff ehsani et al 2017 studied various storage capacity options for reservoir operation under a climate change scenario using a neural network based general reservoir operation scheme gops they developed an indicator of the effective degree of regulation edr by dams on water resources and expected it to increase in dry months as a consequence of climate change zamani et al 2017 investigated the climate change impacts on the optimal operation of jarreh reservoir in the south west of iran for the period from 2025 to 2054 and reported an increase in the agricultural water demand along with a considerable reduction in reservoir inflows in the future the modeling results depicted reduced reliability and increased vulnerability of the reservoir in the future abera et al 2018 evaluated the climate change impacts on the streamflow and reported increased inflows except during dry months under future climate scenarios they also studied the operation of the tekese hydropower reservoir in eastern nile and suggested that power storage potential can be increased by 25 30 by optimal reservoir operation policies the water resources management under an uncertain scenario of future water availability coupled with the higher water demands seems to be a challenging task therefore formulation of effective adaptation mechanisms for addressing the climate change associated impacts on water resources is necessary the study aims to investigate the of future water availability in the context of climate change and its related uncertainties so as to suggest appropriate solutions to manage the water resources in the future large number of water resources projects is planned in the study area to create additional storages for meeting the irrigation demands the changes in the rainfall pattern and incidences of higher extreme events and longer dry spells coupled with increased demands for irrigation and plans for water transfer outside the basin calls for a detailed investigation of future water availability so as to ascertain whether these additional storages will be useful to counter the adverse impacts of climate change this study proposes to investigate the impacts of reservoir operation and climate change on the flow regimes of the narmada basin in india explicitly to assess the impact of climate change on future water availability and extreme events swat a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model has been employed to study the impact of climate change using cordex sa climate datasets under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 future climate scenarios various possibilities for water resources management under the future climate change scenarios have been investigated viz i standalone reservoir operation by simulation only approach using nih resyp reservoir simulation model ii standalone reservoir operation by simulation optimisation approach using nih resyp and genetic algorithm optimiser and iii integrated operation of the existing reservoir and the proposed reservoirs by simulation optimisation approach using nih resyp and genetic algorithm optimiser a comparison of these strategies helped to understand that the adoption of the simulation optimisation approach considering the integrated operation of the existing and proposed reservoirs in tandem was the best suited strategy to address the issues of high flows due to extreme rainfall events coupled with long intervening dry spells low flows and droughts 2 material and methods 2 1 upper narmada basin the narmada basin located in madhya pradesh in central india between 72 53 to 81 75 e longitude and 21 33 to 23 75 n latitude extends over an area of 98 796 sq km the snow free perennial narmada river originates in the amarkantak plateau in shahdol district and drains to the arabian sea after traversing 1312 km the basin lies in three states of madhya pradesh maharashtra and gujarat with an aerial extent of 86 2 and 12 respectively the basin has three distinct physiographic zones namely the upper zone comprising of the hilly region the middle zone comprising of the plains region and the lower zone comprising of the lower hilly and lower plains the climate is generally humid with an annual rainfall of 1178 mm the upper zone of the basin mostly comprises shallow red and yellow soils of relatively low fertility while the middle zone comprises of deep black cotton soils which are fertile areas well suited for cultivation the net sown area in the basin is about 45 while about 32 of the basin is forested the index map of the narmada basin is given in fig 1 even though the assessment of the climate change signals in the observed datasets of rainfall and temperature have been carried out for the complete basin the future climate change impact assessments have been limited to narmada basin up to barmanghat as most of the water resources development projects are being planned in this region 2 2 hydrologic modeling 2 2 1 soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a semi distributed watershed model and used for performing simulations on a daily time scale for very long continuous periods arnold et al 1999 it can be used to assess the impacts of alternate management practices land use change and climate change on the water resources sediment and non point pollution in large river basins the spatial variability in the watershed is represented by dividing the basin into multiple sub basins which are further sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus which comprise of homogeneous land use topography soil characteristics and management practices neitsch et al 2002 the modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn model is used to estimate the surface runoff and the land cover is simulated using plant growth models the surface runoff q s u r f is estimated using the procedure and is given by 1 q s u r f p i a 2 p i a s f o r p i a e l s e q s u r f 0 0 where i a is the initial abstraction which includes the surface storage interception and infiltration prior to runoff in mm s is the soil moisture retention parameter in mm which generally varies spatially due to changes in the soil type land use pattern and management practices and varies temporally due to changes in water content the initial abstraction i a is commonly approximated as 0 2s but can vary depending on the soil type the cn is the curve number used for antecedent moisture condition ii amc ii for the day for the give land use land cover and hydrologic soil group the parameter s is related to the curve number cn by the scs equation given by 2 s 25400 c n 254 the retention parameter s varies according to the variation of soil water content in the soil profile the retention parameter s can also be assumed to vary with the accumulated plant evapotranspiration in swat cn is represented as cn2 which is the initial scs curve number for amc ii average condition for a 5 slope and is a function of the soil permeability and land use and varies depending on the antecedent moisture conditions in swat the cn2 can be updated in plant tillage and harvest kill operations the cn1 for amci dry condition and cn3 for amciii wet condition is given by 3 c n 1 c n 2 20 100 c n 2 100 c n 2 e x p 2 533 0 0636 100 c n 2 4 c n 3 c n 2 e x p 0 00673 100 c n 2 the curve number can be adjusted to account for different slopes williams 1995 given by 5 c n 2 s c n 3 c n 2 3 1 2 e x p 13 86 s l p c n 2 where cn2s is curve number for amcii adjusted for slope the overland and channel flow analysis uses manning s roughness coefficient and sediment yield is simulated using the modified universal soil loss equation musle the potential evapotranspiration pet is computed by any one of the three methods viz penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 or hargreaves and samani 1982 the flow calculations in the unsaturated zone use richard s equation whereas darcy s law and the mass conservation of 2d laminar flow are used for simulating the groundwater flow through saturated zone all processes in swat are based on the water balance given by 6 i 1 t p w ia i 1 t q surf e t q lf w seep q rf s h sw t sw o where sw t is the final soil water content on any day i mm sw o is the initial soil water content on a day i mm p is the precipitation amount on day i mm q surf is the surface runoff consequent to the precipitation in mm e t is the evapotranspiration on day i mm q lf is the lateral flow or interflow component mm w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm w ia is the irrigation application amount on day i mm and q rf s h is the return flow or base flow component mm the source of irrigation water can be from river reach reservoir shallow aquifer deep aquifer or a source from outside the watershed the source of irrigation water is specified from reservoir or groundwater depending on the irrigation water availability in the rainfed areas and command areas for this purpose the reservoir number and the sub basin number of the source is given to swat the actual irrigation water requirement in any hydrological response unit hru depends on the water deficit in the soil matrix the irrigation application is triggered by the specified soil water deficit threshold when the total water in the soil profile falls below the field capacity by more than the soil water deficit threshold an irrigation application occurs the amount of water available from the source is then compared to the water specified for an irrigation operation if the available water from the source is less than the water specified for irrigation operation then swat will only apply the available water however if the water availability from the source is more than the irrigation water demand then the irrigation demand is fully satisfied from the source the arcswat extension for arcgis 9 3 has been used for simulating the hydrology in narmada basin up to barmanghat the srtm dem at 90 m resolution land use land cover soil with three slope classes five land use classes and five soil classes have been considered for the derivation of hrus with threshold values for the sub basins as 25 which resulted in 96 sub basins and 232 hrus the meteorological data comprising of gridded daily rainfall and gridded minimum and maximum temperature have been imported into the model framework the reservoir properties along with the monthly outflows from the existing reservoirs viz bargi dam and matiyari dam along with the management operations have been added the model runs have been performed at monthly time steps from 1984 to 2000 with an initial warm up period of 4 years 2 2 2 multisite calibration validation and uncertainty analysis the multi site calibration of the swat model has been carried using the sufi 2 algorithm of swat cup software which combines parameter calibration and uncertainty prediction the input parameters in uncertainty are represented by uniform distributions whereas the model output uncertainty is quantified by the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu the global sensitivity analysis and one at a time sensitivity oat analysis were used to identify the most sensitive parameters and the non sensitive parameters were eliminated based on the p values and t statistic the curve number cn2 is the most sensitive parameter followed by groundwater delay gwdelay groundwater revap coefficient gw revap and threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn the other important parameters include available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc base flow alpha factor alpha bf and soil evaporation compensation factor esco the model parameter and input data uncertainty is represented by the 95ppu band and quantified by the p factor and r factor the 95ppu band ideally gets smaller with subsequent iteration during the calibration process a balance is maintained between the p factor and r factor such that the p factor does not become too small while the r factor remains high the desired parameter ranges are obtained when the p factor and the r factor does not change in the subsequent iterations 2 2 3 swat performance evaluation the model performance has been

to obtain multiple future outcomes in the desired hydrological variables the scenarios are a representation of the alternate possible ways in which the future may unfold the rcps are trajectories of greenhouse gases and pollutants resulting from human activities and land use change and provide a quantitative description of concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere and their radiative forcing in 2100 moss et al 2010 the four rcps viz rcp8 5 rcp6 rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 have been developed by a global community of integrated assessment modeling groups riahi et al 2011 masui et al 2011 thomson et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011b in the present study cordex sa climate datasets have been used the cordex sa data comprises an ensemble of multiple downscaling models considering the multiple forcing gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 archive and is available at a finer resolution of 50 km 50 km the rcm datasets used in the study is based on the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam experiments driven by the gcm s viz australian community climate and earth system simulator version 1 0 access1 0 centre

should be corrected before using the climate data for any impact assessment analysis the dynamic downscaling techniques adds bias to the downscaled climate data argüeso et al 2013 johnson and sharma 2012 piani et al 2010 randall et al 2007 teutschbein and seibert 2010 wood et al 2004 as the runoff response to the precipitation and temperature is non linear the biases in the climate data may lead to incorrect assessments of changes in the streamflow chen et al 2011 haddeland et al 2012 in the present study the quantile mapping qm technique has been used to bias correct the temperature and precipitation the method uses the cumulative density function cdf which maps the cdf of the rcm variable in the historical period 1970 2005 to the observed cdf which is the india meteorological department imd data during the same period 1970 2005 and then applies the same mapping to the cdf of the future rcm variable during near term mid term and end term time horizons the bias correction has been performed separately for each month 2 4 reservoir operation the reservoir simulation can be performed using the reservoir simulation models which require hydraulic particulars of the dam and inflows into the reservoir to estimate probable flow at 50 75 and 90 dependability for different months which is thereafter used for the derivation of initial rule curves the reservoir system package developed at the national institute of hydrology nih resyp has been applied for the monthly reservoir operation based on the initial rule curves derived from monthly reservoir inflows at various probability levels and monthly water demands jain et al 1998 2 4 1 derivation of rule curves bargi dam is a multipurpose reservoir with four types of water demands viz domestic demand environmental flow demand irrigation demand and hydropower demand four rule curves have been devised based on the respective demands and inflows into the reservoir during each month of the simulation period since the mandate of the bargi project is basically to cater to the irrigation demands fulfilling the irrigation demands are more important than meeting the hydropower demands during periods of lower water availability in the dam therefore the hydropower demand is the lowest priority demand as compared to irrigation demand and can be curtailed partially or completely during periods of water shortages however the domestic demands and environmental flow demands have to be satisfied at all times and are the highest priority demands therefore in the order of priorities the domestic demands and environmental flow demands have the highest priority followed by irrigation demands which are at the next priority followed by hydropower demand which has the least priority these priorities are reflected in the four rule curves viz a upper rule curve urc b first middle rule curve fmrc c second middle rule curve smrc and d lower rule curve lrc which have been derived such that there are minimum failures during the reservoir operation the lowest priority demand hydropower demands corresponds to fmrc whereas the highest priority demands domestic and environmental flow demands correspond to lrc the smrc corresponds to the irrigation demands and lies between fmrc and lrc priorities only come into play during periods of water shortages when the decision maker has to allocate water based on the priority of demands the urc basically corresponds to the reservoir fill policy and it has been kept at full reservoir level frl during the monsoon season and then computed based on 50 probable inflows all target demands evaporation losses and uncontrolled spills using the water balance equation as given in eq 12 the urc specifies the uppermost level to which the reservoir can be filled and water is spilled if the water level in the reservoir goes above the urc 12 storage end storage beginning i n f l o w d e m a n d e v a p o r a t i o n s p i l l s the fmrc has been set for the lower priority demand between hydropower and irrigation and the hydropower demand is accorded lowest priority for bargi reservoir the fmrc has been calculated using the 75 probable inflows full target demands evaporation losses and uncontrolled spills as given in eq 13 13 s t o r a g e b e g i n n i n g s t o r a g e e n d i n f l o w d e m a n d e v a p o r a t i o n s p i l l s if the reservoir water level during any month is above urc or fmrc then full supply can be made to meet the targeted demands of all users however if the reservoir water level is located between fmrc and smrc then supply for the hydropower demands have to be curtailed partially based on the specified curtailment factor such that the irrigation demands domestic demands and environmental flow demands are fully satisfied owing to this there shall be failures in meeting hydropower demands the smrc is derived when there are both irrigation and hydropower demands in addition to the domestic and environmental flow demands the smrc has been set for irrigation and has been calculated using the 75 probable inflows demands for irrigation environmental flows and domestic water supplies evaporation losses and uncontrolled spills using eq 13 if the water level in the reservoir is above the smrc releases are made to meet the full irrigation demands however if the reservoir water level is located between smrc and lrc then the hydropower demands are completely curtailed along with partial curtailment in irrigation demands based on the specified curtailment factor such that the domestic demands and environmental flow demands are fully satisfied owing to such situations there shall be failures in complete hydropower demands and few failures in irrigation demands the lrc is critical for water supply for domestic use and environmental flow requirements for the downstream river reaches the lrc has been calculated using the 90 probable inflows demands for environmental flows and domestic water supplies evaporation losses and uncontrolled spills using eq 13 however if the reservoir water level is located below lrc then both hydropower demands and irrigation demands are completely curtailed and only releases are made to satisfy the highest priority demands viz domestic demands and environmental flow demands in such cases there shall be failures in satisfying both hydropower demands and irrigation demands therefore the rule curves are designed in such a manner that the number of failures months during which any demand is not met is limited to a minimum possible the rule curves have been derived both based on the simulation only approach and simulation optimization approach the simulation only approach has been used to derive the best rule curves to obtain minimum failures to meet the various demands under the historical climate and future climate under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios a consistent increase in the number of failures in meeting the irrigation and hydropower demands across the whole time horizon and for all climate models was observed in the future time horizons therefore the simulation optimization framework has been used to derive a set of optimal reservoir operation policies 2 4 2 simulation only approach for operation of bargi reservoir the nih resyp software has been used for the simulation of the bargi reservoir the water demands comprise of irrigation demands hydropower demands domestic demands and environmental flow demands each of these individual demands have been estimated separately the irrigation demands have been estimated based on the cropping pattern and crop water requirement and the hydropower demands estimated based on the water utilized for actual hydropower generation the domestic demands have been estimated based on the water diverted to jabalpur city for drinking water supplies and the environmental flow demands have been estimated as a percentage of inflows into the reservoir during monsoon and non monsoon season 2 4 3 simulation optimisation framework the multi objective genetic algorithm moga which is a search based evolutionary algorithm has been used to generate the pareto optimal sets which eliminates the problems of local optima as genetic algorithms use randomized initialization and stochastic algorithm as the objective of the optimization of a multipurpose reservoir is to obtain solutions for the multi dimensional and multi objective problems the evolutionary algorithms which use the multi member approach is ideal for solving multi objective problems there are very few limited applications of genetic algorithms for optimization of real life water resource systems the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 has been employed in this study for the derivation of optimal rule curves for the multipurpose operation of the reservoir in the moga method firstly the population is initialized within the specified variable ranges after the evaluation of this population based on a non dominated sorting approach the generated alternatives are classified into different fronts the population members are ranked according to their fitness values f rank and are selected for genetic operation on a pair wise comparison to produce an offspring in the generation in this selection process if any pair is having the same rank then the crowded distance values f dist calculated using crowding distance assignment operator provides the basis and helps to maintain diversity in the population deb et al 2002 crossover and mutation operations are performed to change the attributes of the offspring the procedure is repeated for a pre specified number of generations to achieve a diverse set of non dominated solutions possibly attaining true pareto optimal solutions to preserve the best solutions obtained through generations and to speed up the convergence the algorithm uses elitism in which the combination of parents and offspring population are grouped into different fronts and the best individuals selected for the next generation 2 4 3 1 simulation optimisation framework for operation of bargi reservoir the simulation optimization framework based on the genetic algorithm ga is used to derive a set of optimal operation policies for the multipurpose bargi reservoir system in the narmada basin moga has been used to generate a pareto optimal set and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii principle has been used to apply moga for multi purpose reservoir operation problem as it provides an efficient sorting scheme for classifying the population into different fronts and good diversity preserving mechanism for non dominated solutions in the population this simulation optimization framework has been proposed for the standalone operation of the bargi dam the monthly water demands for water supply irrigation hydropower and environmental flow requirements along with the reservoir inflows evaporation area elevation capacity curve and the four initial rule curves were fed to the reservoir operation simulator nih resyp with the highest priority accorded for drinking water supplies and environmental flow requirements followed by irrigation water demands and the lowest priority was given to hydropower water demands the reservoir operation simulator is thereafter linked to the genetic algorithm based optimizer which takes 48 decision variables 4 rule curves 12 months for the bargi dam the objective function is to minimize the number of failures in meeting the domestic irrigation and hydropower demands the number of generations considered during the optimization was 10000 the optimized rule curves of the best simulation is thereafter used for the assessment of the performance of the reservoir operation 2 4 3 2 integrated operation of bargi and proposed reservoirs based on the various options tried for the operation of the bargi reservoir viz the simulation only approach and the simulation optimization approach the performance of the bargi reservoir is projected to deteriorate due to the lower inflows and its high variability in future an adaptive change in the operating rule curves in different time horizons suggested an improvement in the performance of the reservoir nonetheless the reliability of operation deteriorated as compared to the historical time horizon in this case too in such a scenario some other solutions need to be devised as possible adaptation mechanism so that the performance of the bargi reservoir does not get affected to a great extent in future therefore an integrated operation of the reservoir system is envisaged to address the impacts of climate chnage in the future the hypothesis is that if bargi dam along with the few proposed dams being planned upstream are operated on an integrated basis the reservoir operation performance can be improved for the future therefore as a pilot case raghavpur rosra basania and bargi dams were considered for integrated operation to study the effectiveness in improving the future reservoir performance the catchment area up to the upper narmada dam is 1174 83 km2 the free catchment area of raghavpur dam is 2053 17 km2 free catchment area of rosra dam is 1109 0 km2 and free catchment area of basanaia dam is 499 0 km2 the total catchment area up to the bargi dam is 14 556 km2 the swat model has been set up initially with the bargi dam but all the proposed dams were incorporated in swat along with their properties the model runs have been completed with the future climate data of all the six rcm s for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios the probable inflows and the environmental flow requirements have been computed at the raghavpur rosra basania and bargi dams the culturable command area under the various projects are as follows 245 010 ha under bargi dam right bank canal rbc 157000 ha under left bank canal lbc 4000 ha under raghavpur dam and 6000 ha under basania which totals to combined command area of 412 010 ha under the integrated raghavpur rosra basania bargi scheme which is being investigated the hydropower demands are 100 mw at bargi dam 17 mw at raghavpur dam 25 mw at rosra dam and 16 mw at basania dam the gross storage capacities are 3920 mcm for bargi dam 218 7 mcm for raghavpur 460 9 mcm for rosra and 195 mcm for basania dam here it is mentioned that at present the bargi reservoir is operated without any constraints as the domestic water supply demand is limited to 54 mcm from left bank canal lbc irrigation demands for lbc command area of 157 000 ha and hydropower demands for 100 mw power generation as the demands for the rbc are not being utilised due to delay in construction of the canal system however in the integrated operation scheme of the reservoirs the actual demands have been accounted which were much higher for the future viz 170 mcm for water supply demands 4 12 lakh hectares for irrigation hydropower demands for 158 mw power generation industrial demand of 40 mcm and environmental flow demands which have been mandatorily included the probable flows at 50 75 and 90 probability of exceedance have been computed for all the four dams the releases from the upstream located reservoirs raghavpur rosra and basania apart from meeting their high priority demands will also cater to the demands of the bargi reservoir 2 4 4 reservoir performance evaluation the performance of the reservoir has been evaluated based on reliability resilience and vulnerability the time reliability is the probability that a system state lies in the set of satisfactory states given as 14 r t p x t s where p is the probability x t is the system s state in the given time t and s is a set of satisfactory states the time or occurrence based reliability has been estimated by 15 r t 1 f p t p 0 r t 1 f p t p where r t is the estimate of time reliability and f p is the number of failure periods for a particular demand out of the total periods t p similarly the volume reliability has been estimated by 16 r v v s v d where r v is the volume reliability v s is the volume of water supplied released and v d is the volume of water demand the resilience is the ability of the system to recover from failure and a good system design helps the system to recover rapidly from the failure state and return it to a satisfactory state if s denotes the set of satisfactory states and f the set of unsatisfactory states then in the long run the number of transitions from the satisfactory states in s to unsatisfactory states in f must equal to the number of transactions in the reverse direction 17 p x t s a n d x t 1 f p x t f a n d x t 1 s the resilience γ is defined as the conditional probability of a recovery from the failure set in a single time step hashimoto et al 1982 and is given by 18 γ p x t 1 s x t f p x t f a n d x t 1 s p x t f alternatively resilience can also be defined as equal to the inverse of the mean value of the time the system spends in an unsatisfactory state 19 γ 1 m j 1 m d j 1 where d j is the duration of the jth failure event and m is the total number of failure events the vulnerability is a measure of likely damage in a failure event and refers to the likely magnitude of a possible failure although the design is more focussed on maximizing the reliability of the system with the minimum number of operation failures but this is always not feasible and in the process of maximizing the system s reliability and efficiency the vulnerability may also increase the vulnerability is given by 20 ν j f s j e j where e j is the probability of discrete failure x j corresponding to s j which is the most unsatisfactory and severe outcome in a set of unsatisfactory states f 3 results and discussion the multi site calibration has been performed using the daily streamflow data at dindori mohgaon manot patan belkheri and barmanghat from 1988 to 2000 the comparison of the observed and simulated monthly discharges along with the 95ppu band at dindori is given in fig 2 it can be observed that the model can simulate the flows with a reasonable degree of accuracy taking into consideration the uncertainties the model evaluation criteria suggest a very good simulation at dindori with nse of 0 85 very good 0 75 nse 1 00 rsr of 0 39 very good 0 00 rsr 0 50 and pbias of 7 48 very good pbias 10 the model evaluation statistics during the calibration are given in table 1 the model can simulate the flows accurately at manot as the peaks and the rising and recession limbs of the simulated and observed hydrographs closely resemble each other the time to peak and the magnitude of the peak flow has also been simulated satisfactorily the nse of 0 95 and the pbias of 8 91 both indicate a very good simulation similarly the rsr of 0 23 and r2 of 0 96 also indicate a very good simulation at manot the model performance during calibration at mohgaon is rather unsatisfactory with nse of 0 35 less than 0 50 pbias of 37 60 less than 25 and rsr of 0 81 0 70 further investigations were carried out to ascertain the cause for the same and it was found that the simulated and observed discharges were quite different during 1998 and 1999 therefore the rainfall data was checked and the rainfall at all the influencing rain gauges was compared for consistency the rainfall data was consistent at all the influencing rain gauge stations similarly the peak discharges at the mohgaon gauging was investigated in detail for 1998 and 1999 it was observed that peak discharges have not been recorded in the observed discharge data at mohgaon even though the rainfall at the influencing stations was high due to which the model was reporting higher discharges during 1998 and 1999 however the model was run with the independent data for validation since the discharge data during the validation period was free from such discrepancies the model reported better results during the validation phase the model performance at belkheri suggest a very good simulation with nse of 0 90 very good 0 75 nse 1 00 rsr of 0 32 very good 0 00 rsr 0 50 and pbias of 5 80 very good pbias 10 similarly the simulation at dindori also indicates a very good simulation whereas the simulation at patan indicates a satisfactory simulation with nse of 0 63 0 50 nse 0 65 and rsr of 0 61 0 60 rsr 0 70 the model has been able to simulate the flows at barmanghat with considerable accuracy considering the complexities due to the releases from the bargi dam and the irrigation in the command area the nse of 0 79 suggests a very good simulation 0 50 nse 0 65 whereas the rsr of 0 46 0 60 rsr 0 70 and pbias of 13 93 10 pbias 15 also indicates a good simulation the calibrated model has been run with the independent data for the period 2001 to 2005 after incorporating the calibrated parameters the comparison of the observed and simulated flows during validation at mohgaon is given in fig 3 it can be observed that the calibrated model can simulate the monthly flows reasonably well as the rising limbs peaks and the falling limbs of the simulated hydrographs resemble with the observed hydrographs this is also substantiated by the model evaluation statistics at mohgaon with nse of 0 90 rsr of 0 28 and pbias of 5 05 all of which indicate very good performance of the model simulations at mohgaon the model evaluation statistics at dindori nse 0 85 rsr 0 32 pbias 4 56 indicates a very good performance at manot nse 0 97 rsr 0 14 pbias 1 57 also indicates a very good performance whereas the model performance is good at belkheri with nse of 0 70 and rsr of 0 48 the model statistics at patan nse 0 68 rsr 0 51 indicate a satisfactory to good performance whereas the model evaluation statistics at barmanghat nse 0 79 rsr 0 28 pbias 8 33 indicates a very good model performance therefore the model can simulate the flows at all the six gauging sites with a reasonable degree of accuracy both during calibration and validation 3 1 scenario analysis 3 1 1 future temperature scenario the bias corrected future maximum and minimum temperature data have been analyzed further to investigate the temperature patterns during the future time horizons the monthly maximum temperature mmaxt 45 c mmaxt 40 c and mmaxt 35 c and monthly minimum temperature mmint 25 c have been evaluated the extreme events corresponding to mmaxt 45 c are projected to increase steadily in the future time horizons for all rcm s and the number of such events was projected to be substantially higher under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4 as the number of years of analysis was different during various time periods viz 1988 05 18 years 2006 40 35 years 2041 70 30 years and 2071 99 29 years the frequency of occurrence of these events is a better indicator for inter time horizon comparisons the frequency of occurrence of the events with mmaxt 45 c is expected to increase steadily from 1 in 3 5 years during 2006 40 to 1 in 2 60 years during 2071 99 under rcp4 5 scenario whereas under the rcp8 5 scenario it is expected to increase from 1 in 2 69 years during 2006 40 to 1 in 2 26 years during 2071 99 similarly the number of events corresponding to the mmint 25 c is projected to vary between 41 events during 1988 05 65 events during 2006 40 58 events during 2041 70 and 55 events during 2071 99 the temporal variation of the annual maximum temperature amaxt is given in fig 5 which projects a consistent warming trend during all future time horizons similar trends have been observed in the annual minimum temperature amint time series as well 3 1 2 future rainfall scenario the analysis of the bias corrected future rainfall data indicated considerable differences in the rainfall projections of individual rcm s due to the uncertainties involved in the model parameterizations differences in the parent gcm conceptualization and boundary conditions and inadequate representation of the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr pattern in these models however no particular trends have been observed in the annual rainfall arain and seasonal rainfall srain for all future time horizons the comparison of the occurrences of heavy rainfall p 100 mm day very heavy rainfall p 150 mm day extreme rainfall p 200 mm day and 1 day maximum rainfall based on the rcms ensemble mean is given in table 2 only marginal differences in the frequency of occurrence of the heavy very heavy and extreme rainfall events were noted during the future time horizons however the one day maximum rainfall is expected to increase from 258 0 mm during 2006 40 to 286 0 mm during 2041 70 and further increase to 324 5 mm during 2071 99 these projected changes will influence the runoff generation pattern which may have significant implications for the future water availability in the basin 3 1 3 future water availability scenario the swat model setup for the study area has been forced with the bias corrected climate data from the six rcm s for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios separately to simulate the streamflow during three future time horizons the simulations have been carried out with future climate scenarios along with the existing dams being already incorporated in the swat setup the monthly outflows at the existing gauging sites have been used to study the impact of climate change on the water availability scenario and extreme hydrological events in the future since the barmanghat gauging site is located downstream of the bargi dam the flow at barmanghat also incorporates the influence of the storage and release pattern of the bargi dam the annual dependable flow analysis has been carried out for all the six gauging sites based on the simulation outputs considering all the rcm s individually under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the extreme events high flows are characterized by the 5 and 10 dependable flows median flow by the 50 dependable whereas the 75 dependable flow is used for irrigation 90 dependable flow is used for hydropower and 100 dependable flows safe yield is used to design drinking water projects the rcm swat simulated future annual dependable flows during the three future time horizons have been compared with the swat simulated historical flows during 1988 05 to eliminate the swat model uncertainty in the comparisons between the historical and future time horizons these comparisons of annual dependable flow at barmanghat for the rcp8 5 scenario is given in fig 6 the comparison of 90 and the 75 dependable flow indicate significantly lower dependable flows during 2006 40 2041 70 and 2071 99 which may be a cause of concern regarding committed allocations to the various water users a marginal decrease in the future median flows is projected by and extent of 9 3 6 4 and 4 9 during 2006 40 2041 70 and 2071 99 respectively a similar pattern of reduced water availability is predicted at other gauging sites except at dindori another interesting feature is that the frequency of future drought events is projected to be much higher than the frequency of future wet events the increase in the maximum and minimum temperature the reduced high flows median flows and low flows figs 4 6 coupled with an increase in the extreme severe and moderate drought events is an indicator of the water stress in the basin for the future this calls for exploring innovative approaches for effective management of the available water resources by optimal operation of the existing reservoirs and proposed reservoirs to meet the shortfall in the future water availability 3 2 reservoir operation 3 2 1 simulation approach for operation of bargi reservoir under historical climate the operation of the reservoir with the fine tuned rule curves which have been obtained after several simulation runs for minimum failures suggested a reasonably reliable operation of the reservoir and reservoir performance statistics during the historical time horizon 1988 05 as given in table 3 the domestic water demands and environmental flow requirements efr could be met at all times but irrigation demands could not be met on few occasions viz 48 failures occurred with a time and volume reliability of 0 755 and 0 886 respectively however the irrigation failures can be limited to 30 when the supply is curtailed by 75 further there were 98 failures in meeting the hydropower demands with a time and volume reliability of 0 464 and 0 531 respectively 3 2 2 simulation approach for operation of reservoir bargi under future climate scenarios the performance of the bargi reservoir under the projected climate scenario was analyzed considering the same fine tuned rule curves derived based on the historical inflows for simulating the reservoir operation for future time horizons nih resyp has been used independently and not directly coupled with swat the future inflows into the reservoirs derived from swat has thereafter been used as input into nih resyp along with the water demands of various users for the operation of reservoirs both on a standalone basis and integrated basis the comparison of the reservoir operation performance under rcp8 5 during historical and future time horizons is given in table 4 failures to meet domestic water supply demands in the future time horizons were observed which is not an acceptable operational policy also a consistent increase in the failures corresponding to irrigation water supply is seen across all future time horizons and also for all climate models this increase is better understood by considering the percentage change for the number of failures in the historic time horizon as given in fig 7 it can be visualized that the projected failures in meeting the irrigation demands increase steadily from 3 39 during 2006 40 to 8 62 during 2071 99 under rcp4 5 scenario and from 5 18 during 2006 40 to 11 21 during 2071 99 under rcp8 5 scenario similarly the failures in meeting the hydropower demands are also projected to increase at a much higher rate from 4 96 during 2006 40 to 7 04 during 2071 99 under the rcp4 5 scenario and from 6 71 during 2006 40 to 13 37 during 2071 99 under rcp8 5 scenario thus it is very clear that the reservoir performance is expected to deteriorate in all future time horizons if the present operating policy is continued these increased failures in the future were based on the present water demands whereas these demands were expected to increase manifold in the future due to the development of additional command areas in regions outside the narmada basin through inter basin water transfer by the right bank canal of bargi dam this calls for devising appropriate adaptation mechanisms to optimally manage the available water resources in the future so that the reservoir performance is minimally affected and the committed allocations can be made available to the various competing users in the study area without much compromise some of the options which need to be investigated for the optimal performance of reservoir operations could be a to consider a simulation optimization framework for optimizing the rule curves for bargi reservoir in which the rule curves can be optimized through any of the optimization techniques like genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization ant colony optimization and b to consider the integrated operation of the reservoirs in the system along with the proposed dams within a simulation optimization framework for optimizing the combined operation of the reservoirs 3 2 3 simulation optimisation framework for operation of bargi reservoir under historical climate the simulation optimaisation framework has then been applied for the operation of bargi reservoir for historical climate during 1988 05 the number of generations considered during the optimization was 10000 the optimized rule curve of the best simulation is used for the assessment of the performance of the bargi reservoir under the simulation optimization approach during 1988 05 which is given in table 5 the performance has improved largely as compared to the performance under the simulation only approach with the standard operating policy as there were no failures of domestic water supply and environmental flow demands reduction in irrigation failures from 48 to 27 which can further be limited to 20 with curtailment of supply to 75 and reduction in hydropower from 98 to 53 3 2 4 simulation optimisation framework for operation of bargi reservoir under future climate scenarios the performance of the reservoir operation for the future time horizons with the simulation optimization framework under the rcp8 5 is given in table 6 it can be observed that the number of failures obtained by the simulation optimization approach is significantly lower as compared to that using the simulation only approach see table 3 however using this approach also the number of failures have increased consistently for all future time horizons for instance the average irrigation failures have increased from 27 0 to 35 2 for historic 1988 05 and end term 2071 99 respectively similarly the average hydropower supply failures have increased from 53 to a maximum of 83 7 for the historic 1988 05 and end term 2071 99 respectively one of the major concerns is the failure to satisfy domestic water demands particularly during 2006 40 which is not an acceptable operation policy therefore the analysis shows that even though a better reservoir performance can be achieved by operating the bargi dam with the optimized rule curves obtained under the simulation optimization framework nevertheless some of the demands including the highest priority demands cannot be fully satisfied during future time horizons therefore an integrated operation of the proposed reservoirs along with the existing bargi reservoir may be another alternative to help improve the reliability of the water resources management in the future 3 2 5 integrated operation of reservoirs under historical climate a simulation optimization framework has been proposed for the integrated operation of the bargi dam along with the three dams located upstream viz raghavpur dam rosra dam and basania dam the raghavapur dam is located on the most upstream stretch followed by rosra dam basania dam and bargi dam the monthly water demands for domestic water supply irrigation hydropower and environmental flow requirements reservoir inflows evaporation area elevation capacity data and four initial rule curves at bargi dam along with the various demands area elevation capacity table reservoir inflows and initial rules curves at the three upstream dams along with the monthly demand factors were fed to the reservoir operation simulator the simulation optimization framework has been proposed for the integrated reservoir operation as given in fig 8 the objective function is to minimize the number of failures for various demands there were 228 parameters 48 decision variables 4 dams 12 demand factors 3 dams located upstream of bargi dam apart from this the minimum and maximum rule curves for all the four dams and the minimum and maximum demand factors for the 3 dams located upstream of the bargi dam were fed to the genetic algorithm optimizer the modified rule curve obtained from the optimizer goes back to the reservoir operation simulator and the iterative process continues for the specified number of 10 000 generations the optimized rule curves of the best simulation is subsequently used for the assessment of the performance of the integrated reservoir operation the performance of the integrated reservoir operation during 1988 05 is given in table 7 there were no failures of domestic water supply and environmental flow demands with the highest time and volume reliability the irrigation failures in bargi was lower at 14 which can be further reduced to 9 by curtailing the supply to 75 with the time and volume reliability of 0 931 and 0 946 respectively whereas only 68 failures corresponding to hydropower demands were observed with a time and volume reliability of 0 636 and 0 842 respectively the comparison of the number of failures encountered using the various approaches employed for reservoir operation is given in fig 9 the integrated operation of the reservoirs helps to achieve the best performance under the historical climate during 1988 05 it has been observed that the irrigation failures reduced from 48 failures under the bargi dam with a simulation only approach to 27 failures under the bargi dam with a simulation optimization framework which further reduced to 14 under the integrated reservoir operation with the simulation optimization framework this is a considerable enhancement in the reservoir performance for meeting out the irrigation demands most of the time with minimal failures a similar performance has been achieved in satisfying the hydropower demands with a reduction from 98 failures with the bargi simulation only approach to 53 failures with the bargi simulation optimization framework which marginally increased to 68 failures under the integrated simulation optimization framework also the irrigation failures were 107 at raghavpur dam which can be reduced to 16 failures by curtailment factor of 0 75 the irrigation failures were 49 at the basania dam which can be reduced to 15 failures by curtailment factor of 0 75 it is to be noted that the command area under both raghavpur dam 4000 ha and basania dam 6000 ha were considerably less as compared to the command areas of the bargi reservoir 4 07 lakh ha therefore if one plans for a conjunctive use of ground and surface water in the 10000 ha command areas under raghavpur and basania dams the demands from the bargi reservoir can be very well satisfied with the changes in water availability in the context of projected climate change in the future the integrated operation of all these four reservoirs with the main objective of meeting various demands at the bargi reservoir serves the purpose of satisfying the future water demands to the competing water users with minimum number failures as compared to the operation of bargi reservoir only under both simulation only and simulation optimization approaches the reservoir operation performance under four options considered viz bargi dam with simulation only approach integrated operation of four reservoirs with simulation only approach bargi dam with the simulation optimization framework and integrated operation of four reservoirs with simulation optimization framework has demonstrated the advantages which can be derived by adopting the scheme of the integrated operation of reservoirs with the simulation optimization framework the analysis therefore validates the hypothesis that the integrated operation of the reservoirs with the simulation optimization framework can help to achieve better reservoir operational performance it is to be noted here that the higher future water demands at each of the individual dam sites and that of bargi rbc and lbc including the proposed inter basin transfer have been considered for the integrated reservoir operation the integrated reservoir operation with the simulation optimization framework can address the issue of optimal water resources management in the study area wherein the water demand among the competing water users were met with the minimum number of failures based on the priority assigned for the various demands 3 2 6 integrated operation of reservoirs under future climate scenarios the integrated operation of the four reservoirs has been performed for the future time horizons using the simulation optimization framework the optimized rule curves under the simulation optimization framework for the integrated operation of the four reservoir system using ccsm4 based inflows under the rcp8 5 scenario is given in fig 10 a similar exercise has been followed in developing the rule curves for the reservoir operation based on the projected inflows for all time horizons by all rcms for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it is to be noted that with the simulation optimization framework based integrated reservoir operation with access1 0 based inflows under the rcp8 5 scenario the number of irrigation failures have decreased substantially from 92 to 12 during 2006 40 86 to 22 during 2041 70 and 89 to 10 during 2071 99 the hydropower failures have also decreased considerably from 202 to 96 during 2006 40 192 to 28 during 2041 70 and 179 to 67 during 2071 99 a similar performance of the integrated reservoir operation has been observed for all other rcm s a drastic improvement in the performance is seen when the reservoirs were operated in tandem as is reflected by the reduction in failures of domestic water supply irrigation and hydropower demands it can be observed that there were slight variations in the number of failures by different rcm s for the same time horizon due to the differences in the simulated inflow pattern obtained from various rcm s the reservoir operation performance with all three approaches viz a bargi simulation only b bargi simulation optimization and c integrated reservoir operation with the simulation optimization framework using the access1 0 rcm based projected inflows is illustrated in fig 11 the optimal rule curves have been derived for all the six rcms based on the inflows for both scenarios and three future time horizons and the range of the optimized rule curves is given in fig 12 these figures give a clear understanding of the range in which each of the rule curves may vary based on various rcms future climate scenarios and time horizons and can therefore be suitably employed for the optimal integrated operation of the reservoirs it has been observed that under the simulation optimization approach there were no projected failures in meeting the domestic water supply demands in the future during 2006 40 the average number of projected irrigation and hydropower failures respectively is expected to decrease from 98 and 202 under the bargi reservoir operation with the simulation only approach to 28 and 101 with the simulation optimization approach which is expected to further decrease to 30 and 90 under the integrated reservoir operation with the simulation optimization framework similar performance has been observed during 2041 70 and 2071 99 time horizons also it is amply demonstrated that the best performance with minimal failures is achieved under the integrated reservoir operation approach therefore the hypothesis of improved reservoir performance under future climate scenarios through the integrated operation of reservoirs based on the simulation optimization framework can be considered as an adaptation mechanism to help the decision makers to manage the water resources optimally 3 2 7 uncertainty the climate change impacts on the hydrology is generally investigated as a part of modeling chain in which the climate projections from multiple climate models under different greenhouse gas emissions scenario are used as inputs to hydrologic models the high sensitivity of hydrological processes to climate change increases the need for accuracy of climate simulations at the regional scale while there is not much disagreement in projected temperature increases simulated by different gcms for specific scenarios high variability and uncertainty is noticed in projected precipitation trends ipcc 2013 understanding the uncertainties involved in the modelling efforts for the assessment of the climate change impacts on the water resources will help the decision makers to formulate appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies the uncertainties in the modeling chain accrue from uncertainty in global climate models due to their different parameterization schemes uncertainty in the future greenhouse gas emission scenarios which would depend on how the world will evolve in the future uncertainty in the downscaling approaches adopted by different researchers uncertainty in bias correction techniques employed and hydrological model uncertainties to consider climate simulations at the regional scale and to avoid the uncertainties due to different downscaling techniques the dynamically downscaled future climate data of cordex sa simulations for south asia have been used the ensemble modeling approach provides a useful tool to address the uncertainty therefore future climate data from six rcms for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios have been utilized to understand the range of uncertainty across climate models and scenarios the uncertainty in the annual maximum temperature obtained from different rcms for the rcp8 5 scenario is portrayed in fig 5 the uncertainty in the future climate projections gets translated via the hydrologic model and is reflected in the predicted hydrologic variables as seen in fig 6 as such multiple future inflow series were obtained from the hydrologic model simulations which correspond to various rcms 6 rcms and various climate scenarios 2 scenarios the application of these multiple future reservoir inflow series in the reservoir operation simulator and optimizer results in multiple rule curves for different rcms and different scenarios the overall uncertainty is reflected in the rule curves derived for the future operation of the reservoir which is based on six rcms two rcp scenarios and three future time horizons as indicated in fig 12 which depicts the future rules curves for reservoir operation considering all the rcms all future time horizons and all rcp scenarios used in the analysis fig 12 a shows the uncertainty of the urc which is highest in the month of june however the uncertainty is considerably less in the monsoon months july to october when the reservoir is being filled as there is sufficient inflow in the river system to fill the reservoirs and meet the demands thereafter the uncertainty increases in the non monsoon months fig 12 b shows the uncertainty in the fmrc which represents the lowest priority demand i e water demand for hydropower generation which is highest during the monsoon months of august and september and thereafter it is almost uniform in the remaining non monsoon months similarly fig 12 c and d reflect the uncertainty in the smrc and lrc respectively which is highest during august and september 4 conclusion the comprehensive analyses have been carried out to assess the impact of climate change on future water availability and extreme events in the narmada basin the multi site calibration has been performed using swat and daily stream flows at dindori mohgaon manot patan belkheri and barmanghat from 1988 to 2000 the comparison of the observed and simulated flows during the calibration period was found to be satisfactory except at mohgaon the extreme temperature events were projected to increase steadily in the future time horizons for all the rcm s and the number of such events were projected to be substantially higher under the rcp8 5 scenario the one day maximum rainfall is projected to increase from 258 0 mm during 2006 40 to 286 0 mm during 2041 70 and thereafter increase further to 324 5 mm during 2071 99 a lower water availability scenario is projected for the future which is a cause of concern a consistent increase in the failures corresponding to the irrigation water supply is seen across all the future time horizons and also across all climate models therefore the water availability is projected to be under stress in all future time horizons coupled with a higher frequency of extreme events the frequency of drought events is projected to be much higher in comparison to the frequency of wet events appropriate adaptation mechanisms should therefore be devised looking into the scenario of higher rainfall variability lower water availability higher streamflow variability and more extreme events a genetic algorithm based simulation optimization framework has been developed for the multipurpose bargi reservoir system to derive optimal operation policies however all the demands cannot be fully met although better reservoir performance is achieved by operating the bargi dam with the optimized rule curves from the simulation optimization framework out of the many alternatives explored the integrated operation of the bargi dam along with basania rosra and raghavpur dams using the simulation optimization framework seems to be a feasible option as an enhanced reservoir performance for all future time horizons is achieved under the scenario of lower water availability and much higher water demands for inter basin transfer irrigation in additional command areas and additional hydropower generation this will probably serve as an apt adaptation strategy

pluvial flooding fine scale climate model simulations are needed the number of such simulations is however still limited and not widely available thus entailing the downscaling of the model outputs one of the commonly used methods to meet this demand is statistical downscaling where the statistical properties of large r scale climate simulations are used to derive local climate variables this study focuses on applying a distribution based bias correction method on regional climate model rcm simulations to explore how climate change affects extreme precipitation and urban flood events at the end of this century 2071 2100 a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model implemented in infoworks icm is used to simulate pluvial flood events for several return periods for a case study in the city of antwerp in belgium the results show that the statistical downscaling approach can effectively decrease the bias in the model simulations and offer strong scaling relations to derive high resolution extreme precipitation time series the analyses also reveal that climate change may cause an increase of 16 31 47 63 73 and 84 in the flood volume for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively this projected increase in the flood volume enlarges the inundated area by 32 49 56 58 58 and 59 for the respective return periods the flood frequency is also projected to almost double in the future so that a 5 year flood event in the historical period will most likely be a 2 year event in the future period keywords climate change signals extreme precipitation statistical downscaling scaling relation urban flood inundation 1 introduction the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 proclaimed that anthropogenic global warming reached approximately 1 c in 2007 compared to the preindustrial eras which consequently led to an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme events kirchmeier young et al 2019 tabari et al 2020 dong et al 2020 the need to understand the impact of climate change on the extremes has therefore become one of the substantial issues over the last two decades in the water and risk management sectors several studies have shown that the frequency of occurrence and magnitude of heavy precipitation increase by the end of the 21st century based on climate model projections ipcc 2013 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 liu et al 2020 the atmospheric saturation water vapor pressure holds a major role which leads to an increase of extreme precipitation at a rate of 6 7 per degree of surface warming according to the clausius clapeyron c c relation westra et al 2014 ban et al 2015 lenderink and fowler 2017 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 this intensified precipitation phenomenon has boosted up the risk of flooding ashley et al 2005 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a which is also in line with societal concerns regarding extreme precipitation derived floods being one of the catastrophic natural hazards globally ahern et al 2005 knapp et al 2008 hallegatte et al 2013 westra et al 2014 pluvial flooding in urban areas has a higher likelihood due to the greater prevalence of tarmacked and paved surfaces leading to fast runoff processes and short response times ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 and a higher impact due to the density of buildings and people houston et al 2011 the hydrological processes in urban catchments are known to have high spatial and temporal variabilities making them sensitive to local scale variability of precipitation in space and time cristiano et al 2017 the magnitude of the hydrological sensitivities to climate conditions entails climate change impact assessments on the hydrologic cycle the extensive interdependencies between different infrastructure systems in urban areas penny et al 2018 as well as the spatial and temporal scale dependence of climate change signals for extreme precipitation tabari et al 2016 tabari and willems 2018 kirchmeier young et al 2019 make the urban hydrological analysis of climate change impacts more challenging the likelihood of urban pluvial flooding events has been found to increase as a result of anthropogenic climate change maksimović et al 2009 skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 pregnolato et al 2017 effective adaptation strategies for intensified flood events can be implemented only when the nature of the climate change impact is well understood huong and pathirana 2013 climate variables e g precipitation from climate models in combination with hydraulic models are used to project future climate change impacts on urban flooding the primary source for future climate projections lies in the output of general circulation models gcms the resolution of gcm simulations in the order of 100 300 km is inadequate for this purpose as it lacks detailed regional information which is essential to resolve local processes at the catchment scale teutschbein and seibert 2012 parameterization is used when the horizontal grid spacing of gcms fails to resolve the processes which often causes bias in the model simulations and thereof a flawed impact assessment tabari 2019 the gcm outputs thus cannot be directly used for a local climate change impact study for urban flooding ahmed et al 2013 downscaling is an approach to circumvent the intrinsic inadequacy of gcms to represent the fine scale physical processes in order to sort out the incompatibility between the model simulations and the resolution required for impact assessments it assumes a strong influence of large r scale weather on the local scale one but by disregarding any counter effects from the local scale maraun et al 2010 in this regard regional climate models rcms with a spatial scale typically between 50 and 12 km have been developed as a downscaled version of gcms to provide climate change information more suitable for impact studies luo et al 2018 specific to the european area a high resolution rcm ensemble within the world climate research program coordinate regional downscaling experiment euro cordex has been established jacob et al 2014 the finest resolutions of the euro cordex rcms are 3 hourly temporal resolution and 12 km spatial resolution while the spatial and temporal resolutions of rcms are far higher than those of gcms which enable them to reproduce some essential mesoscale patterns of observed precipitation and reflect the topographical dependence of precipitation frei et al 2006 they are still too coarse to meet the scale needed for the urban flood analysis for example design applications in urban hydrology require precipitation time series with a fine temporal scale of a few minutes and a spatial scale of 1 km schilling 1991 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 in addition rcms have shown a systematic bias in the simulation of extreme precipitation characteristics mishra et al 2014 prein et al 2015 berg et al 2019 stemming from their incapacity to represent many mesoscale atmospheric processes leading to extreme precipitation episodes lehtonen et al 2014 the rcm simulations must therefore be further adapted to account for the finer scale requirements and the systematic bias a range of bias correction approaches from simple to sophisticated ones have been developed which mostly focus on mean precipitation e g bárdossy and pegram 2011 johnson and sharma 2012 and only a few of them correct the bias in rcm simulations of extreme precipitation e g rojas et al 2011 or of both mean and extreme precipitation e g maity et al 2019 the bias correction has been applied either directly on extreme precipitation simulations of rcms hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b or indirectly on the factors associated with extreme precipitation such as the lateral boundary conditions outputs of driving gcms of rcm simulations e g xu and yang 2012 kim et al 2020 and the synoptic circulation patterns associated with extreme precipitation e g li et al 2018 this study makes use of a direct bias correction approach based on probability distribution parameters which implements the corrections on the parameters derived from extreme precipitation of different durations due to the scarcity of fine temporal resolution precipitation data from climate models previous urban flood studies have mostly used daily precipitation data from gcms e g zhou et al 2018 2019 duan and gao 2019 or rcms e g martínez gomariz et al 2019 by making a time scale independence assumption for climate change signals the time scale independence assumption implies that the changes in the intensity of daily extreme precipitation are identical to that of sub daily extremes required for the urban flood modeling this assumption has however recently been violated by reported intensified precipitation changes from daily to sub daily scales sunyer et al 2015 tabari et al 2016 innocenti et al 2019 hodnebrog et al 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b wood and ludwig 2020 and a super c c scaling of sub daily extreme precipitation with warming compared to a c c scaling of daily extremes lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 berg et al 2013 förster and thiele 2020 some other studies have used disaggregation methods to derive fine scale precipitation series from gcm simulations needed for climate change impact assessments on urban flooding zahmatkesh et al 2015 tavakol davani et al 2016 lu and qin 2020 medeiros de saboia et al 2020 this study looks further into the statistical downscaling by the downscaling of rcm precipitation simulations by a distribution based approach using the relations between statistical distribution parameters and storm duration bias correction and temporal statistical downscaling approaches are combined to assess the impact of climate change on urban flooding the future climate change impact for the period 2071 2100 is assessed by taking into account the generated floods from the downscaled extreme precipitation simulations for several return periods a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model built for the sewer system of the city of antwerp in belgium is used to simulate pluvial floods based on composite hydrographs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the case study considered here is the city of antwerp which is historically at a vulnerable state to flooding several flood events were recorded in 2013 and 2014 and the worst one happened in may 2016 situated within the north west of the european coastal areas antwerp has a temperate maritime climate with cool summers and moderate winters the city is inhabited with approximately 512 000 people within its total area of 204 5 km2 although only 11 6 km2 is the main focus of this study the dominant land use greater than 80 is the continuous urban fabric class with impermeable land covers i e urban structures transport networks and artificially surfaced areas laid next to the scheldt river the city of antwerp is formed with a generally flat surface throughout the city area mees et al 2016 with a land slope of 0 003 li and willems 2020 the city s drainage system is a gravity driven branched and mostly a combined system which is also accompanied with hydraulic structures such as weirs and orifices li and willems 2020 2 2 data 2 2 1 observation data we use rainfall data recorded at uccle 50 8 n 4 4 e which is the main station of the royal meteorological institute of belgium rmi it holds long term high frequency homogeneous series measured from 1898 by a hellmann fuess recording unshielded raingauge demarée 2003 and continued to present date the station is located on the top of a hill 101 m a s l in an urbanized area in the south of brussels de jongh et al 2006 the measured rainfall data is available at the frequency of 10 min providing a unique opportunity for the temporal downscaling the continues long term high quality and fine scale precipitation data from uccle station have been frequently used for hydraulic design applications in the country e g willems 2013 as well as climate studies over europe e g arnbjerg nielsen et al 2015 förster and thiele 2020 for this study the precipitation data dating from 1971 to 2000 are considered to be consistent with the historical simulation period of rcms besides uccle station hourly precipitation data from several other meteorological stations located in deurne herentals melsele and wilrijk are used these stations are located around the studied area in antwerp owing to the close proximity of these stations with uccle station and a relatively flat topography of flanders precipitation at the studied stations is expected to follow a similar pattern the long term precipitation data are not available at these additional stations and the observed data from 2008 to 2019 is considered and used to validate the bias corrected results of the climate models conducted based on uccle records 2 2 2 climate model data a set of five climate model simulations from the euro cordex initiatives at 0 11 horizontal resolutions are used in this study the data set derives from the rca4 rcm model developed at the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi strandberg et al 2014 and has five driving coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 gcms cnrm cm5 ec earth ipsl cm5a mr hadgem2 es and mpi esm lr the climate model outputs from 1971 to 2000 is considered as the historical period and 2071 2100 as the future period we use the data at 3 hourly temporal resolution under the representative concentration pathway rcps rcp8 5 representing the high level of greenhouse gas concentrations by the year 2100 the rcm data are extracted for the model grid cell covering the city of antwerp using the nearest neighbor algorithm 2 3 methods the methodological framework of this study is represented in fig 1 the methodology can be broadly divided into two parts statistical downscaling and hydrodynamic modelling in the first part the downscaling follows a two step statistical downscaling procedure which can be broken down into i bias correction and ii temporal downscaling 2 3 1 extreme value analysis despite having the ability to represent the climate system rcms are commonly known to have a bias in their simulations thus before using the simulations as the basis of climate impact studies they need to be statistically adjusted primarily based on the model performance assessment of the current climate räty et al 2014 several methods have been developed to correct the bias in climate model simulations chen et al 2011 johnson and sharma 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2012 these methods range from simple scaling approaches to rather well developed distribution methods by utilizing probability mapping techniques luo et al 2018 the methods were initially designed to downscale gcm simulations however they are also applicable to tailor the rcm outputs a distribution based bias correction method is therefore used in this study to downscale the euro cordex rcm outputs this study uses the peak over threshold pot approach for extreme precipitation analyses it was shown that the pot series can be approximated most precisely with a generalized pareto distribution gpd hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b the cumulative distribution function f x of gpd for pot extremes x is given as follows 1 f x 1 1 ξ x μ σ f o r ξ 0 1 exp x μ σ f o r ξ 0 where µ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and ξ is the shape parameter the gpd parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle in the pot method independent extremes need to be selected for sub daily precipitation tabari et al 2016 the independent pot series is selected in this study based on an interevent time of 12 h willems 2009 it implies that two successive precipitation peaks within the same day or night are considered as one extreme event and the larger value is chosen in other words two consecutive precipitation extremes are interpreted to be independent based on this criterion when the time between the two events exceeds 12 h to date though the threshold choice is crucial for the pot method selection of the threshold remains rather subjective tabari 2021 for the threshold selection compromises between bias and variance need to be found the choice of a high threshold will result in a less number of events included in the series leading to a high variance of the distribution parameter estimation although the likelihood of pot independence will increase lang et al 1999 oppositely a lower threshold hence a larger number of events selected will affect the asymptotic basis of the model leading to a higher bias bommier 2014 nagy et al 2017 the common practice to choose the threshold is to opt for the smallest possible value where it yields a reasonable parameter approximation maposa et al 2017 as suggested by davison and smith 1990 a graphical method known as the mean residual life plot based on the mean of the gpd can be used as a threshold selection tool given that u u0 the threshold choice is valid for all excesses over the threshold 2 e x u 0 x u 0 σ u 1 ξ σ u 0 ξ u 1 ξ which for all u u0 the mean residual life plot should visually show linearity to the excess distribution where the gpd also delivers a plausible parameter approximation the empirical mean excess life plot is however defined as 3 u 1 n u i 1 n u x i u u x max where nu is the number of events that exceed the threshold u and xmax is the largest of the xi coles 2001 besides the mean residual plot another commonly used graphical method is the parameter stability plot the key takeaway of this plot is that if the exceedances of a high threshold u0 follow a gpd with parameters ξ and σu0 then for every u such that u u0 the exceedances still follow a gpd with ξu ξ and σu σu0 ξ u u0 bommier 2014 presuming that u0 is properly high threshold this parameterization will not depend on u any longer the parameter stability plot is defined by the locus of points as 4 u σ u x max a n d u ξ u u x max where σ is defined as 5 σ σ u ξ u u the chosen threshold should be at the value where the other two gpd parameters are persistent hence by defining u0 as a suitable threshold for asymptotic approximation the estimation for σ and ξu are also constant for all u u0 2 3 2 distribution based downscaling the bias correction and temporal downscaling of extreme precipitation are performed based on the gpd distribution parameters for the former bias correction factors bc are first derived for the gpd distribution parameters as the gpd parameter of the observation data over the model simulations for the same duration d which can be described as follows 6 b c μ d μ d o b s μ d m o d e l 7 b c σ d σ d o b s σ d m o d e l 8 b c ξ d ξ d o b s ξ d m o d e l where the established bias correction factors are applied to correct the bias in the distribution parameters of the future simulations subsequently the return levels of the future corresponding to return periods of 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 years are approximated by using the corrected gpd parameters coles 2001 courty et al 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a assuming that the scaling relations found in the observations also hold for the future the established scaling relation is applied to the projected precipitation time series kristvik et al 2019 the scaling relation between the extreme events of finer and coarser time scale precipitation is established by taking into account the observed fine time scale precipitation the fractal theory and scale invariance principle gupta and waymire 1990 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 in the temporal downscaling of rcms suggest that the statistical properties of precipitation at different scales can be linked and therefore be expressed as 9 α λ d λ β α d where α denotes the estimated distribution parameter d is the time scale λ is the scaling factor and β is the scaling exponent the scaling exponent is constant and equal to the slope length of the linear regression between the estimated parameter and the duration in a log log space in a simple scaling case yu et al 2004 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 the scaling relation also holds for the distribution quantiles gupta and waymire 1990 as highlighted by menabde et al 1999 and courty et al 2019 it is assumed that µ σ and ξ scale with d according to a power law relation as 10 μ a d α 11 σ b d β 12 ξ c d γ where d is the duration in hours a and α are the scaling parameters for µ b and β are the scaling parameters for σ and c and γ are the scaling parameters for ξ in this study the scaling relationships obtained from uccle data are validated based on the sub daily data from some other stations after validation distribution parameters derived from the scaling relationships of the uccle observations for aggregation levels ranging between 10 min and 15 days are used to generate rcm simulations for time scales finer than 3 h i e 2 hourly hourly 30 min and 10 min 2 3 3 hydrodynamic model for the city of antwerp wherever urban area is concerned it is necessary to represent the complexity of urban surfaces in a realistic way maksimović et al 2009 the integration of the sewer flow surface 1d with flow simulation 2d has proved to perform well in representing the flooding process van dijk et al 2014 the advantage of using the hydrodynamic model relies on its high adaptiveness to the physical and systemic characteristics changes as it is built based on a detailed physical process of the drainage system aside from that the model also allows for the realistic representation of the flood extent which is highly beneficial when it comes to communicating flood hazard and risk results to the greater audience teng et al 2017 li and willems 2020 the detailed 1d 2d hydrodynamic model of the city surface and the sewer network is implemented by using infoworks icm innovyze 2017 which was validated and updated following the established regional regulations hydronaut procedure aquafin 2017 based on continuous discharge and water level measurements over several years at critical locations in the network the 1d 0d model covers the city of antwerp and the surrounding districts while the 1d 2d model covers only the main city center of antwerp as shown in fig 2 the 2d surface flood simulation results were validated based on crowdsource data newspapers disaster journalists social media and fire brigade records of the city of antwerp current and future precipitation simulations are used as inputs to the hydrodynamic model to simulate the current and future flooding events a storm composite hydrograph is used to tackle the issues of too detailed model and too long period time series in order to have shorter simulation time the composite storms are synthetic storms that include a t year precipitation intensity for all possible durations of uniformly distributed precipitation series over the urban catchment rosbjerg and madsen 2019 the composite storms in this study are constructed using the chicago method keifer and chu 1957 whose design procedure and characteristics are provided by vaes et al 2001 based on the intensity duration frequency idf curves derived from the bias corrected distribution parameters the shallow water equation swe is applied in the hydrodynamic model to pinpoint the 2d flow where it assumes that the flow is horizontal at the start of simulations and the velocity over the said coordinate can be set aside innovyze 2017 the surface is represented as a 2d mesh in order to portray a flood map of the surface the runoff is distributed to the 2d mesh and thus dispatched to the 1d 2d links and the sewer network the type of the surface areas roads buildings and permeable surfaces is represented by the software s built in features area take off ato it enables the automatic calculation of the runoff surface area of the corresponding sub catchment to the systems where they are connected storm sanitary or foul by taking the information from the imported gis innovyze 2017 the digital elevation model dem with a high resolution of 1 m is used to precisely represent the city s urban topography the detailed number of the structural component of the sewer network represented in the model can be seen in table s1 several classes of the surface identified as streets permeable impermeable buildings and water are used for the surface classification the reservoirs dimensions modelled as flood cones are estimated from the surface dem this simplification approach is done to maximize the computational efficiency while maintaining a good accuracy of the results bermúdez et al 2018 li and willems 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 threshold choice for the pot method the choice of the threshold in the pot method holds a pivotal role to estimate the gpd parameters the threshold should indeed correspond to the number of the selected data so that it should not be either too high or too low the threshold is chosen based on 13 percentile levels 95 95 5 96 96 5 97 97 5 98 98 5 99 99 2 99 4 99 6 and 99 8 two graphical methods of mean residual life plot and parameter stability plot are used in order to get the optimum threshold the mean residual life plot for 10 minute precipitation at uccle station is shown in fig 3 the mean exceedance above threshold for 10 minute precipitation at uccle station is constant from 95th to 97th percentile however the mean exceedance value starts to increase almost linearly with percentile when thresholds of 97 5th are chosen thus based on this provision result the threshold choice should be derived from the 97th percentile as the endpoint of the straight line on the plot from 95th to 97th percentile before it becomes unstable as the precipitation become very extreme 97 5th to 99 8th percentile the parameter stability plot consists of plotting the modified scale eq 5 and the shape parameter against the varying thresholds percentile for threshold in our case for the same range of quantiles as the mean residual life plot according to fig 4 both the modified scale and shape parameter show the same result as the mean residual life plot from the 95th to 97th percentile the parameter estimations are constant before it increases linearly with the percentile level based on these results the threshold choice of the 97th percentile is considered as the optimum threshold choice which could compromise between the biases and the variance for the gpd parameter estimation as another prerequisite for the pot method independent pots were selected effectively from all of the pots fig s1 as expected the precipitation values for the all pots and independent pots cases diverge for lower quantiles implying that dependent pots are found more at the lower quantiles 3 2 gpd parameters and their relations with storm duration for every aggregation level the selected pot events are fitted to a gpd based on the chosen threshold resulting in three parameters of location scale and shape these results are plotted in the double logarithmic plot to see whether the scaling method is applicable or not both scale fig 5 a and location fig 5b parameters proved to have an exponential relation with the duration as it is obvious from their linear relation with the duration on a double logarithmic plot therefore a downscaling approach based on gpd location and scale parameters following eqs 10 and 11 can be used by applying the scaling exponent noted in each figure on the contrary the shape parameter also known as the extreme value index shows a weaker relation fig 5c proven by a smaller r2 value the shape parameter is generally decreasing with the precipitation duration although in the smaller duration the shape parameter value does not show much variation this result is in agreement with previous studies koutsoyiannis 2004 overeem et al 2008 osman et al 2013 the selected pots from the historical rcm simulations 1971 2000 are also fitted to the gpd and the gpd parameters are obtained by using the same procedure as the uccle observation data since the climate model simulations are available at 3 hourly temporal scale the scaling is applied using the exponent derived from power law variable b in fig 5a and 5b to obtain the gpd parameters at 10 min 30 min 1 h and 2 h durations represented in fig 6 is the gpd parameters of the rcm simulations compared to the uccle observation data for the same period the scale and location parameters of the rcm simulations are generally in the same range with the uccle observation data and follow a similar relationship with duration despite a reasonable consistency of the scaling relations between modeled and observed precipitation extremes a lower location parameter of modeled data for short durations implies an underestimation of extreme precipitation of fine scales by rcms as short duration extreme precipitation events are mainly driven by local convection activities berg et al 2013 the underestimation can be attributed to the inadequate convection depths of the rcm the underestimation of short duration extreme precipitation by rcms has also been found in previous studies mishra et al 2012 berg et al 2019 longer duration extreme precipitation are better captured by the grid resolved component of the rcm simulations fig 6 which are often related to larger scale fields olsson et al 2014 contrary to the previous two parameters there is a considerable difference between the shape parameter estimations from the climate model simulations and observations the model based shape parameter is lower in larger durations and higher in smaller durations than that from the observation data 3 3 bias correction of rcm simulations as seen in fig 6 the rcm derived gpd parameters for the historical period are biased when compared to the observation data thus the bias correction procedure is conducted by implementing eqs 6 7 and 8 in order to correct the bias in rcm future simulations in fig 7 b the median of the bias correction factors for the location parameter are shown to be significantly decreasing with the duration however the condition is not applied to the other two gpd parameters a change of trend is however found after the 7 day duration for the scale and shape parameters where the bias correction factors increase slightly with increasing storm duration fig 7a and c nevertheless the slope of the bias correction factors for the scale parameter with the durations of larger than 7 days is higher compared to that of the shape parameter as denoted by hagemann et al 2011 the statistical bias correction methodology is used to design all moments of the probability distribution function pdf to have the same pdf intensity as the observed or control data in practice the bias in the return levels of the rcm simulations is corrected by using the uccle station precipitation as the reference to validate the bias corrected results the bias correction factors for the model simulations of the 1971 2000 period are applied to the same quantiles of the rcp8 5 simulations for the period 2008 2019 this validation procedure was used by hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b for european extreme precipitation the validation period was selected based on the availability of the station data for the model simulations the future model data simulated under the business as usual scenario continuation of the current circumstances were used because the model historical simulations end in 2005 both the raw and the bias corrected model simulations are compared against the observed precipitation intensity from four stations near the city of antwerp deurne herentals melsele and wilrijk the deviation for each of the precipitation return levels is measured by using the root mean square error rmse which is provided in table 1 in general the rmse values for all climate simulations increase with the return period the bias corrected rcm simulations are proven to have a smaller rmse compared to the raw simulations the bias corrected simulations indeed improved for all simulations except for the ipsl cm5a mr driven simulations the greatest improvement is found for the cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es driven rcm simulations respectively while for the cnrm cm5 driven rcm simulations the improvement is larger for higher return periods such pattern cannot be detected for the other simulations 3 4 climate change impact on extreme precipitation with the future gpd parameters obtained and downscaled intensity durationfrequency idf curves are generated for the range of aggregation levels considered the climate change projections point to an increase in precipitation intensity at every return period considered the result is in agreement with previous studies hagemann et al 2011 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b where a larger change is found at longer return periods and shorter durations fig 8 represents the historical and future periods for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year storms under rcp8 5 where uplifted and more inclined curves are projected for the future the upward shift in the idf curves increases with the return period however it decreases with the aggregation level the shift varies between 15 and 28 the steepening of the projected idf curves ranges from 16 to 27 depending on the return period as previously discussed the change in the attributed climate change output distribution parameter is projected to increase in the future period this will have an impact on the extreme precipitation and hence the uplifted future idf curves moreover it is also revealed that a larger increase at the lower aggregation level is expected under climate change which leads the idf curves to be more inclined 3 5 climate change impact on pluvial flooding sixty composite storm hydrographs are generated based on the calculated idf curves for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods each with a duration of 12 hr and a 10 minute time step fig 9 shows composite hydrographs for the respective return periods based on the ensemble median of climate model runs as shown the composite hydrograph will be shifted upward for all return periods due to the intensification of extreme precipitation under climate change the design storms developed for each rcm run are incorporated into the hydrodynamic model separately thus making the total simulation runs equal to sixty 5 climate model runs 6 return periods historical and future periods as a result of climate change the flood volume is projected to increase on average by 16 31 48 63 73 and 84 for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively fig 10 the uncertainty in the projections is large where the volume increase ranges between 2 and 34 for 2 year floods and between 54 and 104 for 50 year floods furthermore as projected by the five rcm runs floods are likely to at least double in frequency by the end of this century e g the amount of historical period s maximum flood of a 5 year return period might occur every 2 years in the 2071 2100 period the amplification of flood frequencies also increases with return period the increase in the flood volume would also make an impact on the inundated areas the mean projections from the climate model runs reveal an increase of 32 49 56 58 58 and 59 of the inundated area in the future period for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively fig 11 similar to the flood volume projections there is a large model uncertainty in the future projections of inundated areas accounting for a standard deviation of 11 15 for different return periods the impact of climate change on urban flooding either in terms of flood volume or inundation area increases with return period the rising climate change impact with event extremity has also been previously found for european pluvial flooding hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a and global river flooding tabari 2021 it is due to a similar pattern in extreme precipitation liu et al 2020 which is one of the main drivers of flooding arnell and gosling 2016 the atmospheric moisture change is responsible for the increase in more intense precipitation emori and brown 2005 and thus flooding while the magnitude of the increase in less intense events reduces under the influence of dynamic factors norris et al 2019 figs 12 and s3 s6 show the spatial distribution of the inundation area of a 50 year flood derived from historical and future climate model simulations a larger inundation area for the future is obvious which is distributed over the antwerp sewer network 4 conclusions and recommendations this study examined the future climate change impact on pluvial flooding events by considering the extreme precipitation from the distribution based bias corrected euro cordex rcm simulations extreme precipitation events were selected using the pot method with a threshold chosen at the 97th percentile by assessing the mean residual life and parameter stability plots the 10 minute precipitation observation data from uccle station were fitted to the gpd at 40 aggregation levels the relations between the gpd parameters and the duration show that the scaling can only be applied to the location and scale parameters as the shape parameter does not show an exponential behavior the scaling exponent obtained from the observation data was applied to the rcm simulations to derive the gpd parameters at higher temporal resolutions the results also show that the bias correction factors vary with the storm duration the climate model simulations were bias corrected by taking into account the gpd parameterization of the high resolution precipitation observation data from uccle station in the reference period of 1971 2000 the bias corrected method managed to decrease the bias in the climate model simulations proven by validating the extreme precipitation intensities based on other neighboring observation stations the idf curves were computed for the historical period and the future period under the rcp8 5 scenario for specific return periods of 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 years predominantly the changes found in the future idf curves are projected to increase with the return period and decrease with the aggregation level the future idf curves are expected to be shifted upward and steepened as an effect of higher extreme precipitation level as well as the larger change found at the shorter storm durations to visualize the climate change impact on pluvial flooding a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model was used composite storm hydrographs were built and used as an input to the model for each of the corresponding return periods the results show that between the historical and future periods an increase of 16 31 48 63 73 and 84 in the flood volume is expected for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively this increased flood volume will also have an effect on the inundated areas on average the projected future floods indicate that there will be 32 49 56 58 58 and 59 increases in the inundated area in the city of antwerp for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively the increased flood volume and inundated areas will cause major financial and humanitarian impact in this high population density area it calls for effective flood management plans and prevention measures such as rainfall harvesting systems permeable paving green roofs and vertical greening hard landscaping and underground water storage in this study extreme precipitation simulations from five euro cordex rcm runs were downscaled for local impact assessment a similar research can be done based on the large ensemble of the cmip6 gcms although the spatial resolution of gcms is much coarser than rcms the use of a large multi model ensemble can better quantify the uncertainty in the projections furthermore separating between the wet and dry season from the historical period can represent the seasonal variability of the studied area the climate change impact on flooding also varies with season with a smaller impact in dry seasons when limited climatological water availability can constrain the intensification of extreme precipitation and flooding tabari 2020 for the simulation of urban flooding a detailed 1d 2d hydrodynamic model of the city surface and the sewer network was implemented by using infoworks icm the long computational time of hydrodynamic models may limit its applicability for a large climate model ensemble developing and using a data driven approach for the flood modelling as done by li and willems 2020 and hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a may accelerate the process the selection of representative gcms from the full ensemble using cluster analysis algorithms cannon 2015 is another possibility to decrease the run time for future flood modelling using a combined data driven and physically based model structure wolfs and willems 2017 is also a feasible alternative in order to shorten the calculation time without sacrificing the accuracy of highly detailed models the downscaled extreme precipitation using a distribution based method was used for climate change impact analysis on urban flooding the same downscaling method but based on the parameters of the generalized extreme value gev distribution would reveal whether the downscaling results are influenced by the method choice for the extreme value analysis tabari 2021 the distribution based method can also be used for other hydrological applications which need fine spatial and temporal resolutions such as river flooding putting the distribution based method in an ensemble of downscaling methods allows a comparative analysis of the results obtained here with other types of downscaling methods the future downscaled results from the distribution based method can also be validated based on the future simulations from high resolution climate models 4 km the so called convection permitting models upon public availability such models are able to explicitly resolve deep convection and to better represent small scale orography and local surface features thus providing a more trustworthy simulation of sub daily precipitation extremes compared to convection parameterized models ban et al 2015 prein et al 2015 2017 this can be particularly beneficial for the simulation of short term rainstorms during summer which are primarily convective in nature in the region and can lead to flash floods tabari et al 2016 credit authorship contribution statement parisa hosseinzadehtalaei conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing

4513,the expected intensification of extreme precipitation events under climate change likely results in more frequent and intense pluvial floods worldwide to study the climate change impact on urban pluvial flooding fine scale climate model simulations are needed the number of such simulations is however still limited and not widely available thus entailing the downscaling of the model outputs one of the commonly used methods to meet this demand is statistical downscaling where the statistical properties of large r scale climate simulations are used to derive local climate variables this study focuses on applying a distribution based bias correction method on regional climate model rcm simulations to explore how climate change affects extreme precipitation and urban flood events at the end of this century 2071 2100 a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model implemented in infoworks icm is used to simulate pluvial flood events for several return periods for a case study in the city of antwerp in belgium the results show that the statistical downscaling approach can effectively decrease the bias in the model simulations and offer strong scaling relations to derive high resolution extreme precipitation time series the analyses also reveal that climate change may cause an increase of 16 31 47 63 73 and 84 in the flood volume for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively this projected increase in the flood volume enlarges the inundated area by 32 49 56 58 58 and 59 for the respective return periods the flood frequency is also projected to almost double in the future so that a 5 year flood event in the historical period will most likely be a 2 year event in the future period keywords climate change signals extreme precipitation statistical downscaling scaling relation urban flood inundation 1 introduction the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 proclaimed that anthropogenic global warming reached approximately 1 c in 2007 compared to the preindustrial eras which consequently led to an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme events kirchmeier young et al 2019 tabari et al 2020 dong et al 2020 the need to understand the impact of climate change on the extremes has therefore become one of the substantial issues over the last two decades in the water and risk management sectors several studies have shown that the frequency of occurrence and magnitude of heavy precipitation increase by the end of the 21st century based on climate model projections ipcc 2013 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 liu et al 2020 the atmospheric saturation water vapor pressure holds a major role which leads to an increase of extreme precipitation at a rate of 6 7 per degree of surface warming according to the clausius clapeyron c c relation westra et al 2014 ban et al 2015 lenderink and fowler 2017 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 this intensified precipitation phenomenon has boosted up the risk of flooding ashley et al 2005 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a which is also in line with societal concerns regarding extreme precipitation derived floods being one of the catastrophic natural hazards globally ahern et al 2005 knapp et al 2008 hallegatte et al 2013 westra et al 2014 pluvial flooding in urban areas has a higher likelihood due to the greater prevalence of tarmacked and paved surfaces leading to fast runoff processes and short response times ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 and a higher impact due to the density of buildings and people houston et al 2011 the hydrological processes in urban catchments are known to have high spatial and temporal variabilities making them sensitive to local scale variability of precipitation in space and time cristiano et al 2017 the magnitude of the hydrological sensitivities to climate conditions entails climate change impact assessments on the hydrologic cycle the extensive interdependencies between different infrastructure systems in urban areas penny et al 2018 as well as the spatial and temporal scale dependence of climate change signals for extreme precipitation tabari et al 2016 tabari and willems 2018 kirchmeier young et al 2019 make the urban hydrological analysis of climate change impacts more challenging the likelihood of urban pluvial flooding events has been found to increase as a result of anthropogenic climate change maksimović et al 2009 skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 pregnolato et al 2017 effective adaptation strategies for intensified flood events can be implemented only when the nature of the climate change impact is well understood huong and pathirana 2013 climate variables e g precipitation from climate models in combination with hydraulic models are used to project future climate change impacts on urban flooding the primary source for future climate projections lies in the output of general circulation models gcms the resolution of gcm simulations in the order of 100 300 km is inadequate for this purpose as it lacks detailed regional information which is essential to resolve local processes at the catchment scale teutschbein and seibert 2012 parameterization is used when the horizontal grid spacing of gcms fails to resolve the processes which often causes bias in the model simulations and thereof a flawed impact assessment tabari 2019 the gcm outputs thus cannot be directly used for a local climate change impact study for urban flooding ahmed et al 2013 downscaling is an approach to circumvent the intrinsic inadequacy of gcms to represent the fine scale physical processes in order to sort out the incompatibility between the model simulations and the resolution required for impact assessments it assumes a strong influence of large r scale weather on the local scale one but by disregarding any counter effects from the local scale maraun et al 2010 in this regard regional climate models rcms with a spatial scale typically between 50 and 12 km have been developed as a downscaled version of gcms to provide climate change information more suitable for impact studies luo et al 2018 specific to the european area a high resolution rcm ensemble within the world climate research program coordinate regional downscaling experiment euro cordex has been established jacob et al 2014 the finest resolutions of the euro cordex rcms are 3 hourly temporal resolution and 12 km spatial resolution while the spatial and temporal resolutions of rcms are far higher than those of gcms which enable them to reproduce some essential mesoscale patterns of observed precipitation and reflect the topographical dependence of precipitation frei et al 2006 they are still too coarse to meet the scale needed for the urban flood analysis for example design applications in urban hydrology require precipitation time series with a fine temporal scale of a few minutes and a spatial scale of 1 km schilling 1991 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 in addition rcms have shown a systematic bias in the simulation of extreme precipitation characteristics mishra et al 2014 prein et al 2015 berg et al 2019 stemming from their incapacity to represent many mesoscale atmospheric processes leading to extreme precipitation episodes lehtonen et al 2014 the rcm simulations must therefore be further adapted to account for the finer scale requirements and the systematic bias a range of bias correction approaches from simple to sophisticated ones have been developed which mostly focus on mean precipitation e g bárdossy and pegram 2011 johnson and sharma 2012 and only a few of them correct the bias in rcm simulations of extreme precipitation e g rojas et al 2011 or of both mean and extreme precipitation e g maity et al 2019 the bias correction has been applied either directly on extreme precipitation simulations of rcms hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b or indirectly on the factors associated with extreme precipitation such as the lateral boundary conditions outputs of driving gcms of rcm simulations e g xu and yang 2012 kim et al 2020 and the synoptic circulation patterns associated with extreme precipitation e g li et al 2018 this study makes use of a direct bias correction approach based on probability distribution parameters which implements the corrections on the parameters derived from extreme precipitation of different durations due to the scarcity of fine temporal resolution precipitation data from climate models previous urban flood studies have mostly used daily precipitation data from gcms e g zhou et al 2018 2019 duan and gao 2019 or rcms e g martínez gomariz et al 2019 by making a time scale independence assumption for climate change signals the time scale independence assumption implies that the changes in the intensity of daily extreme precipitation are identical to that of sub daily extremes required for the urban flood modeling this assumption has however recently been violated by reported intensified precipitation changes from daily to sub daily scales sunyer et al 2015 tabari et al 2016 innocenti et al 2019 hodnebrog et al 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b wood and ludwig 2020 and a super c c scaling of sub daily extreme precipitation with warming compared to a c c scaling of daily extremes lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 berg et al 2013 förster and thiele 2020 some other studies have used disaggregation methods to derive fine scale precipitation series from gcm simulations needed for climate change impact assessments on urban flooding zahmatkesh et al 2015 tavakol davani et al 2016 lu and qin 2020 medeiros de saboia et al 2020 this study looks further into the statistical downscaling by the downscaling of rcm precipitation simulations by a distribution based approach using the relations between statistical distribution parameters and storm duration bias correction and temporal statistical downscaling approaches are combined to assess the impact of climate change on urban flooding the future climate change impact for the period 2071 2100 is assessed by taking into account the generated floods from the downscaled extreme precipitation simulations for several return periods a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model built for the sewer system of the city of antwerp in belgium is used to simulate pluvial floods based on composite hydrographs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the case study considered here is the city of antwerp which is historically at a vulnerable state to flooding several flood events were recorded in 2013 and 2014 and the worst one happened in may 2016 situated within the north west of the european coastal areas antwerp has a temperate maritime climate with cool summers and moderate winters the city is inhabited with approximately 512 000 people within its total area of 204 5 km2 although only 11 6 km2 is the main focus of this study the dominant land use greater than 80 is the continuous urban fabric class with impermeable land covers i e urban structures transport networks and artificially surfaced areas laid next to the scheldt river the city of antwerp is formed with a generally flat surface throughout the city area mees et al 2016 with a land slope of 0 003 li and willems 2020 the city s drainage system is a gravity driven branched and mostly a combined system which is also accompanied with hydraulic structures such as weirs and orifices li and willems 2020 2 2 data 2 2 1 observation data we use rainfall data recorded at uccle 50 8 n 4 4 e which is the main station of the royal meteorological institute of belgium rmi it holds long term high frequency homogeneous series measured from 1898 by a hellmann fuess recording unshielded raingauge demarée 2003 and continued to present date the station is located on the top of a hill 101 m a s l in an urbanized area in the south of brussels de jongh et al 2006 the measured rainfall data is available at the frequency of 10 min providing a unique opportunity for the temporal downscaling the continues long term high quality and fine scale precipitation data from uccle station have been frequently used for hydraulic design applications in the country e g willems 2013 as well as climate studies over europe e g arnbjerg nielsen et al 2015 förster and thiele 2020 for this study the precipitation data dating from 1971 to 2000 are considered to be consistent with the historical simulation period of rcms besides uccle station hourly precipitation data from several other meteorological stations located in deurne herentals melsele and wilrijk are used these stations are located around the studied area in antwerp owing to the close proximity of these stations with uccle station and a relatively flat topography of flanders precipitation at the studied stations is expected to follow a similar pattern the long term precipitation data are not available at these additional stations and the observed data from 2008 to 2019 is considered and used to validate the bias corrected results of the climate models conducted based on uccle records 2 2 2 climate model data a set of five climate model simulations from the euro cordex initiatives at 0 11 horizontal resolutions are used in this study the data set derives from the rca4 rcm model developed at the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi strandberg et al 2014 and has five driving coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 gcms cnrm cm5 ec earth ipsl cm5a mr hadgem2 es and mpi esm lr the climate model outputs from 1971 to 2000 is considered as the historical period and 2071 2100 as the future period we use the data at 3 hourly temporal resolution under the representative concentration pathway rcps rcp8 5 representing the high level of greenhouse gas concentrations by the year 2100 the rcm data are extracted for the model grid cell covering the city of antwerp using the nearest neighbor algorithm 2 3 methods the methodological framework of this study is represented in fig 1 the methodology can be broadly divided into two parts statistical downscaling and hydrodynamic modelling in the first part the downscaling follows a two step statistical downscaling procedure which can be broken down into i bias correction and ii temporal downscaling 2 3 1 extreme value analysis despite having the ability to represent the climate system rcms are commonly known to have a bias in their simulations thus before using the simulations as the basis of climate impact studies they need to be statistically adjusted primarily based on the model performance assessment of the current climate räty et al 2014 several methods have been developed to correct the bias in climate model simulations chen et al 2011 johnson and sharma 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2012 these methods range from simple scaling approaches to rather well developed distribution methods by utilizing probability mapping techniques luo et al 2018 the methods were initially designed to downscale gcm simulations however they are also applicable to tailor the rcm outputs a distribution based bias correction method is therefore used in this study to downscale the euro cordex rcm outputs this study uses the peak over threshold pot approach for extreme precipitation analyses it was shown that the pot series can be approximated most precisely with a generalized pareto distribution gpd hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b the cumulative distribution function f x of gpd for pot extremes x is given as follows 1 f x 1 1 ξ x μ σ f o r ξ 0 1 exp x μ σ f o r ξ 0 where µ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and ξ is the shape parameter the gpd parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle in the pot method independent extremes need to be selected for sub daily precipitation tabari et al 2016 the independent pot series is selected in this study based on an interevent time of 12 h willems 2009 it implies that two successive precipitation peaks within the same day or night are considered as one extreme event and the larger value is chosen in other words two consecutive precipitation extremes are interpreted to be independent based on this criterion when the time between the two events exceeds 12 h to date though the threshold choice is crucial for the pot method selection of the threshold remains rather subjective tabari 2021 for the threshold selection compromises between bias and variance need to be found the choice of a high threshold will result in a less number of events included in the series leading to a high variance of the distribution parameter estimation although the likelihood of pot independence will increase lang et al 1999 oppositely a lower threshold hence a larger number of events selected will affect the asymptotic basis of the model leading to a higher bias bommier 2014 nagy et al 2017 the common practice to choose the threshold is to opt for the smallest possible value where it yields a reasonable parameter approximation maposa et al 2017 as suggested by davison and smith 1990 a graphical method known as the mean residual life plot based on the mean of the gpd can be used as a threshold selection tool given that u u0 the threshold choice is valid for all excesses over the threshold 2 e x u 0 x u 0 σ u 1 ξ σ u 0 ξ u 1 ξ which for all u u0 the mean residual life plot should visually show linearity to the excess distribution where the gpd also delivers a plausible parameter approximation the empirical mean excess life plot is however defined as 3 u 1 n u i 1 n u x i u u x max where nu is the number of events that exceed the threshold u and xmax is the largest of the xi coles 2001 besides the mean residual plot another commonly used graphical method is the parameter stability plot the key takeaway of this plot is that if the exceedances of a high threshold u0 follow a gpd with parameters ξ and σu0 then for every u such that u u0 the exceedances still follow a gpd with ξu ξ and σu σu0 ξ u u0 bommier 2014 presuming that u0 is properly high threshold this parameterization will not depend on u any longer the parameter stability plot is defined by the locus of points as 4 u σ u x max a n d u ξ u u x max where σ is defined as 5 σ σ u ξ u u the chosen threshold should be at the value where the other two gpd parameters are persistent hence by defining u0 as a suitable threshold for asymptotic approximation the estimation for σ and ξu are also constant for all u u0 2 3 2 distribution based downscaling the bias correction and temporal downscaling of extreme precipitation are performed based on the gpd distribution parameters for the former bias correction factors bc are first derived for the gpd distribution parameters as the gpd parameter of the observation data over the model simulations for the same duration d which can be described as follows 6 b c μ d μ d o b s μ d m o d e l 7 b c σ d σ d o b s σ d m o d e l 8 b c ξ d ξ d o b s ξ d m o d e l where the established bias correction factors are applied to correct the bias in the distribution parameters of the future simulations subsequently the return levels of the future corresponding to return periods of 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 years are approximated by using the corrected gpd parameters coles 2001 courty et al 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a assuming that the scaling relations found in the observations also hold for the future the established scaling relation is applied to the projected precipitation time series kristvik et al 2019 the scaling relation between the extreme events of finer and coarser time scale precipitation is established by taking into account the observed fine time scale precipitation the fractal theory and scale invariance principle gupta and waymire 1990 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 in the temporal downscaling of rcms suggest that the statistical properties of precipitation at different scales can be linked and therefore be expressed as 9 α λ d λ β α d where α denotes the estimated distribution parameter d is the time scale λ is the scaling factor and β is the scaling exponent the scaling exponent is constant and equal to the slope length of the linear regression between the estimated parameter and the duration in a log log space in a simple scaling case yu et al 2004 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 the scaling relation also holds for the distribution quantiles gupta and waymire 1990 as highlighted by menabde et al 1999 and courty et al 2019 it is assumed that µ σ and ξ scale with d according to a power law relation as 10 μ a d α 11 σ b d β 12 ξ c d γ where d is the duration in hours a and α are the scaling parameters for µ b and β are the scaling parameters for σ and c and γ are the scaling parameters for ξ in this study the scaling relationships obtained from uccle data are validated based on the sub daily data from some other stations after validation distribution parameters derived from the scaling relationships of the uccle observations for aggregation levels ranging between 10 min and 15 days are used to generate rcm simulations for time scales finer than 3 h i e 2 hourly hourly 30 min and 10 min 2 3 3 hydrodynamic model for the city of antwerp wherever urban area is concerned it is necessary to represent the complexity of urban surfaces in a realistic way maksimović et al 2009 the integration of the sewer flow surface 1d with flow simulation 2d has proved to perform well in representing the flooding process van dijk et al 2014 the advantage of using the hydrodynamic model relies on its high adaptiveness to the physical and systemic characteristics changes as it is built based on a detailed physical process of the drainage system aside from that the model also allows for the realistic representation of the flood extent which is highly beneficial when it comes to communicating flood hazard and risk results to the greater audience teng et al 2017 li and willems 2020 the detailed 1d 2d hydrodynamic model of the city surface and the sewer network is implemented by using infoworks icm innovyze 2017 which was validated and updated following the established regional regulations hydronaut procedure aquafin 2017 based on continuous discharge and water level measurements over several years at critical locations in the network the 1d 0d model covers the city of antwerp and the surrounding districts while the 1d 2d model covers only the main city center of antwerp as shown in fig 2 the 2d surface flood simulation results were validated based on crowdsource data newspapers disaster journalists social media and fire brigade records of the city of antwerp current and future precipitation simulations are used as inputs to the hydrodynamic model to simulate the current and future flooding events a storm composite hydrograph is used to tackle the issues of too detailed model and too long period time series in order to have shorter simulation time the composite storms are synthetic storms that include a t year precipitation intensity for all possible durations of uniformly distributed precipitation series over the urban catchment rosbjerg and madsen 2019 the composite storms in this study are constructed using the chicago method keifer and chu 1957 whose design procedure and characteristics are provided by vaes et al 2001 based on the intensity duration frequency idf curves derived from the bias corrected distribution parameters the shallow water equation swe is applied in the hydrodynamic model to pinpoint the 2d flow where it assumes that the flow is horizontal at the start of simulations and the velocity over the said coordinate can be set aside innovyze 2017 the surface is represented as a 2d mesh in order to portray a flood map of the surface the runoff is distributed to the 2d mesh and thus dispatched to the 1d 2d links and the sewer network the type of the surface areas roads buildings and permeable surfaces is represented by the software s built in features area take off ato it enables the automatic calculation of the runoff surface area of the corresponding sub catchment to the systems where they are connected storm sanitary or foul by taking the information from the imported gis innovyze 2017 the digital elevation model dem with a high resolution of 1 m is used to precisely represent the city s urban topography the detailed number of the structural component of the sewer network represented in the model can be seen in table s1 several classes of the surface identified as streets permeable impermeable buildings and water are used for the surface classification the reservoirs dimensions modelled as flood cones are estimated from the surface dem this simplification approach is done to maximize the computational efficiency while maintaining a good accuracy of the results bermúdez et al 2018 li and willems 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 threshold choice for the pot method the choice of the threshold in the pot method holds a pivotal role to estimate the gpd parameters the threshold should indeed correspond to the number of the selected data so that it should not be either too high or too low the threshold is chosen based on 13 percentile levels 95 95 5 96 96 5 97 97 5 98 98 5 99 99 2 99 4 99 6 and 99 8 two graphical methods of mean residual life plot and parameter stability plot are used in order to get the optimum threshold the mean residual life plot for 10 minute precipitation at uccle station is shown in fig 3 the mean exceedance above threshold for 10 minute precipitation at uccle station is constant from 95th to 97th percentile however the mean exceedance value starts to increase almost linearly with percentile when thresholds of 97 5th are chosen thus based on this provision result the threshold choice should be derived from the 97th percentile as the endpoint of the straight line on the plot from 95th to 97th percentile before it becomes unstable as the precipitation become very extreme 97 5th to 99 8th percentile the parameter stability plot consists of plotting the modified scale eq 5 and the shape parameter against the varying thresholds percentile for threshold in our case for the same range of quantiles as the mean residual life plot according to fig 4 both the modified scale and shape parameter show the same result as the mean residual life plot from the 95th to 97th percentile the parameter estimations are constant before it increases linearly with the percentile level based on these results the threshold choice of the 97th percentile is considered as the optimum threshold choice which could compromise between the biases and the variance for the gpd parameter estimation as another prerequisite for the pot method independent pots were selected effectively from all of the pots fig s1 as expected the precipitation values for the all pots and independent pots cases diverge for lower quantiles implying that dependent pots are found more at the lower quantiles 3 2 gpd parameters and their relations with storm duration for every aggregation level the selected pot events are fitted to a gpd based on the chosen threshold resulting in three parameters of location scale and shape these results are plotted in the double logarithmic plot to see whether the scaling method is applicable or not both scale fig 5 a and location fig 5b parameters proved to have an exponential relation with the duration as it is obvious from their linear relation with the duration on a double logarithmic plot therefore a downscaling approach based on gpd location and scale parameters following eqs 10 and 11 can be used by applying the scaling exponent noted in each figure on the contrary the shape parameter also known as the extreme value index shows a weaker relation fig 5c proven by a smaller r2 value the shape parameter is generally decreasing with the precipitation duration although in the smaller duration the shape parameter value does not show much variation this result is in agreement with previous studies koutsoyiannis 2004 overeem et al 2008 osman et al 2013 the selected pots from the historical rcm simulations 1971 2000 are also fitted to the gpd and the gpd parameters are obtained by using the same procedure as the uccle observation data since the climate model simulations are available at 3 hourly temporal scale the scaling is applied using the exponent derived from power law variable b in fig 5a and 5b to obtain the gpd parameters at 10 min 30 min 1 h and 2 h durations represented in fig 6 is the gpd parameters of the rcm simulations compared to the uccle observation data for the same period the scale and location parameters of the rcm simulations are generally in the same range with the uccle observation data and follow a similar relationship with duration despite a reasonable consistency of the scaling relations between modeled and observed precipitation extremes a lower location parameter of modeled data for short durations implies an underestimation of extreme precipitation of fine scales by rcms as short duration extreme precipitation events are mainly driven by local convection activities berg et al 2013 the underestimation can be attributed to the inadequate convection depths of the rcm the underestimation of short duration extreme precipitation by rcms has also been found in previous studies mishra et al 2012 berg et al 2019 longer duration extreme precipitation are better captured by the grid resolved component of the rcm simulations fig 6 which are often related to larger scale fields olsson et al 2014 contrary to the previous two parameters there is a considerable difference between the shape parameter estimations from the climate model simulations and observations the model based shape parameter is lower in larger durations and higher in smaller durations than that from the observation data 3 3 bias correction of rcm simulations as seen in fig 6 the rcm derived gpd parameters for the historical period are biased when compared to the observation data thus the bias correction procedure is conducted by implementing eqs 6 7 and 8 in order to correct the bias in rcm future simulations in fig 7 b the median of the bias correction factors for the location parameter are shown to be significantly decreasing with the duration however the condition is not applied to the other two gpd parameters a change of trend is however found after the 7 day duration for the scale and shape parameters where the bias correction factors increase slightly with increasing storm duration fig 7a and c nevertheless the slope of the bias correction factors for the scale parameter with the durations of larger than 7 days is higher compared to that of the shape parameter as denoted by hagemann et al 2011 the statistical bias correction methodology is used to design all moments of the probability distribution function pdf to have the same pdf intensity as the observed or control data in practice the bias in the return levels of the rcm simulations is corrected by using the uccle station precipitation as the reference to validate the bias corrected results the bias correction factors for the model simulations of the 1971 2000 period are applied to the same quantiles of the rcp8 5 simulations for the period 2008 2019 this validation procedure was used by hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b for european extreme precipitation the validation period was selected based on the availability of the station data for the model simulations the future model data simulated under the business as usual scenario continuation of the current circumstances were used because the model historical simulations end in 2005 both the raw and the bias corrected model simulations are compared against the observed precipitation intensity from four stations near the city of antwerp deurne herentals melsele and wilrijk the deviation for each of the precipitation return levels is measured by using the root mean square error rmse which is provided in table 1 in general the rmse values for all climate simulations increase with the return period the bias corrected rcm simulations are proven to have a smaller rmse compared to the raw simulations the bias corrected simulations indeed improved for all simulations except for the ipsl cm5a mr driven simulations the greatest improvement is found for the cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es driven rcm simulations respectively while for the cnrm cm5 driven rcm simulations the improvement is larger for higher return periods such pattern cannot be detected for the other simulations 3 4 climate change impact on extreme precipitation with the future gpd parameters obtained and downscaled intensity durationfrequency idf curves are generated for the range of aggregation levels considered the climate change projections point to an increase in precipitation intensity at every return period considered the result is in agreement with previous studies hagemann et al 2011 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020b where a larger change is found at longer return periods and shorter durations fig 8 represents the historical and future periods for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year storms under rcp8 5 where uplifted and more inclined curves are projected for the future the upward shift in the idf curves increases with the return period however it decreases with the aggregation level the shift varies between 15 and 28 the steepening of the projected idf curves ranges from 16 to 27 depending on the return period as previously discussed the change in the attributed climate change output distribution parameter is projected to increase in the future period this will have an impact on the extreme precipitation and hence the uplifted future idf curves moreover it is also revealed that a larger increase at the lower aggregation level is expected under climate change which leads the idf curves to be more inclined 3 5 climate change impact on pluvial flooding sixty composite storm hydrographs are generated based on the calculated idf curves for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods each with a duration of 12 hr and a 10 minute time step fig 9 shows composite hydrographs for the respective return periods based on the ensemble median of climate model runs as shown the composite hydrograph will be shifted upward for all return periods due to the intensification of extreme precipitation under climate change the design storms developed for each rcm run are incorporated into the hydrodynamic model separately thus making the total simulation runs equal to sixty 5 climate model runs 6 return periods historical and future periods as a result of climate change the flood volume is projected to increase on average by 16 31 48 63 73 and 84 for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively fig 10 the uncertainty in the projections is large where the volume increase ranges between 2 and 34 for 2 year floods and between 54 and 104 for 50 year floods furthermore as projected by the five rcm runs floods are likely to at least double in frequency by the end of this century e g the amount of historical period s maximum flood of a 5 year return period might occur every 2 years in the 2071 2100 period the amplification of flood frequencies also increases with return period the increase in the flood volume would also make an impact on the inundated areas the mean projections from the climate model runs reveal an increase of 32 49 56 58 58 and 59 of the inundated area in the future period for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively fig 11 similar to the flood volume projections there is a large model uncertainty in the future projections of inundated areas accounting for a standard deviation of 11 15 for different return periods the impact of climate change on urban flooding either in terms of flood volume or inundation area increases with return period the rising climate change impact with event extremity has also been previously found for european pluvial flooding hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a and global river flooding tabari 2021 it is due to a similar pattern in extreme precipitation liu et al 2020 which is one of the main drivers of flooding arnell and gosling 2016 the atmospheric moisture change is responsible for the increase in more intense precipitation emori and brown 2005 and thus flooding while the magnitude of the increase in less intense events reduces under the influence of dynamic factors norris et al 2019 figs 12 and s3 s6 show the spatial distribution of the inundation area of a 50 year flood derived from historical and future climate model simulations a larger inundation area for the future is obvious which is distributed over the antwerp sewer network 4 conclusions and recommendations this study examined the future climate change impact on pluvial flooding events by considering the extreme precipitation from the distribution based bias corrected euro cordex rcm simulations extreme precipitation events were selected using the pot method with a threshold chosen at the 97th percentile by assessing the mean residual life and parameter stability plots the 10 minute precipitation observation data from uccle station were fitted to the gpd at 40 aggregation levels the relations between the gpd parameters and the duration show that the scaling can only be applied to the location and scale parameters as the shape parameter does not show an exponential behavior the scaling exponent obtained from the observation data was applied to the rcm simulations to derive the gpd parameters at higher temporal resolutions the results also show that the bias correction factors vary with the storm duration the climate model simulations were bias corrected by taking into account the gpd parameterization of the high resolution precipitation observation data from uccle station in the reference period of 1971 2000 the bias corrected method managed to decrease the bias in the climate model simulations proven by validating the extreme precipitation intensities based on other neighboring observation stations the idf curves were computed for the historical period and the future period under the rcp8 5 scenario for specific return periods of 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 years predominantly the changes found in the future idf curves are projected to increase with the return period and decrease with the aggregation level the future idf curves are expected to be shifted upward and steepened as an effect of higher extreme precipitation level as well as the larger change found at the shorter storm durations to visualize the climate change impact on pluvial flooding a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model was used composite storm hydrographs were built and used as an input to the model for each of the corresponding return periods the results show that between the historical and future periods an increase of 16 31 48 63 73 and 84 in the flood volume is expected for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively this increased flood volume will also have an effect on the inundated areas on average the projected future floods indicate that there will be 32 49 56 58 58 and 59 increases in the inundated area in the city of antwerp for 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 year return periods respectively the increased flood volume and inundated areas will cause major financial and humanitarian impact in this high population density area it calls for effective flood management plans and prevention measures such as rainfall harvesting systems permeable paving green roofs and vertical greening hard landscaping and underground water storage in this study extreme precipitation simulations from five euro cordex rcm runs were downscaled for local impact assessment a similar research can be done based on the large ensemble of the cmip6 gcms although the spatial resolution of gcms is much coarser than rcms the use of a large multi model ensemble can better quantify the uncertainty in the projections furthermore separating between the wet and dry season from the historical period can represent the seasonal variability of the studied area the climate change impact on flooding also varies with season with a smaller impact in dry seasons when limited climatological water availability can constrain the intensification of extreme precipitation and flooding tabari 2020 for the simulation of urban flooding a detailed 1d 2d hydrodynamic model of the city surface and the sewer network was implemented by using infoworks icm the long computational time of hydrodynamic models may limit its applicability for a large climate model ensemble developing and using a data driven approach for the flood modelling as done by li and willems 2020 and hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020a may accelerate the process the selection of representative gcms from the full ensemble using cluster analysis algorithms cannon 2015 is another possibility to decrease the run time for future flood modelling using a combined data driven and physically based model structure wolfs and willems 2017 is also a feasible alternative in order to shorten the calculation time without sacrificing the accuracy of highly detailed models the downscaled extreme precipitation using a distribution based method was used for climate change impact analysis on urban flooding the same downscaling method but based on the parameters of the generalized extreme value gev distribution would reveal whether the downscaling results are influenced by the method choice for the extreme value analysis tabari 2021 the distribution based method can also be used for other hydrological applications which need fine spatial and temporal resolutions such as river flooding putting the distribution based method in an ensemble of downscaling methods allows a comparative analysis of the results obtained here with other types of downscaling methods the future downscaled results from the distribution based method can also be validated based on the future simulations from high resolution climate models 4 km the so called convection permitting models upon public availability such models are able to explicitly resolve deep convection and to better represent small scale orography and local surface features thus providing a more trustworthy simulation of sub daily precipitation extremes compared to convection parameterized models ban et al 2015 prein et al 2015 2017 this can be particularly beneficial for the simulation of short term rainstorms during summer which are primarily convective in nature in the region and can lead to flash floods tabari et al 2016 credit authorship contribution statement parisa hosseinzadehtalaei conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing

4514,aquatic photosynthesis transforms inorganic carbon to organic carbon oc which contributes to autochthonous organic carbon aoc in sediment and particulate organic carbon in surface karst aquatic systems aquatic plant and microbes are participated in autochthonous dissolved organic carbon adoc formation in surface karst aquatic systems but the composition and formation of adoc remains little known which leaves problem on calculation of organic carbon flux in this study the lijiang river was chosen as typical surface karst river to identify the doc composition and its origin and to explore the environmental influencing factors samples were collected seasonally from the upper to lower reaches of the river to analyze hydrochemical parameters and the excitation emission matrix eem spectrum of chromophoricdissolved organic matter cdom three cdom components were calculated by parallel factor analysis parafac from eem spectra which were allochthonous soil sourced doc sdoc autochthonous aquatic plant sourced doc apdoc and microbial sourced doc mdoc based on the doc component concentrations sdoc is induced by large amounts of precipitation causing soil erosion in summer apdoc formation is encouraged by moderate water temperatures in spring and fall restricted by high water turbidity in summer the significant positive linear correlations between apdoc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic and mdoc indicate dic fertilization effect in karst aquatic systems directly promotes apdoc formation and indirectly promotes mdoc our study develops a relatively simple way to calculate composition of karst aquatic doc which demonstrates the participation of aquatic plants and microbes in apdoc production and reiterate that autochthonous doc should be considered when calculating the carbon sink in surface karst aquatic systems keywords cdom microbes photosynthesis eem parafrac surface karst aquatic system 1 introduction the biological carbon pump bcp plays an important role in carbon cycling in karst surface freshwater ecosystem it transforms inorganic carbon to autochthonous organic carbon aoc and contributes to a stable organic carbon oc sink liu et al 2017 2018a passow and carlson 2012 yang et al 2015 the bcp effect and aquatic photosynthetic formation of aoc have been observed via variations in hydrochemical and co2 emission in karst pools and reservoirs jiang et al 2013 pu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 2019 based on stable isotope fractionation and tracer modeling high dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentration promoted aquatic plant and phytoplankton photosynthesis production in karst aquatic systems and photosynthetic aoc contributed 60 80 of total sediment and particulate oc in karst freshwater lakes and rivers in south china he et al 2020 huang et al 2020 yang et al 2016 additionally dissolved organic carbon doc was observed to increase coupled with high concentration of dic in karst aquatic systems kritzberg et al 2006 yuan 2016 which accounted for more than 80 of the total oc in karst water however the effect and contribution of aquatic plant photosynthesis on the autochthonous doc formation process remain unclear which is adverse to calculating the carbon sink flux of autochthonous doc in karst carbon cycling in addition phototrophic bacteria were observed in karst aquatic systems and engaged in the dic doc transformation kolda et al 2019 li et al 2018 posth et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 while heterotrophic bacteria were involved in the decomposition of autochthonous doc produced by aquatic photosynthesis in karst aquatic systems kritzberg et al 2006 shabarova et al 2014 song et al 2017 the participation of microbes produces microbial sourced doc mdoc production which induces variation in doc components and concentrations in karst aquatic system previous reports revealed that microbial sourced organic matter was persistent and considered a more stable carbon sink in freshwater and marine systems jiao et al 2010 ogawa et al 2001 but the characters of mdoc remain unclear in karst aquatic system also the concentration and fraction of mdoc in karst aquatic system need more accurate assessment thus mdoc flux and persistent organic carbon sink can be accurately calculated in karst aquatic system which is the crucial link between aquatic photosynthesis and persistent organic carbon sink however the effective mothed that evaluates mdoc fraction is still in developing and the environmental factors that influence mdoc formation remain unclear which are antecedent conclusions before mdoc flux calculation chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is the optically measurable component of dissolved organic matter dom in water cdom components and fluorescence indexes calculated by excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac were used to illustrate the dominant dom composition origin and biochemical characteristics cooper et al 2016 moradi et al 2018 the underground recharge from karst subterrane in surface estuaries had been distinguished by cdom fluorescence index and components which were characterized by low concentrations of om high protein like fluorescence and autochthonous and microbial origin arellano and coble 2015 chen et al 2010 martínez pérez et al 2019 pain et al 2020 sakellariadou and antivachis 2018 the fluorescence index of cave dripping and spring water revealed autochthonous microbial origin and low humification however a humic like component had also been detected which indicated soil oc input birdwell and engel 2010 hartland et al 2010 mudarra et al 2011 quiers et al 2014 simon et al 2010 tatár et al 2004 xie et al 2008 in surface karst aquatic systems including freshwater lakes reservoirs and rivers cdom components contained oc originating from terrestrial soil aquatic plant and microbial organic matter cheng 2014 liu et al 2018b lu 2018 however the temporospatial variation of cdom components and concentrations in surface karst aquatic systems is seldom reported which could be used to determine the origin and concentration of doc components and influence factors and then calculate adoc flux the lijiang river located in guangxi china was selected as a typical example of a surface karst aquatic system to investigate autochthonous doc formation and its influence factors in surface karst aquatic system water samples were collected from the upper to lower reaches seasonally to monitor the spatial and temporal variation in hydrochemistry and fluorescence spectrum characteristics cdom components were calculated from the eem fluorescence matrix using a parafac model the adoc and mdoc concentration were calculated basing on the cdom component and doc concentration we supposed that the variation of cdom spectrum characters could reveal the spatial and temporal variation of doc components and the variation of doc components would be influenced by aquatic plant and microbes the spatiotemporal variation of adoc and mdoc concentration can be used for calculation of refractory doc flux in future work 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the lijiang river is a typical karst river located in the upper reaches of the guijiang river which belongs to the pearl river system and originates from south of laoshanjie mountain guanxi zhuang autonomous region southwest china the lijiang river flows from north to south through a 12 690 km2 watershed with a length of 164 km fig 1 the lijiang watershed mainly consists of 1 a non karst area in the upper reaches of l2 that is underlain by slightly metamorphosed devonian granite 2 a covered karst area in the middle reaches between sites l2 and l3 that is underlain by middle and lower devonian red clasolite and 3 a bare karst area in the downstream of l3 that is underlain by triassic and cretaceous carbonate rocks with a thickness of approximately 900 3000 m as a percentage of the watershed the non karst area accounts for 51 of the total area the covered karst area accounts for 7 and the bare karst area accounts for 42 zhao 2018 lijiang river watershed is significantly influenced by extreme humidity and high temperatures consistent with the asian monsoon climate with annual precipitation in the range of 1367 1932 mm the discharge of the lijiang river is closely correlated with precipitation precipitation in the wet season from march to august accounts for 80 of the precipitation for the whole year while the dry season from september to february accounts for 20 consequently the discharge of lijiang river in the wet season is approximately 10 times that of the dry season in 2017 the discharge at the l6 site was 606 m3 s 1 in july 217 m3 s 1 in march 84 m3 s 1 in september and 52 m3 s 1 in december the slope of the lijiang river valley decreases from the upper to lower reaches and is no more than 0 5 between sites l3 to l6 thus the river water between sites l3 and l6 flows slowly and maintains low turbidity unless storm events occur hu 2016 yuan 2016 zhao 2018 at the upriver of lijiang river forest land covers 51 4 of the total area which decreases to 14 2 in the mid and down stream yue and chen 2008 heavy precipitation and anthropogenic activity are the main factor that induces soil erosion intensification and sediment yield increase in lijiang river basin which causes lijiang river water becomes turbid and yellow in storm event chang 2008 yue and chen 2008 zhang and wang 2016 the annual average temperature in the lijiang river watershed ranges from 16 5 to 20 0 c while the annual average duration of insolation is 1615 h per year the duration of insolation is 1354 h when temperatures are higher than 10 c which accounts for 84 of the annual duration of insolation the annual average number of non frost days is 320 days per year these features combined with the secchi disk depth of tens meters allow for the growth of dense submerged aquatic vegetation in the riverbed although vegetation varies with respect to the geomorphic features of the river dense submerged aquatic plants are observed in the lijiang river especially in the middle to lower reaches between site l3 and l6 typical native submerged c3 macrophytes resulting from the surface waters of the south china sea occur in the main channel such as vallisneria natans l potamogeton distinctus a benn ceratophyllum demersum l and hydrilla verticillata representing 90 of the submerged aquatic vegetation wu and bai 2017 other primary producers include a variety of filamentous benthic algae as well as emergent and floating species that can become dominant in the channel margins 2 2 sampling six sampling sites were selected to monitor the hydrochemical parameters and cdom fluorescence spectra in the lijiang river of which the locations are shown in fig 1 sites l1 and l2 locate at non karst and covered karst areas respectively while the other sites are located in the bare karst area l3 locates at the urban area of guilin city l4 locates at the place most important turbidities import l5 locates at the place major groundwater import and l6 locates at the end of lijiang river which imports to guijiang river about 20 km2 later in total 24 water samples were collected in march july september and december of 2017 duplicate 50 ml water samples were collected using brown glass bottles for doc cdom and total organic carbon toc concentration analysis to which a 0 5 ml saturation hgcl2 solution was added to avoid microbial degradation the sample for doc cdom analysis was filtered using a 0 70 μm fiberglass micro membrane the sample for toc analysis was not subjected to this process glass bottles and fiberglass micro membrane were heated at 300 c for 3 4 h to remove all the organic matter before use all sample bottles were rinsed 3 5 times using water sample before water samples were taken 2 3 hydrochemical analysis a manta water quality multiprobe

parameters were measured in the field when the water samples were collected discharge data for the lijiang river and its branches were obtained from the hydrological stations set by the guilin hydrographic office discharge and precipitation data used are given in the supplementary material concentrations of toc and doc were analyzed by a multi n c 3100 analyzer analytik jena ag germany accuracy of 0 01 mg l 1 in the chongqing key laboratory of karst environment school of geographical sciences southwest university chongqing china doc concentration of gantangjiang river and three wells near l3 were monitored from march 2017 to january 2018 the data were unpublished and got from tao zhang key laboratory of karst dynamics ministry of land and resources guangxi institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences guilin china 2 4 eem fluorescence analysis the eem fluorescence measurements were performed with a rf 5301pc spectrophotometer shimazu japan equipped with a 150 w xe lamp in the chongqing key laboratory of karst environment school of geographical sciences southwest university eem fluorescence spectrum matrices were obtained by emission scanning from 250 to 600 nm with 1 nm wavelength intervals at excitations from 220 to 500 nm and a 5 nm wavelength interval a 1 cm 1 cm 4 cm quartz cuvette was used at room temperature 25 c water raman intensities were determined using deionized water millipore usa excited at 348 nm with emissions monitored at 395 nm which was consistently maintained during each session to guarantee equipment stability the fluorescence emission intensity was normalized to the intensity of the lamp at the particular excitation wavelength applied zhang et al 2009 the fluorescence emission intensity was reported by qsu eem matrices were analyzed using the parafac multivariate modeling technique which was performed in matlab mathworks natick ma with the domfluor toolbox stedmon et al 2008 raman and rayleigh scattering were mitigated by subtracting the deionized water eem spectrum collected from each corrected eem and delaunay triangular interpolation outlier samples were eliminated by checking component loadings and leverages of each sample split half analysis and random initialization were used to validate the identified components stedmon et al 2003 the maximum fluorescence intensity fi of each parafac component fmax and the percentages of each parafac component in water samples was calculated korak et al 2015 osburn et al 2013 the parafac component position was determined by the component fmax value and its ex and em wavelength the parafac component percentages and position were used to elucidate quantitative and qualitative variations in cdom and dom between water samples 2 5 organic matter concentrations the concentration of cdom was represented by the absorption at 355 nm the cdom absorbance spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2450pc uv vis spectrometer shimadzu corporation kyoto japan in a 1 cm 1 cm 4 cm quartz cuvette recording absorbance values from 200 to 800 nm at 1 nm intervals pure water was used as blank milli q usa average absorbance from 700 to 800 nm was subtracted from each spectrum to correct for offsets due to several instrument baseline effects helms et al 2008 absorbance measurements at each wavelength λ were baseline corrected by subtracting the absorbance at 700 nm absorption coefficients were obtained using the following equation zhang et al 2009 1 a c d o m λ 2 303 d λ r where acdom λ is the cdom absorption coefficient at wavelength λ nm d λ is the corrected optical density at wavelength λ and r is the cuvette path length in m in this study the absorption coefficient at 355 nm a355 was taken as a quantitative measure of cdom the linear fit of a355 absorbance and doc concentration revealed significant correlation p 0 001 r2 0 95 fig s1 which indicated cdom cloud be used to invert the characters of doc griffin et al 2018 the linear fit of total fluorescence intensity tf and doc concentration showed significant correlations p 0 01 r2 0 95 fig s1 which indicated that the fluorescence intensity could be used to invert the characters of doc the parafac component position information was compared to published references to identify their biochemical characteristics references were cites in 3 2 and these were used to distinguish the organic matter sources in this study the fluorescence of cdom fluorophores fits concentration fluorescence linear correlations and the slope of linear relationship varies between individual parafac components tryptophane and humic acid were measured as modal components to calculate the linear relationship of three parafac components the linear relationship functions were represented as following 2 ci si fii bi ci represented the concentration of model component i fii represented the fluorescence intensify of model component i which was collected with fluorescence spectrometer from a series certain concentration solutions of model component i si was the slope of linear function and bi was the intercept of linear function which

origin 2018 too 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics the hydrochemical parameters revealed different seasonal variations in which water temperature tur and tsm recorded the highest values in summer whereas concentrations of chl a recorded lower value in summer and winter fig 2 table s1 the water temperature in the lijiang river was the highest in summer with the mean value of 26 0 c which followed by that in spring and fall with mean values of 15 5 c and 19 2 c respectively and lowest in winter with a mean value of 10 4 c the concentration of tur and tsm were the highest in summer of which the mean values are 14 9 mg l 1 and 15 9 mg l respectively these were significantly higher than those in the other seasons which ranged from 6 1 to 8 6 mg l 1 and 4 8 8 2 mg l 1 respectively differently the concentration of chl a revealed higher value in spring and fall with the same mean value of 1 7 μg l 1 but lower values in winter and summer with a man value of 0 7 μg l 1 and 0 8 μg l

pattern the concentration of dic increased from 3 8 to 13 9 mg l 1 at l1 to 35 1 58 0 mg l 1 at l6 the concentration of doc increased from 1 1 to 1 8 mg l 1 at l1 to 2 6 4 1 mg l 1 at l6 of which the largest increase occurred between sites l2 and l3 fig 2 table s1 the concentration of toc increased from 1 1 to 2 2 mg l 1 at l1 to 3 4 5 1 mg l 1 at l6 of which the largest increase occurred between sites l2 and l3 the box plot of doc concentrations revealed that doc in gantangjiang river were significantly higher than that at l2 and the doc in groundwater was 2 51 mg l 1 in average which was lower than that at l3 to l6 fig 3 3 2 cdom components according to the parafac modelling results three fluorescence components were identified these were two protein like components tryptophan c1 λex λem 280 324 nm and c3 λex λem 250 368 nm and one humic like component c2 λex λem 315 414 nm fig 4 component c1 is similar to peak t1 t1 λex λem 270 295 330 380 nm which was found in uncontaminated aquatic systems and originated from phenolic and algae cellular substance decomposition martínez pérez et al 2019 murphy et al 2006 zhou et al 2019 additionally component c1 is similar to the tryptophan fluorophore peak 5 λex λem 270 280 335 340 nm in freshwater algae cultivation experiments on the phytoplankton bloom and cultivation period wang et al 2012 thus in this study component c1 is identified as an autochthonous organic matter component sourced from aquatic plant component c2 is similar to peak c c λex λem 300 350 400 460 nm which was found in uncontaminated aquatic systems garcia et al 2015 shutova et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 and represents long wavelength humus this component is also similar to the humic like component peak 3 λex λem 310 330 420 455 nm characterized as long chain alkane and less aromatic carbohydrate which originates from allochthonous decomposed soil organic matter cawley et al 2012 hambly et al 2015 wang et al 2012 in this study component c2 is identified as allochthonous soil sourced organic matter component c3 is similar to peak t2 c λex λem 210 240 330 380 nm which was found in uncontaminated aquatic systems and characterized as a tryptophan substance related to microbial involved decomposition mudarra et al 2011 component c3 is also similar to microbial related peak 4 λex λem 200 215 330 345 nm of which the fluorescence intensity increases with increased microbial colony lee et al 2018 peak t2 was also reported to be an indicator of microbial decomposition in research on organic matter composition in urban influenced and anthropogenic contaminated aquatic systems bricaud et al 1981 hong et al 2005 mudarra et al 2011 in this study component c3 is identified as autochthonous organic matter originating from microbes the total fluorescence intensities revealed a pattern of variation in cdom concentrations the total fluorescence intensity in spring and fall ranged from 32 7 to 37 6 qsu with mean values of 35 2 and 36 3 qsu respectively the intensities in winter ranged from 25 7 to 30 0 qsu with a mean value of 27 8 qsu while the lowest fluorescence intensities were recorded in summer which ranged from 17 5 to 20 4 qsu with a mean value of 19 0 qsu fig 5 a based on the percentages of the three components calculated from the fluorescence intensities the fractions of components c1 and c3 showed an increase from the upper to lower reaches however the fraction of component c2 decreased fig 5b the fractions of component c1 increased from 19 to 32 at l1 to 25 41 at l6 while the fractions of component c3 increased from 31 to 40 at l1 to 40 42 at l6 in contrast the fraction of component c2 declined from 33 to 50 at l1 to 20 41 at l6 because components c1 and c3 are autochthonous the autochthonous doc fractions increased from the upper to lower reaches and account for 59 80 in the lower reaches which was the dominant component in lijiang river 3 3 seasonal and spatial variation of doc components the concentrations of apdoc allochthonous soil sourced doc sdoc and mdoc in each sample were calculated based on eq 2 as shown in fig 5a the concentrations of apdoc and mdoc were higher than those of sdoc in spring and fall but lower than that of sdoc in summer the three doc components showed increase trend from the upper reach site l1 to the lower reach site l6 which indicated accumulation of organic matter in the aquatic system fig 6 as shown in fig 6b the largest increases in the three types of doc occur between sites l2 and l3 where the increases are 0 29 0 10 mg l 1 for apdoc 0 09 0 06 mg l 1for sdoc and 0 16 0 05 mg l 1 for mdoc the largest increase between sites l2 and l3 indicated that a considerable quantity of organic matter including from the three sources recharged the lijiang river in the upper reaches above l3 besides the increases between sites l2 and l3 apdoc and mdoc increase significantly along the path of the river whereas sdoc undergoes relatively stable recharge in the lijiang river the increases in doc concentrations between other adjacent sampling sites were much less than those between l2 and l3 with apdoc ranging from 0 07 to 0 43 mg l 1 mdoc ranging from 0 06 to 0 17 mg l 1 and sdoc ranging from 0 01 to 0 10 mg l 1 4 discussion 4 1 ground discharge of oc to lijiang river lijiang river develops in peak forest karst plain at guiling guangxi china although there are plenty of groundwater recharges to surface river in most of the karst area only a few of subsurface river is found recharging to lijiang river in lijiang catchment as show in fig 1 the main subsurface rivers are found between site l3 to site l6 the biggest groundwater is guanyan river which recharges to lijiang river near sampling site l5 and some small springs recharge to lijiang river at riverbed to investigate the influence of groundwater the oc concentration and discharge between site l3 and l6 were detected to calculate the doc flux discharge data were shown in table 1 including three big turbidities yulong river liangfeng river and chaotian river and lijiang river main stream data were collected in july october 2017 and january 2018 groundwater doc concentration was shown in fig 3 of which three wells near l3 were collected from march 2017 to january 2018 the discharge of groundwater was calculated by the increment discharge from l3 to l6 subtracting the total discharge of three major turbidities the doc concentration of groundwater was represented by the mean doc concentration of three wells in the same month doc flux was calculated by the doc concentration multiplied discharge the data in table 1 showed that doc flux of groundwater were 301 0 g s 1 28 7 g s 1 and 23 0 g s 1 which accounted for 24 36 of the doc flux increment from site l3 to l6 and 11 13 of the total doc flux at l6 the proportions of groundwater doc flux indicated that groundwater was not the dominant organic matter recharge source of lijiang river the doc recharge from surface turbidity and autochthonous oc should be the dominant doc source of lijiang river 4 2 temporal factors influencing oc concentrations apdoc and mdoc showed significantly higher concentrations in spring and fall than in summer however sdoc revealed an inverse seasonal variation the seasonal variation indicated that doc components were influenced by different environmental factors the sdoc showed remarkable increases in summer that correlated with discharge tur and tsm each of which is influenced by precipitation the higher concentrations of tur and tsm indicated higher quantities of particulate matter and turbulence which were induced by high flow velocity in the lijiang river and soil erosion in the watershed wang 2013 in summer the precipitation was 910 mm and accounted for 49 of the annual precipitation such that the discharge at site l6 was 606 l s in july which was 2 8 11 4 times of that in the other seasons the heavy and frequent storm events resulted in intensive soil erosion in the watershed and high discharge flow velocities of the lijiang river which also consequently induced increase tur tsm and soil sourced organic matter wang 2013 as shown in fig 6a the average concentration of sdoc was 0 67 mg l 1 in summer which was 113 130 of that in spring fall and winter fig 7 a the concentrations of sdoc revealed significant positive correlations with that of tur fig 7b r2 0 84 p 0 05 thus precipitation is the main factor causing seasonal variation in allochthonous sdoc the highest concentrations of apdoc were recorded in fall while the lowest concentration was recorded in summer chl a concentration exhibited similar seasonal variation the concentrations of chl a and apdoc were observed to have a very strong correlation fig 7d r2 0 95 p 0 01 the concentration of chl a is an important indicator of primary productivity that indicates the quantities of pigment and planktonic algae in aquatic systems sasaki et al 2005 the significant correlations with apdoc indicate that aquatic plant photosynthesis is the main source of apdoc and that the environmental factors that influence aquatic plant photosynthesis would be the main factors influencing the concentrations of apdoc the temperature and turbidity of the lijiang river are influenced by the asian monsoon which impacts aquatic plant photosynthesis and consequently induces seasonal variation in apdoc aquatic plants in the lijiang river are heliophile and thermophile which grow well in aquatic systems with the water temperature ranges from 15 to 30 c li 2007 thus the aquatic plants grow well in spring summer and fall when the average water temperatures are 19 2 26 0 and 15 5 c respectively however they exhibit restricted growth in winter when the average water temperature is 10 4 c fig 7c in addition the water turbidity in summer increased significantly which induced insufficient illumination in the river water and consequently restricted aquatic plant photosynthesis thus apdoc was observed at lower concentrations in winter and summer due to low temperatures and high turbidity respectively restricting aquatic plant photosynthesis and growth 4 3 spatial factors influencing oc concentrations the concentrations of dic in the lower reaches from sites l3 to l6 ranged from 21 5 to 58 0 mg l 1 which is 2 3 7 5 times of that at l1 fig 2 according to previous reports lijiang river is significantly recharged from allochthonous water which is corrosive to carbonate bedrock as zhao et al 2020 and sun et al 2019 reported dic was dominantly originated from carbonated weathering but not organic matter the high concentrations of dic in the karst area promoted aquatic plant photosynthesis liu et al 2018a yang et al 2015 which induced significantly increased concentrations of chl a the indicator of photosynthesis in the downstream karst area thus the concentrations of chl a were shown to have a similar increasing pattern insofar as the increase between sites l3 and l6 ranged from 0 31 to 0 54 mg l 1 which was 1 5 13 4 times that between sites l1 and l2 fig 2 on the other hand plenty of n and p input could result in phytoplankton increase large scale submerged plant inhabitation and doc increase in aquatic system as shown in table s1 the major cation and anion concentrations revealed that water samples of lijiang river contained very low concentrations of inorganic nutrients lijiang river has good water quality in which large scale submerged plant is the dominant aquatic species and the main nutrient source is sediment or soil at riverbed and the limited nutrient of plant in karst area is c but not n and p thus the dic fertilization is the main reason of doc formation consequently apdoc the product of aquatic plant photosynthesis was observed to have increased significantly while the concentrations revealed a significant linear correlation with dic concentrations in the lijiang river fig 8 r2 0 88 p 0 01 the concentration of apdoc and mdoc revealed significantly positive correlations with dic which indicates that dic fertilization effect was an important factor promoting increases in autochthonous doc the microbial community in surface freshwater is dominated by heterotrophic species which need organic matter as an energy and carbon source shabarova et al 2014 allochthonous organic matter has a high humification organic component and the heterotrophic species thus decompose small molecular labile organic matter produced by aquatic plants as a carbon and energy source kritzberg et al 2006 obernosterer and benner 2004 zhang et al 2009 the concentration of mdoc is influenced by the abundance of apdoc and their concentrations reveal a significant linear correlation fig 8 r2 0 94 p 0 001 progressively increasing dic concentrations were observed from the upper to lower reaches of the lijiang river which promoted the increase in apdoc and consequently induced an increase in mdoc as reported by huang et al 2020 and pu et al 2020 reservoirs are also important inorganic and oc sinks in karst areas thus the gantangjiang river which has its source from the qingshitan reservoir and recharges to the lijiang river in the upper reaches at l3 is an important oc recharge source of the lijiang river the qingshitan reservoir is located in the upper reaches of the gantangjiang river two thirds of the area of which is distributed in bare karst areas fig 1 the doc and dic concentration of gantangjiang river were significantly higher than that in l2 fig s2 and table s1 according to the discharge data from the guilin hydrological station the discharge of the gantangjiang river was 19 48 21 and 14 m3 s 1 in spring summer fall and winter respectively and corresponds to the largest recharge tributary of the lijiang river thus the water from the qingshitan reservoir contained high concentrations of dic and doc to recharge the gantangjiang river which induced impressive increases in dic and doc concentrations between sites l2 and l3 according to the hydrological data in july 2017 october 2017 and january 2018 the flux of three organic sources were calculated table 2 discharge data of july 2017 represented summer of which october 2017 represented fall and january 2018 represented winter the autochthonous doc flux from l3 to l6 were 1075 9 g s 1 in summer 130 2 g s 1 in fall and 59 0 g s 1 in winter which accounted for 79 87 of the total doc flux increment significant variation had been found in different season for the river discharge changed thus in the future work more frequently sampling and monitoring should be applied based on the temperature and hydrological condition variation to investigate the precise variation of apdoc and mdoc concentration in lijiang river also more sampling sites including important turbidity import sites and groundwater should be selected and monitored to calculate the exactly increment of autochthonous apdoc and mdoc in the surface karst aquatic system according to the high frequency monitoring cdom and hydrological data the autochthonous apdoc and mdoc flux would be calculated accurately which offers a simple and effective mothed to evaluated the organic carbon sink and dic doc conversion rate in karst aquatic system 5 conclusions three cdom components were detected in the lijiang river with em ex wavelengths similar to those reported for cdom peaks of soil aquatic plant and microbial sourced organic matter the cdom compositions and origins demonstrated that aquatic plants and microbes were involved in autochthonous doc formation the seasonal variation in oc compounds is linked to hydrochemical factors including chl a tur tsm and t of which tur and tsm were significantly influenced by the heavy precipitation in summer and chl a was influenced by the aquatic plant growth in high temperature thus precipitation and temperature are the most important environmental factors inducing increases of sdoc in summer and of apdoc in spring and fall the spatial variation of apdoc and mdoc is linked to dic which indicates that the dic fertilization effect promotes a pattern of increases in apdoc from the upper to lower reaches which consequently induces increases in mdoc the results of this study offer evidence that microbes participate in dic doc transformation and are indirectly influenced by the dic fertilization effect and photosynthesis in karst systems the apdoc and mdoc are important parts of the oc sink in karst aquatic systems and need to be considered in karst aquatic carbon sink calculations also a relatively simple mothed was developed to calculate doc component concentration from cdom eem fluorescence spectrum which offered effective and convenient way to determine the adoc component and

4514,aquatic photosynthesis transforms inorganic carbon to organic carbon oc which contributes to autochthonous organic carbon aoc in sediment and particulate organic carbon in surface karst aquatic systems aquatic plant and microbes are participated in autochthonous dissolved organic carbon adoc formation in surface karst aquatic systems but the composition and formation of adoc remains little known which leaves problem on calculation of organic carbon flux in this study the lijiang river was chosen as typical surface karst river to identify the doc composition and its origin and to explore the environmental influencing factors samples were collected seasonally from the upper to lower reaches of the river to analyze hydrochemical parameters and the excitation emission matrix eem spectrum of chromophoricdissolved organic matter cdom three cdom components were calculated by parallel factor analysis parafac from eem spectra which were allochthonous soil sourced doc sdoc autochthonous aquatic plant sourced doc apdoc and microbial sourced doc mdoc based on the doc component concentrations sdoc is induced by large amounts of precipitation causing soil erosion in summer apdoc formation is encouraged by moderate water temperatures in spring and fall restricted by high water turbidity in summer the significant positive linear correlations between apdoc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic and mdoc indicate dic fertilization effect in karst aquatic systems directly promotes apdoc formation and indirectly promotes mdoc our study develops a relatively simple way to calculate composition of karst aquatic doc which demonstrates the participation of aquatic plants and microbes in apdoc production and reiterate that autochthonous doc should be considered when calculating the carbon sink in surface karst aquatic systems keywords cdom microbes photosynthesis eem parafrac surface karst aquatic system 1 introduction the biological carbon pump bcp plays an important role in carbon cycling in karst surface freshwater ecosystem it transforms inorganic carbon to autochthonous organic carbon aoc and contributes to a stable organic carbon oc sink liu et al 2017 2018a passow and carlson 2012 yang et al 2015 the bcp effect and aquatic photosynthetic formation of aoc have been observed via variations in hydrochemical and co2 emission in karst pools and reservoirs jiang et al 2013 pu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 2019 based on stable isotope fractionation and tracer modeling high dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentration promoted aquatic plant and phytoplankton photosynthesis production in karst aquatic systems and photosynthetic aoc contributed 60 80 of total sediment and particulate oc in karst freshwater lakes and rivers in south china he et al 2020 huang et al 2020 yang et al 2016 additionally dissolved organic carbon doc was observed to increase coupled with high concentration of dic in karst aquatic systems kritzberg et al 2006 yuan 2016 which accounted for more than 80 of the total oc in karst water however the effect and contribution of aquatic plant photosynthesis on the autochthonous doc formation process remain unclear which is adverse to calculating the carbon sink flux of autochthonous doc in karst carbon cycling in addition phototrophic bacteria were observed in karst aquatic systems and engaged in the dic doc transformation kolda et al 2019 li et al 2018 posth et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 while heterotrophic bacteria were involved in the decomposition of autochthonous doc produced by aquatic photosynthesis in karst aquatic systems kritzberg et al 2006 shabarova et al 2014 song et al 2017 the participation of microbes produces microbial sourced doc mdoc production which induces variation in doc components and concentrations in karst aquatic system previous reports revealed that microbial sourced organic matter was persistent and considered a more stable carbon sink in freshwater and marine systems jiao et al 2010 ogawa et al 2001 but the characters of mdoc remain unclear in karst aquatic system also the concentration and fraction of mdoc in karst aquatic system need more accurate assessment thus mdoc flux and persistent organic carbon sink can be accurately calculated in karst aquatic system which is the crucial link between aquatic photosynthesis and persistent organic carbon sink however the effective mothed that evaluates mdoc fraction is still in developing and the environmental factors that influence mdoc formation remain unclear which are antecedent conclusions before mdoc flux calculation chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is the optically measurable component of dissolved organic matter dom in water cdom components and fluorescence indexes calculated by excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac were used to illustrate the dominant dom composition origin and biochemical characteristics cooper et al 2016 moradi et al 2018 the underground recharge from karst subterrane in surface estuaries had been distinguished by cdom fluorescence index and components which were characterized by low concentrations of om high protein like fluorescence and autochthonous and microbial origin arellano and coble 2015 chen et al 2010 martínez pérez et al 2019 pain et al 2020 sakellariadou and antivachis 2018 the fluorescence index of cave dripping and spring water revealed autochthonous microbial origin and low humification however a humic like component had also been detected which indicated soil oc input birdwell and engel 2010 hartland et al 2010 mudarra et al 2011 quiers et al 2014 simon et al 2010 tatár et al 2004 xie et al 2008 in surface karst aquatic systems including freshwater lakes reservoirs and rivers cdom components contained oc originating from terrestrial soil aquatic plant and microbial organic matter cheng 2014 liu et al 2018b lu 2018 however the temporospatial variation of cdom components and concentrations in surface karst aquatic systems is seldom reported which could be used to determine the origin and concentration of doc components and influence factors and then calculate adoc flux the lijiang river located in guangxi china was selected as a typical example of a surface karst aquatic system to investigate autochthonous doc formation and its influence factors in surface karst aquatic system water samples were collected from the upper to lower reaches seasonally to monitor the spatial and temporal variation in hydrochemistry and fluorescence spectrum characteristics cdom components were calculated from the eem fluorescence matrix using a parafac model the adoc and mdoc concentration were calculated basing on the cdom component and doc concentration we supposed that the variation of cdom spectrum characters could reveal the spatial and temporal variation of doc components and the variation of doc components would be influenced by aquatic plant and microbes the spatiotemporal variation of adoc and mdoc concentration can be used for calculation of refractory doc flux in future work 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the lijiang river is a typical karst river located in the upper reaches of the guijiang river which belongs to the pearl river system and originates from south of laoshanjie mountain guanxi zhuang autonomous region southwest china the lijiang river flows from north to south through a 12 690 km2 watershed with a length of 164 km fig 1 the lijiang watershed mainly consists of 1 a non karst area in the upper reaches of l2 that is underlain by slightly metamorphosed devonian granite 2 a covered karst area in the middle reaches between sites l2 and l3 that is underlain by middle and lower devonian red clasolite and 3 a bare karst area in the downstream of l3 that is underlain by triassic and cretaceous carbonate rocks with a thickness of approximately 900 3000 m as a percentage of the watershed the non karst area accounts for 51 of the total area the covered karst area accounts for 7 and the bare karst area accounts for 42 zhao 2018 lijiang river watershed is significantly influenced by extreme humidity and high temperatures consistent with the asian monsoon climate with annual precipitation in the range of 1367 1932 mm the discharge of the lijiang river is closely correlated with precipitation precipitation in the wet season from march to august accounts for 80 of the precipitation for the whole year while the dry season from september to february accounts for 20 consequently the discharge of lijiang river in the wet season is approximately 10 times that of the dry season in 2017 the discharge at the l6 site was 606 m3 s 1 in july 217 m3 s 1 in march 84 m3 s 1 in september and 52 m3 s 1 in december the slope of the lijiang river valley decreases from the upper to lower reaches and is no more than 0 5 between sites l3 to l6 thus the river water between sites l3 and l6 flows slowly and maintains low turbidity unless storm events occur hu 2016 yuan 2016 zhao 2018 at the upriver of lijiang river forest land covers 51 4 of the total area which decreases to 14 2 in the mid and down stream yue and chen 2008 heavy precipitation and anthropogenic activity are the main factor that induces soil erosion intensification and sediment yield increase in lijiang river basin which causes lijiang river water becomes turbid and yellow in storm event chang 2008 yue and chen 2008 zhang and wang 2016 the annual average temperature in the lijiang river watershed ranges from 16 5 to 20 0 c while the annual average duration of insolation is 1615 h per year the duration of insolation is 1354 h when temperatures are higher than 10 c which accounts for 84 of the annual duration of insolation the annual average number of non frost days is 320 days per year these features combined with the secchi disk depth of tens meters allow for the growth of dense submerged aquatic vegetation in the riverbed although vegetation varies with respect to the geomorphic features of the river dense submerged aquatic plants are observed in the lijiang river especially in the middle to lower reaches between site l3 and l6 typical native submerged c3 macrophytes resulting from the surface waters of the south china sea occur in the main channel such as vallisneria natans l potamogeton distinctus a benn ceratophyllum demersum l and hydrilla verticillata representing 90 of the submerged aquatic vegetation wu and bai 2017 other primary producers include a variety of filamentous benthic algae as well as emergent and floating species that can become dominant in the channel margins 2 2 sampling six sampling sites were selected to monitor the hydrochemical parameters and cdom fluorescence spectra in the lijiang river of which the locations are shown in fig 1 sites l1 and l2 locate at non karst and covered karst areas respectively while the other sites are located in the bare karst area l3 locates at the urban area of guilin city l4 locates at the place most important turbidities import l5 locates at the place major groundwater import and l6 locates at the end of lijiang river which imports to guijiang river about 20 km2 later in total 24 water samples were collected in march july september and december of 2017 duplicate 50 ml water samples were collected using brown glass bottles for doc cdom and total organic carbon toc concentration analysis to which a 0 5 ml saturation hgcl2 solution was added to avoid microbial degradation the sample for doc cdom analysis was filtered using a 0 70 μm fiberglass micro membrane the sample for toc analysis was not subjected to this process glass bottles and fiberglass micro membrane were heated at 300 c for 3 4 h to remove all the organic matter before use all sample bottles were rinsed 3 5 times using water sample before water samples were taken 2 3 hydrochemical analysis a manta water quality multiprobe

dissolved solid tds turbidity tur and chlorophyll a chl a accuracy 0 1 μg l 1 an alkaline testing kit merck germany was used to determine the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 0 1 mmol l 1 these parameters were measured in the field when the water samples were collected discharge data for the lijiang river and its branches were obtained from the hydrological stations set by the guilin hydrographic office discharge and precipitation data used are given in the supplementary material concentrations of toc and doc were analyzed by a multi n c 3100 analyzer analytik jena ag germany accuracy of 0 01 mg l 1 in the chongqing key laboratory of karst environment school of geographical sciences southwest university chongqing china doc concentration of gantangjiang river and three wells near l3 were monitored from march 2017 to january 2018 the data were unpublished and got from tao zhang key laboratory of karst dynamics ministry of land and resources guangxi institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences guilin china 2 4 eem fluorescence analysis the eem fluorescence measurements were performed with a rf 5301pc spectrophotometer shimazu japan equipped with a 150 w xe lamp in the chongqing key laboratory of karst environment school of geographical sciences southwest university eem fluorescence spectrum matrices were obtained by emission scanning from 250 to 600 nm with 1 nm wavelength intervals at excitations from 220 to 500 nm and a 5 nm wavelength interval a 1 cm 1 cm 4 cm quartz cuvette was used at room temperature 25 c water raman intensities were determined using deionized water millipore usa excited at 348 nm with emissions monitored at 395 nm which was consistently maintained during each session to guarantee equipment stability the fluorescence emission intensity was normalized to the intensity of the lamp at the particular excitation wavelength applied zhang et al 2009 the fluorescence emission intensity was reported by qsu eem matrices were analyzed using the parafac multivariate modeling technique which was performed in matlab mathworks natick ma with the domfluor toolbox stedmon et al 2008 raman and rayleigh scattering were mitigated by subtracting the deionized water eem spectrum collected from each corrected eem and delaunay triangular interpolation outlier samples were eliminated by checking component loadings and leverages of each sample split half analysis and random initialization were used to validate the identified components stedmon et al 2003 the maximum fluorescence intensity fi of each parafac component fmax and the percentages of each parafac component in water samples was calculated korak et al 2015 osburn et al 2013 the parafac component position was determined by the component fmax value and its ex and em wavelength the parafac component percentages and position were used to elucidate quantitative and qualitative variations in cdom and dom between water samples 2 5 organic matter concentrations the concentration of cdom was represented by the absorption at 355 nm the cdom absorbance spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2450pc uv vis spectrometer shimadzu corporation kyoto japan in a 1 cm 1 cm 4 cm quartz cuvette recording absorbance values from 200 to 800 nm at 1 nm intervals pure water was used as blank milli q usa average absorbance from 700 to 800 nm was subtracted from each spectrum to correct for offsets due to several instrument baseline effects helms et al 2008 absorbance measurements at each wavelength λ were baseline corrected by subtracting the absorbance at 700 nm absorption coefficients were obtained using the following equation zhang et al 2009 1 a c d o m λ 2 303 d λ r where acdom λ is the cdom absorption coefficient at wavelength λ nm d λ is the corrected optical density at wavelength λ and r is the cuvette path length in m in this study the absorption coefficient at 355 nm a355 was taken as a quantitative measure of cdom the linear fit of a355 absorbance and doc concentration revealed significant correlation p 0 001 r2 0 95 fig s1 which indicated cdom cloud be used to invert the characters of doc griffin et al 2018 the linear fit of total fluorescence intensity tf and doc concentration showed significant correlations p 0 01 r2 0 95 fig s1 which indicated that the fluorescence intensity could be used to invert the characters of doc the parafac component position information was compared to published references to identify their biochemical characteristics references were cites in 3 2 and these were used to distinguish the organic matter sources in this study the fluorescence of cdom fluorophores fits concentration fluorescence linear correlations and the slope of linear relationship varies between individual parafac components tryptophane and humic acid were measured as modal components to calculate the linear relationship of three parafac components the linear relationship functions were represented as following 2 ci si fii bi ci represented the concentration of model component i fii represented the fluorescence intensify of model component i which was collected with fluorescence spectrometer from a series certain concentration solutions of model component i si was the slope of linear function and bi was the intercept of linear function which were calculated from linear fitting according to ci and fii the concentration and fluorescence intensify data of model components were shown in fig s2 as well as linear functions the concentration of

used to model the eem parafac analysis and calculate cdom component factors origin 2018 was used to calculate the hydrochemical parameters and render the graphics linear regression was completed with origin 2018 too 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics the hydrochemical parameters revealed different seasonal variations in which water temperature tur and tsm recorded the highest values in summer whereas concentrations of chl a recorded lower value in summer and winter fig 2 table s1 the water temperature in the lijiang river was the highest in summer with the mean value of 26 0 c which followed by that in spring and fall with mean values of 15 5 c and 19 2 c respectively and lowest in winter with a mean value of 10 4 c the concentration of tur and tsm were the highest in summer of which the mean values are 14 9 mg l 1 and 15 9 mg l respectively these were significantly higher than those in the other seasons which ranged from 6 1 to 8 6 mg l 1 and 4 8 8 2 mg l 1 respectively differently the concentration of chl a revealed higher value in spring and fall with the same mean value of 1 7 μg l 1 but lower values in winter and summer with a man value of 0 7 μg l 1 and 0 8 μg l 1 respectively the spatial variation of hydrochemical parameters exhibited a significant pattern of increasing concentrations from the upper to lower reaches whereas tur and tsm exhibited a decreasing pattern the concentration of dic increased from 3 8 to 13 9 mg l 1 at l1 to 35 1 58 0 mg l 1 at l6 the concentration of doc increased from 1 1 to 1 8 mg l 1 at l1 to 2 6 4 1 mg l 1 at l6 of which the largest increase occurred between sites l2 and l3 fig 2 table s1 the concentration of toc increased from 1 1 to 2 2 mg l 1 at l1 to 3 4 5 1 mg l 1 at l6 of which the largest increase occurred between sites l2 and l3 the box plot of doc concentrations revealed that doc in gantangjiang river were significantly higher than that at l2 and the doc in groundwater was 2 51 mg l 1 in average which was lower than that at l3 to l6 fig 3 3 2 cdom components according to the parafac modelling results three fluorescence components were identified these were two protein like components tryptophan c1 λex λem 280 324 nm and c3 λex λem 250 368 nm and one humic like component c2 λex λem 315 414 nm fig 4 component c1 is similar to peak t1 t1 λex λem 270 295 330 380 nm which was found in uncontaminated aquatic systems and originated from phenolic and algae cellular substance decomposition martínez pérez et al 2019 murphy et al 2006 zhou et al 2019 additionally component c1 is similar to the tryptophan fluorophore peak 5 λex λem 270 280 335 340 nm in freshwater algae cultivation experiments on the phytoplankton bloom and cultivation period wang et al 2012 thus in this study component c1 is identified as an autochthonous organic matter component sourced from aquatic plant component c2 is similar to peak c c λex λem 300 350 400 460 nm which was found in uncontaminated aquatic systems garcia et al 2015 shutova et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 and represents long wavelength humus this component is also similar to the humic like component peak 3 λex λem 310 330 420 455 nm characterized as long chain alkane and less aromatic carbohydrate which originates from allochthonous decomposed soil organic matter cawley et al 2012 hambly et al 2015 wang et al 2012 in this study component c2 is identified as allochthonous soil sourced organic matter component c3 is similar to peak t2 c λex λem 210 240 330 380 nm which was found in uncontaminated aquatic systems and characterized as a tryptophan substance related to microbial involved decomposition mudarra et al 2011 component c3 is also similar to microbial related peak 4 λex λem 200 215 330 345 nm of which the fluorescence intensity increases with increased microbial colony lee et al 2018 peak t2 was also reported to be an indicator of microbial decomposition in research on organic matter composition in urban influenced and anthropogenic contaminated aquatic systems bricaud et al 1981 hong et al 2005 mudarra et al 2011 in this study component c3 is identified as autochthonous organic matter originating from microbes the total fluorescence intensities revealed a pattern of variation in cdom concentrations the total fluorescence intensity in spring and fall ranged from 32 7 to 37 6 qsu with mean values of 35 2 and 36 3 qsu respectively the intensities in winter ranged from 25 7 to 30 0 qsu with a mean value of 27 8 qsu while the lowest fluorescence intensities were recorded in summer which ranged from 17 5 to 20 4 qsu with a mean value of 19 0 qsu fig 5 a based on the percentages of the three components calculated from the fluorescence intensities the fractions of components c1 and c3 showed an increase from the upper to lower reaches however the fraction of component c2 decreased fig 5b the fractions of component c1 increased from 19 to 32 at l1 to 25 41 at l6 while the fractions of component c3 increased from 31 to 40 at l1 to 40 42 at l6 in contrast the fraction of component c2 declined from 33 to 50 at l1 to 20 41 at l6 because components c1 and c3 are autochthonous the autochthonous doc fractions increased from the upper to lower reaches and account for 59 80 in the lower reaches which was the dominant component in lijiang river 3 3 seasonal and spatial variation of doc components the concentrations of apdoc allochthonous soil sourced doc sdoc and mdoc in each sample were calculated based on eq 2 as shown in fig 5a the concentrations of apdoc and mdoc were higher than those of sdoc in spring and fall but lower than that of sdoc in summer the three doc components showed increase trend from the upper reach site l1 to the lower reach site l6 which indicated accumulation of organic matter in the aquatic system fig 6 as shown in fig 6b the largest increases in the three types of doc occur between sites l2 and l3 where the increases are 0 29 0 10 mg l 1 for apdoc 0 09 0 06 mg l 1for sdoc and 0 16 0 05 mg l 1 for mdoc the largest increase between sites l2 and l3 indicated that a considerable quantity of organic matter including from the three sources recharged the lijiang river in the upper reaches above l3 besides the increases between sites l2 and l3 apdoc and mdoc increase significantly along the path of the river whereas sdoc undergoes relatively stable recharge in the lijiang river the increases in doc concentrations between other adjacent sampling sites were much less than those between l2 and l3 with apdoc ranging from 0 07 to 0 43 mg l 1 mdoc ranging from 0 06 to 0 17 mg l 1 and sdoc ranging from 0 01 to 0 10 mg l 1 4 discussion 4 1 ground discharge of oc to lijiang river lijiang river develops in peak forest karst plain at guiling guangxi china although there are plenty of groundwater recharges to surface river in most of the karst area only a few of subsurface river is found recharging to lijiang river in lijiang catchment as show in fig 1 the main subsurface rivers are found between site l3 to site l6 the biggest groundwater is guanyan river which recharges to lijiang river near sampling site l5 and some small springs recharge to lijiang river at riverbed to investigate the influence of groundwater the oc concentration and discharge between site l3 and l6 were detected to calculate the doc flux discharge data were shown in table 1 including three big turbidities yulong river liangfeng river and chaotian river and lijiang river main stream data were collected in july october 2017 and january 2018 groundwater doc concentration was shown in fig 3 of which three wells near l3 were collected from march 2017 to january 2018 the discharge of groundwater was calculated by the increment discharge from l3 to l6 subtracting the total discharge of three major turbidities the doc concentration of groundwater was represented by the mean doc concentration of three wells in the same month doc flux was calculated by the doc concentration multiplied discharge the data in table 1 showed that doc flux of groundwater were 301 0 g s 1 28 7 g s 1 and 23 0 g s 1 which accounted for 24 36 of the doc flux increment from site l3 to l6 and 11 13 of the total doc flux at l6 the proportions of groundwater doc flux indicated that groundwater was not the dominant organic matter recharge source of lijiang river the doc recharge from surface turbidity and autochthonous oc should be the dominant doc source of lijiang river 4 2 temporal factors influencing oc concentrations apdoc and mdoc showed significantly higher concentrations in spring and fall than in summer however sdoc revealed an inverse seasonal variation the seasonal variation indicated that doc components were influenced by different environmental factors the sdoc showed remarkable increases in summer that correlated with discharge tur and tsm each of which is influenced by precipitation the higher concentrations of tur and tsm indicated higher quantities of particulate matter and turbulence which were induced by high flow velocity in the lijiang river and soil erosion in the watershed wang 2013 in summer the precipitation was 910 mm and accounted for 49 of the annual precipitation such that the discharge at site l6 was 606 l s in july which was 2 8 11 4 times of that in the other seasons the heavy and frequent storm events resulted in intensive soil erosion in the watershed and high discharge flow velocities of the lijiang river which also consequently induced increase tur tsm and soil sourced organic matter wang 2013 as shown in fig 6a the average concentration of sdoc was 0 67 mg l 1 in summer which was 113 130 of that in spring fall and winter fig 7 a the concentrations of sdoc revealed significant positive correlations with that of tur fig 7b r2 0 84 p 0 05 thus precipitation is the main factor causing seasonal variation in allochthonous sdoc the highest concentrations of apdoc were recorded in fall while the lowest concentration was recorded in summer chl a concentration exhibited similar seasonal variation the concentrations of chl a and apdoc were observed to have a very strong correlation fig 7d r2 0 95 p 0 01 the concentration of chl a is an important indicator of primary productivity that indicates the quantities of pigment and planktonic algae in aquatic systems sasaki et al 2005 the significant correlations with apdoc indicate that aquatic plant photosynthesis is the main source of apdoc and that the environmental factors that influence aquatic plant photosynthesis would be the main factors influencing the concentrations of apdoc the temperature and turbidity of the lijiang river are influenced by the asian monsoon which impacts aquatic plant photosynthesis and consequently induces seasonal variation in apdoc aquatic plants in the lijiang river are heliophile and thermophile which grow well in aquatic systems with the water temperature ranges from 15 to 30 c li 2007 thus the aquatic plants grow well in spring summer and fall when the average water temperatures are 19 2 26 0 and 15 5 c respectively however they exhibit restricted growth in winter when the average water temperature is 10 4 c fig 7c in addition the water turbidity in summer increased significantly which induced insufficient illumination in the river water and consequently restricted aquatic plant photosynthesis thus apdoc was observed at lower concentrations in winter and summer due to low temperatures and high turbidity respectively restricting aquatic plant photosynthesis and growth 4 3 spatial factors influencing oc concentrations the concentrations of dic in the lower reaches from sites l3 to l6 ranged from 21 5 to 58 0 mg l 1 which is 2 3 7 5 times of that at l1 fig 2 according to previous reports lijiang river is significantly recharged from allochthonous water which is corrosive to carbonate bedrock as zhao et al 2020 and sun et al 2019 reported dic was dominantly originated from carbonated weathering but not organic matter the high concentrations of dic in the karst area promoted aquatic plant photosynthesis liu et al 2018a yang et al 2015 which induced significantly increased concentrations of chl a the indicator of photosynthesis in the downstream karst area thus the concentrations of chl a were shown to have a similar increasing pattern insofar as the increase between sites l3 and l6 ranged from 0 31 to 0 54 mg l 1 which was 1 5 13 4 times that between sites l1 and l2 fig 2 on the other hand plenty of n and p input could result in phytoplankton increase large scale submerged plant inhabitation and doc increase in aquatic system as shown in table s1 the major cation and anion concentrations revealed that water samples of lijiang river contained very low concentrations of inorganic nutrients lijiang river has good water quality in which large scale submerged plant is the dominant aquatic species and the main nutrient source is sediment or soil at riverbed and the limited nutrient of plant in karst area is c but not n and p thus the dic fertilization is the main reason of doc formation consequently apdoc the product of aquatic plant photosynthesis was observed to have increased significantly while the concentrations revealed a significant linear correlation with dic concentrations in the lijiang river fig 8 r2 0 88 p 0 01 the concentration of apdoc and mdoc revealed significantly positive correlations with dic which indicates that dic fertilization effect was an important factor promoting increases in autochthonous doc the microbial community in surface freshwater is dominated by heterotrophic species which need organic matter as an energy and carbon source shabarova et al 2014 allochthonous organic matter has a high humification organic component and the heterotrophic species thus decompose small molecular labile organic matter produced by aquatic plants as a carbon and energy source kritzberg et al 2006 obernosterer and benner 2004 zhang et al 2009 the concentration of mdoc is influenced by the abundance of apdoc and their concentrations reveal a significant linear correlation fig 8 r2 0 94 p 0 001 progressively increasing dic concentrations were observed from the upper to lower reaches of the lijiang river which promoted the increase in apdoc and consequently induced an increase in mdoc as reported by huang et al 2020 and pu et al 2020 reservoirs are also important inorganic and oc sinks in karst areas thus the gantangjiang river which has its source from the qingshitan reservoir and recharges to the lijiang river in the upper reaches at l3 is an important oc recharge source of the lijiang river the qingshitan reservoir is located in the upper reaches of the gantangjiang river two thirds of the area of which is distributed in bare karst areas fig 1 the doc and dic concentration of gantangjiang river were significantly higher than that in l2 fig s2 and table s1 according to the discharge data from the guilin hydrological station the discharge of the gantangjiang river was 19 48 21 and 14 m3 s 1 in spring summer fall and winter respectively and corresponds to the largest recharge tributary of the lijiang river thus the water from the qingshitan reservoir contained high concentrations of dic and doc to recharge the gantangjiang river which induced impressive increases in dic and doc concentrations between sites l2 and l3 according to the hydrological data in july 2017 october 2017 and january 2018 the flux of three organic sources were calculated table 2 discharge data of july 2017 represented summer of which october 2017 represented fall and january 2018 represented winter the autochthonous doc flux from l3 to l6 were 1075 9 g s 1 in summer 130 2 g s 1 in fall and 59 0 g s 1 in winter which accounted for 79 87 of the total doc flux increment significant variation had been found in different season for the river discharge changed thus in the future work more frequently sampling and monitoring should be applied based on the temperature and hydrological condition variation to investigate the precise variation of apdoc and mdoc concentration in lijiang river also more sampling sites including important turbidity import sites and groundwater should be selected and monitored to calculate the exactly increment of autochthonous apdoc and mdoc in the surface karst aquatic system according to the high frequency monitoring cdom and hydrological data the autochthonous apdoc and mdoc flux would be calculated accurately which offers a simple and effective mothed to evaluated the organic carbon sink and dic doc conversion rate in karst aquatic system 5 conclusions three cdom components were detected in the lijiang river with em ex wavelengths similar to those reported for cdom peaks of soil aquatic plant and microbial sourced organic matter the cdom compositions and origins demonstrated that aquatic plants and microbes were involved in autochthonous doc formation the seasonal variation in oc compounds is linked to hydrochemical factors including chl a tur tsm and t of which tur and tsm were significantly influenced by the heavy precipitation in summer and chl a was influenced by the aquatic plant growth in high temperature thus precipitation and temperature are the most important environmental factors inducing increases of sdoc in summer and of apdoc in spring and fall the spatial variation of apdoc and mdoc is linked to dic which indicates that the dic fertilization effect promotes a pattern of increases in apdoc from the upper to lower reaches which consequently induces increases in mdoc the results of this study offer evidence that microbes participate in dic doc transformation and are indirectly influenced by the dic fertilization effect and photosynthesis in karst systems the apdoc and mdoc are important parts of the oc sink in karst aquatic systems and need to be considered in karst aquatic carbon sink calculations also a relatively simple mothed was developed to calculate doc component concentration from cdom eem fluorescence spectrum which offered effective and convenient way to determine the adoc component and concentration credit authorship contribution statement qiufang he conceptualization visualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing qiong xiao writing review editing
