12195,groundwater is only an important water resources for drinking and irrigation in the central telangana india rapid growth in the population and intensive irrigation practises has become stress on groundwater the available groundwater are being depleted and its quality has also deteriorated for this reason a total of 105 groundwater samples collected from semi arid region of central telangana were executed in order to evaluate its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes results highlighted that most of the groundwater is suitable for drinking purposes based on ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as caco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 about 51 and 71 of groundwater samples were exceeded the maximum permissible limits of fluoride and nitrate respectively therefore it is suggested that groundwater with high fluoride and nitrate concentration water should be avoided for drinking purposes spatial distribution maps are generated using gis platform and the dissimilar distribution pattern was noticed for nitrate and fluoride in the study region gibbs plots authenticate that the groundwater chemistry is controlled by rock water interaction and geochemical scatter plots suggested that the silicate mineral dissolution play dominant role in the chemistry of groundwater according to the water quality index wqi values 60 and 36 of groundwater samples fall under excellent and good category for drinking purposes the groundwater is na so4 2 deep meteoric percolation type but most of it belong to ca2 mg2 hco3 na hco3 facies and few are ca2 mg2 cl and na cl facies majority of groundwater samples exhibit that the alkaline earths ca2 mg2 exceed alkali cation na k and strong acids so4 2 cl dominate over weak acid hco3 irrigational suitability of groundwater in the study area was also estimated through sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na and residual sodium carbonate rsc magnesium hazard ratio mhr and kelly ratio kr results shown that the majority of the groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation uses keywords groundwater quality water quality index sodium adsorption ratio sodium percentage residual sodium carbonate magnesium hazard ratio kelly ratio 1 introduction groundwater is the main commodity source of water supply for drinking agricultural and industrial purposes exclusively in the arid and semi arid regions of many countries globally 65 of groundwater is used for drinking purposes 20 for irrigation and livestock and 15 for industry and mining saeid et al 2018 and approximately one third of the world s population depends only on groundwater for drinking purposes unep 1999 adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 especially developing countries like india and china groundwater plays a vital role to fulfilling the basic needs there are few particular reasons for hang on groundwater such as tremendous growth of human population increasing agricultural and industrial sectors inadequate supply of surface water and thereby gradually groundwater is over exploited for drinking and also most useful for various purposes therefore it is necessary to monitoring the groundwater quality and quantity are equally important due to the aptness of water for drinking agricultural and industrial uses adimalla and li 2019 singh et al 2011 therefore groundwater measures have become vitally important which needs to be adopted in semi arid regions to meet the increasing demand and declining groundwater quality hence groundwater measures hydrochemistry in the semi arid region is typically controlled by local hydrogeology geology evaporation precipitation rock water interactions mineral dissolution weathering industrial effluents irrigation cultivation chemical fertilizers and largely anthropogenic activities furthermore hydrogeochemical measures such as weathering dissolution ion exchange control the concentrations of major and minor ions in groundwater singh et al 2011 rajesh et al 2012 to demonstrate the groundwater measures and its suitability for drinking irrigation and major contaminant source have been carried out all over the world adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 adimalla et al 2018b di≈üli 2017 li et al 2016b vahab et al 2015 faten et al 2016 observed that the water rock interaction and evaporation are the main source for contaminating groundwater in northeastern tunisia li et al 2016a noted that the groundwater evaporation influences the development of sulphate type groundwater contamination in a semi arid region of northwest china sadat noori et al 2014 evaluated an aquifer with the combined use of the water quality index wqi and a geographical information system gis in a semi arid area at iran the gis technology often used for generating the spatial distribution maps of groundwater quality for various purposes and it can also helpful to identify the water quality zones and also polluted zones jasrotia et al 2018 2019 adimalla and taloor 2020 however over exploitation of groundwater is one of the biggest problem in many regions of the world moreover india is also one of them ngwa 2016 noticed that the annual extraction of groundwater in india is the highest in the world which even supersedes that of the usa and china put together furthermore according to the central ground water board cgwb 2014 report reveals that the groundwater draft in india is 245 109 m3 most of which is used for irrigation purposes only and also nearly 90 of rural population of the country uses groundwater for drinking and domestic purposes however in india growing urbanization population growth and over exploitation of rural areas for drinking domestic and agriculture needs extreme usages of fertilizers impacts of anthropogenic activities etc which majorly influence the groundwater quality therefore a number of studies on groundwater quality with respect to drinking and irrigation purposes have been carried out in the different parts of india haritash et al 2017 rajesh et al 2012 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2013 2017a 2017b 2018a 2018b adimalla and li 2019 narsimha et al 2018 chetan and ahada 2017 narsimha 2018 subba rao et al 2012 in the present study chinnakodur area most of the population purely depend on groundwater which is only the main source for drinking and irrigation purposes the predicament of medak region district telangana is caused for much concern considering the steady drop of water table from 18 39 m below ground level mbgl to 24 34 mbgl adimalla et al 2018b and chinnkodur is one of the region facing the groundwater scarcity contamination pollution decline of water and quality issues therefore the principal objectives of this paper are a to analyse the hydrogeochemical characteristics and facies of groundwater b to assess the overall groundwater quality using water quality index wqi method c to evaluate the groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes using multiple water quality indicators such as sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na residual sodium carbonate rsc magnesium hazard ratio mhr and kelly ratio kr however the present study results are most useful for local groundwater quality assessment and also management supporting the maintainable groundwater quality development in the study region 2 study area the present study area is situated in the central part of telangana and located between 18 12 18 26 n and 78 00 79 98 e fig 1 which has a continental arid to semi arid climate with an annual mean temperature is 26 3 c and may is the hottest month of the year the study area is hydrologically closed and the water source is mainly from precipitation rainfall in the region is extremely seasonal with about 745 mm ensuing during the southwest monsoon june september 109 mm during the northeast monsoon oct dec no rainfall in winter jan feb and 55 mm in summer march may the exposed bedrock of the regional ground surfaces was mainly formed during the archaean and is comprised mainly of granites gneisses amphibolite hornblende biotite schist and basic rocks in the current study groundwater naturally occurs under phreatic conditions in the weathered layer and semi confined conditions in the fractured zones at different levels cgwb 2013 moreover the depth of the groundwater level ranges from 20 m to 45 m in study region because it is occupied by totally hard rock terrain in weathered condition and depth of groundwater was more in un weathered zones cgwb 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical procedure the 105 groundwater samples were collected in 1 l high density polyethylene plastic bottles which were pre cleaned with double distilled water and then three times with sampling water and then analyzed for various hydrochemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as caco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 and fluoride f ec ph and tds of water samples were measured in the field immediately after the collection of the samples by using ph ec tds meter hanna hi 9811 5 th ca2 and mg2 were determined titrimetrically using standard ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta chloride was estimated by agno3 titration na and k were measured by flame photometer model 130 systronics flame photometer co3 2 and hco3 were estimated by titrating with standard sulphuric acid so4 2 and no3 were determined by colorimetry with an uv visible spectrophotometer the fluoride concentration in the groundwater was determined electrochemically using fluoride ion selective electrode apha 1995 the electrode used was an orion fluoride electrode coupled to an orion electrometer standard fluoride solutions 0 1 10 mg l were prepared from a stock solution 100 mg l of sodium fluoride as per experimental requirement 2 ml of total ionic strength adjusting buffer grade iii tisab iii was added in 20 ml of sample the ion meter was calibrated for a slope of 59 2 2 however the location and distribution maps of fluoride and nitrate of the study region are prepared using arcgis version 9 3 software with spatial analyst module and kriging interpoloation technique 3 2 irrigation water quality evaluation typically quality of irrigation water signifies its mineral composition and also demonstrates its effects on plants and as well as soil therefore assessment of groundwater for irrigation is most important generally irrigation water quality was evaluated through sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium percentage na kelly s ratio kr and magnesium hazard ratio mhr mostly these all parameters are vital in measuring the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes however these profound indicators can be calculated as follows richards 1954 eaton 1950 wilcox 1955 kelley 1963 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 2 n a n a c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 3 rsc hco 3 co 3 2 ca 2 mg 2 4 m h r m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 5 k r n a c a 2 m g 2 where all ion concentration na ca2 mg2 hco3 co3 2 k are expressed in meq l 4 results and discussion 4 1 assessment of groundwater suitability for drinking purposes the physicochemical parameters of the sampled groundwater are presented in table 1 descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean and standard deviation and the major ion values are compared with world health organization who 2011 and bureau of india standard bis 2012 are shown in table 2 to find the suitability of the groundwater samples collected for drinking purposes the ph is one of the most important parameter indicating drinking water suitability as table 2 shows ph values are ranged from 6 9 to 9 1 with mean value 8 1 about two groundwater samples are acidic and remaining are all slightly alkaline nature however 9 of groundwater were exceeding the recommended limits bis 2012 table 2 supplementary fig 1a the tds embodies the total dissolved solids in water demonstrating water salinity and the applicability of groundwater to human consumption as shown in table 1 the level of tds varies from 224 to 1529 mg l with mean of 741 mg l and about 82 of groundwater samples are within the acceptable limit 500 mg l 18 of the samples fall under the permissible limit 2000 mg l table 2 supplementary fig 1b and effectively suitable for drinking purposes further tds values are classified according to davis and dewiest 1967 freeze and cherry 1979 which are presented in table 3 indicates that 87 and 13 of groundwater samples are under fresh and brackish water respectively freeze and cherry 1979 th represents the sum of ca2 and mg2 dissolved in groundwater expressed as caco3 the maximum permissible limit of th for drinking purpose is 500 mg l as per who standard who 2011 and results indicate that only one groundwater sample is above the maximum permissible limit 500 mg l which clearly depicted in supplementary fig 1c however about 7 of groundwater samples are exceeded the 300 mg l which is considered as a very hard sawyer and mccarty 1967 table 3 the cl and so4 2 ions concentration in the groundwater ranged between 21 and 320 mg l and 16 and 425 mg l with a mean values of 128 3 and 188 5 mg l respectively table 2 the acceptable and permissible limit of cl in potable water is 250 mg l and 1000 mg l for indian conditions bis 2012 all the groundwater samples are within the maximum permissible limits table 2 supplementary fig 1d which are most suitable for drinking purposes about three groundwater samples which are collected in the villages of ramanaptla 421 mg l kondagulakunta 421 mg l and gopalapuram 425 mg l are exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 400 mg l for sulphate for drinking purposes table 1 supplementary fig 1e the ca2 and mg2 concentrations of the groundwater are totally below the maximum permissible limits prescribed by who 2011 for potable purposes and ranges from 14 to 152 mg l 10 83 mg l respectively table 2 supplementary figs 1f and 1g the average concentrations of na and k ions found in groundwater samples in the study region are 72 and 3 1 mg l respectively and all the samples are within the maximum permissible limits prescribed by who who 2011 table 2 it is noticed in this study that compared to other major cations the concentration of k in groundwater shows typically in low level due to it weak mobility for the past two decades there has been an increasing trend in nitrate pollution in groundwater especially telangana region due to fast growing population urbanization industrialization and huge application of nitrogenous fertilizers ammonium nitrate and urea and agricultural practices and also high nitrate concentration in drinking water can pose risk of human health adimalla 2019b adimalla and qian 2019a 2019b the major source of nitrogen in water biological fixation and precipitation and fertilizers activity were identified by berner and berner 1987 this is the second largest problem after f facing in the telangana state and as well as the study region because nitrate contamination is more associated with health concerns nitrate concentration in the groundwater in the study area is ranging from 12 to 212 mg l with a mean of 69 mg l table 2 in the study region majority of population depend on agriculture practices for surviving and using different fertilizers for crop yields which could be one of the reason for elevated nitrate concentration in the study area the investigation reveals that the nitrate concentration in 71 of groundwater samples exceeded the bis recommended limit of 45 mg l for drinking purposes table 2 a graphical interpretation for risk evaluation of nitrate concentration for suitability drinking utility in study region is shown in fig 2 a and classified into three categories adimalla et al 2018b namely no risk category suitable for drinking purposes 45 mg l high risk category 46 100 mg l very high risk category 100 mg l based on this classification figs 2 28 groundwater samples are under no risk which are purely suitable for drinking purpose 55 and 17 groundwater samples under high risk and very high risk category which are absolutely not suitable for drinking purposes in the study region however spatial distribution map of nitrate is depicted in fig 3 and high risk zones are noticed in the northern southern and a few patches are in eastern parts of the study region moreover comly 1987 has firstly reported health implications of exposure to nitrate in drinking water and further elevated nitrate concentration in groundwater and its effects on human health and occurrence has been meticulously studied coinly 1945 comly 1987 fan et al 1987 canter 1996 nas and berktay 2006 nkotagu 1996 adimalla and li 2019 therefore constant consumption of the high nitrate groundwater for drinking purposes can cause methemoglobinemia in infants of the study region fluoride is frequently found in higher concentration in groundwater especially in arid and semi arid regions in various geological terrains in the world and specifically in telangana provinces adimalla and li 2019 narsimha and rajitha 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b where most of the rural population suffers from deadly disease of fluorosis adimalla 2019a because there is no proper drinking facility evidently all districts 10 out of 10 districts of telangana state in india are reported to be fluoride endemic adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 however the present study region people depends on groundwater for drinking and other uses the fluoride concentration in the groundwater ranges from 0 5 to 3 5 mg l with a mean value of 1 5 mg l table 2 the results highlighted that 51 of groundwater samples have found within the recommended limits whereas 49 of them contain fluoride concentration exceeding the 1 5 mg l prescribed by who 2011 furthermore the results have been classified into five groups such as 0 5 mg l dental caries 0 6 1 5 mg l beneficial for human health 1 6 2 mg l dental fluorosis 2 3 mg l dental and skeletal fluorosis and finally 3 mg l leads to skeletal fluorosis which are clearly illustrated in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 about 26 of groundwater samples are in yellow colour and vulnerable for dental fluorosis 18 and 5 of samples are shown in red and green colour and can cause dental to skeletal fluorosis and if continuous by consumed this water for drinking purposes in addition the spatial distribution of fluoride map indicates that the elevated fluoride concentration are extensively distributed in groundwater throughout the study region fig 3 the occurrence of high fluoride groundwater is controlled by various factors including rock chemistry residence time well depth preferential pathways for the upward movement of deep groundwater as discussed above the study region occupied by granitic rocks these granitic rocks predominantly contain a relative abundance of fluoride bearing minerals which forms the source of fluoride to percolating groundwater in the recharge zones supplementary table 1 bailey 1977 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 adimalla et al 2018a 2019 however fluoride can be leached into groundwater from many fluoride rich minerals through weathering and rock water interaction processes the important fluoride minerals are fluorite or fluorspar caf2 fluorapatite ca5 oh f po4 3 and cryolite na3alf6 besides these other fluoride bearing minerals are biotite muscovite lepidolite tourmaline hornblende series minerals glaucophane and riebeckite and asbestos chrysotile actinolite anthophyllite out of 416 fluoride bearing rock minerals only topaz fluorite villiaumite and cryolite have fluorine as an essential constituent in the formula bailey 1977 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b 2018a 2018b narsimha and rajitha 2018 subba rao et al 2012 adimalla and li 2019 narsimha et al 2018 chetan and ahada 2017 narsimha 2018 handa 1975 these fluoride bearing minerals could be the case for elevated fluoride concentration in the study region groundwater however the present investigation suggests that the groundwater of eastern and northern part of the study region groundwater not suitable for drinking purposes fig 3 4 2 groundwater quality assessment through water quality index wqi studies in recent trends the wqi has been used by hydrogeologists hydrologists environmental scientists and many researchers to evaluate the water quality for drinking purposes in various geological terrains chung et al 2014 aly et al 2014 adimalla et al 2018b adimalla and qian 2019a adimalla and taloor 2020 the water quality index wqi is an effective tool to estimate the overall groundwater quality for drinking purposes by examining the individual water quality parameters ph tds th ca2 na k mg2 so4 2 hco3 cl no3 and f the standards for drinking purposes as recommended by bureau of indian standards bis 2012 have been used for the calculation of wqi which involves three steps in the first step each of the eleven chemical parameters like ph tds th ca2 na k mg2 so4 2 hco3 cl no3 and f were assigned weights wi ranging from 2 to 5 and its selection depends on their significance in quality of water for drinking purposes table 4 ramakrishnalah et al 2009 in the second step is relative weights wi are calculated through equation 6 6 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight wi is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters table 4 in the third step quality rating scale calculation qi for each individual parameter is computed by dividing its concentration for each groundwater sample with drinking water quality standards of bis 2012 and then multiplied by 100 using equation 7 7 q i c i s i 100 where qi is the quality rating ci is the concentration of each chemical parameter in each water sample in milligrams per litre mg l and si is the indian drinking water bis 2012 guidelines for each chemical parameter eventuality water quality sub index sii for each chemical parameter was computed by equation 8 and whole the wqi was determined by equation 9 8 s i i w i q i 9 wqi si i where sii is the sub index of the ith parameter qi is the rating based on the concentration of ith parameter and n is the total number of parameters groundwater samples n 105 and its wqi values are presented in table 5 the computed wqi values range from 67 to 228 with a mean of 141 thus the wqi can be classified as excellent water type if the wqi values are less than 150 good water type it the wqi values ranged from 150 to 120 poor water type if the wqi values ranged between 200 and 250 very poor water type if the wqi values ranged from 250 to 300 and unsuitable for drinking water type if the wqi values larger than 300 ramakrishnalah et al 2009 as shown in table 5 60 and 36 of groundwater as fall under excellent and good category for drinking purposes about 4 groundwater samples are found poor water quality for drinking purposes fig 4 4 3 groundwater quality for irrigation purpose in the study region agriculture is the primary occupation where the main crops are rice jowar bajra sugarcane black gram red gram bengal gram cotton and groundnut moreover agriculture is a dominant sector in the economic development of chinnakodur region and supports the 90 of the population therefore evaluation of groundwater for irrigation is vital in the study region for that graphical ussl 1954 and wilcox 1955 and calculation methods such as sar na rsc mhr and kr were chosen for better understanding of the groundwater chemistry as well as its suitability for irrigation in general water quality loss through evaporation and declining groundwater levels especially in summer season increase the chemical elements concentration in groundwater and effects on both the plants and soils which is the major problem in the semi arid regions in many parts of the world the major component is high sodium concentration in water leads to the formation of alkaline soil and high salt concentration brings to the development of saline soil todd 1980 salinity hazard and sodium hazards are most important parameters to assess the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes therefore sodium adsorption ratio sar is calculated as an index for sodium hazard sar values ranged from 0 53 to 6 02 with an average of 2 23 table 6 and salinity hazard ec Œºs cm concentration between 350 and 2390 Œºs cm with an average of 1158 Œºs cm tables 1 and 6 and both are used represented into us salinity diagram 1954 fig 5 fig 5 shows that 87 of groundwater samples fall under c3s1 indicating high salinity and low sodium hazards water which requires good drainage and this high salinity may effect on crop growth and it can cause osmotic effects and nutritional disorders l√§uchli and epstein 1990 in the study area about 9 of groundwater samples fall in category c2s1 indicating medium salinity and low sodium hazard which are good for irrigation and crops may be grown without any special consideration for salinity control only 3 of groundwater falls in c3s2 indicating high salinity and medium sodium hazard if this water is used for a long period of time may enhance the salinity and sodium hazards equally in the soil hence such soil essentially needs good drainage pattern and good permeability for better irrigation purposes moreover classification of irrigation water quality based on sodium hazard sar and salinity hazard ec Œºs cm are clearly elucidated in table 6 sodium concentration reacts with soil to reduce or enhance its permeability wilcox 1955 has found that the sodium percentage na is a very common parameter which is extensively used to evaluate the water for irrigation suitability karanth 1987 noticed high sodium percentage can cause the deflocculation and impairment of tilth and permeability of soils consequently sodium percentage na calculated through eq 2 for groundwater in the study region is plotted against ec in wilcox diagram fig 5 which shows that out of 105 groundwater samples 26 of the groundwater samples belong to excellent to good category followed by 65 of the samples belonging to good to permissible category 9 and 4 of the samples belongs to permissible to doubtful and doubtful to unsuitable category for irrigation use respectively fig 5 the surplus sum of co3 2 and hco3 in groundwater over the alkaline earths sum of ca2 and mg2 are also effect the groundwater quality for irrigation which is well known as rsc residual sodium carbonate richards 1954 has classified irrigation water based on rsc as 1 1 25 meq l is safe for irrigation 2 1 25 2 5 meq l is doubtful and 3 2 5 is not suitable for irrigation the rsc calculated values are presented in table 7 and reveals that all the groundwater samples have rsc values under 1 25 meq l which shows that all groundwater sampling locations are fit for irrigation moreover tiwari and manzoor 1988 has concluded that the negative values of rsc indicates incomplete precipitation of ca2 and mg2 and also higher concentration of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater can damage soil quality which reduces the crop productivity mainly paddy moreover magnesium has more severe effects on crop yield than calcium therefore magnesium hazardous ration mhr is one of the most important to evaluate the suitability for irrigation water quality and it computed through equation 4 szabolcs and darab 1964 paliwal 1972 and results are shown in table 7 the mhr values ranges from 9 78 to 86 02 meq l and with mean of 48 58 meq l table 7 about 47 of groundwater samples have mhr more than 50 which is strictly considered as unsuitable and remaining are suitable for irrigation purposes in the study region in addition kelley 1963 index is also implemented in the study region according to kelly ratio kr 76 of groundwater is suitable for irrigation 1 and remaining samples kr is more than 1 which is not suitable for irrigation in the study region table 7 4 4 mechanism and assessment of ion exchange chloro alkaline indices cai i ii are proposed by schoeller 1977 and it is a well established technique to distinguish the ion exchange between groundwater and its host rock water interaction environment during residence or travel in the subsurface if cai is positive there is no base ion exchange and in other hand if cai is negative there is surely a base ion exchange between sodium and potassium in water with calcium and magnesium in rock many hydrogelogists environmental scientists and researchers have used the cai to estimate the ion exchange percentage of groundwater in different regions koffi et al 2017 masood et al 2012 adimalla and qian 2019b 10 c a i i c l n a k c l 11 c a i i i c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 n o 3 cai i and ii are computed through above equations respectively and results are shown in supplementary table 2 which is evidently shows that 48 of groundwater samples are no active in base ion exchange and 52 of the groundwater samples have negative values which clearly specifies the base ion exchange sodium and potassium from water are exchanged with calcium and magnesium in host rocks during the period of residence and movement in the study region this cai analysis infers that the cation exchange ion exchange is the main mechanism which controls the chemical composition of the groundwater in the study region 4 5 groundwater natural evolution and its mechanism of groundwater chemistry gibbs 1970 diagram is an effective tool to comprehend the dominant hydrochemical process and dominant factors controlling groundwater chemistry which are precipitation dominants rock dominants or rock water interaction and evaporation dominants gibbs diagram fig 6 demonstrates that more number of groundwater samples of the study area fall in rock dominant zone this suggests that the chemistry of groundwater is influenced by rock weathering or rock water interaction moreover the moving of groundwater sampling points in the gibbs fig 6 field towards the evaporation domain from the rock dominant domain which indicates an increase of sodium and chloride ions and consequent higher tds due to water contamination caused by the influences of the poor sanitary conditions li et al 2016b subba rao et al 2012 gibbs diagram is widely used in many regions to identify the major controlling factors on groundwater chemistry di≈üli 2017 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b koffi et al 2017 li et al 2016a 2016b rajesh et al 2012 adimalla and qian 2019b and concluded that the rock water interaction is one of the most significant and dominant factor controlling the groundwater chemistry and hydrochemistry of groundwater in different areas underlain by various geological terrains this observation indicates that dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals control the groundwater chemistry in order to estimate the dissolutions a few scatters plots were drawn for the groundwater parameters of the study region the scatter plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 shows that most of the groundwater samples fall below the equiline y x indicates 1 1 line trend which indicates that the high concentrations of ions are derived from weathering of silicate minerals fig 7 the two scatter plots na k versus total cations tc and ca2 mg2 versus total cations tc suggest that all the groundwater samples fall below the equiline y x indicates 1 1 line and also majority of the samples fall around na k 0 5 tc fig 7 and ca2 mg2 0 5 tc fig 7 trend line which elucidates that cations in the groundwater could be derived from the silicate weathering and ca2 na versus hco3 na fig 7 also further confirms that the silicate weathering in the groundwater chemistry of the study region 4 6 hydrogeochemistry classification of groundwater and water types groundwater types and facies were classified on selected ions according to their concentrations meq l proposed by soltan 1998 the total groundwater samples of study region can be classified as normal sulphate 6 meq l normal chloride 15 meq l and normal bicarbonate types 7 meq l supplementary table 3 in addition to that groundwater can be categorised based on the base exchange indices r1 and r2 which are computed by eqs 12 and 13 respectively soltan 1998 12 r 1 na cl so 4 2 meq l 13 r 2 na k cl so 4 2 meq l if r1 is 1 groundwater can be na so4 2 and 1 it can be na hco3 type and further r2 is classified 1 and 1 indicating deep meteoric percolation and shallow meteoric percolation type respectively the calculated groundwater values of r1 and r2 reveals that 98 of samples belongs to na so4 2 and deep meteoric percolation types in the study region supplementary table 3 the new trends in hydrochemistry researchers and scientists were used to identify the suitable groundwater types and groundwater facies in order to better understanding the hydrogeochemical facies chadha 1999 diagram was also used in this study and is shown in fig 8 this diagram divides the groundwater into eight types which are clearly illustrated in fig 8 the chadha diagram fig 8 illustrates that the most of the groundwater samples show that alkaline earths exceed alkali metals and weak acids exceed strong acids types in addition to groundwater facies belongs to ca2 mg2 hco3 and na hco3 type and a few samples belong to ca2 mg2 cl and na cl types fig 8 5 conclusions in this study region people depend on groundwater and it is the only water source for drinking and irrigation needs therefore it is essential to execute the hydrogeochemical studies in this semi arid region with an objective of inferring water quality with respect of drinking and irrigation uses the hydrogeochemical results were compared with world health organization who and bureau of indian standards bis ph values of the groundwater samples in the study region shows that neutral to slightly alkaline in nature only 13 have a higher tds value which indicates brackish water the classification of groundwater based on th showed that 74 of the groundwater samples come under the hard category and the 7 of the groundwater samples fall in the very hard category in the study area most of the samples of groundwater come under the safe category for drinking with reference to concentration of so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 na and k fluoride and nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of the study area are exceeding permissible limits in 51 and 71 of samples respectively water rock interaction silicate weathering and anthropogenic activity play dominant role for the high concentrations the wqi studies revels that the 63 and 36 of groundwater samples are excellent and good water quality and remaining 4 of samples are poor water quality for drinking purposes the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes depends on the effect of mineral constituents of groundwater on both plants and soils wilcox diagram reveals that most of the groundwater is suitable for irrigation us salinity diagram indicates that the 87 of groundwater samples belong to high salinity and low sodium hazards c3s1 which requires good drainage sar values ranged from 0 53 to 6 02 which is clearly less than 10 indicating that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation calculated values of na kr mhr and rsc indicate that most of the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation of crops in the study region public awareness programs on the consequences of inferior water quality on human health and agricultural fields and rain water conservation methods are key factors for the success of water quality management for sustainable development furthermore people are advised not to drink the groundwater where the fluoride and nitrate concentrates have exceeded the permissible limits they have to depend on the alternate source of groundwater for drinking and domestic uses however in case alternative drinking water sources are not available proper treatment is mandatory in long run it would be advisable to adopt artificial recharge and rain water harvesting for dilution of fluoride contaminated water declaration of competing interest no conflict of

12195,groundwater is only an important water resources for drinking and irrigation in the central telangana india rapid growth in the population and intensive irrigation practises has become stress on groundwater the available groundwater are being depleted and its quality has also deteriorated for this reason a total of 105 groundwater samples collected from semi arid region of central telangana were executed in order to evaluate its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes results highlighted that most of the groundwater is suitable for drinking purposes based on ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as caco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 about 51 and 71 of groundwater samples were exceeded the maximum permissible limits of fluoride and nitrate respectively therefore it is suggested that groundwater with high fluoride and nitrate concentration water should be avoided for drinking purposes spatial distribution maps are generated using gis platform and the dissimilar distribution pattern was noticed for nitrate and fluoride in the study region gibbs plots authenticate that the groundwater chemistry is controlled by rock water interaction and geochemical scatter plots suggested that the silicate mineral dissolution play dominant role in the chemistry of groundwater according to the water quality index wqi values 60 and 36 of groundwater samples fall under excellent and good category for drinking purposes the groundwater is na so4 2 deep meteoric percolation type but most of it belong to ca2 mg2 hco3 na hco3 facies and few are ca2 mg2 cl and na cl facies majority of groundwater samples exhibit that the alkaline earths ca2 mg2 exceed alkali cation na k and strong acids so4 2 cl dominate over weak acid hco3 irrigational suitability of groundwater in the study area was also estimated through sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na and residual sodium carbonate rsc magnesium hazard ratio mhr and kelly ratio kr results shown that the majority of the groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation uses keywords groundwater quality water quality index sodium adsorption ratio sodium percentage residual sodium carbonate magnesium hazard ratio kelly ratio 1 introduction groundwater is the main commodity source of water supply for drinking agricultural and industrial purposes exclusively in the arid and semi arid regions of many countries globally 65 of groundwater is used for drinking purposes 20 for irrigation and livestock and 15 for industry and mining saeid et al 2018 and approximately one third of the world s population depends only on groundwater for drinking purposes unep 1999 adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 especially developing countries like india and china groundwater plays a vital role to fulfilling the basic needs there are few particular reasons for hang on groundwater such as tremendous growth of human population increasing agricultural and industrial sectors inadequate supply of surface water and thereby gradually groundwater is over exploited for drinking and also most useful for various purposes therefore it is necessary to monitoring the groundwater quality and quantity are equally important due to the aptness of water for drinking agricultural and industrial uses adimalla and li 2019 singh et al 2011 therefore groundwater measures have become vitally important which needs to be adopted in semi arid regions to meet the increasing demand and declining groundwater quality hence groundwater measures hydrochemistry in the semi arid region is typically controlled by local hydrogeology geology evaporation precipitation rock water interactions mineral dissolution weathering industrial effluents irrigation cultivation chemical fertilizers and largely anthropogenic activities furthermore hydrogeochemical measures such as weathering dissolution ion exchange control the concentrations of major and minor ions in groundwater singh et al 2011 rajesh et al 2012 to demonstrate the groundwater measures and its suitability for drinking irrigation and major contaminant source have been carried out all over the world adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 adimalla et al 2018b di≈üli 2017 li et al 2016b vahab et al 2015 faten et al 2016 observed that the water rock interaction and evaporation are the main source for contaminating groundwater in northeastern tunisia li et al 2016a noted that the groundwater evaporation influences the development of sulphate type groundwater contamination in a semi arid region of northwest china sadat noori et al 2014 evaluated an aquifer with the combined use of the water quality index wqi and a geographical information system gis in a semi arid area at iran the gis technology often used for generating the spatial distribution maps of groundwater quality for various purposes and it can also helpful to identify the water quality zones and also polluted zones jasrotia et al 2018 2019 adimalla and taloor 2020 however over exploitation of groundwater is one of the biggest problem in many regions of the world moreover india is also one of them ngwa 2016 noticed that the annual extraction of groundwater in india is the highest in the world which even supersedes that of the usa and china put together furthermore according to the central ground water board cgwb 2014 report reveals that the groundwater draft in india is 245 109 m3 most of which is used for irrigation purposes only and also nearly 90 of rural population of the country uses groundwater for drinking and domestic purposes however in india growing urbanization population growth and over exploitation of rural areas for drinking domestic and agriculture needs extreme usages of fertilizers impacts of anthropogenic activities etc which majorly influence the groundwater quality therefore a number of studies on groundwater quality with respect to drinking and irrigation purposes have been carried out in the different parts of india haritash et al 2017 rajesh et al 2012 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2013 2017a 2017b 2018a 2018b adimalla and li 2019 narsimha et al 2018 chetan and ahada 2017 narsimha 2018 subba rao et al 2012 in the present study chinnakodur area most of the population purely depend on groundwater which is only the main source for drinking and irrigation purposes the predicament of medak region district telangana is caused for much concern considering the steady drop of water table from 18 39 m below ground level mbgl to 24 34 mbgl adimalla et al 2018b and chinnkodur is one of the region facing the groundwater scarcity contamination pollution decline of water and quality issues therefore the principal objectives of this paper are a to analyse the hydrogeochemical characteristics and facies of groundwater b to assess the overall groundwater quality using water quality index wqi method c to evaluate the groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes using multiple water quality indicators such as sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na residual sodium carbonate rsc magnesium hazard ratio mhr and kelly ratio kr however the present study results are most useful for local groundwater quality assessment and also management supporting the maintainable groundwater quality development in the study region 2 study area the present study area is situated in the central part of telangana and located between 18 12 18 26 n and 78 00 79 98 e fig 1 which has a continental arid to semi arid climate with an annual mean temperature is 26 3 c and may is the hottest month of the year the study area is hydrologically closed and the water source is mainly from precipitation rainfall in the region is extremely seasonal with about 745 mm ensuing during the southwest monsoon june september 109 mm during the northeast monsoon oct dec no rainfall in winter jan feb and 55 mm in summer march may the exposed bedrock of the regional ground surfaces was mainly formed during the archaean and is comprised mainly of granites gneisses amphibolite hornblende biotite schist and basic rocks in the current study groundwater naturally occurs under phreatic conditions in the weathered layer and semi confined conditions in the fractured zones at different levels cgwb 2013 moreover the depth of the groundwater level ranges from 20 m to 45 m in study region because it is occupied by totally hard rock terrain in weathered condition and depth of groundwater was more in un weathered zones cgwb 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical procedure the 105 groundwater samples were collected in 1 l high density polyethylene plastic bottles which were pre cleaned with double distilled water and then three times with sampling water and then analyzed for various hydrochemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as caco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 and fluoride f ec ph and tds of water samples were measured in the field immediately after the collection of the samples by using ph ec tds meter hanna hi 9811 5 th ca2 and mg2 were determined titrimetrically using standard ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta chloride was estimated by agno3 titration na and k were measured by flame photometer model 130 systronics flame photometer co3 2 and hco3 were estimated by titrating with standard sulphuric acid so4 2 and no3 were determined by colorimetry with an uv visible spectrophotometer the fluoride concentration in the groundwater was determined electrochemically using fluoride ion selective electrode apha 1995 the electrode used was an orion fluoride electrode coupled to an orion electrometer standard fluoride solutions 0 1 10 mg l were prepared from a stock solution 100 mg l of sodium fluoride as per experimental requirement 2 ml of total ionic strength adjusting buffer grade iii tisab iii was added in 20 ml of sample the ion meter was calibrated for a slope of 59 2 2 however the location and distribution maps of fluoride and nitrate of the study region are prepared using arcgis version 9 3 software with spatial analyst module and kriging interpoloation technique 3 2 irrigation water quality evaluation typically quality of irrigation water signifies its mineral composition and also demonstrates its effects on plants and as well as soil therefore assessment of groundwater for irrigation is most important generally irrigation water quality was evaluated through sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium percentage na kelly s ratio kr and magnesium hazard ratio mhr mostly these all parameters are vital in measuring the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes however these profound indicators can be calculated as follows richards 1954 eaton 1950 wilcox 1955 kelley 1963 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 2 n a n a c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 3 rsc hco 3 co 3 2 ca 2 mg 2 4 m h r m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 5 k r n a c a 2 m g 2 where all ion concentration na ca2 mg2 hco3 co3 2 k are expressed in meq l 4 results and discussion 4 1 assessment of groundwater suitability for drinking purposes the physicochemical parameters of the sampled groundwater are presented in table 1 descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean and standard deviation and the major ion values are compared with world health organization who 2011 and bureau of india standard bis 2012 are shown in table 2 to find the suitability of the groundwater samples collected for drinking purposes the ph is one of the most important parameter indicating drinking water suitability as table 2 shows ph values are ranged from 6 9 to 9 1 with mean value 8 1 about two groundwater samples are acidic and remaining are all slightly alkaline nature however 9 of groundwater were exceeding the recommended limits bis 2012 table 2 supplementary fig 1a the tds embodies the total dissolved solids in water demonstrating water salinity and the applicability of groundwater to human consumption as shown in table 1 the level of tds varies from 224 to 1529 mg l with mean of 741 mg l and about 82 of groundwater samples are within the acceptable limit 500 mg l 18 of the samples fall under the permissible limit 2000 mg l table 2 supplementary fig 1b and effectively suitable for drinking purposes further tds values are classified according to davis and dewiest 1967 freeze and cherry 1979 which are presented in table 3 indicates that 87 and 13 of groundwater samples are under fresh and brackish water respectively freeze and cherry 1979 th represents the sum of ca2 and mg2 dissolved in groundwater expressed as caco3 the maximum permissible limit of th for drinking purpose is 500 mg l as per who standard who 2011 and results indicate that only one groundwater sample is above the maximum permissible limit 500 mg l which clearly depicted in supplementary fig 1c however about 7 of groundwater samples are exceeded the 300 mg l which is considered as a very hard sawyer and mccarty 1967 table 3 the cl and so4 2 ions concentration in the groundwater ranged between 21 and 320 mg l and 16 and 425 mg l with a mean values of 128 3 and 188 5 mg l respectively table 2 the acceptable and permissible limit of cl in potable water is 250 mg l and 1000 mg l for indian conditions bis 2012 all the groundwater samples are within the maximum permissible limits table 2 supplementary fig 1d which are most suitable for drinking purposes about three groundwater samples which are collected in the villages of ramanaptla 421 mg l kondagulakunta 421 mg l and gopalapuram 425 mg l are exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 400 mg l for sulphate for drinking purposes table 1 supplementary fig 1e the ca2 and mg2 concentrations of the groundwater are totally below the maximum permissible limits prescribed by who 2011 for potable purposes and ranges from 14 to 152 mg l 10 83 mg l respectively table 2 supplementary figs 1f and 1g the average concentrations of na and k ions found in groundwater samples in the study region are 72 and 3 1 mg l respectively and all the samples are within the maximum permissible limits prescribed by who who 2011 table 2 it is noticed in this study that compared to other major cations the concentration of k in groundwater shows typically in low level due to it weak mobility for the past two decades there has been an increasing trend in nitrate pollution in groundwater especially telangana region due to fast growing population urbanization industrialization and huge application of nitrogenous fertilizers ammonium nitrate and urea and agricultural practices and also high nitrate concentration in drinking water can pose risk of human health adimalla 2019b adimalla and qian 2019a 2019b the major source of nitrogen in water biological fixation and precipitation and fertilizers activity were identified by berner and berner 1987 this is the second largest problem after f facing in the telangana state and as well as the study region because nitrate contamination is more associated with health concerns nitrate concentration in the groundwater in the study area is ranging from 12 to 212 mg l with a mean of 69 mg l table 2 in the study region majority of population depend on agriculture practices for surviving and using different fertilizers for crop yields which could be one of the reason for elevated nitrate concentration in the study area the investigation reveals that the nitrate concentration in 71 of groundwater samples exceeded the bis recommended limit of 45 mg l for drinking purposes table 2 a graphical interpretation for risk evaluation of nitrate concentration for suitability drinking utility in study region is shown in fig 2 a and classified into three categories adimalla et al 2018b namely no risk category suitable for drinking purposes 45 mg l high risk category 46 100 mg l very high risk category 100 mg l based on this classification figs 2 28 groundwater samples are under no risk which are purely suitable for drinking purpose 55 and 17 groundwater samples under high risk and very high risk category which are absolutely not suitable for drinking purposes in the study region however spatial distribution map of nitrate is depicted in fig 3 and high risk zones are noticed in the northern southern and a few patches are in eastern parts of the study region moreover comly 1987 has firstly reported health implications of exposure to nitrate in drinking water and further elevated nitrate concentration in groundwater and its effects on human health and occurrence has been meticulously studied coinly 1945 comly 1987 fan et al 1987 canter 1996 nas and berktay 2006 nkotagu 1996 adimalla and li 2019 therefore constant consumption of the high nitrate groundwater for drinking purposes can cause methemoglobinemia in infants of the study region fluoride is frequently found in higher concentration in groundwater especially in arid and semi arid regions in various geological terrains in the world and specifically in telangana provinces adimalla and li 2019 narsimha and rajitha 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b where most of the rural population suffers from deadly disease of fluorosis adimalla 2019a because there is no proper drinking facility evidently all districts 10 out of 10 districts of telangana state in india are reported to be fluoride endemic adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 however the present study region people depends on groundwater for drinking and other uses the fluoride concentration in the groundwater ranges from 0 5 to 3 5 mg l with a mean value of 1 5 mg l table 2 the results highlighted that 51 of groundwater samples have found within the recommended limits whereas 49 of them contain fluoride concentration exceeding the 1 5 mg l prescribed by who 2011 furthermore the results have been classified into five groups such as 0 5 mg l dental caries 0 6 1 5 mg l beneficial for human health 1 6 2 mg l dental fluorosis 2 3 mg l dental and skeletal fluorosis and finally 3 mg l leads to skeletal fluorosis which are clearly illustrated in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 about 26 of groundwater samples are in yellow colour and vulnerable for dental fluorosis 18 and 5 of samples are shown in red and green colour and can cause dental to skeletal fluorosis and if continuous by consumed this water for drinking purposes in addition the spatial distribution of fluoride map indicates that the elevated fluoride concentration are extensively distributed in groundwater throughout the study region fig 3 the occurrence of high fluoride groundwater is controlled by various factors including rock chemistry residence time well depth preferential pathways for the upward movement of deep groundwater as discussed above the study region occupied by granitic rocks these granitic rocks predominantly contain a relative abundance of fluoride bearing minerals which forms the source of fluoride to percolating groundwater in the recharge zones supplementary table 1 bailey 1977 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 adimalla et al 2018a 2019 however fluoride can be leached into groundwater from many fluoride rich minerals through weathering and rock water interaction processes the important fluoride minerals are fluorite or fluorspar caf2 fluorapatite ca5 oh f po4 3 and cryolite na3alf6 besides these other fluoride bearing minerals are biotite muscovite lepidolite tourmaline hornblende series minerals glaucophane and riebeckite and asbestos chrysotile actinolite anthophyllite out of 416 fluoride bearing rock minerals only topaz fluorite villiaumite and cryolite have fluorine as an essential constituent in the formula bailey 1977 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b 2018a 2018b narsimha and rajitha 2018 subba rao et al 2012 adimalla and li 2019 narsimha et al 2018 chetan and ahada 2017 narsimha 2018 handa 1975 these fluoride bearing minerals could be the case for elevated fluoride concentration in the study region groundwater however the present investigation suggests that the groundwater of eastern and northern part of the study region groundwater not suitable for drinking purposes fig 3 4 2 groundwater quality assessment through water quality index wqi studies in recent trends the wqi has been used by hydrogeologists hydrologists environmental scientists and many researchers to evaluate the water quality for drinking purposes in various geological terrains chung et al 2014 aly et al 2014 adimalla et al 2018b adimalla and qian 2019a adimalla and taloor 2020 the water quality index wqi is an effective tool to estimate the overall groundwater quality for drinking purposes by examining the individual water quality parameters ph tds th ca2 na k mg2 so4 2 hco3 cl no3 and f the standards for drinking purposes as recommended by bureau of indian standards bis 2012 have been used for the calculation of wqi which involves three steps in the first step each of the eleven chemical parameters like ph tds th ca2 na k mg2 so4 2 hco3 cl no3 and f were assigned weights wi ranging from 2 to 5 and its selection depends on their significance in quality of water for drinking purposes table 4 ramakrishnalah et al 2009 in the second step is relative weights wi are calculated through equation 6 6 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight wi is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters table 4 in the third step quality rating scale calculation qi for each individual parameter is computed by dividing its concentration for each groundwater sample with drinking water quality standards of bis 2012 and then multiplied by 100 using equation 7 7 q i c i s i 100 where qi is the quality rating ci is the concentration of each chemical parameter in each water sample in milligrams per litre mg l and si is the indian drinking water bis 2012 guidelines for each chemical parameter eventuality water quality sub index sii for each chemical parameter was computed by equation 8 and whole the wqi was determined by equation 9 8 s i i w i q i 9 wqi si i where sii is the sub index of the ith parameter qi is the rating based on the concentration of ith parameter and n is the total number of parameters groundwater samples n 105 and its wqi values are presented in table 5 the computed wqi values range from 67 to 228 with a mean of 141 thus the wqi can be classified as excellent water type if the wqi values are less than 150 good water type it the wqi values ranged from 150 to 120 poor water type if the wqi values ranged between 200 and 250 very poor water type if the wqi values ranged from 250 to 300 and unsuitable for drinking water type if the wqi values larger than 300 ramakrishnalah et al 2009 as shown in table 5 60 and 36 of groundwater as fall under excellent and good category for drinking purposes about 4 groundwater samples are found poor water quality for drinking purposes fig 4 4 3 groundwater quality for irrigation purpose in the study region agriculture is the primary occupation where the main crops are rice jowar bajra sugarcane black gram red gram bengal gram cotton and groundnut moreover agriculture is a dominant sector in the economic development of chinnakodur region and supports the 90 of the population therefore evaluation of groundwater for irrigation is vital in the study region for that graphical ussl 1954 and wilcox 1955 and calculation methods such as sar na rsc mhr and kr were chosen for better understanding of the groundwater chemistry as well as its suitability for irrigation in general water quality loss through evaporation and declining groundwater levels especially in summer season increase the chemical elements concentration in groundwater and effects on both the plants and soils which is the major problem in the semi arid regions in many parts of the world the major component is high sodium concentration in water leads to the formation of alkaline soil and high salt concentration brings to the development of saline soil todd 1980 salinity hazard and sodium hazards are most important parameters to assess the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes therefore sodium adsorption ratio sar is calculated as an index for sodium hazard sar values ranged from 0 53 to 6 02 with an average of 2 23 table 6 and salinity hazard ec Œºs cm concentration between 350 and 2390 Œºs cm with an average of 1158 Œºs cm tables 1 and 6 and both are used represented into us salinity diagram 1954 fig 5 fig 5 shows that 87 of groundwater samples fall under c3s1 indicating high salinity and low sodium hazards water which requires good drainage and this high salinity may effect on crop growth and it can cause osmotic effects and nutritional disorders l√§uchli and epstein 1990 in the study area about 9 of groundwater samples fall in category c2s1 indicating medium salinity and low sodium hazard which are good for irrigation and crops may be grown without any special consideration for salinity control only 3 of groundwater falls in c3s2 indicating high salinity and medium sodium hazard if this water is used for a long period of time may enhance the salinity and sodium hazards equally in the soil hence such soil essentially needs good drainage pattern and good permeability for better irrigation purposes moreover classification of irrigation water quality based on sodium hazard sar and salinity hazard ec Œºs cm are clearly elucidated in table 6 sodium concentration reacts with soil to reduce or enhance its permeability wilcox 1955 has found that the sodium percentage na is a very common parameter which is extensively used to evaluate the water for irrigation suitability karanth 1987 noticed high sodium percentage can cause the deflocculation and impairment of tilth and permeability of soils consequently sodium percentage na calculated through eq 2 for groundwater in the study region is plotted against ec in wilcox diagram fig 5 which shows that out of 105 groundwater samples 26 of the groundwater samples belong to excellent to good category followed by 65 of the samples belonging to good to permissible category 9 and 4 of the samples belongs to permissible to doubtful and doubtful to unsuitable category for irrigation use respectively fig 5 the surplus sum of co3 2 and hco3 in groundwater over the alkaline earths sum of ca2 and mg2 are also effect the groundwater quality for irrigation which is well known as rsc residual sodium carbonate richards 1954 has classified irrigation water based on rsc as 1 1 25 meq l is safe for irrigation 2 1 25 2 5 meq l is doubtful and 3 2 5 is not suitable for irrigation the rsc calculated values are presented in table 7 and reveals that all the groundwater samples have rsc values under 1 25 meq l which shows that all groundwater sampling locations are fit for irrigation moreover tiwari and manzoor 1988 has concluded that the negative values of rsc indicates incomplete precipitation of ca2 and mg2 and also higher concentration of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater can damage soil quality which reduces the crop productivity mainly paddy moreover magnesium has more severe effects on crop yield than calcium therefore magnesium hazardous ration mhr is one of the most important to evaluate the suitability for irrigation water quality and it computed through equation 4 szabolcs and darab 1964 paliwal 1972 and results are shown in table 7 the mhr values ranges from 9 78 to 86 02 meq l and with mean of 48 58 meq l table 7 about 47 of groundwater samples have mhr more than 50 which is strictly considered as unsuitable and remaining are suitable for irrigation purposes in the study region in addition kelley 1963 index is also implemented in the study region according to kelly ratio kr 76 of groundwater is suitable for irrigation 1 and remaining samples kr is more than 1 which is not suitable for irrigation in the study region table 7 4 4 mechanism and assessment of ion exchange chloro alkaline indices cai i ii are proposed by schoeller 1977 and it is a well established technique to distinguish the ion exchange between groundwater and its host rock water interaction environment during residence or travel in the subsurface if cai is positive there is no base ion exchange and in other hand if cai is negative there is surely a base ion exchange between sodium and potassium in water with calcium and magnesium in rock many hydrogelogists environmental scientists and researchers have used the cai to estimate the ion exchange percentage of groundwater in different regions koffi et al 2017 masood et al 2012 adimalla and qian 2019b 10 c a i i c l n a k c l 11 c a i i i c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 n o 3 cai i and ii are computed through above equations respectively and results are shown in supplementary table 2 which is evidently shows that 48 of groundwater samples are no active in base ion exchange and 52 of the groundwater samples have negative values which clearly specifies the base ion exchange sodium and potassium from water are exchanged with calcium and magnesium in host rocks during the period of residence and movement in the study region this cai analysis infers that the cation exchange ion exchange is the main mechanism which controls the chemical composition of the groundwater in the study region 4 5 groundwater natural evolution and its mechanism of groundwater chemistry gibbs 1970 diagram is an effective tool to comprehend the dominant hydrochemical process and dominant factors controlling groundwater chemistry which are precipitation dominants rock dominants or rock water interaction and evaporation dominants gibbs diagram fig 6 demonstrates that more number of groundwater samples of the study area fall in rock dominant zone this suggests that the chemistry of groundwater is influenced by rock weathering or rock water interaction moreover the moving of groundwater sampling points in the gibbs fig 6 field towards the evaporation domain from the rock dominant domain which indicates an increase of sodium and chloride ions and consequent higher tds due to water contamination caused by the influences of the poor sanitary conditions li et al 2016b subba rao et al 2012 gibbs diagram is widely used in many regions to identify the major controlling factors on groundwater chemistry di≈üli 2017 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b koffi et al 2017 li et al 2016a 2016b rajesh et al 2012 adimalla and qian 2019b and concluded that the rock water interaction is one of the most significant and dominant factor controlling the groundwater chemistry and hydrochemistry of groundwater in different areas underlain by various geological terrains this observation indicates that dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals control the groundwater chemistry in order to estimate the dissolutions a few scatters plots were drawn for the groundwater parameters of the study region the scatter plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 shows that most of the groundwater samples fall below the equiline y x indicates 1 1 line trend which indicates that the high concentrations of ions are derived from weathering of silicate minerals fig 7 the two scatter plots na k versus total cations tc and ca2 mg2 versus total cations tc suggest that all the groundwater samples fall below the equiline y x indicates 1 1 line and also majority of the samples fall around na k 0 5 tc fig 7 and ca2 mg2 0 5 tc fig 7 trend line which elucidates that cations in the groundwater could be derived from the silicate weathering and ca2 na versus hco3 na fig 7 also further confirms that the silicate weathering in the groundwater chemistry of the study region 4 6 hydrogeochemistry classification of groundwater and water types groundwater types and facies were classified on selected ions according to their concentrations meq l proposed by soltan 1998 the total groundwater samples of study region can be classified as normal sulphate 6 meq l normal chloride 15 meq l and normal bicarbonate types 7 meq l supplementary table 3 in addition to that groundwater can be categorised based on the base exchange indices r1 and r2 which are computed by eqs 12 and 13 respectively soltan 1998 12 r 1 na cl so 4 2 meq l 13 r 2 na k cl so 4 2 meq l if r1 is 1 groundwater can be na so4 2 and 1 it can be na hco3 type and further r2 is classified 1 and 1 indicating deep meteoric percolation and shallow meteoric percolation type respectively the calculated groundwater values of r1 and r2 reveals that 98 of samples belongs to na so4 2 and deep meteoric percolation types in the study region supplementary table 3 the new trends in hydrochemistry researchers and scientists were used to identify the suitable groundwater types and groundwater facies in order to better understanding the hydrogeochemical facies chadha 1999 diagram was also used in this study and is shown in fig 8 this diagram divides the groundwater into eight types which are clearly illustrated in fig 8 the chadha diagram fig 8 illustrates that the most of the groundwater samples show that alkaline earths exceed alkali metals and weak acids exceed strong acids types in addition to groundwater facies belongs to ca2 mg2 hco3 and na hco3 type and a few samples belong to ca2 mg2 cl and na cl types fig 8 5 conclusions in this study region people depend on groundwater and it is the only water source for drinking and irrigation needs therefore it is essential to execute the hydrogeochemical studies in this semi arid region with an objective of inferring water quality with respect of drinking and irrigation uses the hydrogeochemical results were compared with world health organization who and bureau of indian standards bis ph values of the groundwater samples in the study region shows that neutral to slightly alkaline in nature only 13 have a higher tds value which indicates brackish water the classification of groundwater based on th showed that 74 of the groundwater samples come under the hard category and the 7 of the groundwater samples fall in the very hard category in the study area most of the samples of groundwater come under the safe category for drinking with reference to concentration of so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 na and k fluoride and nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of the study area are exceeding permissible limits in 51 and 71 of samples respectively water rock interaction silicate weathering and anthropogenic activity play dominant role for the high concentrations the wqi studies revels that the 63 and 36 of groundwater samples are excellent and good water quality and remaining 4 of samples are poor water quality for drinking purposes the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes depends on the effect of mineral constituents of groundwater on both plants and soils wilcox diagram reveals that most of the groundwater is suitable for irrigation us salinity diagram indicates that the 87 of groundwater samples belong to high salinity and low sodium hazards c3s1 which requires good drainage sar values ranged from 0 53 to 6 02 which is clearly less than 10 indicating that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation calculated values of na kr mhr and rsc indicate that most of the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation of crops in the study region public awareness programs on the consequences of inferior water quality on human health and agricultural fields and rain water conservation methods are key factors for the success of water quality management for sustainable development furthermore people are advised not to drink the groundwater where the fluoride and nitrate concentrates have exceeded the permissible limits they have to depend on the alternate source of groundwater for drinking and domestic uses however in case alternative drinking water sources are not available proper treatment

iron served which served as the coagulating agent for enhanced filtration and neutralize any residual ocl oxidant leftover from the oxidation step that may hamper downstream biological treatment process to remove soluble organics fig 2 to construct the rapid filter locally available coarse sand and gravel were used the sand served as the filtration media and the gravel served as the bed to

chemical oxygen demand cod reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental protocol the efficacy of the proposed process to treat the textile wastewater was investigated at the bench scale level in the field where the processing facility was producing fabrics for blue jeans the proposed process is a combination of calcium hypochlorite oxidation followed by chemically aided a layer of waste iron filing serving as a source of fe0 fe2 fe3 prior to rapid sand filtration the waste iron filings served as the coagulating agent for the rapid sand filtration as well as to neutralize any excess hypochlorite from the oxidation step the sand served as the filtration media that will remove residual particulate matter from the coagulation process and the gravel served as the base to hold the finer filling layer and the granular sand layer ensuring that the iron particulate matter is not pushed through by the water into the bed and also for the sand from not washing away with the flow of the water over the filtration bed the whole system of the iron filings sitting on a layer of gravel that sits onto the sand bed supported again by a layer of gravel is called a multimedia filter system the textile wastewater reacted with calcium hypochlorite in a beaker after mixing for five to 7 min in the batch reactor which was a beaker with a liquid volume of 1000 ml the treated wastewater was allowed to settle for 1 5 h mimicking a clarifier and the supernatant collected for analysis 50 ml and the remaining supernatant was passed through the multi media filter in a gravity flow mode the flow diagram of the process is shown in fig 3 and the picture of the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 the column study was conducted until bed breakthrough occurred indicated by a decrease in filtration rate 2 2 test textile dyeing and processing wastewater for this experiment program blue denim processing textile wastewater was used the textile wastewater sample was collected from the equalization basin of a blue denim textile processing wastewater treatment plant a time proportion composite sample was collected for 24 h of operation to test the efficacy of the treatment process 2 3 calcium hypochlorite oxidation step blue denim textile dyeing wastewater was oxidized using calcium hypochlorite dosage optimization it was done by adding ninety two percent pure calcium hypochlorite powder until the color of the wastewater disappeared from blue to colorless in a completely mixed batch reactor the batch reactor which was a beaker with a liquid volume of 1000 ml where the content of the beaker was constantly mixed manually using a wooden ladle as the calcium hypochlorite was added till the wastewater in the beaker changed color from blue to colorless the total mixing time was observed to be between five to 7 min in total in total 24 batches batch tests were done to ensure confidence with respect to the reproducibility of the results 2 4 bench scale column step the rapid filter consisted of a plastic column of diameter 3 81 cm and a height of 45 72 cm in this experiment program the plastic column was filled with a layer of 2 cm rusted waste iron filings at the top a layer of 7 6 cm coarse gravel afterward a layer of 7 9 cm coarse sand with fineness modulus of 2 2 and finally a layer of 2 cm gravel the design filtration rate volume of water passed divided by filter bed correctional surface area has a unit of m3 m2 hr or m hr of the rapid sand filter was 4 9 m h m3 m2 hr after the neutralization of the color by chemical oxidation the wastewater was passed through the rapid filtration system by gravity flow the column study was conducted until bed breakthrough occurred due to the fouling of the filter which was indicated by a substantial decrease in the filtration rate less than 0 5 m3 m2 hr treated water was collected at preset bed volumes of water passed bed volume is a non dimensional parameter used in the water industry to relate the volume of water to passed through the filter bed it is defined as the volume of water passed through the media bed in this case the sand bed m3 divided by the empty volume of the sand bed m3 its unit can also be specified as m3 of water passed m3 of the media in the filter the treated wastewater was analyzed for ph onsite and the rest of the sample was stored in plastic bottles of 250 ml to be analyzed in the laboratory for color turbidity total suspended solids total dissolved solids chemical oxygen demand and residual chlorine the runs were repeated twice and average standard deviation values were plotted with respect to the bed volumes of water treated 3 analysis the flow rate was measured using a graduated cylinder and a stopwatch chemical oxygen demand was measured by hach method

by hanna instruments hi 2300 system the ph for the characterization of the raw wastewater a hi 2211 ph orp probe and meter system by hanna instruments was used for field pilot ph measurements were made using ph paper strip made by fisher scientific the field ph measurement is just as a process indication tool and was not intended for regulatory compliance measurement total suspended solids were determined by standard methods 2540d where a well mixed volume of a wastewater or water sample was filtered through a pre weighed glass fiber filter pore size 0 45 Œºm the filter was dried at 104 1 c and then weighed the mass increase divided by the water volume filtered is equal to the tss in mg l american public health association 1989 4 results and discussion wastewater has to be treated before it is allowed to be discharged into the water bodies meeting the regulatory limits set by the government department of environment bangladesh 2008 unfortunately non compliance is a concern and tariffs on imported materials calls maiko sakamoto 2019 for development of pretreatment processes to remove color that rely on locally available materials to treat textile processing wastewater that decuples from the reliance on imported chemical for decoloring and possible chemical oxygen reduction to reduce loading to the secondary biological treatment process that requires energy for operation of blowers to provide the air required by the microorganisms towards the goal of overall sustainability the process that was developed uses locally available calcium hypochlorite to break down the organic azoic dye constitutions ventura camargo b 2013 which accounts for the color in the wastewater followed by chemically waste iron filings locally available from rerolling mills and electric arc furnaces of steel industries aided rapid sand filtration waste iron filings fe0 fe2 fe3 served as the coagulating agent to enhance colloidal particulate removal in the rapid sand filtration process and also to neutralize any excess hypochlorite ion ocl from the oxidation step the schematic process flow diagram is shown in fig 2 along with the schematic and picture of the bench scale setup is shown in figs 3 and 4 the objective of the process evaluation program was to validate and evaluate the proposed primary treatment process on its ability to remove color from the test textile dyeing and processing wastewater thereby serving as a substitute to imported chemical decoloring agents and also investigate the possibility of chemical oxygen demand cod reduction thereby reducing the load to the secondary biological treatment which requires energy that is dependent on the cod of the wastewater entering the secondary biological treatment system to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed process a time proportioned wastewater sample was collected from the equalization basin of a blue denim textile processing facility wastewater treatment plant the water quality characterization of the composite wastewater sample is listed in table 1 the wastewater had color and higher that average sewage wastewater cod peavy 1984 calling for the need of color removal and reduction of cod by primary treatment before secondary aerobic biological treatment the first step in the treatment process is the oxidation of blue denim textile dyeing wastewater using calcium hypochlorite occurred in continuous batch a process in a rapid mixing reactor it took on average 17 9 0 5 g of ninety percent pure locally available commercial grade calcium hypochlorite to completely remove the color from 243 11 ptco to colorless 0 0 ptco for every liter of the wastewater treated for twenty four batches of wastewater treated the oxidation process reduced the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater from 590 79 mg l to 13 5 1 5 mg l n 24 p 0 05 the batch oxidation process also decreased the total dissolved solids from 422 2 to 6 9 0 7 mg l n 24 p 0 05 and predictably post oxidation there was an increase in the concentration of ocl in the wastewater from blow detection 0 0 mg l to 0 3 0 2 mg l with regards to the overall efficacy of the process the oxidation step clearly removed color and reduce the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater appreciable but the only drawback was the presence of the trace oxidizing agent in the wastewater after the batch oxidation step the residual oxidizing agent in the water may affect negatively the secondary biological treatment system ocl a strong oxidizing and disinfectant could be toxic to the microorganisms present in the activated sludge system and affect the performance of the system to breakdown the organic compounds present in the wastewater this requires the need for the second step the reduction of the ocl by the waste iron filings followed by the cores sand filtration step that will reduce any carry over ferric salts and calcium salts from the oxidation and reduction steps the next step of the process rapid multi media filter with was carried out at a virgin bed filtration rate of 4 9 m h m3 m2 hr until the filtration rate decreased below 0 1 m h m3 m2 hr the filtration rate decreased with the bed volumes of water treated due to the fouling of the filter decrease of filtration rate is the most common problem of rapid multi media filters and all filters incorporate provisions for backwashing to regenerate the filter at preset bed volumes of wastewater treated bed volume is a non dimensional parameter used in the water industry to relate the volume of water to pass through the filter bed its defined as volume of water passed through the media bed in this case the sand bed m3 divided by the empty volume of the sand bed m3 treated wastewater samples treated effluent were collected and analyzed for ph color total suspended solids and total dissolved solids chemical oxygen demand and residual chlorine after the rapid multimedia step complete color removal was achieved throughout the test run and thus achieved the research goal of removing color using a locally available oxidizing chemical that was calcium hypochlorite the proof is in the picture fig 5 is a comparative picture of the treated water composite sample for a full run against the raw wastewater showing the contrast in color the spectrophotometric analysis value of the treated water samples taken for the duration of the filter runs was 0 0 ptco for the majority of the treated water samples the turbidity was less than 10 ntu although the bangladesh environment conservation regulations do not specify any standard for industrial discharge with respect to turbidity the quality of the treated water was even within the guidelines of potable water of 10 ntu set by the government of bangladesh 5 the total suspended solids throughout the filter runs were below 15 mg l fig 6 both parameters clearly show that the treatment process ensures water that does not have any carryover of solids from the chemical oxidation process for the subsequent biological secondary treatment process again speaking in favorably of the primary treatment process the total dissolved solids of the oxidized filtered wastewater were below 8 0 mg l refer to fig 7 indicating the efficacy of the proposed treatment process in its ability to also reduce total dissolved solids from the raw wastewater raw wastewater tds 422 2 mg l refer to table 1 of significant note is the that the measured residual ocl ions of the iron filing sand filtration step treated water was below detection indicating that the ocl ions remaining in the water after the oxidation step was neutralized this indicates that the waste iron filings were able to neutralize the excess free chlorine ensuring against deleterious effects to the downstream biological or any other treatment processes that would be required in real life application the pretreatment process did not significantly decrease the ph of the wastewater with the ph of the treated wastewater was above 11 5 through the filter run indicating that prior to secondary biological treatment the ph of the wastewater needs to neutralize to near neutral range 6 5 7 5 a restorative factor of the process is its ability to reduce the chemical oxygen demand cod of the wastewater a parameter that is a measure of the biodegradable pollutants in the wastewater a high reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod was observed after the treatment of wastewater by this proposed process the cod removal ranged as high as ninety percent fig 8 and the effluent cod levels for the duration of the test run was below 20 mg l to give a prospective of the efficacy of the process in terms of cod removal and the government of bangladesh discharge limit for cod for wastewater is 200 mg l in essence one could discharge the wastewater without further treatment but one qualification is that the reaming cod may contain residual organics from textile processing that was not measured in the experimental program and may require further biological activated sludge treatment in real life application but what the pretreatment process outlined in the experimental program dose is reduces the cod loading to any subsequent biological treatment process every kg cod loading to the biological aerobic treatment system requires 3 2 kw h of electrical energy plappally 2012 for this particular wastewater the proposed pretreatment treatment system with 95 cod removal fig 9 would produce a net energy savings in the aerobic biological treatment of 1 8 kw h for every meter cube of wastewater treated compared to conventional biological aerobic wastewater treatment the proposed pretreatment with is cod reduction capabilities and thus less aeration requirement in the downstream biological treatment due to reduced cod loading cuts down on the energy requirement and thereby reduces co2 emission as well and for this particular wastewater this would produce a net reduction in co2 emission by 0 31 kg per meter cube of wastewater treated the cost benefit analysis of the proposed process in comparison to the imported chemical depended pretreatment process indicates that the proposed process is more economically favorable for the treatment plant operators a local survey of textile processing facility wastewater treatment plant operation shows that the chemical cost to remove the color from textile wastewater is 24 3 taka m3 taka is the currency of bangladesh and the exchange rate is taka 85 to one united states dollar md ebadul haque 2014 based on local market price of calcium hypochlorite the pretreatment cost of this particular wastewater based on the amount of calcium hypochlorite required to pre treat the wastewater to remove color would be 45 taka m3 though the pre treatment cost may seem higher than the conventional treatment method the overall cost due to more energy savings make the pretreatment method more feasible in this proposed process the cod reduction as a result of the oxidation process as mentioned earlier would result in 1 8 kw h m3 energy can be saved by implementing the pretreatment process outlined in this paper resulting in monitory saving of taka 26 54 m3 of wastewater treated taka 14 44 taka kwh of electric energy consumed for industrial use thus the net savings in treatment cost of taka 5 83 as earlier mentioned there would be a significant savings of carbon emission by implementing this process due to the reduction of electrical energy consumption in the aeration basis and at the co2 emission price of 30 taka kg of co2 emission twd energy conversion 2019 an additional taka 201 58 m3 will be saved as 80 kg co2 emission m3 wastewater treated is reduced by the proposed process taking the cost of co2 reduction in the accounting keeping in mind the overall goal of sustainable operation the net savings in operation cost would be approximately taka 207 m3 of wastewater treated an additional beneficiary feature of this pretreatment process is that all the materials being used in this process can be manufactured locally and thereby there remains no constraint for supply chain management interruption due to cross border shipment issues and tariff change consequences on chemical pricing and cost of treatment an ancillary benefit is the waste reduced hypochlorite residue form the settling step of the process along with the backwash residue will be sent to a thickening tank and he added to the biological treatment process waste activated sludge for enhanced dewatering of the waste activated sludge from the effluent treatment plant and the sewage treatment plants existing in the textile processing factories the reduced residue of hypochlorite calcium hydroxide is an excellent proven additive for enhancing sludge dewater process williford c 2007 and also for municipal and septic tank sludge microbial stabilization by killing off pathogenic microorganisms huan li 2008 present in the waste sludge and would allow for possible use as organic fertilizer the caveat has to be that the wastewater from the textile processing dose not contain heavy metals and in this particular wastewater used in the study the wastewater did not contain heavy metals upon analysis in the experimental program the composite wastewater sample used in the study was analyzed for cadmium chromium lead and mercury in outsourced laboratory and there was no presence of the mentioned toxic heavy metals further the government of bangladesh has banned the use of any heavy metal bearing chemicals in textile processing but for judicious application of the proposed process reuse waste sludge analysis should be performed for presence of heavy metal before application of the proposed process or reuse of the waste calcium hydroxide a common method of reclaiming saline soil where crops cannot grow is to leach out the sodium in the water by rinsing using calcium rich water in this remedial application the calcium rich waste residue from the oxidation process and the calcium rich filter back wash water from the proposed process can be used beneficially to calcium enrich the rinse water there by enhance the soil restoration process orson w israelsen 1962 from an overall perspective the result clearly points to an efficient pre treatment process that removes color and reduce the chemical oxygen demand of the textile processing wastewater the demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed process based on locally available material makes for a good sustainable candidate for application in the textile dyeing wastewater treatment industry mix for application in bangladesh 5 conclusion in search of a sustainable option the technology development project was undertaken using textile wastewater to develop an appropriate method of pre treating textile processing wastewater in bangladesh the process is based on locally available process materials thus sustainable in the long run the experimental program showed complete removal of the color and over ninety percent removal of chemical oxygen demand the developed primary treatment process is an example of a bottom up supply change approach using locally available material and not dependent on imported materials the government by putting tariffs on imported equipment s fosters the need for development of sustainable locally developed technologies the government can further the cause of the energy efficient process that can save energy in the wastewater pretreatment process can foster its application by instating regressive pricing on energy consumption hence having to pay more for more usage by an institution thus would make companies think out of the box and be more open to novel technologies outlined in this paper the same holds for carbon dioxide emission the government needs to introduce carbon emission tariffs that would charge industries in bangladesh for carbon dioxide emission and promulgation of such tariffs would foster the interest in application of the technology outlined in this paper that is more carbon friendly in comparison to the technologies currently being employed in textile wastewater treatment that is extended aeration

hypochlorite from the oxidation step the sand served as the filtration media that will remove residual particulate matter from the coagulation process and the gravel served as the base to hold the finer filling layer and the granular sand layer ensuring that the iron particulate matter is not pushed through by the water into the bed and also for the sand from not washing away with the flow of the water over the filtration bed the whole system of the iron filings sitting on a layer of gravel that sits onto the sand bed supported again by a layer of gravel is called a multimedia filter system the textile wastewater reacted with calcium hypochlorite in a beaker after mixing for five to 7 min in the batch reactor which was a beaker with a liquid volume of 1000 ml the treated wastewater was allowed to settle for 1 5 h mimicking a clarifier and the supernatant collected for analysis 50 ml and the remaining supernatant was passed through the multi media filter in a gravity flow mode the flow diagram of the process is shown in fig 3 and the picture of the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 the column study was conducted until bed breakthrough occurred indicated by a decrease in filtration rate 2 2 test textile dyeing and processing wastewater for this experiment program blue denim processing textile wastewater was used the textile wastewater sample was collected from the equalization basin of a blue denim textile processing wastewater treatment plant a time proportion composite sample was collected for 24 h of operation to test the efficacy of the treatment process 2 3 calcium hypochlorite oxidation step blue denim textile dyeing wastewater was oxidized using calcium hypochlorite dosage optimization it was done by adding ninety two percent pure calcium hypochlorite powder until the color of the wastewater disappeared from blue to colorless in a completely mixed batch reactor the batch reactor which was a beaker with a liquid volume of 1000 ml where the content of the beaker was constantly mixed manually using a wooden ladle as the calcium hypochlorite was added till the wastewater in the beaker changed color from blue to colorless the total mixing time was observed to be between five to 7 min in total in total 24 batches batch tests were done to ensure confidence with respect to the reproducibility of the results 2 4 bench scale column step the rapid filter consisted of a plastic column of diameter 3 81 cm and a height of 45 72 cm in this experiment program the plastic column was filled with a layer of 2 cm rusted waste iron filings at the top a layer of 7 6 cm coarse gravel afterward a layer of 7 9 cm coarse sand with fineness modulus of 2 2 and finally a layer of 2 cm gravel the design filtration rate volume of water passed divided by filter bed correctional surface area has a unit of m3 m2 hr or m hr of the rapid sand filter was 4 9 m h m3 m2 hr after the neutralization of the color by chemical oxidation the wastewater was passed through the rapid filtration system by gravity flow the column study was conducted until bed breakthrough occurred due to the fouling of the filter which was indicated by a substantial decrease in the filtration rate less than 0 5 m3 m2 hr treated water was collected at preset bed volumes of water passed bed volume is a non dimensional parameter used in the water industry to relate the volume of water to passed through the filter bed it is defined as the volume of water passed through the media bed in this case the sand bed m3 divided by the empty volume of the sand bed m3 its unit can also be specified as m3 of water passed m3 of the media in the filter the treated wastewater was analyzed for ph onsite and the rest of the sample was stored in plastic bottles of 250 ml to be analyzed in the laboratory for color turbidity total suspended solids total dissolved solids chemical oxygen demand and residual chlorine the runs were repeated twice and average standard deviation values were plotted with respect to the bed volumes of water treated 3 analysis the flow rate was measured using a graduated cylinder and a stopwatch chemical oxygen demand was measured by hach method reactor digestion method method 8000 digestion 0 1500 mg l range the color was measured by hach method platinum cobalt standard method method 8025 adapted from standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater and national council for air and stream improvement ncasi methods manual residual chlorine was measured by hach method usepa dpd method method 8167 adapted from standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater hach chemical company 2013 american public health association 1989 this procedure is equivalent to usepa and standard method 4500 cl g for drinking water and wastewater analysis total suspended solids were measured by standard method turbidity was measured by dr lange turbidity meter total dissolved solid was measured using ec tds nacl probe and meter by hanna instruments hi 2300 system the ph for the characterization of the raw wastewater a hi 2211 ph orp probe and meter system by hanna instruments was used for field pilot ph measurements were made using ph paper strip made by fisher scientific the field ph measurement is just as a process indication tool and was not intended for regulatory compliance measurement total suspended solids were determined by standard methods 2540d where a well mixed volume of a wastewater or water sample was filtered through a pre weighed glass fiber filter pore size 0 45 Œºm the filter was dried at 104 1 c and then weighed the mass increase divided by the water volume filtered is equal to the tss in mg l american public health association 1989 4 results and discussion wastewater has to be treated before it is allowed to be discharged into the water bodies meeting the regulatory limits set by the government department of environment bangladesh 2008 unfortunately non compliance is a concern and tariffs on imported materials calls maiko sakamoto 2019 for development of pretreatment processes to remove color that rely on locally available materials to treat textile processing wastewater that decuples from the reliance on imported chemical for decoloring and possible chemical oxygen reduction to reduce loading to the secondary biological treatment process that requires energy for operation of blowers to provide the air required by the microorganisms towards the goal of overall sustainability the process that was developed uses locally available calcium hypochlorite to break down the organic azoic dye constitutions ventura camargo b 2013 which accounts for the color in the wastewater followed by chemically waste iron filings locally available from rerolling mills and electric arc furnaces of steel industries aided rapid sand filtration waste iron filings fe0 fe2 fe3 served as the coagulating agent to enhance colloidal particulate removal in the rapid sand filtration process and also to neutralize any excess hypochlorite ion ocl from the oxidation step the schematic process flow diagram is shown in fig 2 along with the schematic and picture of the bench scale setup is shown in figs 3 and 4 the objective of the process evaluation program was to validate and evaluate the proposed primary treatment process on its ability to remove color from the test textile dyeing and processing wastewater thereby serving as a substitute to imported chemical decoloring agents and also investigate the possibility of chemical oxygen demand cod reduction thereby reducing the load to the secondary biological treatment which requires energy that is dependent on the cod of the wastewater entering the secondary biological treatment system to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed process a time proportioned wastewater sample was collected from the equalization basin of a blue denim textile processing facility wastewater treatment plant the water quality characterization of the composite wastewater sample is listed in table 1 the wastewater had color and higher that average sewage wastewater cod peavy 1984 calling for the need of color removal and reduction of cod by primary treatment before secondary aerobic biological treatment the first step in the treatment process is the oxidation of blue denim textile dyeing wastewater using calcium hypochlorite occurred in continuous batch a process in a rapid mixing reactor it took on average 17 9 0 5 g of ninety percent pure locally available commercial grade calcium hypochlorite to completely remove the color from 243 11 ptco to colorless 0 0 ptco for every liter of the wastewater treated for twenty four batches of wastewater treated the oxidation process reduced the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater from 590 79 mg l to 13 5 1 5 mg l n 24 p 0 05 the batch oxidation process also decreased the total dissolved solids from 422 2 to 6 9 0 7 mg l n 24 p 0 05 and predictably post oxidation there was an increase in the concentration of ocl in the wastewater from blow detection 0 0 mg l to 0 3 0 2 mg l with regards to the overall efficacy of the process the oxidation step clearly removed color and reduce the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater appreciable but the only drawback was the presence of the trace oxidizing agent in the wastewater after the batch oxidation step the residual oxidizing agent in the water may affect negatively the secondary biological treatment system ocl a strong oxidizing and disinfectant could be toxic to the microorganisms present in the activated sludge system and affect the performance of the system to breakdown the organic compounds present in the wastewater this requires the need for the second step the reduction of the ocl by the waste iron filings followed by the cores sand filtration step that will reduce any carry over ferric salts and calcium salts from the oxidation and reduction steps the next step of the process rapid multi media filter with was carried out at a virgin bed filtration rate of 4 9 m h m3 m2 hr until the filtration rate decreased below 0 1 m h m3 m2 hr the filtration rate decreased with the bed volumes of water treated due to the fouling of the filter decrease of filtration rate is the most common problem of rapid multi media filters and all filters incorporate provisions for backwashing to regenerate the filter at preset bed volumes of wastewater treated bed volume is a non dimensional parameter used in the water industry to relate the volume of water to pass through the filter bed its defined as volume of water passed through the media bed in this case the sand bed m3 divided by the empty volume of the sand bed m3 treated wastewater samples treated effluent were collected and analyzed for ph color total suspended solids and total dissolved solids chemical oxygen demand and residual chlorine after the rapid multimedia step complete color removal was achieved throughout the test run and thus achieved the research goal of removing color using a locally available oxidizing chemical that was calcium hypochlorite the proof is in the picture fig 5 is a comparative picture of the treated water composite sample for a full run against the raw wastewater showing the contrast in color the spectrophotometric analysis value of the treated water samples taken for the duration of the filter runs was 0 0 ptco for the majority of the treated water samples the turbidity was less than 10 ntu although the bangladesh environment conservation regulations do not specify any standard for industrial discharge with respect to turbidity the quality of the treated water was even within the guidelines of potable water of 10 ntu set by the government of bangladesh 5 the total suspended solids throughout the filter runs were below 15 mg l fig 6 both parameters clearly show that the treatment process ensures water that does not have any carryover of solids from the chemical oxidation process for the subsequent biological secondary treatment process again speaking in favorably of the primary treatment process the total dissolved solids of the oxidized filtered wastewater were below 8 0 mg l refer to fig 7 indicating the efficacy of the proposed treatment process in its ability to also reduce total dissolved solids from the raw wastewater raw wastewater tds 422 2 mg l refer to table 1 of significant note is the that the measured residual ocl ions of the iron filing sand filtration step treated water was below detection indicating that the ocl ions remaining in the water after the oxidation step was neutralized this indicates that the waste iron filings were able to neutralize the excess free chlorine ensuring against deleterious effects to the downstream biological or any other treatment processes that would be required in real life application the pretreatment process did not significantly decrease the ph of the wastewater with the ph of the treated wastewater was above 11 5 through the filter run indicating that prior to secondary biological treatment the ph of the wastewater needs to neutralize to near neutral range 6 5 7 5 a restorative factor of the process is its ability to reduce the chemical oxygen demand cod of the wastewater a parameter that is a measure of the biodegradable pollutants in the wastewater a high reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod was observed after the treatment of wastewater by this proposed process the cod removal ranged as high as ninety percent fig 8 and the effluent cod levels for the duration of the test run was below 20 mg l to give a prospective of the efficacy of the process in terms of cod removal and the government of bangladesh discharge limit for cod for wastewater is 200 mg l in essence one could discharge the wastewater without further treatment but one qualification is that the reaming cod may contain residual organics from textile processing that was not measured in the experimental program and may require further biological activated sludge treatment in real life application but what the pretreatment process outlined in the experimental program dose is reduces the cod loading to any subsequent biological treatment process every kg cod loading to the biological aerobic treatment system requires 3 2 kw h of electrical energy plappally 2012 for this particular wastewater the proposed pretreatment treatment system with 95 cod removal fig 9 would produce a net energy savings in the aerobic biological treatment of 1 8 kw h for every meter cube of wastewater treated compared to conventional biological aerobic wastewater treatment the proposed pretreatment with is cod reduction capabilities and thus less aeration requirement in the downstream biological treatment due to reduced cod loading cuts down on the energy requirement and thereby reduces co2 emission as well and for this particular wastewater this would produce a net reduction in co2 emission by 0 31 kg per meter cube of wastewater treated the cost benefit analysis of the proposed process in comparison to the imported chemical depended pretreatment process indicates that the proposed process is more economically favorable for the treatment plant operators a local survey of textile processing facility wastewater treatment plant operation shows that the chemical cost to remove the color from textile wastewater is 24 3 taka m3 taka is the currency of bangladesh and the exchange rate is taka 85 to one united states dollar md ebadul haque 2014 based on local market price of calcium hypochlorite the pretreatment cost of this particular wastewater based on the amount of calcium hypochlorite required to pre treat the wastewater to remove color would be 45 taka m3 though the pre treatment cost may seem higher than the conventional treatment method the overall cost due to more energy savings make the pretreatment method more feasible in this proposed process the cod reduction as a result of the oxidation process as mentioned earlier would result in 1 8 kw h m3 energy can be saved by implementing the pretreatment process outlined in this paper resulting in monitory saving of taka 26 54 m3 of wastewater treated taka 14 44 taka kwh of electric energy consumed for industrial use thus the net savings in treatment cost of taka 5 83 as earlier mentioned there would be a significant savings of carbon emission by implementing this process due to the reduction of electrical energy consumption in the aeration basis and at the co2 emission price of 30 taka kg of co2 emission twd energy conversion 2019 an additional taka 201 58 m3 will be saved as 80 kg co2 emission m3 wastewater treated is reduced by the proposed process taking the cost of co2 reduction in the accounting keeping in mind the overall goal of sustainable operation the net savings in operation cost would be approximately taka 207 m3 of wastewater treated an additional beneficiary feature of this pretreatment process is that all the materials being used in this process can be manufactured locally and thereby there remains no constraint for supply chain management interruption due to cross border shipment issues and tariff change consequences on chemical pricing and cost of treatment an ancillary benefit is the waste reduced hypochlorite residue form the settling step of the process along with the backwash residue will be sent to a thickening tank and he added to the biological treatment process waste activated sludge for enhanced dewatering of the waste activated sludge from the effluent treatment plant and the sewage treatment plants existing in the textile processing factories the reduced residue of hypochlorite calcium hydroxide is an excellent proven additive for enhancing sludge dewater process williford c 2007 and also for municipal and septic tank sludge microbial stabilization by killing off pathogenic microorganisms huan li 2008 present in the waste sludge and would allow for possible use as organic fertilizer the caveat has to be that the wastewater from the textile processing dose not contain heavy metals and in this particular wastewater used in the study the wastewater did not contain heavy metals upon analysis in the experimental program the composite wastewater sample used in the study was analyzed for cadmium chromium lead and mercury in outsourced laboratory and there was no presence of the mentioned toxic heavy metals further the government of bangladesh has banned the use of any heavy metal bearing chemicals in textile processing but for judicious application of the proposed process reuse waste sludge analysis should be performed for presence of heavy metal before application of the proposed process or reuse of the waste calcium hydroxide a common method of reclaiming saline soil where crops cannot grow is to leach out the sodium in the water by rinsing using calcium rich water in this remedial application the calcium rich waste residue from the oxidation process and the calcium rich filter back wash water from the proposed process can be used beneficially to calcium enrich the rinse water there by enhance the soil restoration process orson w israelsen 1962 from an overall perspective the result clearly points to an efficient pre treatment process that removes color and reduce the chemical oxygen demand of the textile processing wastewater the demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed process based on locally available material makes for a good sustainable candidate for application in the textile dyeing wastewater treatment industry mix for application in bangladesh 5 conclusion in search of a sustainable option the technology development project was undertaken using textile wastewater to develop an appropriate method of pre treating textile processing wastewater in bangladesh the process is based on locally available process materials thus sustainable in the long run the experimental program showed complete removal of the color and over ninety percent removal of chemical oxygen demand the developed primary treatment process is an example of a bottom up supply change approach using locally available material and not dependent on imported materials the government by putting tariffs on imported equipment s fosters the need for development of sustainable locally developed technologies the government can further the cause of the energy efficient process that can save energy in the wastewater pretreatment process can foster its application by instating regressive pricing on energy consumption hence having to pay more for more usage by an institution thus would make companies think out of the box and be more open to novel technologies outlined in this paper the same holds for carbon dioxide emission the government needs to introduce carbon emission tariffs that would charge industries in bangladesh for carbon dioxide emission and promulgation of such tariffs would foster the interest in application of the technology outlined in this paper that is more carbon friendly in comparison to the technologies currently being employed in textile wastewater treatment that is extended aeration 
12197,two potential sorbent materials were investigated for their ability to remove excess phosphate from agricultural runoff in bangladesh because they are low in cost locally available and require few extra resources to prepare they offer viable strategies to prevent hazardous algal blooms that can catastrophically take out fish and water bird populations the first material is rice hulls that have been burned calcined and enhanced with fecl3 the second and more appealing is iron rich sylhet sands that are simply washed sorption trials were run in both batch and column modes optimal conditions for phosphate removal were ph 5 and a 3 h contact time fe treated rice hull ash removed 78 5 of the phosphate from a 5 ppm test solution the sylhet sand achieved a 49 6 reduction when an actual sample of runoff from the tangua hoar was subjected to the sorbents the rice hull ash removed 83 8 and the sylhet sand removed 83 both materials showed signs of being re useable with the rice hull ash 42 9 of the phosphate could desorbed while with the sylhet sand 71 6 of the phosphate was desorbed once desorbed 74 of the phosphate could be recovered for fertilizer feed stock by precipitating it out as ferric phosphate fepo4 graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphate removal process water agricultural runoff eutrophication rice hull ash sylhet sand haor swamp water

had been made leached nutrients into the haor swamp surface waters more than 1200 tonnes of fish thousands of ducks and other aquatic birds and even some livestock fell victims to the cyanobacterial bloom that followed ahmad and roy 2017 and scientific bangladesh 2017 the magnitude of fish and animal deaths was correlated with high bod high phosphorus and low dissolved oxygen levels in these waters water samples from dekar haor and khercher haor showed phosphorus levels that were two to three times higher than normal 0 07 and 0 09 mg l respectively as opposed to less than 0 03 mg l normally at tanguar haor where fewer wildlife deaths were found the phosphorus level was lower at 0 05 mg l this research was motivated by efforts to prevent the reoccurrence of hazardous algal blooms in bangladesh jahan et al 2009 and rahman et al 2007 the occurrence of hazardous algal blooms and their dire consequences underscores the need for effective ways to reduce phosphates in runoff from agricultural lands chorus and bartram 1999 orihel et al 2013 such as the rice paddies in the haor district low cost and locally available materials even though they may not be the best sorbents are compelling to explore for such applications this research reports on testing two potential substances that meet these criteria rice hulls and sylhet sands they are relatively inexpensive and available locally in large quantities because they are found close to the haors minimal transportation charges are incurred in using them the rice hulls are easily converted to a calcined ash form and the sylhet sands need only to be quarried and washed bangladesh is not alone in having problems with excess phosphorus in surface waters discussions in the scientific literature regarding the liabilities of high phosphates in wastewater or runoff generally appear under the heading of cultural eutrophication schindler and vallentyne 2008 the enriched phosphorus levels encourage the growth of all sorts of nuisance algae including cyanobacteria it is a common problem anywhere there are large populations and extensive agricultural lands in developed countries a common urban source of excess phosphorus is soaps and detergents used for laundry and dish washers phosphorus containing compounds are added as builders to soften the water and enhance the effectiveness of the cleaning agents many domestic water supplies have calcium and magnesium ions present also common are iron and manganese cations these cations chelate with the polar head group of the soap or detergent molecule these form insoluble salts that deposit onto clothes or as films on dishes that are difficult to remove many localities have established rules that limit or exclude phosphorous additives to soaps and detergents most notably the great lakes drainage in the northeast and the columbia river watershed in the northwest parts of the usa packages of cleaning agents bought in these areas must display a phosphate free

sorbents metal oxides and hydroxides calcium and magnesium carbonates and hydroxides layered double hydroxides organic sorbents activated carbon anion exchange resins and industrial by products they report maximum removal efficiencies in batch studies of 23 mg g with granulated ferric hydroxide at ph 5 5 and 14 mg g with activated aluminum oxide at ph 5 5 an alternative way to remove the phosphorus is a biological lagoon where a carefully managed ecosystem consumes the phosphorus before it can get into surface waters maiga et al 2017 many municipalities have added enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in tertiary wastewater treatment facilities in which polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao are selectively enriched in the bacterial community within the activated sludge metcalf and eddy 2003 the biomass is subsequently settled out the sludge often used in creating fertilizer ingredients ebpr is capable of meeting an effluent release target of 1 mg l the basis of the phosphate removal scheme described here is the affinity between trivalent ferric ion fe3 and phosphate in the environment phosphate is usually a limiting nutrient because is locked in solid form as ferric phosphate fepo4 s which has a ksp of 4 10 27 thus ferric phosphate s solubility is 6 3 10 14 m harris 2011 sylhet sand s golden color is due to its relatively high ferric ion content the presence of fe3 in oxidized sediment has already been proven useful for removal of arsenic in bangladesh ahmed et al 2004 and stollenwerk et al 2007 rice hull ash is not necessarily high in ferric ion but it can easily be treated with fecl3 while other research has used rice hulls as a sorbent ahmaruzzaman and gupta 2011 the use of a fecl3 enhancement for the specific removal of phosphate has not previously been reported a suitable sorbent for phosphate removal should not only have high phosphate sorption capacity and cost effectiveness but should also be amenable to easy desorption of the sorbed phosphate this allows regeneration of the sorbent a series of experiments was performed to evaluate how reversible the sorption process was finally an ideal phosphate removal procedure should allow for the ultimate recovery of the phosphate residues for use as fertilizer feed stock de bashana and bashan 2004 once the sorbed phosphate had been removed from the sand and rice hull ash sorbent materials its reprecipitation as a phosphate salt was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sorbent materials the sorbent materials were obtained locally in bangladesh fig 1 the sands were collected from the sylhet district located in the northwest rice husks were received from dinajpur district rice mills in the northeast the sorbents were preserved in a dry condition until prepared for sorption studies prior to use the sylhet sand was washed 3 to 4 times in distilled water and 0 10 m hcl the washed sand was then dried in a 60 c oven for 24 h the rice hulls were also washed 3 to 4 times in distilled water then washed with 0 10 m sulfuric acid it was oven dried for 24 h at 60 c after drying the rice hulls were burned in ambient air finally the rice hulls were transferred to a different crucible and calcined at 600 c in a muffle furnace for 6 h to remove volatiles in the sample fig 2 because the presence of iron in sylhet sand seemed likely to be the basis of its efficacy de bashan and bashan 2004 rice hull ash material was treated with 1 m fecl3 and oven dried 2 2 5 ppm phosphate stock solution orthophosphate is soluble and considered to be the only type of p that is directly assimilated by most plants including algae loganathan et al 2014 thus a phosphate test solution was made by dissolving 2 195 g of anhydrous potassium monobasic phosphate kh2po4 in 100 ml of distilled water this is 5000 ppm phosphate as p serial dilution by a factor of 1000 gave a final phosphate test solution that is 5 ppm po4 as p the ph was adjusted to a target value using hcl or naoh during the dilution process 2 3 stannous chloride method molybdophosphoric acid is formed and reduced by stannous chloride to intensely colored molybdenum blue this method is quite sensitive and makes feasible measurements down to 0 01 ppm po4 3 as p murphy and riley 1962 sletten and bach 1961 2 3 1 ammonium molybdate reagent a 2 5 g ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o27 4h2o was dissolved in 17 5 ml distilled water next 28 ml of concentrated h2so4 was added to 40 ml of distilled water and cooled to room temperature before adding to the ammonium molybdate solution the solution mixture was diluted to a final volume of 100 ml 2 3 2 stannous chloride reagent b 2 5 g of sncl2 2h2o was dissolved in 100 ml of glycerol by heating in a water bath at 50 c and stirring to hasten dissolution this reagent was stable and required neither preservatives nor special storage conditions 2 3 3 color development with thorough mixing after each addition 4 0 ml of ammonium molybdate reagent a and 0 50 ml of stannous chloride reagent b were added to a sample the rate of color development and intensity of the color depended on temperature of the final solution each 1 c increase caused about a 1 increase in color intensity hence the samples standards and reagents were strictly maintained within 2 c of one another in a temperature range between 20 c and 30 c measurements reported here were conducted at 22 c 2 3 4 color measurement the samples were filtered through 0 45 Œºm syringe filters and analyzed with a shimadzu 1800 uv vis spectrophotometer using the stannous chloride method the absorbance at 690 nm was recorded between 10 and 12 min after mixing the coloring reagents and the samples the same specific time interval was followed for all determinations a calibration curve and reagent blank were used to determine the sample concentration 2 3 5 hach method occasionally for comparative purposes a commercial hach instrument was used on sample runs the dr6000 is a benchtop uv vis instrument 190 1100 nm color developing reagent molybdenum blue boltz and mellon 1947 was added to the phosphate solution a 2 min wait period was established for color development Œª max at 890 nm and then the concentration was recorded as mg l 2 3 6 scanning electron microscope sem the completely air dried samples were put on a conducting carbon strip the sample loaded strip was mounted in a chamber that was evacuated to about 10 3 to 10 4 torr then a very thin platinum layer few nanometers thick was sputtered onto the sample to ensure the conductivity of its surface finally the sample was placed in the main sem chamber jsm 7600f jeol japan to image its surface the microscope was operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 0 kv 2 4 column experiments columns for flow experiments were conducted by placing 2 000 g of rice hull ash rha as an adsorbent in a 10 ml syringe fig 3 the 5 ppm phosphate test solution was run continuously through the column about 50 ml of solution at ph 5 the effluent was collected in a beaker and passed through a 0 45 Œºm pore sized syringe filter the concentration was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer at 690 nm after developing its color with the ammonium molybdate stannous chloride reagents additional 50 ml aliquots of 5 ppm test solution were passed through the column until a breakthrough event was detected all experimental trials were replicated 5 times different concentrations of phosphate test solutions were tried to assess column performance under other conditions finally phosphate was determined in actual samples from the tangua haor 2 5 batch experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted on synthetic waste waters by mixing different amounts of calcined rice hull ash or sylhet sand with 25 ml of synthetic wastewater in 100 ml conical flasks the flasks were installed on a rotary shaker set to 150 rpm at 25 c sorption studies were performed with ph ranging from 4 0 to 10 0 for 10 g of sylhet sand or 2 g of rice hull ash and contact times ranging from 60 to 270 min after sorption the solution was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm syringe filter subsequent tests were conducted on sylhet sand to generate adsorption isotherm data a range of phs from 4 to 7 was used in order to evaluate its effect 2 6 removal efficiency the removal efficiency for either batch or column modes was computed using a standard formula 1 removal efficiency c 0 c e c 0 x 100 where c o is the initial concentration mg l or ppm and c e is the final concentration of phosphate mg l or ppm 2 7 regenerating sorbents phosphate desorption was performed at several ph values in the alkaline region by centrifuging sorbent for several hours maximum desorption was achieved by adjusting the solution to a ph of 7 0 8 0 and centrifuging the sorbent at 1200 rpm for 12 h the supernatant was then withdrawn and subjected to the color development procedure 2 8 phosphate recovery phosphate was precipitated from the supernatant solution as fepo4 by adding fecl3 3 results and discussion 3 1 rice hull ash and 5 ppm test solution the initial removal efficiency of the rice hull ash syringe columns was determined for both the untreated and fe treated sorbents a 50 0 ml aliquot of the 5 ppm test solution was passed through a 2 000 g bed of untreated rice hull ash the original test solution and eluent were filtered and treated for color development before measurement by the uv vis spectrophotometer their absorbances of 0 351 before and 0 166 after represented a reduction of 52 8 in the phosphate level fig 4 in a subsequent trial 2 000 g of the fecl3 treated rice hull ash was packed into a syringe column again 50 0 ml of the 5 ppm phosphate test solution was passed through the sorbent bed the effluent was collected in a beaker filtered with a 0 45 Œºm pore sized filter and subjected to color development using the stannous chloride method with the absorbance measured at 690 nm the test solution again measured 0 351 standard units while that of the fe treated hull effluent was 0 076 this represents a substantial increase in the removal efficiency 78 5 nearly half again better than the untreated rice hull ash 3 2 sylhet sand and 5 ppm test solution the large grain size of sylhet sand precluded syringe column experiments the size of pores in the sand bed was too large to allow sufficient retention time for sorption thus sylhet sands were assessed only with batch experiments contact times during a run were varied between 1 and 3 h as expected maximal removal was achieved with the 3 h period measured absorbances for the test solution were 0 351 before and 0 177 afterwards thus 49 6 of the phosphate was removed of the two potential sorbents the fe treated rice hull ash had a higher percent removal efficiency than the sylhet sand this may simply be a manifestation of the surface area of sorbent that is available to the test solution the rice hull ash had a much smaller grain size than the sylhet sand as revealed by scanning electron microscopy this is evident in the two images shown in fig 5 note that the magnification on panel a is 500 and that on panel b is x50 even with the greater magnification the rice hull ash displays smaller particles this indicates a significant increase in surface area for sorption in the rice hull ash bed 3 3 effect of sorbent contact time optimal conditions for removal were evaluated with a series of batch experiments that employed 10 0 g of sylhet sand and contact times of 1 4 5 h duration the sorbent was mixed with 25 ml of both a 1 ppm and a 5 ppm phosphate test solution the conical flasks were installed on a rotary shaker set to 150 rpm at 25 c the results indicated that optimal conditions were achieved with a contact time of 3 h fig 6 beyond that the removal efficiency dropped off to a fairly steady level of 38 this suggests that the optimal sorption level is not achieved under equilibrium conditions there must be some kinetic impediment for desorption that requires the longer contact period 3 4 effect of ph on removal efficiency a set of experiments examined the effect of ph on removal efficiency with a second series of batch studies again 25 0 ml of 5 ppm phosphate test solution was used but the ph was adjusted beforehand with hcl or naoh to a range of 4 0 10 0 then 10 0 g samples of sylhet sand were added and the flasks containing the mixture were installed on the rotary shaker for 3 h as previously described the percentage removal efficiencies are shown in fig 7 the highest removal efficiencies were obtained at a ph range of 4 0 5 0 and at contact times of 3 h the sorption studies indicated that a ph of 4 5 was optimal for phosphate removal this is explained by noting that at ph 5 the predominant phosphate species will be h2po4 fig 8 the three acid dissociation constants pkas for the h3po4 system are 2 148 7 199 and 12 15 respectively harris 2011 if the ph is too much lower than 4 the species distribution shifts towards the uncharged h3po4 form with no charge there is no electrostatic attraction to make it attach to the surface at higher phs the increasing amount of oh in solution begins to compete with the phosphate species because fe3 was correlated with good removal efficiencies the presence of higher oh with increasing ph will block access to these binding sites for h2po4 ions oh is a stronger complexing ligand than the dihydrogen phosphate an indication of this is that subjecting the materials after they had sorbed phosphate to a solution of ph 7 0 8 0 was effective in causing the phosphate to desorb essentially the oh was binding more tightly than h2po4 2 and considerably less labile once attached the optimal sorption time of 3 h is interesting this was observed in earlier studies on phosphate removal shukla et al 2019 they too found that there was an initial higher sorption peak before settling in to a lower equilibrium level they suggested the enhanced early adsorption could be due to phosphate levels in the solution that overwhelm the mass transfer process occurring between the sorbent surface and the bulk solution not only was this drop off in removal efficiency seen in the time studies of fig 6 but also in the ph study of fig 7 3 5 adsorption isotherms a series of experiments was conducted to investigate the sorption characteristics of the sylhet sand in each case a series of batches was set up for which increasing amounts of po4 3 in solution was placed in contact with 10 g of sorbent for a 48 h period this was done to promote equilibrium conditions between the sorbent bed and solution phase the temperature was maintained throughout at 25 c three different models were fit to the data 1 a classical langmuir adsorption isotherm langmuir 1918 2 a modified temkin isotherm temkin and pyzhev 1940 and 3 a linear model table 1 holds the data used to generate the curve fits that appear in fig 9 the batch data did not follow a classical langmuir isotherm eq 2 very well values of theta Œ∏ were computed using the data for 7 mg l po4 3 to represent the point of maximum surface coverage a k eq of 0 278 was computed for the initial point where po4 3 was minimal such that k eq Œ∏ with these parameters the Œ∏ computed from the langmuir equation never exceeded 0 73 2 Œ∏ k e q p o 4 3 1 k e q p o 4 3 a better fit was achieved by using a modified version of the temkin equation eq 3 this model takes into account interactions that may occur between the adsorbate and the surface to which it is attracted temkin noted experimentally that strength of sorption tended to increase with increasing surface coverage the line generated here was based on eq 3 3 Œ∏ a Œ∏ k e q p o 4 3 1 k e q p o 4 3 where the coefficient a varies directly with Œ∏ the fit shown here was achieved with a 1 15 and k eq 1 1 it consistently under estimates the value of Œ∏ before site saturation is achieved but its overall shape follows the data quite well the best fit to the data was managed by using a simple linear adsorption model until surface saturation was reached in this regard it is similar to henry s law henry 1803 applied to adsorption from the liquid phase the pre saturation values were computed using the linear regression equation determined from po4 3 values of 0 06 4 mg l i e 4 Œ∏ 0 2214 po 4 3 0 0266 once the amount of po4 3 removed became constant at 5 mg l a value of Œ∏ 1 was used additional isotherm studies were performed at ph values of 4 6 and 7 the ph 7 trace is close to the conditions of the ambient waters 6 7 7 2 found in the haors during the 2017 hazardous algal bloom event there was very little difference in the behavior of the sylhet sand adsorbent with these fluctuations in ph the linear pre saturation portions of the isotherms for all four phs plotted almost on top of one another fig 10 linear regression trend lines for the pre saturation portions of the isotherms yielded slopes of 0 2015 at ph 4 0 2214 at ph 5 0 1964 at ph 6 and 0 2015 at ph 7 as confirmed in earlier studies slightly higher Œ∏ values were observed at ph 5 compared to the other three before the adsorbent became saturated but when expressed as removal for the 5 mg l po4 3 test solution the 54 removal at ph 4 was slightly better than 51 at ph 6 50 at ph 5 and 47 at ph 7 at all ph values there were small variations in Œ∏ as the amount of sylhet sand was increased beyond 5 mg l this can be attributed to measurement errors caused by high levels of po4 3 in the unadsorbed solution phase these concentrations were so high for the analytical method used to measure it that there was an inherent higher degree of uncertainty in the measured values electronic shot noise in the detector becomes more significant in uv vis determinations under these circumstances the trend in the variations becomes more pronounced as the amount of adsorbent increases 3 6 flow studies on sylhet sand columns studies were undertaken to assess how useful sylhet sand would be in flow applications columns with a 10 ml capacity were packed with 8 g of washed syhlet sand then a 1 ppm po4 3 test solution at ph 5 was passed through it under four different flow regimes the removals achieved in each instance are listed in table 2 even when the flow was restricted to 0 5 ml min there was only 14 removal this suggests that flow applications with sylhet sand sorption beds are impractical 3 7 recovery of phosphate from sorbents when measured spectrophotometrically at 690 nm the supernatant solutions indicated 42 9 of the phosphate had desorbed from the rice hull ash and 71 6 had desorbed from sylhet sand 3 8 phosphate recovery by precipitation phosphate was recovered from the supernatant solution as fepo4 by adding fecl3 for a 2 0 g sample of fe treated rice hull ash 0 137 mg of phosphate as p was sorbed and 0 045 mg recovered or 32 8 for a 10 0 g sample of sylhet sand 0 125 mg of phosphate as p was sorbed and 0 093 mg recovered or 74 4 3 9 tangua haor water sample after evaluating the sorbents on the 5 ppm synthetic solutions a real sample of water from the tangua haor was tested that contained 0 06 ppm phosphate as p note that the toxic water conditions were substantially less than the test solutions with which the sorbents were challenged it was collected following the april 2017 flood events that led to a hazardous algal bloom more than 1200 tonnes of fish died as a result the main factor leading to the algal bloom was shown to be elevated phosphate contents both tests on tangua haor water were performed in the batch mode in the first 2 000 g of fe treated rice hull ash were mixed with 25 ml of the haor sample in 100 ml conical flasks the flasks were installed on a rotary shaker for 3 h and set to 150 rpm at 25 c the initial 0 06 ppm haor sample displayed an absorbance of 0 053 before the run and an absorbance of 0 009 afterwards this corresponds to a removal efficiency of 83 8 for the second experiment 10 0 g of sylhet sand were mixed with 25 ml of the haor sample for a 3 h period on the shaker following the contact period the sample was filtered and measured using the commercial hach test kit the before sample was 0 06 ppm and the after sample was 0 01 ppm this represents an 83 removal efficiency nicely comparable to the treated rice hull ash 4 conclusions preliminary investigations have been performed on two potential materials for removing excess phosphates from agricultural runoff in bangladesh they offer cost effective means to develop methods using locally available materials that could help prevent the occurrence of harmful algal blooms such as that experienced in the april 2017 floods of the haor regions when tested on an actual haor sample from that incident 83 of the phosphate was removed with a single exposure to either the fe treated rice hull ash or the sylhet sand luckily the po4 3 levels that created that algal bloom situation are far below the test solutions that challenged the capacity of the sorbent beds the overall removal capacities of the two sorbent materials were 2 37 Œºg g rice hull ash and 0 475 Œºg g sylhet sand this ratio of about 5 to 1 is reflected in the quantities of sorbents that were used in this series of experiments i e 2 0 g of rice hull ash vs 10 0 g of sylhet sand while the rice hull ash has a higher capacity per gram it requires a more elaborate preparation procedure plus treatment with fecl3 rice hull ash also has seasonal availability issues the ashing and calcining steps require the net input of an energy source finally fecl3 treatment adds an additional cost fecl3 of sufficient quality would probably have to be acquired from out of country sources the sylhet sand on the other hand is available in much larger quantities has no seasonality to its acquisition and needs only to be quarried and washed prior to use this makes it the more attractive option to pursue for development at this juncture luckily the sylhet sand s sorption character did not seem to vary much with ph in the range of ambient haor conditions thus no ph adjustment would be needed in using it in field applications the batch studies of sylhet sand to measure its capacity and isotherm behavior were done without any potential interfering species other common anions found in surface waters e g sulfate chlorate hydrogen carbonate and nitrate are much weaker in their interactions with fe3 than phosphate this is reflected in the ksp for iron iii phosphate that is listed at 4 10 27 harris 2011 no other fe3 salts are included in typical ksp compilations except fe oh 3 that becomes problematic at higher phs another category potential interferents in real world samples is humic substances at the ambient ph of haor waters this would be restricted to the fulvic acid fraction these are larger organic ligands that would have more difficulty in finding and saturating the sorption sites on sylhet sand because we tested the sylhet sand with an actual sample from the tangua haor and were able to remove 83 8 of the po4 3 it appears the sorbent will work under the actual conditions for which it is designed given that sylhet sand appears to offer the best opportunity for development applications need to be designed with a batch mode in mind the sand was too coarse and packed too loosely to allow for much contact time between the phosphate containing solutions and the sorbent bed under free flow conditions essentially no po4 3 was retained perhaps a beginning strategy to attempt is the construction of some overflow cells next to each rice paddy the paddies could be flushed after fertilizer applications such that the excess phosphate could be removed by mesh bags containing sylhet sand the sorption capacity of the sand is two orders of magnitude larger than the paddy effluent so it could be used over a number of batches following use the sorbent could be regenerated it appears that the sorbents can be at least partially regenerated for future use and that the phosphate can be recaptured as an input for fertilizer production working out the details of how to best implement the application of these materials to a feasible control program and resource recovery system yet remains acknowledgments this project was partially funded by a grant nsu rp 18 026 from north south

12197,two potential sorbent materials were investigated for their ability to remove excess phosphate from agricultural runoff in bangladesh because they are low in cost locally available and require few extra resources to prepare they offer viable strategies to prevent hazardous algal blooms that can catastrophically take out fish and water bird populations the first material is rice hulls that have been burned calcined and enhanced with fecl3 the second and more appealing is iron rich sylhet sands that are simply washed sorption trials were run in both batch and column modes optimal conditions for phosphate removal were ph 5 and a 3 h contact time fe treated rice hull ash removed 78 5 of the phosphate from a 5 ppm test solution the sylhet sand achieved a 49 6 reduction when an actual sample of runoff from the tangua hoar was subjected to the sorbents the rice hull ash removed 83 8 and the sylhet sand removed 83 both materials showed signs of being re useable with the rice hull ash 42 9 of the phosphate could desorbed while with the sylhet sand 71 6 of the phosphate was desorbed once desorbed 74 of the phosphate could be recovered for fertilizer feed stock by precipitating it out as ferric phosphate fepo4 graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphate removal process water agricultural runoff eutrophication rice hull ash sylhet sand haor swamp water sustainability 1 introduction in april 2017 monsoon rains in northwest bangladesh caused extensive flooding water rushing across rice fields where recent applications of urea and phosphate fertilizers had been made leached nutrients into the haor swamp surface waters more than 1200 tonnes of fish thousands of ducks and other aquatic birds and even some livestock fell victims to the cyanobacterial bloom that followed ahmad and roy 2017 and scientific bangladesh 2017 the magnitude of fish and animal deaths was correlated with high bod high phosphorus and low dissolved oxygen levels in these waters water samples from dekar haor and khercher haor showed phosphorus levels that were two to three times higher than normal 0 07 and 0 09 mg l respectively as opposed to less than 0 03 mg l normally at tanguar haor where fewer wildlife deaths were found the phosphorus level was lower at 0 05 mg l this research was motivated by efforts to prevent the reoccurrence of hazardous algal blooms in bangladesh jahan et al 2009 and rahman et al 2007 the occurrence of hazardous algal blooms and their dire consequences underscores the need for effective ways to reduce phosphates in runoff from agricultural lands chorus and bartram 1999 orihel et al 2013 such as the rice paddies in the haor district low cost and locally available materials even though they may not be the best sorbents are compelling to explore for such applications this research reports on testing two potential substances that meet these criteria rice hulls and sylhet sands they are relatively inexpensive and available locally in large quantities because they are found close to the haors minimal transportation charges are incurred in using them the rice hulls are easily converted to a calcined ash form and the sylhet sands need only to be quarried and washed bangladesh is not alone in having problems with excess phosphorus in surface waters discussions in the scientific literature regarding the liabilities of high phosphates in wastewater or runoff generally appear under the heading of cultural eutrophication schindler and vallentyne 2008 the enriched phosphorus levels encourage the growth of all sorts of nuisance algae including cyanobacteria it is a common problem anywhere there are large populations and extensive agricultural lands in developed countries a common urban source of excess phosphorus is soaps and detergents used for laundry and dish washers phosphorus containing compounds are added as builders to soften the water and enhance the effectiveness of the cleaning agents many domestic water supplies have calcium and magnesium ions present also common are iron and manganese cations these cations chelate with the polar head group of the soap or detergent molecule these form insoluble salts that deposit onto clothes or as films on dishes that are difficult to remove many localities have established rules that limit or exclude phosphorous additives to soaps and detergents most notably the great lakes drainage in the northeast and the columbia river watershed in the northwest parts of the usa packages of cleaning agents bought in these areas must display a phosphate free code phosphorus in agricultural runoff has been an issue for decades in developed countries in the united states huge efforts to reduce nonpoint releases of phosphorus from fertilizer and livestock runoff have been mounted in the mississippi river watershed u s geological survey 1995 and the chesapeake bay regions u s epa 2010 there is a gulf of mexico dead zone created by excess nutrients in agricultural runoff that reached a record 8200 square miles in extent during 2002 u s epa 2019 a number of different techniques have been developed for removing unwanted phosphorus from water these range from biological schemes to chemical agents to sorbents sorption is an attractive water treatment option because of convenience ease of operation simplicity of design and economics provided low cost sorbents are used bhatnagar and sillanp√§√§ 2011 a critical review of processes to remove phosphorus from water using sorption techniques loganathan et al 2014 cites studies based on inorganic sorbents metal oxides and hydroxides calcium and magnesium carbonates and hydroxides layered double hydroxides organic sorbents activated carbon anion exchange resins and industrial by products they report maximum removal efficiencies in batch studies of 23 mg g with granulated ferric hydroxide at ph 5 5 and 14 mg g with activated aluminum oxide at ph 5 5 an alternative way to remove the phosphorus is a biological lagoon where a carefully managed ecosystem consumes the phosphorus before it can get into surface waters maiga et al 2017 many municipalities have added enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in tertiary wastewater treatment facilities in which polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao are selectively enriched in the bacterial community within the activated sludge metcalf and eddy 2003 the biomass is subsequently settled out the sludge often used in creating fertilizer ingredients ebpr is capable of meeting an effluent release target of 1 mg l the basis of the phosphate removal scheme described here is the affinity between trivalent ferric ion fe3 and phosphate in the environment phosphate is usually a limiting nutrient because is locked in solid form as ferric phosphate fepo4 s which has a ksp of 4 10 27 thus ferric phosphate s solubility is 6 3 10 14 m harris 2011 sylhet sand s golden color is due to its relatively high ferric ion content the presence of fe3 in oxidized sediment has already been proven useful for removal of arsenic in bangladesh ahmed et al 2004 and stollenwerk et al 2007 rice hull ash is not necessarily high in ferric ion but it can easily be treated with fecl3 while other research has used rice hulls as a sorbent ahmaruzzaman and gupta 2011 the use of a fecl3 enhancement for the specific removal of phosphate has not previously been reported a suitable sorbent for phosphate removal should not only have high phosphate sorption capacity and cost effectiveness but should also be amenable to easy desorption of the sorbed phosphate this allows regeneration of the sorbent a series of experiments was performed to evaluate how reversible the sorption process was finally an ideal phosphate removal procedure should allow for the ultimate recovery of the phosphate residues for use as fertilizer feed stock de bashana and bashan 2004 once the sorbed phosphate had been removed from the sand and rice hull ash sorbent materials its reprecipitation as a phosphate salt was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sorbent materials the sorbent materials were obtained locally in bangladesh fig 1 the sands were collected from the sylhet district located in the northwest rice husks were received from dinajpur district rice mills in the northeast the sorbents were preserved in a dry condition until prepared for sorption studies prior to use the sylhet sand was washed 3 to 4 times in distilled water and 0 10 m hcl the washed sand was then dried in a 60 c oven for 24 h the rice hulls were also washed 3 to 4 times in distilled water then washed with 0 10 m sulfuric acid it was oven dried for 24 h at 60 c after drying the rice hulls were burned in ambient air finally the rice hulls were transferred to a different crucible and calcined at 600 c in a muffle furnace for 6 h to remove volatiles in the sample fig 2 because the presence of iron in sylhet sand seemed likely to be the basis of its efficacy de bashan and bashan 2004 rice hull ash material was treated with 1 m fecl3 and oven dried 2 2 5 ppm phosphate stock solution orthophosphate is soluble and considered to be the only type of p that is directly assimilated by most plants including algae loganathan et al 2014 thus a phosphate test solution was made by dissolving 2 195 g of anhydrous potassium monobasic phosphate kh2po4 in 100 ml of distilled water this is 5000 ppm phosphate as p serial dilution by a factor of 1000 gave a final phosphate test solution that is 5 ppm po4 as p the ph was adjusted to a target value using hcl or naoh during the dilution process 2 3 stannous chloride method molybdophosphoric acid is formed and reduced by stannous chloride to intensely colored molybdenum blue this method is quite sensitive and makes feasible measurements down to 0 01 ppm po4 3 as p murphy and riley 1962 sletten and bach 1961 2 3 1 ammonium molybdate reagent a 2 5 g ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o27 4h2o was dissolved in 17 5 ml distilled water next 28 ml of concentrated h2so4 was added to 40 ml of distilled water and cooled to room temperature before adding to the ammonium molybdate solution the solution mixture was diluted to a final volume of 100 ml 2 3 2 stannous chloride reagent b 2 5 g of sncl2 2h2o was dissolved in 100 ml of glycerol by heating in a water bath at 50 c and stirring to hasten dissolution this reagent was stable and required neither preservatives nor special storage conditions 2 3 3 color development with thorough mixing after each addition 4 0 ml of ammonium molybdate reagent a and 0 50 ml of stannous chloride reagent b were added to a sample the rate of color development and intensity of the color depended on temperature of the final solution each 1 c increase caused about a 1 increase in color intensity hence the samples standards and reagents were strictly maintained within 2 c of one another in a temperature range between 20 c and 30 c measurements reported here were conducted at 22 c 2 3 4 color measurement the samples were filtered through 0 45 Œºm syringe filters and analyzed with a shimadzu 1800 uv vis spectrophotometer using the stannous chloride method the absorbance at 690 nm was recorded between 10 and 12 min after mixing the coloring reagents and the samples the same specific time interval was followed for all determinations a calibration curve and reagent blank were used to determine the sample concentration 2 3 5 hach method occasionally for comparative purposes a commercial hach instrument was used on sample runs the dr6000 is a benchtop uv vis instrument 190 1100 nm color developing reagent molybdenum blue boltz and mellon 1947 was added to the phosphate solution a 2 min wait period was established for color development Œª max at 890 nm and then the concentration was recorded as mg l 2 3 6 scanning electron microscope sem the completely air dried samples were put on a conducting carbon strip the sample loaded strip was mounted in a chamber that was evacuated to about 10 3 to 10 4 torr then a very thin platinum layer few nanometers thick was sputtered onto the sample to ensure the conductivity of its surface finally the sample was placed in the main sem chamber jsm 7600f jeol japan to image its surface the microscope was operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 0 kv 2 4 column experiments columns for flow experiments were conducted by placing 2 000 g of rice hull ash rha as an adsorbent in a 10 ml syringe fig 3 the 5 ppm phosphate test solution was run continuously through the column about 50 ml of solution at ph 5 the effluent was collected in a beaker and passed through a 0 45 Œºm pore sized syringe filter the concentration was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer at 690 nm after developing its color with the ammonium molybdate stannous chloride reagents additional 50 ml aliquots of 5 ppm test solution were passed through the column until a breakthrough event was detected all experimental trials were replicated 5 times different concentrations of phosphate test solutions were tried to assess column performance under other conditions finally phosphate was determined in actual samples from the tangua haor 2 5 batch experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted on synthetic waste waters by mixing different amounts of calcined rice hull ash or sylhet sand with 25 ml of synthetic wastewater in 100 ml conical flasks the flasks were installed on a rotary shaker set to 150 rpm at 25 c sorption studies were performed with ph ranging from 4 0 to 10 0 for 10 g of sylhet sand or 2 g of rice hull ash and contact times ranging from 60 to 270 min after sorption the solution was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm syringe filter subsequent tests were conducted on sylhet sand to generate adsorption isotherm data a range of phs from 4 to 7 was used in order to evaluate its effect 2 6 removal efficiency the removal efficiency for either batch or column modes was computed using a standard formula 1 removal efficiency c 0 c e c 0 x 100 where c o is the initial concentration mg l or ppm and c e is the final concentration of phosphate mg l or ppm 2 7 regenerating sorbents phosphate desorption was performed at several ph values in the alkaline region by centrifuging sorbent for several hours maximum desorption was achieved by adjusting the solution to a ph of 7 0 8 0 and centrifuging the sorbent at 1200 rpm for 12 h the supernatant was then withdrawn and subjected to the color development procedure 2 8 phosphate recovery phosphate was precipitated from the supernatant solution as fepo4 by adding fecl3 3 results and discussion 3 1 rice hull ash and 5 ppm test solution the initial removal efficiency of the rice hull ash syringe columns was determined for both the untreated and fe treated sorbents a 50 0 ml aliquot of the 5 ppm test solution was passed through a 2 000 g bed of untreated rice hull ash the original test solution and eluent were filtered and treated for color development before measurement by the uv vis spectrophotometer their absorbances of 0 351 before and 0 166 after represented a reduction of 52 8 in the phosphate level fig 4 in a subsequent trial 2 000 g of the fecl3 treated rice hull ash was packed into a syringe column again 50 0 ml of the 5 ppm phosphate test solution was passed through the sorbent bed the effluent was collected in a beaker filtered with a 0 45 Œºm pore sized filter and subjected to color development using the stannous chloride method with the absorbance measured at 690 nm the test solution again measured 0 351 standard units while that of the fe treated hull effluent was 0 076 this represents a substantial increase in the removal efficiency 78 5 nearly half again better than the untreated rice hull ash 3 2 sylhet sand and 5 ppm test solution the large grain size of sylhet sand precluded syringe column experiments the size of pores in the sand bed was too large to allow sufficient retention time for sorption thus sylhet sands were assessed only with batch experiments contact times during a run were varied between 1 and 3 h as expected maximal removal was achieved with the 3 h period measured absorbances for the test solution were 0 351 before and 0 177 afterwards thus 49 6 of the phosphate was removed of the two potential sorbents the fe treated rice hull ash had a higher percent removal efficiency than the sylhet sand this may simply be a manifestation of the surface area of sorbent that is available to the test solution the rice hull ash had a much smaller grain size than the sylhet sand as revealed by scanning electron microscopy this is evident in the two images shown in fig 5 note that the magnification on panel a is 500 and that on panel b is x50 even with the greater magnification the rice hull ash displays smaller particles this indicates a significant increase in surface area for sorption in the rice hull ash bed 3 3 effect of sorbent contact time optimal conditions for removal were evaluated with a series of batch experiments that employed 10 0 g of sylhet sand and contact times of 1 4 5 h duration the sorbent was mixed with 25 ml of both a 1 ppm and a 5 ppm phosphate test solution the conical flasks were installed on a rotary shaker set to 150 rpm at 25 c the results indicated that optimal conditions were achieved with a contact time of 3 h fig 6 beyond that the removal efficiency dropped off to a fairly steady level of 38 this suggests that the optimal sorption level is not achieved under equilibrium conditions there must be some kinetic impediment for desorption that requires the longer contact period 3 4 effect of ph on removal efficiency a set of experiments examined the effect of ph on removal efficiency with a second series of batch studies again 25 0 ml of 5 ppm phosphate test solution was used but the ph was adjusted beforehand with hcl or naoh to a range of 4 0 10 0 then 10 0 g samples of sylhet sand were added and the flasks containing the mixture were installed on the rotary shaker for 3 h as previously described the percentage removal efficiencies are shown in fig 7 the highest removal efficiencies were obtained at a ph range of 4 0 5 0 and at contact times of 3 h the sorption studies indicated that a ph of 4 5 was optimal for phosphate removal this is explained by noting that at ph 5 the predominant phosphate species will be h2po4 fig 8 the three acid dissociation constants pkas for the h3po4 system are 2 148 7 199 and 12 15 respectively harris 2011 if the ph is too much lower than 4 the species distribution shifts towards the uncharged h3po4 form with no charge there is no electrostatic attraction to make it attach to the surface at higher phs the increasing amount of oh in solution begins to compete with the phosphate species because fe3 was correlated with good removal efficiencies the presence of higher oh with increasing ph will block access to these binding sites for h2po4 ions oh is a stronger complexing ligand than the dihydrogen phosphate an indication of this is that subjecting the materials after they had sorbed phosphate to a solution of ph 7 0 8 0 was effective in causing the phosphate to desorb essentially the oh was binding more tightly than h2po4 2 and considerably less labile once attached the optimal sorption time of 3 h is interesting this was observed in earlier studies on phosphate removal shukla et al 2019 they too found that there was an initial higher sorption peak before settling in to a lower equilibrium level they suggested the enhanced early adsorption could be due to phosphate levels in the solution that overwhelm the mass transfer process occurring between the sorbent surface and the bulk solution not only was this drop off in removal efficiency seen in the time studies of fig 6 but also in the ph study of fig 7 3 5 adsorption isotherms a series of experiments was conducted to investigate the sorption characteristics of the sylhet sand in each case a series of batches was set up for which increasing amounts of po4 3 in solution was placed in contact with 10 g of sorbent for a 48 h period this was done to promote equilibrium conditions between the sorbent bed and solution phase the temperature was maintained throughout at 25 c three different models were fit to the data 1 a classical langmuir adsorption isotherm langmuir 1918 2 a modified temkin isotherm temkin and pyzhev 1940 and 3 a linear model table 1 holds the data used to generate the curve fits that appear in fig 9 the batch data did not follow a classical langmuir isotherm eq 2 very well values of theta Œ∏ were computed using the data for 7 mg l po4 3 to represent the point of maximum surface coverage a k eq of 0 278 was computed for the initial point where po4 3 was minimal such that k eq Œ∏ with these parameters the Œ∏ computed from the langmuir equation never exceeded 0 73 2 Œ∏ k e q p o 4 3 1 k e q p o 4 3 a better fit was achieved by using a modified version of the temkin equation eq 3 this model takes into account interactions that may occur between the adsorbate and the surface to which it is attracted temkin noted experimentally that strength of sorption tended to increase with increasing surface coverage the line generated here was based on eq 3 3 Œ∏ a Œ∏ k e q p o 4 3 1 k e q p o 4 3 where the coefficient a varies directly with Œ∏ the fit shown here was achieved with a 1 15 and k eq 1 1 it consistently under estimates the value of Œ∏ before site saturation is achieved but its overall shape follows the data quite well the best fit to the data was managed by using a simple linear adsorption model until surface saturation was reached in this regard it is similar to henry s law henry 1803 applied to adsorption from the liquid phase the pre saturation values were computed using the linear regression equation determined from po4 3 values of 0 06 4 mg l i e 4 Œ∏ 0 2214 po 4 3 0 0266 once the amount of po4 3 removed became constant at 5 mg l a value of Œ∏ 1 was used additional isotherm studies were performed at ph values of 4 6 and 7 the ph 7 trace is close to the conditions of the ambient waters 6 7 7 2 found in the haors during the 2017 hazardous algal bloom event there was very little difference in the behavior of the sylhet sand adsorbent with these fluctuations in ph the linear pre saturation portions of the isotherms for all four phs plotted almost on top of one another fig 10 linear regression trend lines for the pre saturation portions of the isotherms yielded slopes of 0 2015 at ph 4 0 2214 at ph 5 0 1964 at ph 6 and 0 2015 at ph 7 as confirmed in earlier studies slightly higher Œ∏ values were observed at ph 5 compared to the other three before the adsorbent became saturated but when expressed as removal for the 5 mg l po4 3 test solution the 54 removal at ph 4 was slightly better than 51 at ph 6 50 at ph 5 and 47 at ph 7 at all ph values there were small variations in Œ∏ as the amount of sylhet sand was increased beyond 5 mg l this can be attributed to measurement errors caused by high levels of po4 3 in the unadsorbed solution phase these concentrations were so high for the analytical method used to measure it that there was an inherent higher degree of uncertainty in the measured values electronic shot noise in the detector becomes more significant in uv vis determinations under these circumstances the trend in the variations becomes more pronounced as the amount of adsorbent increases 3 6 flow studies on sylhet sand columns studies were undertaken to assess how useful sylhet sand would be in flow applications columns with a 10 ml capacity were packed with 8 g of washed syhlet sand then a 1 ppm po4 3 test solution at ph 5 was passed through it under four different flow regimes the removals achieved in each instance are listed in table 2 even when the flow was restricted to 0 5 ml min there was only 14 removal this suggests that flow applications with sylhet sand sorption beds are impractical 3 7 recovery of phosphate from sorbents when measured spectrophotometrically at 690 nm the supernatant solutions indicated 42 9 of the phosphate had desorbed from the rice hull ash and 71 6 had desorbed from sylhet sand 3 8 phosphate recovery by precipitation phosphate was recovered from the supernatant solution as fepo4 by adding fecl3 for a 2 0 g sample of fe treated rice hull ash 0 137 mg of phosphate as p was sorbed and 0 045 mg recovered or 32 8 for a 10 0 g sample of sylhet sand 0 125 mg of phosphate as p was sorbed and 0 093 mg recovered or 74 4 3 9 tangua haor water sample after evaluating the sorbents on the 5 ppm synthetic solutions a real sample of water from the tangua haor was tested that contained 0 06 ppm phosphate as p note that the toxic water conditions were substantially less than the test solutions with which the sorbents were challenged it was collected following the april 2017 flood events that led to a hazardous algal bloom more than 1200 tonnes of fish died as a result the main factor leading to the algal bloom was shown to be elevated phosphate contents both tests on tangua haor water were performed in the batch mode in the first 2 000 g of fe treated rice hull ash were mixed with 25 ml of the haor sample in 100 ml conical flasks the flasks were installed on a rotary shaker for 3 h and set to 150 rpm at 25 c the initial 0 06 ppm haor sample displayed an absorbance of 0 053 before the run and an absorbance of 0 009 afterwards this corresponds to a removal efficiency of 83 8 for the second experiment 10 0 g of sylhet sand were mixed with 25 ml of the haor sample for a 3 h period on the shaker following the contact period the sample was filtered and measured using the commercial hach test kit the before sample was 0 06 ppm and the after sample was 0 01 ppm this represents an 83 removal efficiency nicely comparable to the treated rice hull ash 4 conclusions preliminary investigations have been performed on two potential materials for removing excess phosphates from agricultural runoff in bangladesh they offer cost effective means to develop methods using locally available materials that could help prevent the occurrence of harmful algal blooms such as that experienced in the april 2017 floods of the haor regions when tested on an actual haor sample from that incident 83 of the phosphate was removed with a single exposure to either the fe treated rice hull ash or the sylhet sand luckily the po4 3 levels that created that algal bloom situation are far below the test solutions that challenged the capacity of the sorbent beds the overall removal capacities of the two sorbent materials were 2 37 Œºg g rice hull ash and 0 475 Œºg g sylhet sand this ratio of about 5 to 1 is reflected in the quantities of sorbents that were used in this series of experiments i e 2 0 g of rice hull ash vs 10 0 g of sylhet sand while the rice hull ash has a higher capacity per gram it requires a more elaborate preparation procedure plus treatment with fecl3 rice hull ash also has seasonal availability issues the ashing and calcining steps require the net input of an energy source finally fecl3 treatment adds an additional cost fecl3 of sufficient quality would probably have to be acquired from out of country sources the sylhet sand on the other hand is available in much larger quantities has no seasonality to its acquisition and needs only to be quarried and washed prior to use this makes it the more attractive option to pursue for development at this juncture luckily the sylhet sand s sorption character did not seem to vary much with ph in the range of ambient haor conditions thus no ph adjustment would be needed in using it in field applications the batch studies of sylhet sand to measure its capacity and isotherm behavior were done without any potential interfering species other common anions found in surface waters e g sulfate chlorate hydrogen carbonate and nitrate are much weaker in their interactions with fe3 than phosphate this is reflected in the ksp for iron iii phosphate that is listed at 4 10 27 harris 2011 no other fe3 salts are included in typical ksp compilations except fe oh 3 that becomes problematic at higher phs another category potential interferents in real world samples is humic substances at the ambient ph of haor waters this would be restricted to the fulvic acid fraction these are larger organic ligands that would have more difficulty in finding and saturating the sorption sites on sylhet sand because we tested the sylhet sand with an actual sample from the tangua haor and were able to remove 83 8 of the po4 3 it appears the sorbent will work under the actual conditions for which it is designed given that sylhet sand appears to offer the best opportunity for development applications need to be designed with a batch mode in mind the sand was too coarse and packed too loosely to allow for much contact time between the phosphate containing solutions and the sorbent bed under free flow conditions essentially no po4 3 was retained perhaps a beginning strategy to attempt is the construction of some overflow cells next to each rice paddy the paddies could be flushed after fertilizer applications such that the excess phosphate could be removed by mesh bags containing sylhet sand the sorption capacity of the sand is two orders of magnitude larger than the paddy effluent so it could be used over a number of batches following use the sorbent could be regenerated it appears that the sorbents can be at least partially regenerated for future use and that the phosphate can be recaptured as an input for fertilizer production working out the details of how to best implement the application of these materials to a feasible control program and resource recovery system yet remains acknowledgments this project was partially funded by a grant nsu rp 18 026 from north south

agricultural purposes in many regions of the world is a problem not only due to over exploitation of underground resources but also contamination of groundwater aquifers subba rao et al 2012 bouderbala et al 2016 al abadi 2017 adimalla et al 2018 adimalla 2019a b rezaei et al 2019a subba rao and chaudhary 2019 subba rao et al 2019 public awareness of quality of water is being increased everywhere due to its direct effect on the human health both biological and chemical pollutants e g nitrate phosphates heavy metals and organic compounds in drinking and agricultural water can have short and long term health implications sdige and hwang 2009 water quality degradation can turn it into an unusable water resource for human needs and consequently make a negative impact on the environment unethical human involvement and exploitation of the groundwater resources leads to water quality degradation therefore evaluation of water quality is necessary noshadi and ghafourian 2016 assessing and monitoring of water quality often require knowledge of hydrogeochemistry statistics and water quality indices as special tools sustainable management of groundwater resources depends upon the comprehensive understanding of the hydrogeological systems their behavior and interaction and their evolution processes sophocleous 2010 as good water quality is essential to a healthy ecosystem assessment of groundwater is an important aspect of water resource management banerjee and srivastava 2009 monitoring and measuring water quality parameters are key activities in managing the environment it is therefore essential to monitor and assess the groundwater pollution and provide measures to prevent intensification of pollution this assessment is more noticeable in semi arid regions such as iran that experiences water shortage problems given the average annual precipitation being less than one third of the world average razmkhah et al 2010 rezaei et al 2019a assessment of groundwater quality is usually carried out by classifying sampling stations using different methods finding links between water quality variables identifying possible sources of pollution and modeling the contribution of identifying sources to the total contaminant concentration astel et al 2007 bonanno and lo giudice 2010 several studies have highlighted the importance of groundwater hydrochemistry and quality in the vicinity of seasonal lake most of the recent studies are mainly concentrated on identifying groundwater suitability metrics and characterizing contamination sources

defining and prioritizing further investigations and management actions especially in arid regions people in the study area with a semi arid and arid climate and little annual rainfall rely on groundwater reservoirs for various usages in recent years drying hamun e jazmurian seasonal lake can cause salinisation and pollution wastewater irrigation and fertilizers and have a significant effect on groundwater quality from the literature it is concluded that the evaluation of groundwater quality is essential as it is directly related to human health and also provides baseline information for the establishment of long term groundwater monitoring programs for sustainable development of any area in the present research work we have investigated the physicochemical parameters of groundwater such as ph total dissolved solids tds temperature t and electrical conductivity ec in dalgan basin located in southeast iran with a main goal of evaluating the suitability of the groundwater use for agricultural and drinking purposes based on parameters such as sodium percentage na and sodium adsorption ratio sar also the dalgan basin is classified into groundwater quality types on the basis of entropy water quality index ewqi for drinking purpose and water quality index wqi for irrigation purpose assessment of groundwater quality is carried out by using multivariate statistical techniques data envelopment analysis dea and analytic hierarchy process ahp this work will be helpful in the protection and management of groundwater in dalgan basin 2 study area description the study area is located in sistan and baluchestan province of iran fig 1 covering an area of about 580 sq km and with a mean altitude of 400 m above the sea level dalgan is the lowest elevation point in sistan and baluchestan this area is characterized by an arid climate with a mean annual temperature of 28 c the average rainfall amount is less than 100 mm year and there is a very high rate of potential evaporation around of 4400 mm year rezaei et al 2019a the annual potential evaporation in the study area is higher than the average annual precipitation heavy rain has been reported on january 16 2020 a total of 647 sq km of land appear to be flooded in dalgan city based on worldpop population data and the detected surface waters about 2500 people are potentially exposed or living close to flooded areas the volume of rainfall has been unprecedented in the last 40 years the most significant water structure is hamun e jazmurian seasonal lake dalgan is one of the most significant agricultural areas of the region groundwater is mainly used for farming and municipal irrigation and the area is also highly depending on underground resources for drinking purposes as irrigated agriculture is performed on the plain groundwater is widely used so that there exist more than 50 water wells geologically the study area mainly consists from alluvium and lake sediments fig 2 the alluvium deposits recognized here are of four types that include fluvial deposits playa deposits gravel plains and sheet sand huber 1962 presence of sand dunes in this region helps in capturing and evaporating most of the precipitation which in turn makes this basin a no recharge area the groundwater occurrence and movement in the study area are basically controlled by the prevailing morphology according to information from geological investigations the main aquifer was formed in recent alluvial deposits quaternary 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analyses in order to study the hydrochemistry and the assessment of the groundwater quality forty eight representative groundwater samples were collected from different irrigation wells within the study area during the rainy season in a sampling period of june to july 2015 and analyzed for various major ions map of sampling locations is demonstrated in fig 3 that was prepared by using arcgis software the procedure of collecting samples included 10 min of pumping drying cleaning and storing samples in 100 ml polyethylene bottles the samples were then vacuum filtered through a 0 45 Œºm pore size membrane and acidified to a final concentration of about 1 nitric acid as part of heavy metals concentration measurement the collected samples were labeled sealed and transported to the laboratory and preserved in the refrigerator at a temperature of about 4 c until analysis time hydrogen ion activity ph electrical conductance ec temperature t and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ using a multi parameter portable meter hach germany titrimetric method was employed to determine the alkalinity total hardness calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl content while the potassium k and sodium na content were determined using flame photometer at the lab west laboratories australia validity of the analytical ion measurement of all samples was determined by calculating the electrical balance error with the analytical precision and reproducibility measurement being less than 4 3 2 evaluation of groundwater quality for irrigation purposes sodium adsorption ratio sar and na are the main factors that determine the suitability of water for agricultural purposes rezaei and hassani 2017 khangembam and kshetrimayum 2019 sodium concentration is an important criterion in irrigation water classification because sodium reacts with the soil to create sodium hazards by replacing other cations raju 2006 the extent of this replacement is estimated by sar the sar is calculated by the equation hem 1991 1 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 na is another important parameter to indicate the suitability of water for irrigation this term is referred to as soluble sodium percentage or percent sodium na is calculated by eq 2 with concentrations of ions expressed in meq l 2 na n a c a 2 m g 2 n a k 3 3 water quality index wqi the water quality index wqi shows the influence of natural and anthropogenic activities on the quality of water for irrigation purposes based on several key water chemistry parameters batabyal and chakraborty 2015 ahamed et al 2015 first developed by horton 1965 wqi has since been widely used in the evaluation of water quality all over the world adimalla and kumar taloor 2020 wqi is a system of ranking the quality of water in the environment by numerical means for the computation of wqi three steps were followed in the first step each of the parameters has been assigned a weight wi according to its relative importance in the overall quality of water for drinking purposes maximum weight of 5 has been assigned to the parameters like nitrate total dissolved solids chloride sulfate due to their major importance in water quality assessment srinivasamoorthy et al 2009 hardness and phosphate are given the minimum weight of 1 as they play less significant roles in the water quality assessment other parameters like calcium magnesium sodium and potassium were assigned weights of 3 3 4 2 respectively rezaei et al 2017a rezaei et al 2019 in the second step the relative weight wi is computed from the following equation based on their perceived health effects and overall importance in affecting the quality of water tirkey et al 2017 3 w i i 1 m w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight of each parameter and n refers to the number of parameters in the third step a quality rating scale qi for each parameter is assigned by dividing its concentration in each water sample by its respective standard according to the guidelines laid down in the who 2011 and finally the result is multiplied by 100 4 q i c i s i 100 where qi represents the quality rating ci refers to the concentration of each chemical parameter in each sample in mg l and si is the standard limit for each chemical parameter mg l based on the guidelines of the who 2011 in the final step of wqi calculation the sii is first assigned for each chemical parameter and then the sum of si values gives the water quality index for each sample 5 si i w i q i 6 wqi i 1 n si ij where sii represents the sub index of ith parameter qi refers to the rating based on concentration of ith parameter and n is the number of parameters 3 4 entropy water quality index ewqi entropy water quality index ewqi is a comprehensive tool and improved method of water quality index which has widely been used for quantification of water quality for drinking purpose zhou et al 2016 wu et al 2017 su et al 2018 for computing ewqi values following steps should be followed first an entropy weight must be assigned to each parameter jian hua et al 2011 the eigenvalue matrix x eq 7 associated with groundwater quality data for m water samples i 1 2 m and n quality parameters j 1 2 n should be constructed as follows su et al 2018 7 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn then using eq 8 the eigenvalue matrix x is converted into a standard grade matrix y in eq 9 as shown below 8 y ij x ij x ij min x ij max x ij min 9 x y 11 y 12 y 1 n y 21 y 22 y 2 n y m 1 y m 2 y mn then the ratio of index value of the j index and in i sample is 10 p ij y i j i 1 m y ij the information entropy ej of the jth index is calculated by the formula below su et al 2018 11 e j 1 inm i 1 m p ij inp ij the smaller the value of ej the bigger the effect of the j index the entropy weight wj of j parameter can then be calculated using the following equation 12 w j 1 e j i 1 m 1 e j in eq 12 wj is defined as the entropy weight of j parameter after calculation of wj the second step is to assign a quality rating scale qj for each parameter using the following equations 13 q j c j s j 100 where cj is the concentration of each chemical parameters j mg l in each water sample and sj is the permissible limits of the world health organizations who of parameter j in mg l eq 13 ensures that if parameter j is absent in the water the qj is 0 and when the amount of this parameter is just equal to its permissible value the qj is 100 finally ewqi can be computed using eq 14 14 ewqi j 1 m w j q j using ewqi the groundwater quality can be categorized into five types which are excellent rank 1 good rank 2 medium rank 3 poor rank 4 and extremely poor rank 5 water quality types subba rao et al 2019 groundwater with excellent and good water quality is suitable for drinking and will rarely induce health problems medium water quality indicates that some parameters are slightly beyond the corresponding presumable limits and it can still be used for drinking conditionally when the ewqi value is greater than 150 groundwater becomes unsuitable for drinking as some elements are seriously beyond the acceptable limits 3 5 ahp dea model the analytic hierarchy process ahp is famous to be a powerful decision support tool in natural resource management studies bozdag 2015 the ahp is a subjective method for analyzing qualitative criteria to generate a weighing of the operating units saaty has proposed ahp as a decision making method to solve unstructured problems saaty 1996 the analysis of complex decisions involves the evaluation of activities using multiple criteria to determine the best alternative activity multi criteria decision making mcdm tools can support decision makers in this process saaty 1996 yang et al 2008 ustun and anag√ºn 2015 ahp uses pairwise comparison matrices to compare all possible pairs of criteria and determines which criterion has the highest priority using a 1 to 9 scale range where 1 indicates equal importance and 9 indicates highest priority saaty 1987 banai 2010 agarwal et al 2013 data envelopment analysis is an evaluation tool for decision making units dmus which solves many decision making problems by integrating multiple inputs and outputs simultaneously dea is an analytical procedure based on mathematical programming developed by charnes et al 1978 for measuring the relative efficiency of dmus in a set dae is used to access the relative efficiency of dmus after evaluating the groundwater quality a dmu is classified as efficient or inefficient dae method is extensively used in performance evaluation and benchmarking in many organizations banker et al 1984 charnes et al 1994 berg 2010 √ºst√ºn and barbarosoglu 2015 therefore it is also called balanced benchmarking by sherman and zhu 2013 if there are n dmus each with m inputs and s outputs the efficiency score of the dmu o is obtained by solving the model proposed by charnes et al 1978 in the current research work dmus are fourty eight observation wells in dalgan and inputs of the ahp dea model are the three main criteria the goal is to solve the optimization problem formulated by eq 15 and subject to constraints defined in eq 16 and eq 17 15 max Œ∏ 0 v u r 1 s u r y r 0 subject to 16 i 1 m v 1 x i 0 1 17 r 1 s u r y rj i 1 m v i x ij 0 j 1 2 n u r v i 0 where Œ∏ 0 efficiency score of decision making unit 0 n number of dmus s number of outputs m number of inputs o 1 2 n j 1 2 n i 1 2 m r 1 2 s x i j amount of input i utilized by dmu j y r j amount of output r produced by dmu j u r weight given to output r v i weight given to input i eq 16 maintains that the aggregated input of the alternative is equal to 1 while eq 17 ensures that the maximum efficiency of the other alternatives is equal to or less than 1 this model solves the weights needed for the two constraints eq s 16 and 17 the model is then executed for each well alternative and the efficiencies are calculated using ms excel linear solver the ahp and ahp dea models given above were run n times and the relative efficiency scores of all the dmus were calculated in the model each dmu takes input and output weights that maximize its efficiency score a dmu is considered efficient when its efficiency score is one ustun 2015 ustun and anag√ºn 2015 3 6 multivariate statistical analyses statistical methods are very useful and efficient in assessing the quality of water and for communicating the information on overall quality of water tiwari et al 2017 the potential origin of pollution in a groundwater system can be determined by graphical and multivariate statistical methods and modeling approaches many researchers have used multivariate techniques for identification of pollution sources and also for assessment of spatial variations in water quality conditions khound and bhattacharyya 2019 identification of pollutant sources is often determined with the aid of multivariate statistical analysis methods such as correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca which can reveal the relationship between a huge number of variables and explain the correlation among them shrestha and kazama 2007 chen et al 2007 rezaei et al 2019b the correlation matrix analysis cma was carried out to determine the degree of correlation between any two groundwater quality parameters pearson s correlation coefficient was used to analyze the degree of dependency of one parameter to the other strickert et al 2009 4 results and discussion assessment of groundwater quality in the area will make it easier for authorities and decision makers to determine the groundwater quality and recommend most suitable locations for boring wells in the future in this section our goals are to assess hydrogeochemical characteristics of water resources determine the water types identify major hydrogeochemical processes using multivariate statistical analyses focus on the groundwater quality for irrigation and drinking purposes and ranking of wells based on groundwater quality parameters 4 1 physicochemical characteristics of groundwater groundwater samples were collected from forty eight different stations during the year 2015 in order to assess its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes and physicochemical investigation table 1 presents the minimum maximum and the mean for each parameter the world health organization who standards were used as thresholds to compare with the results for the determination of the quality of groundwater the ph values reveal a range of 6 93 8 35 apart from those samples having ph less than 7 0 are acidic and unsuitable for drinking but the range for domestic water is 6 5 8 5 electric conductivity ec varies from 955 to 8510 micro mho cm some of water samples showed high ec values 750 Œºs cm which indicates that water is unsuitable for irrigation because of the negative effect of high ec values on the physical properties of soil and their productivity dinka 2010 total dissolved solid tds is generally used as a measure of water palatability in the study area the tds values ranged from 475 to 4260 mg l with a mean of 2121 1 mg l and the results indicated that 92 of groundwater samples exceeded the permissible limit for drinking purpose water temperature directly affects the availability of dissolved oxygen in the water dalai et al 2002 temperature values of groundwater samples vary from 20 2 c to 32 9 c with a mean of 29 98 c sodium values in groundwater ranged from 124 3 to 2220 mg l fourty one samples had high levels of na exceeding the permissible limit for drinking purposes based on who standards 200 mg l concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were in the ranges of 11 3 510 mg 1 and 2 52 284 1 mg 1 respectively a total of 71 and 34 of the samples exceeded who standard levels concentration of k was quite lower ranging from 0 93 to 63 4 mg l in the dalgan basin higher k levels 12 mg l were observed in the seventeen samples the observed concentration of cl was between 104 and 964 mg l with a mean of 447 8 mg l a total of 71 of the samples were above the threshold for drinking purposes the levels of hco3 in the groundwater samples were between 24 71 and 1010 mg l with a mean of 218 7 mg l results showed that 4 of the groundwater samples had higher levels of hco3 exceeding the permissible limit so4 2 concentrations were from 105 8 to 2000 mg l in the study area a total of 54 of the samples had higher values of who standard the highest ion values are observed in the groundwater flow system close to the seasonal lake hamun e jazmurian 4 2 hydrogeochemical types to understand the hydrochemical evolution piper 1944 introduced the concept of hydrogeochemical types which provide significant information on compositional classes based on major cations and anions in meq l that are presented dominant ions in the groundwater system groundwater samples were plotted in a piper diagram fig 4 to determine the hydrochemically dominant groundwater types in the study area from the piper diagram fig 4 the groundwater type of the study area can be clearly classified as sodium chloride water the anions triangle is dominated by chloride followed by sulfate the results show that the dominant water types close to each other indicating they are of a similar water type closer to the seasonal lake hamun e jazmurian na cl facies were dominant in groundwater the mixing of the jazmurian basin water with the groundwater triggers many chemical reactions such as ion exchange redox reactions sorption dissolution and precipitation rezaei et al 2019a 4 3 groundwater quality classification for irrigation purpose the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes in dalgan basin was assessed using agricultural indices i e salinity hazard sar and na according to the calculated parameters the groundwater can be classified into various classes as shown in table 2 tds is used to describe the salts carried in the irrigation water there is a close relationship between sar values in irrigation water and the extent to which na is absorbed by soils subba 2006 sar contents in the groundwater sampled ranged from 3 13 to 24 43 average 9 22 high na and cl values in groundwater may indicate deep and long term cycle systems therefore it can be concluded that there is a high concentration of ions in the seasonal lake which negatively affects the quality of the groundwater on the other hand sodium ions could naturally exist in water due to some phenomena such as evaporation agricultural and manmade activities and clay weathering in addition ion exchange of sodium and calcium and other cations could cause the high amount of sodium in the water the evaluation of water quality characteristic for irrigation purposes can be investigated by united states salinity laboratory united states salinity laboratory 1954 diagram or wilcox diagram the wilcox diagram based on sar and ec classifies the suitability of water for agricultural purposes in four classes from excellent c1 s1 to unsuitable c4 s4 wilcox 1955 as illustrated in fig 5 most groundwater samples fell into the c4 s2 and c4 s3 classes in the ussl plot 4 of water samples falls in c3 s1 zone indicating high salinity and low sodium water which means that no alkali hazard is expected to have negative effects on the crops but it cannot be used on soils with restricted drainage kumar et al 2007 also 4 of the total samples fall in the c4 s1 zone indicating very high salinity and low alkalinity hazard this can be suitable for plants having good salt tolerance and also restricts their suitability for irrigation especially in soils with restricted drainage mohan et al 2000 subramani et al 2005 about 8 of the total samples fall in the c3 s2 zone indicating water having high salinity and medium sodicity high salinity medium sodicity water cannot be used on fine grained soils with restricted drainage vasanthavigar et al 2010 approximately 87 of samples fall in c4 s1 c4 s2 c4 s3 c4 s4 fields and beyond the limits of the us salinity diagram indicating samples not suitable for irrigation due to very high salinity and medium to very high alkalinity which affects the plant growth nagarajan et al 2010 ravikumar et al 2010 it has also been observed that some samples had high 10 sar values which indicates that high sar containing water can reduce the osmotic action of plants and may interrupt the nutrient absorption process from the water and soil tatawat and chandel 2008 agricultural productivity is directly affected by water salinity and necessary management strategies should be applied if agricultural managers aim to enhance palm production in the dalgan basin it is concluded that overpumping and reduction in supply aquifer in recent decades have caused depletion of aquifers and reduction of groundwater quality 4 4 application of the water quality index and the quality of water for drinking purpose in this section the suitability of groundwater of dalgan basin for human drinking purpose is investigated using wqi wqi approach uses empirical values as the weight of each chemical parameter without many valuable information about groundwater quality table 3 nine physicochemical parameters ph tds chloride bicarbonate sulfate calcium magnesium sodium and potassium obtained from the results of groundwater samples from 48 wells in dalgan basin were used for the computation of water quality index wqi table 4 it is concluded that the groundwater in the dalgan area is polluted and may be used for drinking purposes fig 6 presents the spatial distribution map of the water quality index the results show that the majority of groundwater of dalgan basin fall under medium water quality it also shows that the sampling sites with poor very poor and unsuitable categories coincide with the sites in which groundwater quality criteria are exceeded computed ewqi values and the identified clases are shown in table 5 values of ewqi range from 67 79 to 385 91 with an average of 160 98 which indicate that the quality of groundwater for drinking is mainly good to extremely poor as shown in fig 7 the majority of the groundwater samples are located in medium and poor quality rank 3 and 4 also spatial distribution of ewqi values is presented in fig 8 good water quality type is observed in the center of basin medium water quality type from northwest and southeast parts poor water quality type from northwest and southeast parts and extremely poor water quality type from the southeast part the increase in water quality from excellent to extremely poor types could be due to influences of anthropogenic sources which increase the concentrations of tds mg2 na and cl compared to other chemical parameters subba rao and chaudhary 2019 because there are agricultural activities mainly palm trees in the study area the groundwater quality maps created using the data from wqi and ewqi displayed a distribution close together but by comparing the two methods using the ewqi technique due to simultaneously consider all water quality factors yields more accurate results 4 5 multivariate statistical analyses in this research multivariate statistical analyses including correlation matrix analysis ca and principle component analysis pca for major ions were employed to identify parameters influencing geochemical processes in the aquifer system using spss 21 0 software to better assess the interrelationships among different water quality parameters a pearson correlation was applied table 6 the correlation matrix of the 10 variables was computed using spss software correlation coefficients greater than 0 5 were considered significant the results show strong positive and negative correlations between the physicochemical parameters of the study area it is observed that the ec shows a high positive correlation with tds and a moderate negative correlation with ph suggesting that a low ph value acidic condition favored the dissolution of carbonate minerals the existence of a moderate positive correlation of na and cl 0 715 and weak positive correlation between ca2 and mg2 0 590 indicates these parameters have mixed sources of the origin that these two parameters are water hardness factors bodrud doza et al 2016 the relationship between na and cl has been used to identify the process that controls the salinity and saline intrusion in arid and semiarid areas singh et al 2005 also strong and positive correlation between cl and na ions revealed that the existence of na ions in water is due to dissolution of halite by water yidana 2010 however na and cl ions in the groundwater can come from several sources the negative moderate correlation between ph and ec 0 518 indicated the medium effect of acidity on the dissolved content of the water the strong correlation between ec and tds 0 99 can be due to ions in tds that conduct electricity the moderate correlation between mg2 and cl 0 62 can be as a result of domestic waste water entering groundwater in this area also strong and positive correlation between ions of mg2 and so4 2 0 82 can be emanated by the use of organic and chemical fertilizers in agricultural activities in the study area raju et al 2015 declared that the strong correlation between these ions might be derived from mg sulfate mineral weathering pca was performed on a groundwater dataset consisting of 48 observations and 10 physicochemical parameters the pca results for physicochemical variables in the groundwater of the dalgan area are given in table 7 the varimax rotation procedure was applied to principal components pcs with kaiser s criterion according to the selection criteria factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 0 before and after rotation were accounted for in this study three principal components pc1 pc2 and pc3 were extracted from groundwater quality parameters it is observed that the first three principal components together account for 85 35 of the total variance in the dataset in which the first principal component is 45 07 the second principal component is 27 09 and the third principal component is 13 18 of the total variance the important point is to find out which variables have high loadings in each component in table 7 variables with loadings greater than 0 6 are marked in bold in the first principal component k na cl mg2 so42 and ca2 parameters have high positive loadings the pc1 was probably caused by groundwater geological medium interaction and natural hydro geochemical evolution of groundwater bencer et al 2016 proposed that when these parameters are gathered in one factor it reflects the effect of natural factors like dissolution of some carbonate dolomitic and evaporate minerals in the groundwater in pc2 tds and ec are the dominant parameters this factor explained the effect of salinity on groundwater quality which was due to weathering and dissolution of evaporitic minerals and also leaching of fertilizers from agricultural areas the third factor with 13 18 of the total variance included hco3 the concentration of hco3 of groundwater are the results of the reaction of soil co2 with the dissolution of silicate minerals krantzberg et al 2010 4 6 evaluating the groundwater quality and ranking based on ahp and ahp dea methods in this research work we have applied the analytic hierarchy process ahp and data envelopment dea model to weight the relative preferences of groundwater quality dea is a popular technique for measuring the relative efficiency of a set of decision making units dmus dmus refer to the 48 irrigation wells being evaluated in the study area the evaluation of groundwater quality was performed in three main stages the first stage involved the implementation of the standard ahp method a well designed questionnaire was administered to 10 experts who were asked to rank the 48 irrigation wells in the study area an ahp based pairwise comparison is used to evaluate irrigation wells for groundwater quality the experts compared these irrigation wells alternatives according to the 3 criteria group1 2 and 3 and 8 sub criteria group 1 temperature ph and ec group2 chloride sodium and sulfate group 3 sar and na each criterion relies on different measured parameters and reflects a different aspect of water quality they need to be given weights in other words we asked each dmu as a decision maker to compare the relative importance of inputs outputs and each dmu constructs its pairwise comparison judgment matrix based on the best weights produced according to a dea model then the relative weights from pairwise comparisons of the ahp hierarchy were calculated taking the principal right eigenvector of relevant matrix the results of this study were found consistent since the inconsistency ratio of all pairwise comparisons was less than 0 1 the second stage of evaluation in the study was the implementation of the ahp dea model which resulted in a different water quality index and groundwater quality map the values obtained from the ahp implementation in the first stage were used as the inputs of the ahp dea model according to the same three criteria Œ∏ Œ≥ and Œ≤ since all observation wells were assumed to produce the same amount of water for each dmu the output of the model was taken as 1 the inputs of the ahp dea model were defined as follows Œ∏ 1 group 1 criteria weights obtained from the ahp model Œ≥ 1 group 2 criteria weights which is obtained from ahp model Œ≤ 1 group 3 criteria weights which is obtained from ahp model for ahp based approach pairwise comparison of qualitative data is made to quantify the judgments made the pairwise comparison matrix is aggregated using the eigenvector method to determine the weights of each alternative the objective is to maximize the efficiency of the well relative to other well the model is executed for each well to determine their efficiencies after the model construction the model was executed for each well alternative and the efficiencies were calculated using ms excel linear solver using this model the efficiency score of each dmu was calculated each run had negligible computational time and since the model is linear the solution was guaranteed a global optimum the groundwater quality index value is evaluated on a scale of 0 1 where a value of 1 indicates that the dmu is relatively efficient and a value less than 1 indicates that the dmu is inefficient cooper et al 2000 the screening process was completed by selecting the well with efficiency equal to one while a groundwater quality index value of less than one means that another well may be better table 8 illustrates the results of the ahp dea model according to these results there were 7 relatively efficient dmus with a groundwater quality index value of 1 the other observation wells were considered inefficient since their groundwater quality index value was lower than 1 the groundwater quality index value ranged from 0 402 to 1 based on groundwater quality index values the drinking water source areas were classified as excellent 4 good 17 permissible 31 and unsuitable 48 groundwater quality was considered unsuitable when the groundwater quality index value was lower than 0 7 as observed in the northwestern and southeastern parts of the study area the last stage in the study was to assess the spatial distribution of groundwater quality using data obtained by the ahp dea models in this research work the groundwater quality map was constructed using the results obtained from the ahp dea models the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality was modeled using ordinary kriging interpolation method fig 9 this map can be used as a tool for environmental decision making process the groundwater quality map shows that high groundwater quality was observed in the central parts of the study area where groundwater quality index value were greater than 0 8 twelve samples were not suitable for agricultural irrigation due to very high sodium and salinity levels furthermore eleven samples were not potable because of their very high salinity and medium sodium levels this study shows how to determine the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality and identify the impact of hydrogeochemical processes on the groundwater quality in the study area comparison of the obtained results shows that the ranking and prioritization of groundwater wells are in accordance with classical methods e g wqi ewqi in the study area the affected parameters in the ahp dea models were very suitable for determining the water quality index of each well and finally prioritizing it the results of the study indicated that groundwater quality index values are useful and reliable indices and can be used to determine the groundwater quality of any region this will also reduce the disease risks of people coming into contact with contaminated groundwater 5 conclusion in this study groundwater quality evaluated using physicochemical data statistical methods wqi and ewqi indexes and ahp dea method the results obtained from statistical analysis and piper diagram indicated that cation predominance in groundwater was in the following order na ca2 mg2 k and the predominance of anions was so4 2 hco3 cl the na cl groundwater type was dominant water types due closer to the seasonal lake hamun e jazmurian the computed wqi and ewqi values have shown that the quality of groundwater for drinking was good to extremely poor by comparing the two methods the ewqi technique showed more accurate results ca and pca were successfully applied to assess the groundwater quality and identify hydrogeochemical processes groundwater contamination is defined by high levels of sulfate sodium and calcium concentrations sourced from rock water interaction as well as wastewater irrigation infiltration and recharge significant so4 2 and na concentrations were linked to agricultural pollution by wastewater irrigation and agricultural fertilizers the results indicate good agreement between the results from the groundwater quality indexes and statistical methods according to ahp dea results there were 7 relatively efficient dmus with a groundwater good quality index integration of the groundwater quality maps showed the high groundwater quality in the central parts of the study area thus agricultural activities and salinisation of groundwater were the major contributing factors to groundwater pollutants in the study area degradation of groundwater quality and increased salinity are due to simultaneous occurrence of droughts and excessive pumping of groundwater resources the findings of this study can be applied to ensure the quality of groundwater used for drinking and irrigation purposes in any region thus there is a need to protect groundwater resources by following preventive measures to control the contamination declaration of competing interest regular monitoring the water quality to prevent further deterioration of water resources acknowledgements the authors would like

focuses on dalgan basin in southeast iran with the objectives of monitoring and assessment of physicochemical parameters ph ec tds and t cations k na ca2 and mg2 major anions cl hco3 and so4 2 and calculation of groundwater quality indexes wqi and ewqi for irrigation and drinking purposes in this research we also prioritize the wells based on the groundwater quality index using the analytic hierarchy process and data envelopment analysis ahp dea model use of multivariate statistical techniques including correlation analysis ca and principal component analysis pca indicated that geogenic i e interaction of water rock climatic conditions high evaporation and anthropogenic i e agricultural fertilizer sources are responsible for variation in physicochemical parameters in groundwater of the study area the results of the study showed that the simultaneous use of these methods and indicators is very effective and suitable in determining groundwater quality and prioritizing wells of any region keywords physicochemical parameter entropy water quality index data envelopment analysis multivariate statistical analysis dalgan 1 introduction availability of groundwater for drinking and agricultural purposes in many regions of the world is a problem not only due to over exploitation of underground resources but also contamination of groundwater aquifers subba rao et al 2012 bouderbala et al 2016 al abadi 2017 adimalla et al 2018 adimalla 2019a b rezaei et al 2019a subba rao and chaudhary 2019 subba rao et al 2019 public awareness of quality of water is being increased everywhere due to its direct effect on the human health both biological and chemical pollutants e g nitrate phosphates heavy metals and organic compounds in drinking and agricultural water can have short and long term health implications sdige and hwang 2009 water quality degradation can turn it into an unusable water resource for human needs and consequently make a negative impact on the environment unethical human involvement and exploitation of the groundwater resources leads to water quality degradation therefore evaluation of water quality is necessary noshadi and ghafourian 2016 assessing and monitoring of water quality often require knowledge of hydrogeochemistry statistics and water quality indices as special tools sustainable management of groundwater resources depends upon the comprehensive understanding of the hydrogeological systems their behavior and interaction and their evolution processes sophocleous 2010 as good water quality is essential to a healthy ecosystem assessment of groundwater is an important aspect of water resource management banerjee and srivastava 2009 monitoring and measuring water quality parameters are key activities in managing the environment it is therefore essential to monitor and assess the groundwater pollution and provide measures to prevent intensification of pollution this assessment is more noticeable in semi arid regions such as iran that experiences water shortage problems given the average annual precipitation being less than one third of the world average razmkhah et al 2010 rezaei et al 2019a assessment of groundwater quality is usually carried out by classifying sampling stations using different methods finding links between water quality variables identifying possible sources of pollution and modeling the contribution of identifying sources to the total contaminant concentration astel et al 2007 bonanno and lo giudice 2010 several studies have highlighted the importance of groundwater hydrochemistry and quality in the vicinity of seasonal lake most of the recent studies are mainly concentrated on identifying groundwater suitability metrics and characterizing contamination sources all over the world these studies have evaluated the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater controlling factors of chemical composition and mechanism of groundwater quality variation using a combination of water quality indices wqis multivariate statistical approaches and analytic hierarchy process ahp methods hayaty et al 2014 kavurmaci and √ºst√ºn 2016 barzegar et al 2016 rezaei et al

2020 in recent years complex decision analysis techniques such as ahp and data envelopment analysis dea have been developed and used to evaluate the water quality and determine wqi jha et al 2010 pourghasemi et al 2012 do et al 2013 tirkey et al 2013 jeihouni et al 2014 application of mathematical tools in such assessments is an important aid in integrating multiple measured variables and defining and prioritizing further investigations and management actions especially in arid regions people in the study area with a semi arid and arid climate and little annual rainfall rely on groundwater reservoirs for various usages in recent years drying hamun e jazmurian seasonal lake can cause salinisation and pollution wastewater irrigation and fertilizers and have a significant effect on groundwater quality from the literature it is concluded that the evaluation of groundwater quality is essential as it is directly related to human health and also provides baseline information for the establishment of long term groundwater monitoring programs for sustainable development of any area in the present research work we have investigated the physicochemical parameters of groundwater such as ph total dissolved solids tds temperature t and electrical conductivity ec in dalgan basin located in southeast iran with a main goal of evaluating the suitability of the groundwater use for agricultural and drinking purposes based on parameters such as sodium percentage na and sodium adsorption ratio sar also the dalgan basin is classified into groundwater quality types on the basis of entropy water quality index ewqi for drinking purpose and water quality index wqi for irrigation purpose assessment of groundwater quality is carried out by using multivariate statistical techniques data envelopment analysis dea and analytic hierarchy process ahp this work will be helpful in the protection and management of groundwater in dalgan basin 2 study area description the study area is located in sistan and baluchestan province of iran fig 1 covering an area of about 580 sq km and with a mean altitude of 400 m above the sea level dalgan is the lowest elevation point in sistan and baluchestan this area is characterized by an arid climate with a mean annual temperature of 28 c the average rainfall amount is less than 100 mm year and there is a very high rate of potential evaporation around of 4400 mm year rezaei et al 2019a the annual potential evaporation in the study area is higher than the average annual precipitation heavy rain has been reported on january 16 2020 a total of 647 sq km of land appear to be flooded in dalgan city based on worldpop population data and the detected surface waters about 2500 people are potentially exposed or living close to flooded areas the volume of rainfall has been unprecedented in the last 40 years the most significant water structure is hamun e jazmurian seasonal lake dalgan is one of the most significant agricultural areas of the region groundwater is mainly used for farming and municipal irrigation and the area is also highly depending on underground resources for drinking purposes as irrigated agriculture is performed on the plain groundwater is widely used so that there exist more than 50 water wells geologically the study area mainly consists from alluvium and lake sediments fig 2 the alluvium deposits recognized here are of four types that include fluvial deposits playa deposits gravel plains and sheet sand huber 1962 presence of sand dunes in this region helps in capturing and evaporating most of the precipitation which in turn makes this basin a no recharge area the groundwater occurrence and movement in the study area are basically controlled by the prevailing morphology according to information from geological investigations the main aquifer was formed in recent alluvial deposits quaternary 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analyses in order to study the hydrochemistry and the assessment of the groundwater quality forty eight representative groundwater samples were collected from different irrigation wells within the study area during the rainy season in a sampling period of june to july 2015 and analyzed for various major ions map of sampling locations is demonstrated in fig 3 that was prepared by using arcgis software the procedure of collecting samples included 10 min of pumping drying cleaning and storing samples in 100 ml polyethylene bottles the samples were then vacuum filtered through a 0 45 Œºm pore size membrane and acidified to a final concentration of about 1 nitric acid as part of heavy metals concentration measurement the collected samples were labeled sealed and transported to the laboratory and preserved in the refrigerator at a temperature of about 4 c until analysis time hydrogen ion activity ph electrical conductance ec temperature t and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ using a multi parameter portable meter hach germany titrimetric method was employed to determine the alkalinity total hardness calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl content while the potassium k and sodium na content were determined using flame photometer at the lab west laboratories australia validity of the analytical ion measurement of all samples was determined by calculating the electrical balance error with the analytical precision and reproducibility measurement being less than 4 3 2 evaluation of groundwater quality for irrigation purposes sodium adsorption ratio sar and na are the main factors that determine the suitability of water for agricultural purposes rezaei and hassani 2017 khangembam and kshetrimayum 2019 sodium concentration is an important criterion in irrigation water classification because sodium reacts with the soil to create sodium hazards by replacing other cations raju 2006 the extent of this replacement is estimated by sar the sar is calculated by the equation hem 1991 1 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 na is another important parameter to indicate the suitability of water for irrigation this term is referred to as soluble sodium percentage or percent sodium na is calculated by eq 2 with concentrations of ions expressed in meq l 2 na n a c a 2 m g 2 n a k 3 3 water quality index wqi the water quality index wqi shows the influence of natural and anthropogenic activities on the quality of water for irrigation purposes based on several key water chemistry parameters batabyal and chakraborty 2015 ahamed et al 2015 first developed by horton 1965 wqi has since been widely used in the evaluation of water quality all over the world adimalla and kumar taloor 2020 wqi is a system of ranking the quality of water in the environment by numerical means for the computation of wqi three steps were followed in the first step each of the parameters has been assigned a weight wi according to its relative importance in the overall quality of water for drinking purposes maximum weight of 5 has been assigned to the parameters like nitrate total dissolved solids chloride sulfate due to their major importance in water quality assessment srinivasamoorthy et al 2009 hardness and phosphate are given the minimum weight of 1 as they play less significant roles in the water quality assessment other parameters like calcium magnesium sodium and potassium were assigned weights of 3 3 4 2 respectively rezaei et al 2017a rezaei et al 2019 in the second step the relative weight wi is computed from the following equation based on their perceived health effects and overall importance in affecting the quality of water tirkey et al 2017 3 w i i 1 m w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight of each parameter and n refers to the number of parameters in the third step a quality rating scale qi for each parameter is assigned by dividing its concentration in each water sample by its respective standard according to the guidelines laid down in the who 2011 and finally the result is multiplied by 100 4 q i c i s i 100 where qi represents the quality rating ci refers to the concentration of each chemical parameter in each sample in mg l and si is the standard limit for each chemical parameter mg l based on the guidelines of the who 2011 in the final step of wqi calculation the sii is first assigned for each chemical parameter and then the sum of si values gives the water quality index for each sample 5 si i w i q i 6 wqi i 1 n si ij where sii represents the sub index of ith parameter qi refers to the rating based on concentration of ith parameter and n is the number of parameters 3 4 entropy water quality index ewqi entropy water quality index ewqi is a comprehensive tool and improved method of water quality index which has widely been used for quantification of water quality for drinking purpose zhou et al 2016 wu et al 2017 su et al 2018 for computing ewqi values following steps should be followed first an entropy weight must be assigned to each parameter jian hua et al 2011 the eigenvalue matrix x eq 7 associated with groundwater quality data for m water samples i 1 2 m and n quality parameters j 1 2 n should be constructed as follows su et al 2018 7 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn then using eq 8 the eigenvalue matrix x is converted into a standard grade matrix y in eq 9 as shown below 8 y ij x ij x ij min x ij max x ij min 9 x y 11 y 12 y 1 n y 21 y 22 y 2 n y m 1 y m 2 y mn then the ratio of index value of the j index and in i sample is 10 p ij y i j i 1 m y ij the information entropy ej of the jth index is calculated by the formula below su et al 2018 11 e j 1 inm i 1 m p ij inp ij the smaller the value of ej the bigger the effect of the j index the entropy weight wj of j parameter can then be calculated using the following equation 12 w j 1 e j i 1 m 1 e j in eq 12 wj is defined as the entropy weight of j parameter after calculation of wj the second step is to assign a quality rating scale qj for each parameter using the following equations 13 q j c j s j 100 where cj is the concentration of each chemical parameters j mg l in each water sample and sj is the permissible limits of the world health organizations who of parameter j in mg l eq 13 ensures that if parameter j is absent in the water the qj is 0 and when the amount of this parameter is just equal to its permissible value the qj is 100 finally ewqi can be computed using eq 14 14 ewqi j 1 m w j q j using ewqi the groundwater quality can be categorized into five types which are excellent rank 1 good rank 2 medium rank 3 poor rank 4 and extremely poor rank 5 water quality types subba rao et al 2019 groundwater with excellent and good water quality is suitable for drinking and will rarely induce health problems medium water quality indicates that some parameters are slightly beyond the corresponding presumable limits and it can still be used for drinking conditionally when the ewqi value is greater than 150 groundwater becomes unsuitable for drinking as some elements are seriously beyond the acceptable limits 3 5 ahp dea model the analytic hierarchy process ahp is famous to be a powerful decision support tool in natural resource management studies bozdag 2015 the ahp is a subjective method for analyzing qualitative criteria to generate a weighing of the operating units saaty has proposed ahp as a decision making method to solve unstructured problems saaty 1996 the analysis of complex decisions involves the evaluation of activities using multiple criteria to determine the best alternative activity multi criteria decision making mcdm tools can support decision makers in this process saaty 1996 yang et al 2008 ustun and anag√ºn 2015 ahp uses pairwise comparison matrices to compare all possible pairs of criteria and determines which criterion has the highest priority using a 1 to 9 scale range where 1 indicates equal importance and 9 indicates highest priority saaty 1987 banai 2010 agarwal et al 2013 data envelopment analysis is an evaluation tool for decision making units dmus which solves many decision making problems by integrating multiple inputs and outputs simultaneously dea is an analytical procedure based on mathematical programming developed by charnes et al 1978 for measuring the relative efficiency of dmus in a set dae is used to access the relative efficiency of dmus after evaluating the groundwater quality a dmu is classified as efficient or inefficient dae method is extensively used in performance evaluation and benchmarking in many organizations banker et al 1984 charnes et al 1994 berg 2010 √ºst√ºn and barbarosoglu 2015 therefore it is also called balanced benchmarking by sherman and zhu 2013 if there are n dmus each with m inputs and s outputs the efficiency score of the dmu o is obtained by solving the model proposed by charnes et al 1978 in the current research work dmus are fourty eight observation wells in dalgan and inputs of the ahp dea model are the three main criteria the goal is to solve the optimization problem formulated by eq 15 and subject to constraints defined in eq 16 and eq 17 15 max Œ∏ 0 v u r 1 s u r y r 0 subject to 16 i 1 m v 1 x i 0 1 17 r 1 s u r y rj i 1 m v i x ij 0 j 1 2 n u r v i 0 where Œ∏ 0 efficiency score of decision making unit 0 n number of dmus s number of outputs m number of inputs o 1 2 n j 1 2 n i 1 2 m r 1 2 s x i j amount of input i utilized by dmu j y r j amount of output r produced by dmu j u r weight given to output r v i weight given to input i eq 16 maintains that the aggregated input of the alternative is equal to 1 while eq 17 ensures that the maximum efficiency of the other alternatives is equal to or less than 1 this model solves the weights needed for the two constraints eq s 16 and 17 the model is then executed for each well alternative and the efficiencies are calculated using ms excel linear solver the ahp and ahp dea models given above were run n times and the relative efficiency scores of all the dmus were calculated in the model each dmu takes input and output weights that maximize its efficiency score a dmu is considered efficient when its efficiency score is one ustun 2015 ustun and anag√ºn 2015 3 6 multivariate statistical analyses statistical methods are very useful and efficient in assessing the quality of water and for communicating the information on overall quality of water tiwari et al 2017 the potential origin of pollution in a groundwater system can be determined by graphical and multivariate statistical methods and modeling approaches many researchers have used multivariate techniques for identification of pollution sources and also for assessment of spatial variations in water quality conditions khound and bhattacharyya 2019 identification of pollutant sources is often determined with the aid of multivariate statistical analysis methods such as correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca which can reveal the relationship between a huge number of variables and explain the correlation among them shrestha and kazama 2007 chen et al 2007 rezaei et al 2019b the correlation matrix analysis cma was carried out to determine the degree of correlation between any two groundwater quality parameters pearson s correlation coefficient was used to analyze the degree of dependency of one parameter to the other strickert et al 2009 4 results and discussion assessment of groundwater quality in the area will make it easier for authorities and decision makers to determine the groundwater quality and recommend most suitable locations for boring wells in the future in this section our goals are to assess hydrogeochemical characteristics of water resources determine the water types identify major hydrogeochemical processes using multivariate statistical analyses focus on the groundwater quality for irrigation and drinking purposes and ranking of wells based on groundwater quality parameters 4 1 physicochemical characteristics of groundwater groundwater samples were collected from forty eight different stations during the year 2015 in order to assess its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes and physicochemical investigation table 1 presents the minimum maximum and the mean for each parameter the world health organization who standards were used as thresholds to compare with the results for the determination of the quality of groundwater the ph values reveal a range of 6 93 8 35 apart from those samples having ph less than 7 0 are acidic and unsuitable for drinking but the range for domestic water is 6 5 8 5 electric conductivity ec varies from 955 to 8510 micro mho cm some of water samples showed high ec values 750 Œºs cm which indicates that water is unsuitable for irrigation because of the negative effect of high ec values on the physical properties of soil and their productivity dinka 2010 total dissolved solid tds is generally used as a measure of water palatability in the study area the tds values ranged from 475 to 4260 mg l with a mean of 2121 1 mg l and the results indicated that 92 of groundwater samples exceeded the permissible limit for drinking purpose water temperature directly affects the availability of dissolved oxygen in the water dalai et al 2002 temperature values of groundwater samples vary from 20 2 c to 32 9 c with a mean of 29 98 c sodium values in groundwater ranged from 124 3 to 2220 mg l fourty one samples had high levels of na exceeding the permissible limit for drinking purposes based on who standards 200 mg l concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were in the ranges of 11 3 510 mg 1 and 2 52 284 1 mg 1 respectively a total of 71 and 34 of the samples exceeded who standard levels concentration of k was quite lower ranging from 0 93 to 63 4 mg l in the dalgan basin higher k levels 12 mg l were observed in the seventeen samples the observed concentration of cl was between 104 and 964 mg l with a mean of 447 8 mg l a total of 71 of the samples were above the threshold for drinking purposes the levels of hco3 in the groundwater samples were between 24 71 and 1010 mg l with a mean of 218 7 mg l results showed that 4 of the groundwater samples had higher levels of hco3 exceeding the permissible limit so4 2 concentrations were from 105 8 to 2000 mg l in the study area a total of 54 of the samples had higher values of who standard the highest ion values are observed in the groundwater flow system close to the seasonal lake hamun e jazmurian 4 2 hydrogeochemical types to understand the hydrochemical evolution piper 1944 introduced the concept of hydrogeochemical types which provide significant information on compositional classes based on major cations and anions in meq l that are presented dominant ions in the groundwater system groundwater samples were plotted in a piper diagram fig 4 to determine the hydrochemically dominant groundwater types in the study area from the piper diagram fig 4 the groundwater type of the study area can be clearly classified as sodium chloride water the anions triangle is dominated by chloride followed by sulfate the results show that the dominant water types close to each other indicating they are of a similar water type closer to the seasonal lake hamun e jazmurian na cl facies were dominant in groundwater the mixing of the jazmurian basin water with the groundwater triggers many chemical reactions such as ion exchange redox reactions sorption dissolution and precipitation rezaei et al 2019a 4 3 groundwater quality classification for irrigation purpose the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes in dalgan basin was assessed using agricultural indices i e salinity hazard sar and na according to the calculated parameters the groundwater can be classified into various classes as shown in table 2 tds is used to describe the salts carried in the irrigation water there is a close relationship between sar values in irrigation water and the extent to which na is absorbed by soils subba 2006 sar contents in the groundwater sampled ranged from 3 13 to 24 43 average 9 22 high na and cl values in groundwater may indicate deep and long term cycle systems therefore it can be concluded that there is a high concentration of ions in the seasonal lake which negatively affects the quality of the groundwater on the other hand sodium ions could naturally exist in water due to some phenomena such as evaporation agricultural and manmade activities and clay weathering in addition ion exchange of sodium and calcium and other cations could cause the high amount of sodium in the water the evaluation of water quality characteristic for irrigation purposes can be investigated by united states salinity laboratory united states salinity laboratory 1954 diagram or wilcox diagram the wilcox diagram based on sar and ec classifies the suitability of water for agricultural purposes in four classes from excellent c1 s1 to unsuitable c4 s4 wilcox 1955 as illustrated in fig 5 most groundwater samples fell into the c4 s2 and c4 s3 classes in the ussl plot 4 of water samples falls in c3 s1 zone indicating high salinity and low sodium water which means that no alkali hazard is expected to have negative effects on the crops but it cannot be used on soils with restricted drainage kumar et al 2007 also 4 of the total samples fall in the c4 s1 zone indicating very high salinity and low alkalinity hazard this can be suitable for plants having good salt tolerance and also restricts their suitability for irrigation especially in soils with restricted drainage mohan et al 2000 subramani et al 2005 about 8 of the total samples fall in the c3 s2 zone indicating water having high salinity and medium sodicity high salinity medium sodicity water cannot be used on fine grained soils with restricted drainage vasanthavigar et al 2010 approximately 87 of samples fall in c4 s1 c4 s2 c4 s3 c4 s4 fields and beyond the limits of the us salinity diagram indicating samples not suitable for irrigation due to very high salinity and medium to very high alkalinity which affects the plant growth nagarajan et al 2010 ravikumar et al 2010 it has also been observed that some samples had high 10 sar values which indicates that high sar containing water can reduce the osmotic action of plants and may interrupt the nutrient absorption process from the water and soil tatawat and chandel 2008 agricultural productivity is directly affected by water salinity and necessary management strategies should be applied if agricultural managers aim to enhance palm production in the dalgan basin it is concluded that overpumping and reduction in supply aquifer in recent decades have caused depletion of aquifers and reduction of groundwater quality 4 4 application of the water quality index and the quality of water for drinking purpose in this section the suitability of groundwater of dalgan basin for human drinking purpose is investigated using wqi wqi approach uses empirical values as the weight of each chemical parameter without many valuable information about groundwater quality table 3 nine physicochemical parameters ph tds chloride bicarbonate sulfate calcium magnesium sodium and potassium obtained from the results of groundwater samples from 48 wells in dalgan basin were used for the computation of water quality index wqi table 4 it is concluded that the groundwater in the dalgan area is polluted and may be used for drinking purposes fig 6 presents the spatial distribution map of the water quality index the results show that the majority of groundwater of dalgan basin fall under medium water quality it also shows that the sampling sites with poor very poor and unsuitable categories coincide with the sites in which groundwater quality criteria are exceeded computed ewqi values and the identified clases are shown in table 5 values of ewqi range from 67 79 to 385 91 with an average of 160 98 which indicate that the quality of groundwater for drinking is mainly good to extremely poor as shown in fig 7 the majority of the groundwater samples are located in medium and poor quality rank 3 and 4 also spatial distribution of ewqi values is presented in fig 8 good water quality type is observed in the center of basin medium water quality type from northwest and southeast parts poor water quality type from northwest and southeast parts and extremely poor water quality type from the southeast part the increase in water quality from excellent to extremely poor types could be due to influences of anthropogenic sources which increase the concentrations of tds mg2 na and cl compared to other chemical parameters subba rao and chaudhary 2019 because there are agricultural activities mainly palm trees in the study area the groundwater quality maps created using the data from wqi and ewqi displayed a distribution close together but by comparing the two methods using the ewqi technique due to simultaneously consider all water quality factors yields more accurate results 4 5 multivariate statistical analyses in this research multivariate statistical analyses including correlation matrix analysis ca and principle component analysis pca for major ions were employed to identify parameters influencing geochemical processes in the aquifer system using spss 21 0 software to better assess the interrelationships among different water quality parameters a pearson correlation was applied table 6 the correlation matrix of the 10 variables was computed using spss software correlation coefficients greater than 0 5 were considered significant the results show strong positive and negative correlations between the physicochemical parameters of the study area it is observed that the ec shows a high positive correlation with tds and a moderate negative correlation with ph suggesting that a low ph value acidic condition favored the dissolution of carbonate minerals the existence of a moderate positive correlation of na and cl 0 715 and weak positive correlation between ca2 and mg2 0 590 indicates these parameters have mixed sources of the origin that these two parameters are water hardness factors bodrud doza et al 2016 the relationship between na and cl has been used to identify the process that controls the salinity and saline intrusion in arid and semiarid areas singh et al 2005 also strong and positive correlation between cl and na ions revealed that the existence of na ions in water is due to dissolution of halite by water yidana 2010 however na and cl ions in the groundwater can come from several sources the negative moderate correlation between ph and ec 0 518 indicated the medium effect of acidity on the dissolved content of the water the strong correlation between ec and tds 0 99 can be due to ions in tds that conduct electricity the moderate correlation between mg2 and cl 0 62 can be as a result of domestic waste water entering groundwater in this area also strong and positive correlation between ions of mg2 and so4 2 0 82 can be emanated by the use of organic and chemical fertilizers in agricultural activities in the study area raju et al 2015 declared that the strong correlation between these ions might be derived from mg sulfate mineral weathering pca was performed on a groundwater dataset consisting of 48 observations and 10 physicochemical parameters the pca results for physicochemical variables in the groundwater of the dalgan area are given in table 7 the varimax rotation procedure was applied to principal components pcs with kaiser s criterion according to the selection criteria factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 0 before and after rotation were accounted for in this study three principal components pc1 pc2 and pc3 were extracted from groundwater quality parameters it is observed that the first three principal components together account for 85 35 of the total variance in the dataset in which the first principal component is 45 07 the second principal component is 27 09 and the third principal component is 13 18 of the total variance the important point is to find out which variables have high loadings in each component in table 7 variables with loadings greater than 0 6 are marked in bold in the first principal component k na cl mg2 so42 and ca2 parameters have high positive loadings the pc1 was probably caused by groundwater geological medium interaction and natural hydro geochemical evolution of groundwater bencer et al 2016 proposed that when these parameters are gathered in one factor it reflects the effect of natural factors like dissolution of some carbonate dolomitic and evaporate minerals in the groundwater in pc2 tds and ec are the dominant parameters this factor explained the effect of salinity on groundwater quality which was due to weathering and dissolution of evaporitic minerals and also leaching of fertilizers from agricultural areas the third factor with 13 18 of the total variance included hco3 the concentration of hco3 of groundwater are the results of the reaction of soil co2 with the dissolution of silicate minerals krantzberg et al 2010 4 6 evaluating the groundwater quality and ranking based on ahp and ahp dea methods in this research work we have applied the analytic hierarchy process ahp and data envelopment dea model to weight the relative preferences of groundwater quality dea is a popular technique for measuring the relative efficiency of a set of decision making units dmus dmus refer to the 48 irrigation wells being evaluated in the study area the evaluation of groundwater quality was performed in three main stages the first stage involved the implementation of the standard ahp method a well designed questionnaire was administered to 10 experts who were asked to rank the 48 irrigation wells in the study area an ahp based pairwise comparison is used to evaluate irrigation wells for groundwater quality the experts compared these irrigation wells alternatives according to the 3 criteria group1 2 and 3 and 8 sub criteria group 1 temperature ph and ec group2 chloride sodium and sulfate group 3 sar and na each criterion relies on different measured parameters and reflects a different aspect of water quality they need to be given weights in other words we asked each dmu as a decision maker to compare the relative importance of inputs outputs and each dmu constructs its pairwise comparison judgment matrix based on the best weights produced according to a dea model then the relative weights from pairwise comparisons of the ahp hierarchy were calculated taking the principal right eigenvector of relevant matrix the results of this study were found consistent since the inconsistency ratio of all pairwise comparisons was less than 0 1 the second stage of evaluation in the study was the implementation of the ahp dea model which resulted in a different water quality index and groundwater quality map the values obtained from the ahp implementation in the first stage were used as the inputs of the ahp dea model according to the same three criteria Œ∏ Œ≥ and Œ≤ since all observation wells were assumed to produce the same amount of water for each dmu the output of the model was taken as 1 the inputs of the ahp dea model were defined as follows Œ∏ 1 group 1 criteria weights obtained from the ahp model Œ≥ 1 group 2 criteria weights which is obtained from ahp model Œ≤ 1 group 3 criteria weights which is obtained from ahp model for ahp based approach pairwise comparison of qualitative data is made to quantify the judgments made the pairwise comparison matrix is aggregated using the eigenvector method to determine the weights of each alternative the objective is to maximize the efficiency of the well relative to other well the model is executed for each well to determine their efficiencies after the model construction the model was executed for each well alternative and the efficiencies were calculated using ms excel linear solver using this model the efficiency score of each dmu was calculated each run had negligible computational time and since the model is linear the solution was guaranteed a global optimum the groundwater quality index value is evaluated on a scale of 0 1 where a value of 1 indicates that the dmu is relatively efficient and a value less than 1 indicates that the dmu is inefficient cooper et al 2000 the screening process was completed by selecting the well with efficiency equal to one while a groundwater quality index value of less than one means that another well may be better table 8 illustrates the results of the ahp dea model according to these results there were 7 relatively efficient dmus with a groundwater quality index value of 1 the other observation wells were considered inefficient since their groundwater quality index value was lower than 1 the groundwater quality index value ranged from 0 402 to 1 based on groundwater quality index values the drinking water source areas were classified as excellent 4 good 17 permissible 31 and unsuitable 48 groundwater quality was considered unsuitable when the groundwater quality index value was lower than 0 7 as observed in the northwestern and southeastern parts of the study area the last stage in the study was to assess the spatial distribution of groundwater quality using data obtained by the ahp dea models in this research work the groundwater quality map was constructed using the results obtained from the ahp dea models the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality was modeled using ordinary kriging interpolation method fig 9 this map can be used as a tool for environmental decision making process the groundwater quality map shows that high groundwater quality was observed in the central parts of the study area where groundwater quality index value were greater than 0 8 twelve samples were not suitable for agricultural irrigation due to very high sodium and salinity levels furthermore eleven samples were not potable because of their very high salinity and medium sodium levels this study shows how to determine the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality and identify the impact of hydrogeochemical processes on the groundwater quality in the study area comparison of the obtained results shows that the ranking and prioritization of groundwater wells are in accordance with classical methods e g wqi ewqi in the study area the affected parameters in the ahp dea models were very suitable for determining the water quality index of each well and finally prioritizing it the results of the study indicated that groundwater quality index values are useful and reliable indices and can be used to determine the groundwater quality of any region this will also reduce the disease risks of people coming into contact with contaminated groundwater 5 conclusion in this study groundwater quality evaluated using physicochemical data statistical methods wqi and ewqi indexes and ahp dea method the results obtained from statistical analysis and piper diagram indicated that cation predominance in groundwater was in the following order na ca2 mg2 k and the predominance of anions was so4 2 hco3 cl the na cl groundwater type was dominant water types due closer to the seasonal lake hamun e jazmurian the computed wqi and ewqi values have shown that the quality of groundwater for drinking was good to extremely poor by comparing the two methods the ewqi technique showed more accurate results ca and pca were successfully applied to assess the groundwater quality and identify hydrogeochemical processes groundwater contamination is defined by high levels of sulfate sodium and calcium concentrations sourced from rock water interaction as well as wastewater irrigation infiltration and recharge significant so4 2 and na concentrations were linked to agricultural pollution by wastewater irrigation and agricultural fertilizers the results indicate good agreement between the results from the groundwater quality indexes and statistical methods according to ahp dea results there were 7 relatively efficient dmus with a groundwater good quality index integration of the groundwater quality maps showed the high groundwater quality in the central parts of the study area thus agricultural activities and salinisation of groundwater were the major contributing factors to groundwater pollutants in the study area degradation of groundwater quality and increased salinity are due to simultaneous occurrence of droughts and excessive pumping of groundwater resources the findings of this study can be applied to ensure the quality of groundwater used for drinking and irrigation purposes in any region thus there is a need to protect groundwater resources by following preventive measures to control the contamination declaration of competing interest regular monitoring the water quality to prevent further deterioration of water resources acknowledgements the authors would like

analytical procedures spring samples of 60 locations were collected and analyzed for various hydrochemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as caco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 fluoride f environment sensitive index such as ph hydrogen ion concentration electrical conductance ec total dissolved solids tds were measured in the field at the time of sample collection using a ph ec tds meter the detail analytical procedure for hydrochemical quality given in table 2 the location of each spring was taken into the gis environment and the results of each parameter analyzed were added to the concerned wells 3 2 water quality index the water quality index wqi was also evaluated to determine the suitability for drinking purposes horton 1965 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 varol and davraz 2015 saha et al 2018 adimalla and taloor 2020 the wqi is a mathematical effectual tool which provides a comprehensive model of the groundwater quality and is used to present large quantities of water quality data into a single number developed by horton 1965 wqis are effective tool to estimate the overall water quality for drinking purposes by examining individual water quality parameters where all calculated cations anions ph ec and tds were taken into account to determine the water quality index by using the three set wqi calculations which includes a assignment of weights wi based on equation 1 to each water quality parameter involved b calculation of relative weights wi and c quality rating scale calculation qi based on equation 2 1 wi w i i 1 n w i 2 qi ci s i 100 where qi is the quality rating for each chemical parameter i ci is the concentration of each chemical parameter i in each water sample mg l n is the total number of parameters and si is the indian drinking water standard bis 2012 for chemical parameter i assigning the weights for each chemical parameter is the most important part which determines the significance of a water quality parameter for drinking uses assigning the weights for each chemical parameter is the most important part which determines the significance of a water quality parameter for drinking uses for each of 11 parameters a weight wi has been assigned according to its relative importance in the overall quality of drinking water as shown in table 3 the most significant parameters have a weight of 5 and the least significant have a weight of 2 in the study the maximum weight of 5 has been assigned to total dissolved solids nitrate and fluoride due to their major importance in water quality assessment ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 then water quality sub indices sii for each chemical parameter is computed by equation 3 and the wqi is determined by equation 4 3 sii wi x qi 4 wqi i 1 n s i i based on the spatial statistical analysis in the gis using arc map 10 5 software the quality maps of the different cations anion ph and tds were prepared in the gis environment using the inverse distance weighting idw one of the highly used for the random sample data 3 3 irrigation water quality irrigation water quality was computed by the following as under for the irrigation water quality measurement sodium absorption ration sar which is a kind of sodium hazard in the use of water for irrigation was determined by equation 5 karanth 1987 5 sar na ca 2 m g 2 2 the concentrations of cations are expressed in meq l the sodium percent in water is another common parameter wilcox 1955 which is extensively used to evaluate the water for irrigation suitability parameter computed to evaluate the suitability for irrigation computed by equation 6 6 na 100 na k ca 2 mg 2 na k the concentrations of cations are expressed in meq l the concentrations of cations are expressed in meq l besides this irrigation water can also be classified based on rsc when the sum of carbonate and bicarbonate is in excess over the alkaline earths chiefly calcium and magnesium in excess of permissible limits affects irrigation adversely according to eaton 1950 and richards 1954 7 rsc co 32 hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 meq l 3 4 discharge measurement the discharge of the spring water fluctuates seasonally and mainly depends on rainfall pattern in the recharge area and variation in the amount of rainwater that is able to in filtrate the ground in some studies we have found that anthropogenic activity affects the spring discharge hao et al 2016 where the measure of concentration discharge have also been well documented with arsenic occurrence reyes et al 2015 we measure the discharge of spring during the summer pre monsoon at that time the flow was quite low so we use this simple and accurate the discharge measurement of the springs were also carried out using the container stopwatch method where flow q can be captured into a container of known volume v one of the most straightforward methodologies for determining discharge is to time t the filling of the container and calculate flow using the discharge equation 8 q v t 4 results and discussions 4 1 assessment of spring water suitability for drinking purposes it is essential to distinguish the quality of spring for drinking and other domestic purposes various water quality parameters and analytical results are presented in table 4 and the values are compared with standard values of the bureau of india standards bis 2012 as shown in table 5 the ph value ranged from 7 to 8 4 with a mean of 7 66 table 4 the ph values range between 6 5 and 7 9 indicates the water is acidic to slightly alkaline in nature the total dissolved solids tds ranges between 123 and 793 mg l within the highest desirable limit indicate the water is suitable for livestock b classification based on the hardness the spring samples of study area falls under moderately hard 8 to hard category 92 table 6 furthermore tds values were classified according to freeze and cherry 1979 as shown in table 6 indicating all the spring samples were under fresh water category the classification of davis and dewiest 1966 indicate that 95 samples are under desirable for drinking water and only 5 are under the permissible category the calcium varies from 10 5 to 138 5 with 73 samples are under the desirable limit and 27 samples fall in the permissible limit bis 2012 the magnesium varies from 3 7 to 93 7 with 53 fall in the desirable category and 47 fall in the permissible limit the sodium varies from 6 to 93 3 and potassium varies from 0 9 to 59 9 in the study area among the anion bicarbonate is the dominant element varies from 105 to 590 chloride varies from 7 8 to 175 sulphate varies 2 to 251 nitrate varies 0 9 to 139 9 and fluoride varies from 0 1 to 0 6 in the study area the piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 and gibbs diagram 1970 were plotted to accentuates the spring water quality the piper plot of the spring samples falls in the field 1 and 3 which highlights that alkaline earth exceeds alkalies weak acids exceeds strong acids respectively fig 2 the major ion chemistry is dominated major ion chemistry is dominated by ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 ions in the spring waters the dissolution of carbonate rocks enriches the water in ca2 and mg2 ions the ca mg molar ratio of spring water indicates the dissolution of calcite and dolomite from the geological formation in the gibbs ratio the relation to three mechanisms i e evaporation dominance rock dominance and precipitation dominance controlling water chemistry the gibb s ratio cl cl hco3 for anion fig 3 a and ratio na k na k ca2 for cation fig 3b exhibit that the water is mainly governed by rock dominance the carbonate mineral dissolution may be diminished during the travel of groundwater from the recharge areas towards the thicker parts of the aquifer because of the lack of carbon dioxide 4 2 gis based spatial water quality the gis is an efficient tool to represent the data spatially ways and widely used by number of researchers around the world in the last four decades for mapping of the physical and chemical parameters in the present study it found that the spatial spring water quality distribution of physical parameter ph fig 4 a shows that most of the area under the desirable limit except a small patch in the southern part of the study area tds fig 4b shows that except a small patch in the hilly area the tds is under the desirable limit the spatial distribution of the chemical parameters fig 4c i show that most of the area is under the desirable limit except a few pockets which are above the desirable permissible limit 4 3 water quality index wqi groundwater samples n 60 and its wqi values are presented in table 3 therefore the groundwater quality status can be categorized into five types ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 adimalla and taloor 2020 based on wqi values namely excellent water 150 good water 150 200 poor water 200 250 very poor water 250 300 and water unsuitable for drinking 300 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 the computed wqi values ranged from 28 to 116 table 4 as per the classification of wqi 27 of the total spring samples fell under the excellent category and 30 of the spring sample belongs to good water category for drinking purposes moreover 3 of groundwater samples were found of poor water quality table 7 the gis based spatial analysis were performed using kriging interpolation to determine the spatial distribution water quality index wqi map of the study area fig 5 the spatial map shows that most of the area falls under the excellent to good categories where two small pockets found in the north and north west are under the poor category it is also found that no sample in the study area falls in the very poor and not suitable drinking water categories 4 4 evaluation of spring water suitability for irrigation purposes evaluation of spring water quality is an important and vital for the study area as the southern portion is completed dominated by the agriculture activities for the better understanding of the irrigation water quality the well established ussl diagram 1954 sodium absorption ratio sar sodium percentage na and residual sodium carbonate rsc were chosen to understand the suitability for irrigation purposes the surplus amount of sodium concentration in water leads to the formation of alkaline soil and the high salt concentration which results in the development of saline soil besides this dissolved ion such as sodium bicarbonate and carbonate in irrigation water affects plants growth and reduce productivity of crops the ec and na concentration are important in classifying irrigation water sar of irrigation water is calculated as an index of sodium hazard and is quantified as the relative proportion of sodium na to calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions in water richards 1954 sar values ranged from 0 14 to 2 06 with an average of 0 52 table 9 the salinity hazard parameter ec ranged between 233 and 1523 Œºs cm with an average value of 526 Œºs cm tables 3 and 8 and both are used in the ussl 1954 diagram fig 6 the ussl diagram shows that all the samples fall in the low alkali hazard zone where as the 3 samples 5 falls under the low salinity hazard 50 83 samples under the medium salinity hazard and 7 12 samples fall under the high salinity hazard zone sodium concentration reacts with soil to reduce or enhance its permeability sodium is one of the common element found in the water extensively used to evaluate irrigation water suitability in the present study the sodium percentage calculated through equation 6 for spring water in the study area is plotted against ec in wilcox diagram fig 7 the spatial distribution map of the ec was prepared to know about the spatial distribution and it was found that most of the area under 250 ec whereas three pocket in the northern area have 250 750 ec and a small area have a value 2750 fig 8 the value of na ranges from 0 002 to 45 93 with a mean of 16 34 the wilcox diagram shows that 45 samples 75 falls under the excellent category for irrigation use of water and 15 samples 25 falls under the good category of sodium in the irrigation water for irrigational purposes the water containing a high concentration of carbonate and bicarbonate ions tends to precipitate calcium and magnesium as carbonates as a result the increase in the relative proportion of sodium decreases soil permeability the residual sodium carbonate destroys the soil structure as it restricts water and air movement through the soil rsc is present in groundwater if the total concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions exceed that of calcium and magnesium ions richards 1954 the rsc value classified raghunath 1987a as 1 25 good water type for irrigation 1 25 to 2 5 doubtful for irrigation 2 5 unsuitable for irrigation in the present study the rsc values varies from 5 29 to 1 19 which shows that all the samples fall under the good category 4 5 spring discharge spring discharge is now a day for critical parameter for the suitable development and management of the springs high discharge springs are considered as quite valuable and well maintained due to high utility of spring water it is useful to embed the growing problem of spring water depletion within the context of mountain environmental systems including the reference to mountain aquifers springs have provided water to the mountain communities for centuries and the revival of this traditional source of water is extremely important for the region s sustainable growth at the same time rivers are kept alive throughout the year particularly in a monsoonal climate primarily due to discharge from groundwater as springs and seeps along their river channels in the present study area based on equation 8 the measurement of discharge indicates that 42 springs have discharge more than 20 l per minute second lps 10 springs have discharge between 10 and 20 lps 5 springs have discharge between 2 and 10 lps and 3 springs have discharge 2 lps table 10 5 conclusion hydrochemical analysis of the spring water samples exhibit that ca and mg are dominant followed by the na and k among cations the bicarbonate is one of the most dominant anion followed by the cl and no3 analysis of hydrochemical facies reveals two dominant facies on piper trilinear diagram ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 so2 4 type which depicts that the water chemistry is dominated by the alkaline earth and weak acids the gibbs plot shows that total dissolved solids point towards rock dominance and suggests congruent dissolution of carbonate lithology the high values of hco3 in spring water samples illustrate the dissolution of carbonate rocks in the recharge area due to the acidic precipitation co2 rich and ionic enrichment the fluoride is with the desirable limit whereas the nitrate is in the permissible limit except 3 5 samples the wilcox diagram revealed that most of the spring samples are good 25 to excellent 75 category for irrigation the us salinity laboratory diagram indicates that 83 of groundwater samples belong to medium salinity s2 and low sodium hazards c3s1 whereas only 12 samples falls under the high salinity water which considered as unsuitable for soil with restricted drainage the water quality index of domestic uses was determined and found that 95 of the spring water samples are under excellent to good category which means that most of the springs are source of fresh drinking water where major chunk of the population in the study area is rely for drinking purposes the spatial water quality index map shows that most of the study area are fall under excellent to good categories and a few pockets have the poor spatial wqi the depletion of spring is one of the major problems in the himalayas due to various socio economic and political reasons which has arose the need of spring discharge measurement and in the study it was found that 70 of the springs dominated by the sandstone lithology have discharge rate of 20lps whereas the spring in the boulder sandstone area 17 springs usually have a discharge rate of 10 20 lps and required a carefully attention for the revival and rejuvenations of the springs before it comes too late the overall scenario of the spring water in the study area is chemically potable and suitable for domestic and agricultural uses declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

analytical procedures spring samples of 60 locations were collected and analyzed for various hydrochemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th as caco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 fluoride f environment sensitive index such as ph hydrogen ion concentration electrical conductance ec total dissolved solids tds were measured in the field at the time of sample collection using a ph ec tds meter the detail analytical procedure for hydrochemical quality given in table 2 the location of each spring was taken into the gis environment and the results of each parameter analyzed were added to the concerned wells 3 2 water quality index the water quality index wqi was also evaluated to determine the suitability for drinking purposes horton 1965 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 varol and davraz 2015 saha et al 2018 adimalla and taloor 2020 the wqi is a mathematical effectual tool which provides a comprehensive model of the groundwater quality and is used to present large quantities of water quality data into a single number developed by horton 1965 wqis are effective tool to estimate the overall water quality for drinking purposes by examining individual water quality parameters where all calculated cations anions ph ec and tds were taken into account to determine the water quality index by using the three set wqi calculations which includes a assignment of weights wi based on equation 1 to each water quality parameter involved b calculation of relative weights wi and c quality rating scale calculation qi based on equation 2 1 wi w i i 1 n w i 2 qi ci s i 100 where qi is the quality rating for each chemical parameter i ci is the concentration of each chemical parameter i in each water sample mg l n is the total number of parameters and si is the indian drinking water standard bis 2012 for chemical parameter i assigning the weights for each chemical parameter is the most important part which determines the significance of a water quality parameter for drinking uses assigning the weights for each chemical parameter is the most important part which determines the significance of a water quality parameter for drinking uses for each of 11 parameters a weight wi has been assigned according to its relative importance in the overall quality of drinking water as shown in table 3 the most significant parameters have a weight of 5 and the least significant have a weight of 2 in the study the maximum weight of 5 has been assigned to total dissolved solids nitrate and fluoride due to their major importance in water quality assessment ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 then water quality sub indices sii for each chemical parameter is computed by equation 3 and the wqi is determined by equation 4 3 sii wi x qi 4 wqi i 1 n s i i based on the spatial statistical analysis in the gis using arc map 10 5 software the quality maps of the different cations anion ph and tds were prepared in the gis environment using the inverse distance weighting idw one of the highly used for the random sample data 3 3 irrigation water quality irrigation water quality was computed by the following as under for the irrigation water quality measurement sodium absorption ration sar which is a kind of sodium hazard in the use of water for irrigation was determined by equation 5 karanth 1987 5 sar na ca 2 m g 2 2 the concentrations of cations are expressed in meq l the sodium percent in water is another common parameter wilcox 1955 which is extensively used to evaluate the water for irrigation suitability parameter computed to evaluate the suitability for irrigation computed by equation 6 6 na 100 na k ca 2 mg 2 na k the concentrations of cations are expressed in meq l the concentrations of cations are expressed in meq l besides this irrigation water can also be classified based on rsc when the sum of carbonate and bicarbonate is in excess over the alkaline earths chiefly calcium and magnesium in excess of permissible limits affects irrigation adversely according to eaton 1950 and richards 1954 7 rsc co 32 hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 meq l 3 4 discharge measurement the discharge of the spring water fluctuates seasonally and mainly depends on rainfall pattern in the recharge area and variation in the amount of rainwater that is able to in filtrate the ground in some studies we have found that anthropogenic activity affects the spring discharge hao et al 2016 where the measure of concentration discharge have also been well documented with arsenic occurrence reyes et al 2015 we measure the discharge of spring during the summer pre monsoon at that time the flow was quite low so we use this simple and accurate the discharge measurement of the springs were also carried out using the container stopwatch method where flow q can be captured into a container of known volume v one of the most straightforward methodologies for determining discharge is to time t the filling of the container and calculate flow using the discharge equation 8 q v t 4 results and discussions 4 1 assessment of spring water suitability for drinking purposes it is essential to distinguish the quality of spring for drinking and other domestic purposes various water quality parameters and analytical results are presented in table 4 and the values are compared with standard values of the bureau of india standards bis 2012 as shown in table 5 the ph value ranged from 7 to 8 4 with a mean of 7 66 table 4 the ph values range between 6 5 and 7 9 indicates the water is acidic to slightly alkaline in nature the total dissolved solids tds ranges between 123 and 793 mg l within the highest desirable limit indicate the water is suitable for livestock b classification based on the hardness the spring samples of study area falls under moderately hard 8 to hard category 92 table 6 furthermore tds values were classified according to freeze and cherry 1979 as shown in table 6 indicating all the spring samples were under fresh water category the classification of davis and dewiest 1966 indicate that 95 samples are under desirable for drinking water and only 5 are under the permissible category the calcium varies from 10 5 to 138 5 with 73 samples are under the desirable limit and 27 samples fall in the permissible limit bis 2012 the magnesium varies from 3 7 to 93 7 with 53 fall in the desirable category and 47 fall in the permissible limit the sodium varies from 6 to 93 3 and potassium varies from 0 9 to 59 9 in the study area among the anion bicarbonate is the dominant element varies from 105 to 590 chloride varies from 7 8 to 175 sulphate varies 2 to 251 nitrate varies 0 9 to 139 9 and fluoride varies from 0 1 to 0 6 in the study area the piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 and gibbs diagram 1970 were plotted to accentuates the spring water quality the piper plot of the spring samples falls in the field 1 and 3 which highlights that alkaline earth exceeds alkalies weak acids exceeds strong acids respectively fig 2 the major ion chemistry is dominated major ion chemistry is dominated by ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 ions in the spring waters the dissolution of carbonate rocks enriches the water in ca2 and mg2 ions the ca mg molar ratio of spring water indicates the dissolution of calcite and dolomite from the geological formation in the gibbs ratio the relation to three mechanisms i e evaporation dominance rock dominance and precipitation dominance controlling water chemistry the gibb s ratio cl cl hco3 for anion fig 3 a and ratio na k na k ca2 for cation fig 3b exhibit that the water is mainly governed by rock dominance the carbonate mineral dissolution may be diminished during the travel of groundwater from the recharge areas towards the thicker parts of the aquifer because of the lack of carbon dioxide 4 2 gis based spatial water quality the gis is an efficient tool to represent the data spatially ways and widely used by number of researchers around the world in the last four decades for mapping of the physical and chemical parameters in the present study it found that the spatial spring water quality distribution of physical parameter ph fig 4 a shows that most of the area under the desirable limit except a small patch in the southern part of the study area tds fig 4b shows that except a small patch in the hilly area the tds is under the desirable limit the spatial distribution of the chemical parameters fig 4c i show that most of the area is under the desirable limit except a few pockets which are above the desirable permissible limit 4 3 water quality index wqi groundwater samples n 60 and its wqi values are presented in table 3 therefore the groundwater quality status can be categorized into five types ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 adimalla and taloor 2020 based on wqi values namely excellent water 150 good water 150 200 poor water 200 250 very poor water 250 300 and water unsuitable for drinking 300 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 the computed wqi values ranged from 28 to 116 table 4 as per the classification of wqi 27 of the total spring samples fell under the excellent category and 30 of the spring sample belongs to good water category for drinking purposes moreover 3 of groundwater samples were found of poor water quality table 7 the gis based spatial analysis were performed using kriging interpolation to determine the spatial distribution water quality index wqi map of the study area fig 5 the spatial map shows that most of the area falls under the excellent to good categories where two small pockets found in the north and north west are under the poor category it is also found that no sample in the study area falls in the very poor and not suitable drinking water categories 4 4 evaluation of spring water suitability for irrigation purposes evaluation of spring water quality is an important and vital for the study area as the southern portion is completed dominated by the agriculture activities for the better understanding of the irrigation water quality the well established ussl diagram 1954 sodium absorption ratio sar sodium percentage na and residual sodium carbonate rsc were chosen to understand the suitability for irrigation purposes the surplus amount of sodium concentration in water leads to the formation of alkaline soil and the high salt concentration which results in the development of saline soil besides this dissolved ion such as sodium bicarbonate and carbonate in irrigation water affects plants growth and reduce productivity of crops the ec and na concentration are important in classifying irrigation water sar of irrigation water is calculated as an index of sodium hazard and is quantified as the relative proportion of sodium na to calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions in water richards 1954 sar values ranged from 0 14 to 2 06 with an average of 0 52 table 9 the salinity hazard parameter ec ranged between 233 and 1523 Œºs cm with an average value of 526 Œºs cm tables 3 and 8 and both are used in the ussl 1954 diagram fig 6 the ussl diagram shows that all the samples fall in the low alkali hazard zone where as the 3 samples 5 falls under the low salinity hazard 50 83 samples under the medium salinity hazard and 7 12 samples fall under the high salinity hazard zone sodium concentration reacts with soil to reduce or enhance its permeability sodium is one of the common element found in the water extensively used to evaluate irrigation water suitability in the present study the sodium percentage calculated through equation 6 for spring water in the study area is plotted against ec in wilcox diagram fig 7 the spatial distribution map of the ec was prepared to know about the spatial distribution and it was found that most of the area under 250 ec whereas three pocket in the northern area have 250 750 ec and a small area have a value 2750 fig 8 the value of na ranges from 0 002 to 45 93 with a mean of 16 34 the wilcox diagram shows that 45 samples 75 falls under the excellent category for irrigation use of water and 15 samples 25 falls under the good category of sodium in the irrigation water for irrigational purposes the water containing a high concentration of carbonate and bicarbonate ions tends to precipitate calcium and magnesium as carbonates as a result the increase in the relative proportion of sodium decreases soil permeability the residual sodium carbonate destroys the soil structure as it restricts water and air movement through the soil rsc is present in groundwater if the total concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions exceed that of calcium and magnesium ions richards 1954 the rsc value classified raghunath 1987a as 1 25 good water type for irrigation 1 25 to 2 5 doubtful for irrigation 2 5 unsuitable for irrigation in the present study the rsc values varies from 5 29 to 1 19 which shows that all the samples fall under the good category 4 5 spring discharge spring discharge is now a day for critical parameter for the suitable development and management of the springs high discharge springs are considered as quite valuable and well maintained due to high utility of spring water it is useful to embed the growing problem of spring water depletion within the context of mountain environmental systems including the reference to mountain aquifers springs have provided water to the mountain communities for centuries and the revival of this traditional source of water is extremely important for the region s sustainable growth at the same time rivers are kept alive throughout the year particularly in a monsoonal climate primarily due to discharge from groundwater as springs and seeps along their river channels in the present study area based on equation 8 the measurement of discharge indicates that 42 springs have discharge more than 20 l per minute second lps 10 springs have discharge between 10 and 20 lps 5 springs have discharge between 2 and 10 lps and 3 springs have discharge 2 lps table 10 5 conclusion hydrochemical analysis of the spring water samples exhibit that ca and mg are dominant followed by the na and k among cations the bicarbonate is one of the most dominant anion followed by the cl and no3 analysis of hydrochemical facies reveals two dominant facies on piper trilinear diagram ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 so2 4 type which depicts that the water chemistry is dominated by the alkaline earth and weak acids the gibbs plot shows that total dissolved solids point towards rock dominance and suggests congruent dissolution of carbonate lithology the high values of hco3 in spring water samples illustrate the dissolution of carbonate rocks in the recharge area due to the acidic precipitation co2 rich and ionic enrichment the fluoride is with the desirable limit whereas the nitrate is in the permissible limit except 3 5 samples the wilcox diagram revealed that most of the spring samples are good 25 to excellent 75 category for irrigation the us salinity laboratory diagram indicates that 83 of groundwater samples belong to medium salinity s2 and low sodium hazards c3s1 whereas only 12 samples falls under the high salinity water which considered as unsuitable for soil with restricted drainage the water quality index of domestic uses was determined and found that 95 of the spring water samples are under excellent to good category which means that most of the springs are source of fresh drinking water where major chunk of the population in the study area is rely for drinking purposes the spatial water quality index map shows that most of the study area are fall under excellent to good categories and a few pockets have the poor spatial wqi the depletion of spring is one of the major problems in the himalayas due to various socio economic and political reasons which has arose the need of spring discharge measurement and in the study it was found that 70 of the springs dominated by the sandstone lithology have discharge rate of 20lps whereas the spring in the boulder sandstone area 17 springs usually have a discharge rate of 10 20 lps and required a carefully attention for the revival and rejuvenations of the springs before it comes too late the overall scenario of the spring water in the study area is chemically potable and suitable for domestic and agricultural uses declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
