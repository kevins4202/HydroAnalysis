7615,this study presents a three step validation technique to compare the performance of the canadian precipitation analysis capa product relative to actual observation as a hydrologic forcing in regional watershed simulation capa is an interpolated 6h or 24h accumulation reanalysis precipitation product in near real time covering all of north america the analysis procedure involves point to point p2p and map to map m2m comparisons followed by proxy validation using an operational version of the watflood hydrologic model from 2002 to 2005 in the lake winnipeg basin lwb canada the p2p technique using a bayesian change point analysis shows that capa corresponds with actual observations canadian daily climate data cdcd on both an annual and seasonal basis capa has the same spatial pattern dependency and autocorrelation properties as cdcd pixel by pixel m2m when used as hydrologic forcing in watflood results indicate that capa is a reliable product for water resource modeling and predictions but that the quality of capa data varies annually and seasonally as does the quality of observations capa proved most beneficial as a hydrologic forcing during winter seasons where observation quality is the lowest reanalysis products such as capa can be a reliable option in sparse network areas and is beneficial for regional governments when the cost of new weather stations is prohibitive keywords precipitation forcing precipitation data quality hydrologic modeling canadian precipitation analysis bayesian change point analysis spatial autocorrelation interpolation 1 introduction in many regions of the world particularly mid to high latitude regions weather station networks are sparse making precipitation analysis a challenge and generating significant errors for hydrologic modeling applications nicotina et al 2008 for example in canada there are few stations in the north where ironically much of the major hydroelectric and water resource infrastructure is located the major challenge in hydrologic modeling large watersheds such as those in canada is that weather station density is higher in the south near the american border and decreases drastically moving northward similarly coulibaly et al 2013 conducted a study on spatial analysis of the canadian national hydrometric network cnhn based on the world meteorological organization wmo guidelines for hydrometric network density their results show that approximately 12 of the terrestrial area of canada is covered by hydrometric networks in other words this is the only area that meets the wmo 2008 standards also 49 of the area is poorly gauged while the remaining 39 is ungauged this shows that most the terrestrial area of canada did not meet the wmo standard and as such precipitation patterns may not be fully represented in modeled flows from these areas providing an accurate representation of amount and the spatial variability in precipitation to a hydrologic model is therefore crucial for accurate hydrologic prediction for practical applications interpolation of precipitation estimates from weather stations is relied on to provide values for areas and across regions that are ungauged traditionally spatial interpolation techniques based on deterministic and geostatistical principles have been used ly et al 2011 deterministic interpolation methods involve the thiessen polygon thi inverse distance weighting idw polynomial interpolation pi spline interpolation si and moving window regression mwr techniques ly et al 2013 the general disadvantage of these afore mentioned techniques is their inability to quantify interpolation uncertainty geostatistical methods on the other hand involve techniques such as ordinary kriging ok simple kriging sk and universal kriging uk etc with basically every kriging method dealing with analysis of random fields z u z is random and u is the geographical coordinate index bivand et al 2008 kriging involves estimation and modeling of spatial dependency autocorrelation and verification of the stationarity assumption geostatistics methods relative to deterministic techniques generally provide improved predictions resulting from considering the spatial configurations of observations bivand et al 2008 even with geostatistical techniques the impact of spatial smoothing is a challenge boluwade and madramootoo 2013 resulting in the underestimation of large values and over estimation of small values of the variable of interest interpolation accuracy is also only as good as the number of spatial datasets used in producing the resulting interpolated surface bivand et al 2008 therefore in large mid to high latitude regions of canada there is need for better methods of precipitation representation using more advanced datasets from weather prediction models at appropriate scales for hydrologic modeling applications the development of numerical weather prediction nwp models haltiner 1971 provides a platform to predict precipitation at short time steps nwp uses current observation of weather combined with model predictions to forecast future events belair et al 2003 mailhot et al 2006 it is a procedure that applies 3 d differential atmospheric equations to estimate future states of the atmosphere that require initial conditions cote et al 1998 girard et al 2010 the regional deterministic prediction system rdps of environment canada is an operational short term nwp system developed for north america four times daily with a horizontal resolution of 10 km fortin et al 2015 rdps relies on the canadian global environmental multi scale model gem fortin et al 2015 gem is an integrated forecasting system and data assimilation platform which is based on the hydrostatic primitive equations with time discretization following an implicit two time level semi lagrangian procedure lespinas et al 2015 the performance assessment of gem as a short term forecast product has been reported by cote et al 1998 their results further demonstrated the validity and versatility of gem model gem s short range forecast is suitable for a background field for reanalysis products such as the canadian precipitation analysis capa lespinas et al 2015 capa is a joint canadian project between the meteorological research and department mrd and meteorological services of canada msc both divisions of environment canada mahfouf et al 2007 capa produces 6h and 12h accumulation of precipitation covering all of north america on a 10km grid capa assimilates the gem s short term forecasts radar precipitation estimates fortin et al 2015 satellite observation boluwade et al submitted for publication and point estimates from weather stations using an internal quality control procedure lespinas et al 2015 fortin et al 2015 capa offers potential as a forcing product for hydrologic modeling across canada particularly regions in the mid to high latitudes with sparse gauge networks however there is a need to first verify the reliability and accuracy of capas precipitation estimates such that canadian provincial agencies public institutions and interested parties may have confidence in using capa for operational decision making assessing the reliability of capa as an additional data source with actual observations must therefore involve comparisons point to point p2p map to map m2m and as a forcing for an operational hydrologic model comparing on a point basis change point analysis is a reliable technique to determine the timing and partitioning of precipitation series fortin et al 2004 fu et al 2014 gallagher et al 2012 change point analysis based on bayesian techniques can be used to help determine similarities and aberrations among the datasets where bayesian statistics outperform frequentist methods which is beneficial in quantifying uncertainty in bayesian model parameters banerjee et al 2004 comparing on a spatial or regional basis the datasets must first be interpolated which is also a necessary first step for fully distributed models such as watflood that require gridded inputs variogram analysis and kriging techniques that take care of spatial configurations of the observations can provide the spatial dependency and spatial autocorrelation properties of the datasets bivand et al 2008 furthermore the reliability of capa as an alternate precipitation forcing can be tested by using the reanalysis data in a hydrological model directly and comparing performance metrics to those obtained from forcing with gauge observations the primary focus of this paper is to assess and quantify the reliability of capa precipitation estimates as a hydrologic model forcing relative to canadian observation data on the canadian prairies the objective is to assess capa as a reliable alternative for cdcd using techniques based on p2p m2p and as a forcing for interpolated hydrologic model this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area with descriptions of the datasets capa and cdcd bayesian change point for p2p spatial pattern autocorrelation and interpolation for m2m and hydrologic modeling process using watflood section 3 presents and discusses the results finally section 4 details the conclusions and recommendations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the domain of interest in this study is the lake winnipeg basin lwb a sub watershed of the larger nelson churchill river basin ncrb draining most of central canada and the northern united states fig 1 this region was chosen because it is large spans regions that are well gauged and poorly gauged and is centered in the canadian prairies where capa performance is of operational interest to manitoba hydro a major hydroelectric utility in the province of manitoba canada the entire ncrb 1 4millionsqkm is comprised of the red river basin red winnipeg river basin wpb nelson river basin nrb saskatchewan river basin srb assiniboine river basin arb lake winnipeg basin lwb and churchill river basin crb in the center of the ncrb resides the lwb 190 000km2 within the canadian boreal plain boreal shield and prairie ecozones fig 1 agriculture and agri food canada 2013 and two very large lakes lake manitoba lake winnipeg and one smaller lake lake winnipegosis fig 1 these open surface waters dominate the watershed fig 1 and imply that there would be a relatively small runoff response from the remaining land surface fig 2 shows that land topography are highest in saskatchewan 500m and gradually decrease to about 250m in manitoba the canadian boreal shield is the largest ecozone in canada characterized by ever green vegetation which is comprised of species like spruce and fir that form dense forest vegetation covering a thin layer of soil with impermeable bedrock underneath zhao 2013 climate is characterized by long cold winters and short cool summers in the west and long cold winters but short warm summers to the east table 1 it should be noted that 39 of canada s hydroelectric capacity lies in the boreal shield ecozone 24 574mw generating about 16billion annually from 279 large dams 42 of the canadian total environment canada 2015a 2015b the canadian boreal plain is dominated by natural forest and extends through alberta saskatchewan and manitoba the landscape is flat with low valleys the rocky mountains in the west block most of the moisture being carried eastward by the jet stream smith et al 1998 table 1 larger percentages of the land mass in the prairie ecozone have been cultivated under agricultural practise the prairie ecozone climate is influenced by its location at the center of north america and the neighboring rocky mountains to the west resulting in a semi arid to sub humid climate table 1 twenty five percent of the precipitation in this ecozone falls as snow wiken 1986 1996 snow gauges have been reported to have large biases with goodison et al 1988 documenting problems with winter precipitation measurement 2 2 precipitation data description 2 2 1 canadian precipitation analysis capa capa is a precipitation analysis product developed by the meteorological service of canada that provides interpolated precipitation over north america at a spatial and temporal resolution of 10km and 6hr accumulation estimates respectively lespinas et al 2015 fortin et al 2015 it has been operational since 2011 and can be assessed online at http weather gc ca grib grib2 rdpa ps10km e html the capa methodology is based on the assimilation of different sources of datasets fig 3 such as the forecast from the numerical weather prediction nwp model point estimates from weather stations and precipitation measurements from radar data gem is a fully integrated forecast with a vertical horizontal spatial resolution of 10km over canada that runs 4 times daily and has up to 10days lead time point estimates are also assimilated from several weather networks capa assimilates using gem as the background field from the synoptic network synop which has about 300 700 manned and automatic stations respectively other networks are metar used by the aviation industry with about 1200stations rmcq quebec s provincial network with 120stations and u s shef standardized hydrological exchange format networks volunteer network 11 000 stations at 24h accumulations these stations are quality controlled before being assimilated into capa so that spurious estimates can be removed assimilation of radar started in 2014 specifically for version 4 of capa fortin et al 2015 it should be noted that radar has limited coverage mostly at the southern border with united states just recently boluwade et al submitted for publication integrated satellite observations global precipitation measurement into capa as additional data source lespinas et al 2015 did an assessment of capa over north america and found that capa produces analyses that are reliable and of good quality the authors found that capa analyses perform better in autumn spring and winter than in summer which is due to the nwp s difficulty in producing convective precipitation because of the low spatial resolution of the climate model furthermore the authors recommended that there should be a minimum of 1 17 stations per 10 000km2 in order to produce a precipitation analysis that is better than the raw gem estimates background field 2 2 2 canadian daily climate data cdcd canadian daily climate data cdcd were used in this study as actual precipitation observations collected from weather stations across the study area archives of daily variables such as precipitation temperature and so forth are provided by environment canada and are accessed online http climate weather gc ca or through a purchased cd rom data used in this study i e 2003 2005 were retrieved from the on line version environment canada 2015a 2015b with the number of stations that were active without missing values during each year of the study period summarized in table 2 to prepare the observed dataset for the verification methods used in this paper cdcd data 2002 2005 were downloaded and a python code developed to batch extract the data by selected station data were then converted into a readable format in excel with year month day and precipitation amount mm in separate columns the methodology used in this study is summarized in fig 4 adjusted and homogenized canadian climate data ahccd is the adjusted version of cdcd created at 450 gauged stations across canada with corrections made to the original cdcd due to instrument and data collection errors mekis and vincent 2011 according to mekis and hogg 1999 the current ahccd datasets is based on the first generation adjusted precipitation for canada apc1 more information on how the adjustment was done can be found in mekis 2005 and mekis and vincent 2011 lwb model was initially calibrated by manitoba hydro using this adjusted and homogenized version of cdcd we did not use this adjusted version in this analysis p2p m2m and as an hydrologic forcing because there are too few samples available 2 3 bayesian change point analysis for capa and cdcd to validate capa as a viable alternative to cdcd the nearest capa grid was compared to cdcd weather station data point data in a point to point p2p analysis no downscaling or upscaling was done to avoid station error representativeness in other words if any downscaling or upscaling is done significant biases could be introduced because the station observation data and the capa did not cover the same region ballester and moré 2007 daily observations were accumulated to monthly and seasonal spring mam march april may summer jja june july august fall son september october november and winter djf december january february precipitation totals for each of the years for both products comparisons were performed using a bayesian inference technique called the bayesian change point bcp barry and hartigan 1993 to detect the change points in seasonal accumulated capa and cdcd data the application of bcp was done using the barry and hartigan 1993 proposed bayesian model created as a markov chain monte carlo mcmc package in r statistics software by erdman and emerson 2008 the mcmc is based on the metropolis hastings with independent structure on the parameters the procedure for application of the model is summarized as erdman and emerson 2008 i form an unknown partition of the precipitation series ψ into contiguous blocks such that the means within each block are assumed equal ii there is an assumption of observation independency n μ i σ 2 and the probability of a change point at position weather station i is ξ iii the prior distribution of μ ij the mean of block at position i 1 and ending at position j is given by n μ 0 σ 0 2 j i iv independent priors are selected by barry and hartigan 1993 for μ 0 ξ σ 2 and w σ 2 σ 2 σ 0 2 where w is the ratio of signal error to error variance v these priors are given as μ 0 1 μ 0 σ 2 1 σ 2 0 σ 2 ψ 1 ψ 0 0 ψ ψ 0 w 1 w 0 0 w w 0 2 ξ 1 ξ 0 0 ξ 0 ξ b 1 1 ξ n b d ξ ξ 0 and w0 are preselected numbers in 0 1 and b is the number of blocks in the partition vi partition ψ u1 u2 un where n is the number of observations and ui 1 indicates a change point at position i 1 vii ui 0 viii each step of the markov chain at position i a value ui is drawn from the conditional distribution of ui and the current partition ix the transition probability ξ for the conditional probability of a change point at position i 1 is obtained from the simplified

w0 b0 w1 and b1 are within and between block sums of squares obtained when ui 0 and ui 1 respectively and z is the dataset in this case seasonal cdcd or capa according to erdman and emerson 2007 the tuning parameters γ and λ may take values in 0 1 this is to allow the situation where there are not too many changes i e γ is small the posterior means are updated after each iteration and conditioned on the current situation the assumption of normality in study is appropriate because of central limit theorem clt since the monthly precipitation amount is the summation of daily precipitation over time and space perreault et al 2000a 2000b lee and kim 2014 we implemented this procedure for p2p validation using r statistical software and the bcp package erdman and emerson 2007 to quantify the similarities in the monthly accumulated time series of cdcd and capa pertinent questions such as did change occur how many changes and when did they occur were addressed results assessed capa as an alternative for cdcd specifically in a region with a sparse observation network i e the lwb 2 4 spatial patterning based on spatial autocorrelation and anomalies assessment of capa relative to observed station data informs the accuracy of precipitation estimates at a point in space however it was also desirable to understand spatial patterns autocorrelation and the variability of capa relative to a cdcd interpolated grid pixel to pixel for distributed hydrologic modeling typically cdcd data are interpolated to a grid commensurate with the hydrologic model resolution and used as forcing for model simulation representing the baseline or observed input it should be noted that the idw technique is the in built interpolation engine in watflood however here we used the geostatiscal interpolation technique for the map to map m2m spatial analyses because of this technique s ability to characterize the spatial structure pattern and dependency of cdcd and capa precipitation products through variogram analysis although ly et al 2013 reported there is no significant difference between idw and ok goovaerts 2000 stated that for low density networks of rain gauges geostatistical interpolation outperforms other techniques such as idw we used ok in the gstat package in r pebesma 2004 to interpolate surfaces using the fitted covariance functions from the sample variogram to estimate the general range of spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation of the stations for both capa and cdcd precipitation products the experimental semi variogram i e variogram is defined as half the average squared difference between the pair of data goovaerts 2000 we assumed an isotropic spatial pattern i e identical variability in all directions and adopted the spherical model being the most widely applied ly et al 2011 goovaerts 2000 as the fitted theoretical model nugget is the initial semi variance when autocorrelation is highest or just the uncertainty where distance is close to 0 sill is the variance where the curve levels off and range also called the lag distance where the sill is reached after which there is no spatial correlation in the variable parameters from the spherical model are then used to create an interpolated surface through ok the resulting krigged products were used for calculation of anomalies the annual accumulated and spatially interpolated capa and cdcd were used to calculate annual anomalies with the assumption that interpolated cdcd represents the ground truth and the standard forcing for the distributed hydrologic model watflood the formula used in calculating the anomalies expressed as percentage is given as zhao 2013 6 annual anomaly gridded capa gridded cdcd gridded cdcd 100 where gridded capa is the interpolated annual precipitation capa and gridded cdcd is the interpolated annual precipitation cdcd anomalies quantification provided direct comparison of the forcing data used for hydrologic modeling on pixel by pixel basis across the study region m2m results aid in determining if interpolated capa is a good alternative to interpolated cdcd as a hydrologic forcing for distributed hydrologic models 2 5 proxy validation using the watflood hydrologic model according to kouwen 2015 watflood is a fully distributed semi physically based hydrological model that simulates the hydrologic budget of a watershed using an integrated set of programs watersheds are represented using grouped response units gru integrating grid elevation to determine flow path direction and percentage land cover units grus enable watflood to capture the spatial variability of hydrological dynamics from interpolated heterogeneous input datasets with improved computational efficiency watflood surface process representations include hydrological storages such as soil upper zone surface ponding vegetation interception snow accumulation and snow ablation they also include fluxes such as infiltration evaporation snow melt interflow recharge base flow overland flow wetland dynamics and channel routing kouwen 2015 zhao 2013 processes are computed every time step hourly for every land class unit and are controlled by parameters defining soils river routing and land cover classification characteristics zhao 2013 stadnyk et al 2005 watflood was chosen for this study because manitoba hydro s water resource engineering department had previously setup operational watflood models within the nelson churchill domain for use in both short and long term water resource studies the lwb watershed model used in this study was previously calibrated by manitoba hydro using the ahccd data from 1985 to 1995 this interpolation method is based on assigning four quadrants per grid centered at the centroid of each grid with the nearest weather stations to each quadrant weighted against the distance to the midpoint precipitation is therefore geometrically averaged among all four quadrants to generate the precipitation estimate for that grid zhao 2013 wei and mcguiness 1973 watflood performance may therefore be biased toward interpolated station observations based on the model s calibration however for this study it was desirable to assess the strength reliability and accuracy of capa as an alternative not primary data source particularly in regions with few observation stations watflood requires input data to have approximately the same spatial resolution 10 15km as the model discretization therefore capa s 10km interpolated output is well suited as a forcing product for watflood streamflow simulations using the two interpolated precipitation products will be compared with the hydrometric data discharge collected from the water survey of canada database called hydat https ec gc ca rhc wsc default asp lang en n 9018b5ec 1 for this analysis this flow data will be called observed as shown in fig 1 there are two large lakes at the center of the basin lwb receives flows from several rivers such as the assiniboine saskatchewan winnipeg and red rivers the basin outlet is located at the northern end of lake winnipeg routing flow through the nelson river and into the lower nelson river basin zhao 2013 province of manitoba 2016 as well there are 19 reservoirs present the existing model set up of lwb by manitoba hydro streamflow at the outlet of lwb is partially regulated by the jenpeg generating station and control structure located on the nelson river s western channel due to large inflows from upstream watersheds and the storage capacity of lake winnipeg regulated to increase dependable hydroelectric energy production downstream and reduce lake winnipeg shoreline flooding the rainfall runoff response at the outlet of lwb is de coupled zhao 2013 province of manitoba 2016 in other words there is little variation in the streamflow at this outlet in response to changes in local precipitation for this reason the flow station at bloodvein river an unregulated tributary of lake winnipeg sub basin 19 05rb003 shown in fig 1 was selected for proxy validation using the hydrologic model to assess model performance we adopted the criteria developed by moriasi et al 2007 given as 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the model prediction and observed time series nse is defined as 9 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 where yobs and ysims ymean are the observed simulated and average of observed volumetric discharge respectively 2 percent bias pbias measures the tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts moriasi et al 2007 pbias of 0 0 accurate model agreement between observed and simulated flows small positive values of pbias

bayesian plot fig 5 for 2002 clearly indicates four seasonal aberrations and high posterior probability to each aberration equally identified this shows that bcp discriminates the seasonal pattern in both datasets similarities in terms of time series change points for both actual observation cdcd and reanalysis data capa indicates their equivalence and correspondence or thatcapa is representative of cdcd on a spatio temporal point by point basis agreement was observed for all other years 2003 2005 and there were no abrupt differences between cdcd and capa change points the posterior means of each dataset cdcd capa for each year were retained for further analysis the posterior mean in each plot for 2002 fig 5 identifies the level of seasonal change from spring to autumn i e precipitation amount the posterior means for cdcd and capa were compared for all years table 3 indicates the coefficient of determination r2 when the posterior mean values of cdcd were regressed against those of capa capa performs best in 2002 i e the year with highest number of observation stations posterior means were also compared on a seasonal basis table 4 indicating that capa performs best during the winter period r2 0 92 and has the least effective performance in summer r2 0 63 this is likely the result of gem i e capa background field having difficulties in predicting convective rainfall dominant in the summer months across the canadian prairies lespinas et al 2015 corroborate this and reported that capa analysis are found to perform best in autumn spring and winter due to gem s challenge in predicting convective precipitation due to gems low spatial resolution this point based verification is important in exploring and evaluating the internal structure of capas precipitation time series based on available observation stations relative to observations capa has well represented the number of changes seasonality and timing of change using monthly accumulations seasonality and timing are two important properties for a precipitation product that is to be used for hydrologic forcing showing that capa is a good candidate especially for locations where observation networks are sparse 3 2 spatial pattern based on anomalies and spatial autocorrelation ordinary kriging ok was used to interpolate the accumulated products providing a spatial mapping of annual precipitation for both capa and cdcd as reported by goovaerts 2000 it has been recommended that elevation should be used when the correlation between rainfall and elevation is moderate in other words it was concluded that ordinary kriging ok which ignores elevation is in fact better than linear regression when the correlation is smaller than 0 75 we used ok in this study and in all years given the correlations between elevation and annual precipitation were less than 0 2 not shown at 10km lag width or bin size preliminary variogram results not shown were developed for each of the dataset both products show evidence of trend presence variogram plots not shown according to the procedure outlined by cressie 1986 and as done by boluwade and madramootoo 2015 trends were subtracted from the data and the residuals i e difference between data and trend used for variogram analysis and kriging trends were added back before final surfaces were produced table 5 presents the variogram analysis of the residuals except in 2002 where cdcd showed no apparent trend in 2002 the range values reported in table 5 were similar the nugget variance which is the small scale variability at an infinitesimally small distance between two points i e stations shows different values for all years this indicates that the existing rain gauge network used in this study is less capable of resolving the precipitation variability nugget values of zero shown for capa in almost all years result because it is a reanalysis dataset produced through an advanced interpolation technique due to the interpolation there exists a smoothening effect that reduces or eliminates small scale variation in the dataset the nugget variance for cdcd can be attributed to error or uncertainty in the rain gauge measuring device goovaerts 2000 results also indicate the variogram range for this study area is from 44 to 120km representing the longest distance after which there is no correlation among the stations please note the sample size of available observation stations differs from year to year and also seasonally spatial correlation lengths are within the average of 100km used in the capa optimal interpolation procedure also using quebec as a case study variogram ranges from 43km to 92km were reported by mahfouf et al 2007 it should be noted however that seasonal variations would also be expected with a larger range during winter due to stratiform precipitation and shorter in summer when convective precipitation is prevalent variogram parameters were used for kriging with trend removed to create the annual areal precipitation data for both products fig 6 shows the selected kriged annual precipitation surfaces at 10km spatial resolution for two years 2002 2005 with similar results for all other years capa slightly overestimates the observed annual precipitation this maybe likely due to underestimation of gauged precipitation in winter months the spatial pattern and distributions between capa and cdcd are similar clearly showing the consistent gradient from southwest low to northeast high normally anomaly of zero signifies perfect match between capa and cdcd there is a strong negative precipitation anomaly fig 7 in the southwest region of the study area for some of the years which is consistent with the spatial variability and semi arid characteristics of this region orographic effects which are included in capa may likely contribute to the negative anomalies in this region i e capa estimate higher than gauged precipitation in other words accounting for orographic impacts in capa seems to have realistic influence orographic effects in capa are propagated from gem as background field zadra et al 2003 cote et al 1998 a strong positive precipitation anomaly i e capa less than cdcd to the northeast exists likely influenced by fewer weather stations available in the area if no gauged precipitation data at all are used in capa the analysis will equal the gem background this is not surprising since gauged observation will be more accurate than gem some inter annual spatial variability is apparent between interpolated cdcd observations and capa indicating that both precipitation products vary from year to year in terms of total precipitation amount a distributed hydrologic model like watflood is sensitive to the amount and distribution of water falling across a basin interpolated precipitation surfaces have a significant effect on simulated stream discharge fua et al 2009 shope and maharjan 2015 therefore adequate representation of precipitation patterning is important capa adequately represents both the amount and spatial distribution of precipitation across the lwb and therefore can be considered as an alternative hydrologic forcing 3 3 capa performance as a forcing for proxy validation in a distributed hydrologic modeling moriasi et al 2007 criteria to classify the performance of a hydrologic model were adopted to assess the performance of watflood driven by capa forcing nash sutcliff efficiency nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error ratio rsr for both cdcd and capa hydrologic simulations compared with observed discharge were computed table 6 nse values for the monthly streamflow ranged from 0 51 to 0 69 for capa and cdcd respectively according to moriasi et al 2007 model evaluation guidelines capa performance value nse of 0 51 is satisfactory the rsr values ranged from 0 55 to 0 69 for cdcd and capa respectively indicating model performance for streamflow residual ranged from good to satisfactory pbias values varied from 23 to 14 for capa and cdcd respectively and were rated as satisfactory where the pbias should be less than 25 cdcd performed better compared to capa across all criteria which is not surprising given the lwb model was initially calibrated by manitoba hydro using the adjusted and homogenized version of cdcd data ahccd it is therefore expected that model performance should be slightly biased towards the cdcd forcing capa performed well however and was deemed satisfactory according to all rankings defined by moriasi et al 2007 it can therefore be considered adequate for hydrologic forcing particularly in regions without sufficient observation data the hydrograph at bloodvein river flow station for the lwb indicated that both datasets as inputs to the hydrologic model tend to underestimate peak flow fig 8 capa underestimated summer monthly flows when compared with cdcd this is consistent with the p2p analysis based on season precipitation accumulation and discussed above both products adequately captured the timing of the rising limb of the hydrograph in response to rainfall events for all the years the performances of both products in predicting winter low flows vary from year to year but it seems capa is better in predicting winter precipitation in 2003 2004 resulting in better spring peak flow fig 8 it is interesting to see that capa performs as well as cdcd on a point by point basis and with regards to spatial variability and precipitation patterning this is highly relevant for regions with sparse weather networks as capa can be used as a viable alternative for hydrologic model forcing it is expected that the statistics of capa s performance hold true for other canadian watersheds and other years with similar numbers of observation stations however care must be taken when applying the conclusions of the results from this study to other areas with clear climate differences higher or lower station network density and other watershed models 4 conclusions this study assessed the correspondence between capa and the canadian daily climate data cdcd based on point to point p2p map to map m2p and as a forcing in a fully distributedhydrological model watflood results demonstrated that capa compared well with cdcd observed data across all metrics a few concluding remarks are drawn as follows 1 seasonality and timing are important attributes for any precipitation product as a forcing for hydrologic models statistics from the daily data were aggregated to monthly and seasonal time scales in this study strong correlations between capa and cdcd were found when the posterior mean values from the bayesian change point analysis were compared on an annual and seasonal basis similarities in change points for all stations across all years were similarly observed the number and timing of seasonal change computed for both datasets across all years were found to be the same showing that capa can be a feasible substitute to observed weather station data in the lwb 2 daily areal precipitation distributions are needed for fully distributed hydrologic modeling therefore spatial dependency and autocorrelation of station data interpolation for use as a hydrologic forcing is very important in essence any viable product as additional data source should have the same spatial pattern as the observed data or standard model input variogram analysis trends removed showed good agreement between the two products with individual datasets having spatial autocorrelation ranging from 48km to 120km an increasing spatial trend in precipitation amount from the southwest to northeast was captured in both products across the lwb attributed to the rocky mountains and prevailing wind direction from west to east after interpolation using ordinary kriging spatial anomalies between the two products varies from year to year capa was shown to have the same spatial properties as cdcd interpolated observations and therefore is suitable as an alternative hydrologic forcing 3 when both precipitation products were used to force a hydrological model watflood capa resulted in a satisfactory rated simulation performance according to moriasi et al 2007 the implication is that capa is a reliable option for precipitation forcing in regions of the lwb with sparse observation networks this may be a promising result for other regions of canada with sparse data networks and large watersheds but has yet to be verified in general capa may be a potential alternative to cdcd especially for moderate to large time scale seasonal or annual basis capa will continue to improve especially with the application and assimilation of satellite observations such as the global precipitation measurement gpm and introduction of gem with 2 5km spatial resolution as background field in the near future further studies should examine capa performance for hydrologic modeling purposes once these innovations and advancements are operational and across other canadian watersheds acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the associate editor and two anonymous reviewers who have help improved the quality of

7615,this study presents a three step validation technique to compare the performance of the canadian precipitation analysis capa product relative to actual observation as a hydrologic forcing in regional watershed simulation capa is an interpolated 6h or 24h accumulation reanalysis precipitation product in near real time covering all of north america the analysis procedure involves point to point p2p and map to map m2m comparisons followed by proxy validation using an operational version of the watflood hydrologic model from 2002 to 2005 in the lake winnipeg basin lwb canada the p2p technique using a bayesian change point analysis shows that capa corresponds with actual observations canadian daily climate data cdcd on both an annual and seasonal basis capa has the same spatial pattern dependency and autocorrelation properties as cdcd pixel by pixel m2m when used as hydrologic forcing in watflood results indicate that capa is a reliable product for water resource modeling and predictions but that the quality of capa data varies annually and seasonally as does the quality of observations capa proved most beneficial as a hydrologic forcing during winter seasons where observation quality is the lowest reanalysis products such as capa can be a reliable option in sparse network areas and is beneficial for regional governments when the cost of new weather stations is prohibitive keywords precipitation forcing precipitation data quality hydrologic modeling canadian precipitation analysis bayesian change point analysis spatial autocorrelation interpolation 1 introduction in many regions of the world particularly mid to high latitude regions weather station networks are sparse making precipitation analysis a challenge and generating significant errors for hydrologic modeling applications nicotina et al 2008 for example in canada there are few stations in the north where ironically much of the major hydroelectric and water resource infrastructure is located the major challenge in hydrologic modeling large watersheds such as those in canada is that weather station density is higher in the south near the american border and decreases drastically moving northward similarly coulibaly et al 2013 conducted a study on spatial analysis of the canadian national hydrometric network cnhn based on the world meteorological organization wmo guidelines for hydrometric network density their results show that approximately 12 of the terrestrial area of canada is covered by hydrometric networks in other words this is the only area that meets the wmo 2008 standards also 49 of the area is poorly gauged while the remaining 39 is ungauged this shows that most the terrestrial area of canada did not meet the wmo standard and as such precipitation patterns may not be fully represented in modeled flows from these areas providing an accurate representation of amount and the spatial variability in precipitation to a hydrologic model is therefore crucial for accurate hydrologic prediction for practical applications interpolation of precipitation estimates from weather stations is relied on to provide values for areas and across regions that are ungauged traditionally spatial interpolation techniques based on deterministic and geostatistical principles have been used ly et al 2011 deterministic interpolation methods involve the thiessen polygon thi inverse distance weighting idw polynomial interpolation pi spline interpolation si and moving window regression mwr techniques ly et al 2013 the general disadvantage of these afore mentioned techniques is their inability to quantify interpolation uncertainty geostatistical methods on the other hand involve techniques such as ordinary kriging ok simple kriging sk and universal kriging uk etc with basically every kriging method dealing with analysis of random fields z u z is random and u is the geographical coordinate index bivand et al 2008 kriging involves estimation and modeling of spatial dependency autocorrelation and verification of the stationarity assumption geostatistics methods relative to deterministic techniques generally provide improved predictions resulting from considering the spatial configurations of observations bivand et al 2008 even with geostatistical techniques the impact of spatial smoothing is a challenge boluwade and madramootoo 2013 resulting in the underestimation of large values and over estimation of small values of the variable of interest interpolation accuracy is also only as good as the number of spatial datasets used in producing the resulting interpolated surface bivand et al 2008 therefore in large mid to high latitude regions of canada there is need for better methods of precipitation representation using more advanced datasets from weather prediction models at appropriate scales for hydrologic modeling applications the development of numerical weather prediction nwp models haltiner 1971 provides a platform to predict precipitation at short time steps nwp uses current observation of weather combined with model predictions to forecast future events belair et al 2003 mailhot et al 2006 it is a procedure that applies 3 d differential atmospheric equations to estimate future states of the atmosphere that require initial conditions cote et al 1998 girard et al 2010 the regional deterministic prediction system rdps of environment canada is an operational short term nwp system developed for north america four times daily with a horizontal resolution of 10 km fortin et al 2015 rdps relies on the canadian global environmental multi scale model gem fortin et al 2015 gem is an integrated forecasting system and data assimilation platform which is based on the hydrostatic primitive equations with time discretization following an implicit two time level semi lagrangian procedure lespinas et al 2015 the performance assessment of gem as a short term forecast product has been reported by cote et al 1998 their results further demonstrated the validity and versatility of gem model gem s short range forecast is suitable for a background field for reanalysis products such as the canadian precipitation analysis capa lespinas et al 2015 capa is a joint canadian project between the meteorological research and department mrd and meteorological services of canada msc both divisions of environment canada mahfouf et al 2007 capa produces 6h and 12h accumulation of precipitation covering all of north america on a 10km grid capa assimilates the gem s short term forecasts radar precipitation estimates fortin et al 2015 satellite observation boluwade et al submitted for publication and point estimates from weather stations using an internal quality control procedure lespinas et al 2015 fortin et al 2015 capa offers potential as a forcing product for hydrologic modeling across canada particularly regions in the mid to high latitudes with sparse gauge networks however there is a need to first verify the reliability and accuracy of capas precipitation estimates such that canadian provincial agencies public institutions and interested parties may have confidence in using capa for operational decision making assessing the reliability of capa as an additional data source with actual observations must therefore involve comparisons point to point p2p map to map m2m and as a forcing for an operational hydrologic model comparing on a point basis change point analysis is a reliable technique to determine the timing and partitioning of precipitation series fortin et al 2004 fu et al 2014 gallagher et al 2012 change point analysis based on bayesian techniques can be used to help determine similarities and aberrations among the datasets where bayesian statistics outperform frequentist methods which is beneficial in quantifying uncertainty in bayesian model parameters banerjee et al 2004 comparing on a spatial or regional basis the datasets must first be interpolated which is also a necessary first step for fully distributed models such as watflood that require gridded inputs variogram analysis and kriging techniques that take care of spatial configurations of the observations can provide the spatial dependency and spatial autocorrelation properties of the datasets bivand et al 2008 furthermore the reliability of capa as an alternate precipitation forcing can be tested by using the reanalysis data in a hydrological model directly and comparing performance metrics to those obtained from forcing with gauge observations the primary focus of this paper is to assess and quantify the reliability of capa precipitation estimates as a hydrologic model forcing relative to canadian observation data on the canadian prairies the objective is to assess capa as a reliable alternative for cdcd using techniques based on p2p m2p and as a forcing for interpolated hydrologic model this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area with descriptions of the datasets capa and cdcd bayesian change point for p2p spatial pattern autocorrelation and interpolation for m2m and hydrologic modeling process using watflood section 3 presents and discusses the results finally section 4 details the conclusions and recommendations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the domain of interest in this study is the lake winnipeg basin lwb a sub watershed of the larger nelson churchill river basin ncrb draining most of central canada and the northern united states fig 1 this region was chosen because it is large spans regions that are well gauged and poorly gauged and is centered in the canadian prairies where capa performance is of operational interest to manitoba hydro a major hydroelectric utility in the province of manitoba canada the entire ncrb 1 4millionsqkm is comprised of the red river basin red winnipeg river basin wpb nelson river basin nrb saskatchewan river basin srb assiniboine river basin arb lake winnipeg basin lwb and churchill river basin crb in the center of the ncrb resides the lwb 190 000km2 within the canadian boreal plain boreal shield and prairie ecozones fig 1 agriculture and agri food canada 2013 and two very large lakes lake manitoba lake winnipeg and one smaller lake lake winnipegosis fig 1 these open surface waters dominate the watershed fig 1 and imply that there would be a relatively small runoff response from the remaining land surface fig 2 shows that land topography are highest in saskatchewan 500m and gradually decrease to about 250m in manitoba the canadian boreal shield is the largest ecozone in canada characterized by ever green vegetation which is comprised of species like spruce and fir that form dense forest vegetation covering a thin layer of soil with impermeable bedrock underneath zhao 2013 climate is characterized by long cold winters and short cool summers in the west and long cold winters but short warm summers to the east table 1 it should be noted that 39 of canada s hydroelectric capacity lies in the boreal shield ecozone 24 574mw generating about 16billion annually from 279 large dams 42 of the canadian total environment canada 2015a 2015b the canadian boreal plain is dominated by natural forest and extends through alberta saskatchewan and manitoba the landscape is flat with low valleys the rocky mountains in the west block most of the moisture being carried eastward by the jet stream smith et al 1998 table 1 larger percentages of the land mass in the prairie ecozone have been cultivated under agricultural practise the prairie ecozone climate is influenced by its location at the center of north america and the neighboring rocky mountains to the west resulting in a semi arid to sub humid climate table 1 twenty five percent of the precipitation in this ecozone falls as snow wiken 1986 1996 snow gauges have been reported to have large biases with goodison et al 1988 documenting problems with winter precipitation measurement 2 2 precipitation data description 2 2 1 canadian precipitation analysis capa capa is a precipitation analysis product developed by the meteorological service of canada that provides interpolated precipitation over north america at a spatial and temporal resolution of 10km and 6hr accumulation estimates respectively lespinas et al 2015 fortin et al 2015 it has been operational since 2011 and can be assessed online at http weather gc ca grib grib2 rdpa ps10km e html the capa methodology is based on the assimilation of different sources of datasets fig 3 such as the forecast from the numerical weather prediction nwp model point estimates from weather stations and precipitation measurements from radar data gem is a fully integrated forecast with a vertical horizontal spatial resolution of 10km over canada that runs 4 times daily and has up to 10days lead time point estimates are also assimilated from several weather networks capa assimilates using gem as the background field from the synoptic network synop which has about 300 700 manned and automatic stations respectively other networks are metar used by the aviation industry with about 1200stations rmcq quebec s provincial network with 120stations and u s shef standardized hydrological exchange format networks volunteer network 11 000 stations at 24h accumulations these stations are quality controlled before being assimilated into capa so that spurious estimates can be removed assimilation of radar started in 2014 specifically for version 4 of capa fortin et al 2015 it should be noted that radar has limited coverage mostly at the southern border with united states just recently boluwade et al submitted for publication integrated satellite observations global precipitation measurement into capa as additional data source lespinas et al 2015 did an assessment of capa over north america and found that capa produces analyses that are reliable and of good quality the authors found that capa analyses perform better in autumn spring and winter than in summer which is due to the nwp s difficulty in producing convective precipitation because of the low spatial resolution of the climate model furthermore the authors recommended that there should be a minimum of 1 17 stations per 10 000km2 in order to produce a precipitation analysis that is better than the raw gem estimates background field 2 2 2 canadian daily climate data cdcd canadian daily climate data cdcd were used in this study as actual precipitation observations collected from weather stations across the study area archives of daily variables such as precipitation temperature and so forth are provided by environment canada and are accessed online http climate weather gc ca or through a purchased cd rom data used in this study i e 2003 2005 were retrieved from the on line version environment canada 2015a 2015b with the number of stations that were active without missing values during each year of the study period summarized in table 2 to prepare the observed dataset for the verification methods used in this paper cdcd data 2002 2005 were downloaded and a python code developed to batch extract the data by selected station data were then converted into a readable format in excel with year month day and precipitation amount mm in separate columns the methodology used in this study is summarized in fig 4 adjusted and homogenized canadian climate data ahccd is the adjusted version of cdcd created at 450 gauged stations across canada with corrections made to the original cdcd due to instrument and data collection errors mekis and vincent 2011 according to mekis and hogg 1999 the current ahccd datasets is based on the first generation adjusted precipitation for canada apc1 more information on how the adjustment was done can be found in mekis 2005 and mekis and vincent 2011 lwb model was initially calibrated by manitoba hydro using this adjusted and homogenized version of cdcd we did not use this adjusted version in this analysis p2p m2m and as an hydrologic forcing because there are too few samples available 2 3 bayesian change point analysis for capa and cdcd to validate capa as a viable alternative to cdcd the nearest capa grid was compared to cdcd weather station data point data in a point to point p2p analysis no downscaling or upscaling was done to avoid station error representativeness in other words if any downscaling or upscaling is done significant biases could be introduced because the station observation data and the capa did not cover the same region ballester and moré 2007 daily observations were accumulated to monthly and seasonal spring mam march april may summer jja june july august fall son september october november and winter djf december january february precipitation totals for each of the years for both products comparisons were performed using a bayesian inference technique called the bayesian change point bcp barry and hartigan 1993 to detect the change points in seasonal accumulated capa and cdcd data the application of bcp was done using the barry and hartigan 1993 proposed bayesian model created as a markov chain monte carlo mcmc package in r statistics software by erdman and emerson 2008 the mcmc is based on the metropolis hastings with independent structure on the parameters the procedure for application of the model is summarized as erdman and emerson 2008 i form an unknown partition of the precipitation series ψ into contiguous blocks such that the means within each block are assumed equal ii there is an assumption of observation independency n μ i σ 2 and the probability of a change point at position weather station i is ξ iii the prior distribution of μ ij the mean of block at position i 1 and ending at position j is given by n μ 0 σ 0 2 j i iv independent priors are selected by barry and hartigan 1993 for μ 0 ξ σ 2 and w σ 2 σ 2 σ 0 2 where w is the ratio of signal error to error variance v these priors are given as μ 0 1 μ 0 σ 2 1 σ 2 0 σ 2 ψ 1 ψ 0 0 ψ ψ 0 w 1 w 0 0 w w 0 2 ξ 1 ξ 0 0 ξ 0 ξ b 1 1 ξ n b d ξ ξ 0 and w0 are preselected numbers in 0 1 and b is the number of blocks in the partition vi partition ψ u1 u2 un where n is the number of observations and ui 1 indicates a change point at position i 1 vii ui 0 viii each step of the markov chain at position i a value ui is drawn from the conditional distribution of ui and the current partition ix the transition probability ξ for the conditional probability of a change point at position i 1 is obtained from the simplified

w0 b0 w1 and b1 are within and between block sums of squares obtained when ui 0 and ui 1 respectively and z is the dataset in this case seasonal cdcd or capa according to erdman and emerson 2007 the tuning parameters γ and λ may take values in 0 1 this is to allow the situation where there are not too many changes i e γ is small the posterior means are updated after each iteration and conditioned on the current situation the assumption of normality in study is appropriate because of central limit theorem clt since the monthly precipitation amount is the summation of daily precipitation over time and space perreault et al 2000a 2000b lee and kim 2014 we implemented this procedure for p2p validation using r statistical software and the bcp package erdman and emerson 2007 to quantify the similarities in the monthly accumulated time series of cdcd and capa pertinent questions such as did change occur how many changes and when did they occur were addressed results assessed capa as an alternative for cdcd specifically in a region with a sparse observation network i e the lwb 2 4 spatial patterning based on spatial autocorrelation and anomalies assessment of capa relative to observed station data informs the accuracy of precipitation estimates at a point in space however it was also desirable to understand spatial patterns autocorrelation and the variability of capa relative to a cdcd interpolated grid pixel to pixel for distributed hydrologic modeling typically cdcd data are interpolated to a grid commensurate with the hydrologic model resolution and used as forcing for model simulation representing the baseline or observed input it should be noted that the idw technique is the in built interpolation engine in watflood however here we used the geostatiscal interpolation technique for the map to map m2m spatial analyses because of this technique s ability to characterize the spatial structure pattern and dependency of cdcd and capa precipitation products through variogram analysis although ly et al 2013 reported there is no significant difference between idw and ok goovaerts 2000 stated that for low density networks of rain gauges geostatistical interpolation outperforms other techniques such as idw we used ok in the gstat package in r pebesma 2004 to interpolate surfaces using the fitted covariance functions from the sample variogram to estimate the general range of spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation of the stations for both capa and cdcd precipitation products the experimental semi variogram i e variogram is defined as half the average squared difference between the pair of data goovaerts 2000 we assumed an isotropic spatial pattern i e identical variability in all directions and adopted the spherical model being the most widely applied ly et al 2011 goovaerts 2000 as the fitted theoretical model nugget is the initial semi variance when autocorrelation is highest or just the uncertainty where distance is close to 0 sill is the variance where the curve levels off and range also called the lag distance where the sill is reached after which there is no spatial correlation in the variable parameters from the spherical model are then used to create an interpolated surface through ok the resulting krigged products were used for calculation of anomalies the annual accumulated and spatially interpolated capa and cdcd were used to calculate annual anomalies with the assumption that interpolated cdcd represents the ground truth and the standard forcing for the distributed hydrologic model watflood the formula used in calculating the anomalies expressed as percentage is given as zhao 2013 6 annual anomaly gridded capa gridded cdcd gridded cdcd 100 where gridded capa is the interpolated annual precipitation capa and gridded cdcd is the interpolated annual precipitation cdcd anomalies quantification provided direct comparison of the forcing data used for hydrologic modeling on pixel by pixel basis across the study region m2m results aid in determining if interpolated capa is a good alternative to interpolated cdcd as a hydrologic forcing for distributed hydrologic models 2 5 proxy validation using the watflood hydrologic model according to kouwen 2015 watflood is a fully distributed semi physically based hydrological model that simulates the hydrologic budget of a watershed using an integrated set of programs watersheds are represented using grouped response units gru integrating grid elevation to determine flow path direction and percentage land cover units grus enable watflood to capture the spatial variability of hydrological dynamics from interpolated heterogeneous input datasets with improved computational efficiency watflood surface process representations include hydrological storages such as soil upper zone surface ponding vegetation interception snow accumulation and snow ablation they also include fluxes such as infiltration evaporation snow melt interflow recharge base flow overland flow wetland dynamics and channel routing kouwen 2015 zhao 2013 processes are computed every time step hourly for every land class unit and are controlled by parameters defining soils river routing and land cover classification characteristics zhao 2013 stadnyk et al 2005 watflood was chosen for this study because manitoba hydro s water resource engineering department had previously setup operational watflood models within the nelson churchill domain for use in both short and long term water resource studies the lwb watershed model used in this study was previously calibrated by manitoba hydro using the ahccd data from 1985 to 1995 this interpolation method is based on assigning four quadrants per grid centered at the centroid of each grid with the nearest weather stations to each quadrant weighted against the distance to the midpoint precipitation is therefore geometrically averaged among all four quadrants to generate the precipitation estimate for that grid zhao 2013 wei and mcguiness 1973 watflood performance may therefore be biased toward interpolated station observations based on the model s calibration however for this study it was desirable to assess the strength reliability and accuracy of capa as an alternative not primary data source particularly in regions with few observation stations watflood requires input data to have approximately the same spatial resolution 10 15km as the model discretization therefore capa s 10km interpolated output is well suited as a forcing product for watflood streamflow simulations using the two interpolated precipitation products will be compared with the hydrometric data discharge collected from the water survey of canada database called hydat https ec gc ca rhc wsc default asp lang en n 9018b5ec 1 for this analysis this flow data will be called observed as shown in fig 1 there are two large lakes at the center of the basin lwb receives flows from several rivers such as the assiniboine saskatchewan winnipeg and red rivers the basin outlet is located at the northern end of lake winnipeg routing flow through the nelson river and into the lower nelson river basin zhao 2013 province of manitoba 2016 as well there are 19 reservoirs present the existing model set up of lwb by manitoba hydro streamflow at the outlet of lwb is partially regulated by the jenpeg generating station and control structure located on the nelson river s western channel due to large inflows from upstream watersheds and the storage capacity of lake winnipeg regulated to increase dependable hydroelectric energy production downstream and reduce lake winnipeg shoreline flooding the rainfall runoff response at the outlet of lwb is de coupled zhao 2013 province of manitoba 2016 in other words there is little variation in the streamflow at this outlet in response to changes in local precipitation for this reason the flow station at bloodvein river an unregulated tributary of lake winnipeg sub basin 19 05rb003 shown in fig 1 was selected for proxy validation using the hydrologic model to assess model performance we adopted the criteria developed by moriasi et al 2007 given as 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nse value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the model prediction and observed time series nse is defined as 9 nse 1 i 1 n y

simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts moriasi et al 2007 pbias of 0 0 accurate model agreement between observed and simulated flows small positive values of pbias

bayesian plot fig 5 for 2002 clearly indicates four seasonal aberrations and high posterior probability to each aberration equally identified this shows that bcp discriminates the seasonal pattern in both datasets similarities in terms of time series change points for both actual observation cdcd and reanalysis data capa indicates their equivalence and correspondence or thatcapa is representative of cdcd on a spatio temporal point by point basis agreement was observed for all other years 2003 2005 and there were no abrupt differences between cdcd and capa change points the posterior means of each dataset cdcd capa for each year were retained for further analysis the posterior mean in each plot for 2002 fig 5 identifies the level of seasonal change from spring to autumn i e precipitation amount the posterior means for cdcd and capa were compared for all years table 3 indicates the coefficient of determination r2 when the posterior mean values of cdcd were regressed against those of capa capa performs best in 2002 i e the year with highest number of observation stations posterior means were also compared on a seasonal basis table 4 indicating that capa performs best during the winter period r2 0 92 and has the least effective performance in summer r2 0 63 this is likely the result of gem i e capa background field having difficulties in predicting convective rainfall dominant in the summer months across the canadian prairies lespinas et al 2015 corroborate this and reported that capa analysis are found to perform best in autumn spring and winter due to gem s challenge in predicting convective precipitation due to gems low spatial resolution this point based verification is important in exploring and evaluating the internal structure of capas precipitation time series based on available observation stations relative to observations capa has well represented the number of changes seasonality and timing of change using monthly accumulations seasonality and timing are two important properties for a precipitation product that is to be used for hydrologic forcing showing that capa is a good candidate especially for locations where observation networks are sparse 3 2 spatial pattern based on anomalies and spatial autocorrelation ordinary kriging ok was used to interpolate the accumulated products providing a spatial mapping of annual precipitation for both capa and cdcd as reported by goovaerts 2000 it has been recommended that elevation should be used when the correlation between rainfall and elevation is moderate in other words it was concluded that ordinary kriging ok which ignores elevation is in fact better than linear regression when the correlation is smaller than 0 75 we used ok in this study and in all years given the correlations between elevation and annual precipitation were less than 0 2 not shown at 10km lag width or bin size preliminary variogram results not shown were developed for each of the dataset both products show evidence of trend presence variogram plots not shown according to the procedure outlined by cressie 1986 and as done by boluwade and madramootoo 2015 trends were subtracted from the data and the residuals i e difference between data and trend used for variogram analysis and kriging trends were added back before final surfaces were produced table 5 presents the variogram analysis of the residuals except in 2002 where cdcd showed no apparent trend in 2002 the range values reported in table 5 were similar the nugget variance which is the small scale variability at an infinitesimally small distance between two points i e stations shows different values for all years this indicates that the existing rain gauge network used in this study is less capable of resolving the precipitation variability nugget values of zero shown for capa in almost all years result because it is a reanalysis dataset produced through an advanced interpolation technique due to the interpolation there exists a smoothening effect that reduces or eliminates small scale variation in the dataset the nugget variance for cdcd can be attributed to error or uncertainty in the rain gauge measuring device goovaerts 2000 results also indicate the variogram range for this study area is from 44 to 120km representing the longest distance after which there is no correlation among the stations please note the sample size of available observation stations differs from year to year and also seasonally spatial correlation lengths are within the average of 100km used in the capa optimal interpolation procedure also using quebec as a case study variogram ranges from 43km to 92km were reported by mahfouf et al 2007 it should be noted however that seasonal variations would also be expected with a larger range during winter due to stratiform precipitation and shorter in summer when convective precipitation is prevalent variogram parameters were used for kriging with trend removed to create the annual areal precipitation data for both products fig 6 shows the selected kriged annual precipitation surfaces at 10km spatial resolution for two years 2002 2005 with similar results for all other years capa slightly overestimates the observed annual precipitation this maybe likely due to underestimation of gauged precipitation in winter months the spatial pattern and distributions between capa and cdcd are similar clearly showing the consistent gradient from southwest low to northeast high normally anomaly of zero signifies perfect match between capa and cdcd there is a strong negative precipitation anomaly fig 7 in the southwest region of the study area for some of the years which is consistent with the spatial variability and semi arid characteristics of this region orographic effects which are included in capa may likely contribute to the negative anomalies in this region i e capa estimate higher than gauged precipitation in other words accounting for orographic impacts in capa seems to have realistic influence orographic effects in capa are propagated from gem as background field zadra et al 2003 cote et al 1998 a strong positive precipitation anomaly i e capa less than cdcd to the northeast exists likely influenced by fewer weather stations available in the area if no gauged precipitation data at all are used in capa the analysis will equal the gem background this is not surprising since gauged observation will be more accurate than gem some inter annual spatial variability is apparent between interpolated cdcd observations and capa indicating that both precipitation products vary from year to year in terms of total precipitation amount a distributed hydrologic model like watflood is sensitive to the amount and distribution of water falling across a basin interpolated precipitation surfaces have a significant effect on simulated stream discharge fua et al 2009 shope and maharjan 2015 therefore adequate representation of precipitation patterning is important capa adequately represents both the amount and spatial distribution of precipitation across the lwb and therefore can be considered as an alternative hydrologic forcing 3 3 capa performance as a forcing for proxy validation in a distributed hydrologic modeling moriasi et al 2007 criteria to classify the performance of a hydrologic model were adopted to assess the performance of watflood driven by capa forcing nash sutcliff efficiency nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error ratio rsr for both cdcd and capa hydrologic simulations compared with observed discharge were computed table 6 nse values for the monthly streamflow ranged from 0 51 to 0 69 for capa and cdcd respectively according to moriasi et al 2007 model evaluation guidelines capa performance value nse of 0 51 is satisfactory the rsr values ranged from 0 55 to 0 69 for cdcd and capa respectively indicating model performance for streamflow residual ranged from good to satisfactory pbias values varied from 23 to 14 for capa and cdcd respectively and were rated as satisfactory where the pbias should be less than 25 cdcd performed better compared to capa across all criteria which is not surprising given the lwb model was initially calibrated by manitoba hydro using the adjusted and homogenized version of cdcd data ahccd it is therefore expected that model performance should be slightly biased towards the cdcd forcing capa performed well however and was deemed satisfactory according to all rankings defined by moriasi et al 2007 it can therefore be considered adequate for hydrologic forcing particularly in regions without sufficient observation data the hydrograph at bloodvein river flow station for the lwb indicated that both datasets as inputs to the hydrologic model tend to underestimate peak flow fig 8 capa underestimated summer monthly flows when compared with cdcd this is consistent with the p2p analysis based on season precipitation accumulation and discussed above both products adequately captured the timing of the rising limb of the hydrograph in response to rainfall events for all the years the performances of both products in predicting winter low flows vary from year to year but it seems capa is better in predicting winter precipitation in 2003 2004 resulting in better spring peak flow fig 8 it is interesting to see that capa performs as well as cdcd on a point by point basis and with regards to spatial variability and precipitation patterning this is highly relevant for regions with sparse weather networks as capa can be used as a viable alternative for hydrologic model forcing it is expected that the statistics of capa s performance hold true for other canadian watersheds and other years with similar numbers of observation stations however care must be taken when applying the conclusions of the results from this study to other areas with clear climate differences higher or lower station network density and other watershed models 4 conclusions this study assessed the correspondence between capa and the canadian daily climate data cdcd based on point to point p2p map to map m2p and as a forcing in a fully distributedhydrological model watflood results demonstrated that capa compared well with cdcd observed data across all metrics a few concluding remarks are drawn as follows 1 seasonality and timing are important attributes for any precipitation product as a forcing for hydrologic models statistics from the daily data were aggregated to monthly and seasonal time scales in this study strong correlations between capa and cdcd were found when the posterior mean values from the bayesian change point analysis were compared on an annual and seasonal basis similarities in change points for all stations across all years were similarly observed the number and timing of seasonal change computed for both datasets across all years were found to be the same showing that capa can be a feasible substitute to observed weather station data in the lwb 2 daily areal precipitation distributions are needed for fully distributed hydrologic modeling therefore spatial dependency and autocorrelation of station data interpolation for use as a hydrologic forcing is very important in essence any viable product as additional data source should have the same spatial pattern as the observed data or standard model input variogram analysis trends removed showed good agreement between the two products with individual datasets having spatial autocorrelation ranging from 48km to 120km an increasing spatial trend in precipitation amount from the southwest to northeast was captured in both products across the lwb attributed to the rocky mountains and prevailing wind direction from west to east after interpolation using ordinary kriging spatial anomalies between the two products varies from year to year capa was shown to have the same spatial properties as cdcd interpolated observations and therefore is suitable as an alternative hydrologic forcing 3 when both precipitation products were used to force a hydrological model watflood capa resulted in a satisfactory rated simulation performance according to moriasi et al 2007 the implication is that capa is a reliable option for precipitation forcing in regions of the lwb with sparse observation networks this may be a promising result for other regions of canada with sparse data networks and large watersheds but has yet to be verified in general capa may be a potential alternative to cdcd especially for moderate to large time scale seasonal or annual basis capa will continue to improve especially with the application and assimilation of satellite observations such as the global precipitation measurement gpm and introduction of gem with 2 5km spatial resolution as background field in the near future further studies should examine capa performance for hydrologic modeling purposes once these innovations and advancements are operational and across other canadian watersheds acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the associate editor and two anonymous reviewers who have help improved the quality of

7616,air pollution represents a critical issue in milan urban area northern italy here the levels of fine particles increase overcoming the legal limits mostly in wintertime due to favourable calm weather conditions and large heating and vehicular traffic emissions the main goal of this work is to quantify the aerosol removal effect due to precipitation at the ground at first the scavenging coefficients have been calculated for aerosol particles with diameter between 0 25 and 3μm the average values of this coefficient vary between 2 10 5 and 5 10 5 s 1 then the aerosol removal induced separately by precipitation and wind have been compared through the introduction of a removal index as a matter of fact while precipitation leads to a proper wet scavenging of the particles from the atmosphere high wind speeds cause enhanced particle dispersion and dilution that locally bring to a tangible decrease of aerosol particles number the removal triggered by these two forcings showed comparable average values but different trends the removal efficiency of precipitation lightly increases with the increase of particle diameters and vice versa happens with strong winds keywords precipitation scavenging wind dispersion urban aerosol particle removal 1 introduction milan is the most industrialized and densely populated city of northern italy and is characterized by aerosol concentrations which often exceed the limits set by the european air quality directive commission and directive 2008 its location in the middle of the po valley is characterized by the presence of the alps to the north and west sides and the appennines to the south side which form a natural barrier protecting the city and generally the valley from the major circulations coming from northern europe and from the sea consequently rainfall events are limited the average annual precipitation is less than 1000mm and winds are generally weak or absent in milan the suburbs are in continuous demographic growth the metropolitan area reaches about 6 000 000 residents silibello et al 2008 causing an increase of vehicular traffic in wintertime the coupling of traffic and heating emissions together with calm weather and frequent thermal inversions worsen the air pollution conditions making milan to be one of the most polluted cities in all the european continent however some cities of the po valley such as cremona pavia or turin and also some industrial areas such as the one in brescia can have aerosol concentrations comparable with the ones in milan due to the specific orographic and geomorphological characteristics of this region the high suspended aerosol concentrations in low atmosphere cause short term health effects and increases the possibility of contracting serious acute or chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases pope 2000 the reduction of visibility schwartz 1996 and the modification of the local climate through the alteration of earth s radiation balance finlayson pitts and pitts 2000 are two additional environmental issues related to this phenomenon under this context it is important to understand what are the natural mechanisms which can decrease the aerosol particles numbers and how they work firstly the precipitation plays an important role in aerosol removal through the below cloud scavenging process by which the falling particles rain droplets and ice crystals deposits aerosol particles on the ground surface this process is influenced by rain droplet size distribution rain intensity and collision efficiency between particles and rain droplets seinfeld and pandis 2006 laakso et al 2003 the latter is affected by two main phenomena brownian diffusion and inertial impaction the aerosol particles in the atmosphere move according to a random motion the brownian diffusion which decreases with the increasing of the particle size d p 0 2 μm some of these particles collide with the falling raindrops and are deposited on the ground the deposition increases with the decrease of the particle diameter conversely inertial impaction is a process characteristic of particles above a certain size typically d p 1 μm which thanks to their inertia are not able to follow the streamlines of the raindrops and thus easily impact the drops surface for these reasons the scavenging efficiency reaches a minimum in the range between 0 2 and 1μm which is usually defined as the greenfield gap greenfield 1957 particles in this range are too big to be affected by brownian diffusion but at the same time they do not have enough mass to be exposed to inertial impaction secondly high wind speeds clean the atmosphere by dispersing and diluting the aerosol particles and preventing local accumulations hussein et al 2006 kgabi and mokgwetsi 2009 hussein et al 2011 the occurring of high wind speeds 5m s or greater in a urban and air polluted area like milan where several aerosol anthropogenic sources are located causes an average local decreasing of aerosol particles numbers for this reason the wind dispersion can be viewed as a local removal process what one can expect is a wind removal efficiency which is negatively correlated with the aerosol particle size harrison et al 2001 the smallest and lightest particles which are usually suspended for long periods in the atmosphere can be easily dispersed and diluted by the action of high wind speed causing a local decrease of the fine particles concentration the largest and heaviest particles characterized by short suspension time can be transported for shorter distances and can also be subjected to resuspension phenomena due to turbulent air flows caused by the blowing of strong winds under this process the particles that were previously deposited on the surface of any substrate are resuspended therefore it is possible to measure local and temporal increase of the coarse particles concentration it is important to clarify that these assumptions are true when the study area is far away from the sea in this case high wind speed can bring to an increase of the aerosol numeric concentration because of sea salt particles production at the ocean surface by bursting of air bubbles resulting from the entrainment of air induced by wind stress pant et al 2008 there are different studies davenport and peters 1978 nicholson et al 1991 volken and schumann 1993 mircea et al 2000 laakso et al 2003 chate and pranesha 2004 maria and russell 2005 andronache et al 2006 zikova and zdimal 2016 where precipitation scavenging coefficients have been calculated for different size ranges and usually compared to theoretical predictions in almost all these works the analyses have been performed in sub rural sites or in areas characterized by an overall aerosol load lower than the one in milan here we calculated the rain scavenging coefficient within milan urban area for aerosol particles in 0 25 3μm size interval and we compared the results with the studies of davenport and peters 1978 and of volken and schumann 1993 analysing any similarity and dissimilarity furthermore we compared the removal efficiency of precipitation and winds through the introduction of a removal index in order to clarify how these two processes act the paper is organized as follows a summary of the theory of the aerosol removal mechanisms is reported in section 2 the instruments the data acquisition and processing are presented in section 3 the results are discussed in section 4 the conclusions are given in the last section 2 theory of the mechanisms of aerosol removal during a precipitation event some of the precipitation particles falling through the air collide with the aerosol particles collecting and taking them at the ground this process is called precipitation below cloud scavenging the temporal variability of the aerosol concentration due to this mechanism is described by eq 1 seinfeld and pandis 2006 1 d c d p d t λ c d p where c is the concentration of the aerosol particles with equivalent diameter d p μm and λ 1 s is the scavenging coefficient due to precipitation collection many factors influence this coefficient the size of the aerosol particle the size the velocity and the concentration of the precipitation particles the collection efficiency of precipitation since all of these are usually unknown it is possible to indirectly calculate the scavenging coefficient assuming that rain collection is the only aerosol removal mechanism by integrating eq 1 in time sperber and hameed 1986 laakso et al 2003 2 λ d p 1 t 1 t 0 ln c 0 d p c 1 d p in eq 2 all the terms involved are known c 0 and c 1 are the aerosol concentrations at the beginning t 0 and at the end t 1 of the rain event while t 1 t 0 is the event duration in seconds when precipitation scavenging cannot be considered the unique mechanism influencing the aerosol dynamics eq 1 should be written as 3 d c d p d t λ c d p d c d p d t advection d c d p d t hygr growth d c d p d t turb mixing d c d p d t instr errors d c d p d t emissions eq 3 shows some of the most important mechanisms advection hygroscopic growth turbulent mixing instrumental errors aerosol emissions whose influences cannot be easily ignored when one wants to investigate the aerosol dynamics in some cases these contributions can indeed be greater than the effect of precipitation collection conversely if there are no other contributions except precipitation removal all the right terms of eq 3 except the precipitation collection can be neglected laakso et al 2003 for example the air mass changes due to horizontal and vertical advection can cause errors in the evaluation of the precipitation scavenging efficiency this effect is low when stratiform winter events are taken into account high relative humidity causes the hygroscopic growth of small particles leading to an increase of coarse particles and to a decrease of fine particles turbulent mixing can bring to space and temporal changes of aerosol concentration by mixing two different air masses with different aerosol levels the instrumental errors are often due to wrong calibrations of the instruments or discrepancies caused by the different location of the instruments in case rain and aerosol concentration are not measured in the same exact site furthermore when there is a very small number of aerosol particles high fluctuations in the collection scavenging efficiency can be found for example in a urban and very polluted site as milan the number of particles greater than 3μm is heavy less than 100 and the correspondent value of the scavenging coefficient is characterized by a low level of significance besides it is important not to forget the influence of the numerous punctual aerosol emissions features of an urban site in particular the vehicular traffic is characterized by a recursive trend consisting of two positive peaks corresponding to work school entrance and exit which lead to an increment of the aerosol concentration in order to determine the scavenging coefficient the contributions of the non collection terms have to be considered given the difficulties in the determination of the former contributions in this work we applied a strict selection criterion of the rain events as explained in the next section making legitimate to neglect the terms different from precipitation removal and allowing to use eq 2 for the calculation of the scavenging coefficient according to the limitation of eq 2 valid for the precipitation mechanism only and in order to make a comparison between the aerosol removal operated by precipitation and the aerosol removal induced by wind dispersion and dilution considered as occurring independent mechanisms we have introduced a simple removal index ρ defined as follows 4 ρ d p 1 t 1 t 0 c 0 d p c 1 d p c 0 d p similarly to λ ρ is expressed in s 1 and is characterized by positive values when the aerosol concentration decreases c 0 and c 1 are the aerosol concentrations at the beginning t 0 and at the end t 1 of the rain or wind event while t 1 t 0 is the event duration in seconds in particular according to this index the removal efficiency is proportional to the variation of the aerosol concentration in a certain time range thus the need to compare two very different removal mechanisms as precipitation scavenging and wind dispersion and dilution is behind the use of this generic index 3 measurements 3 1 data acquisition here measurements of particle size distribution rain intensity and wind speed have been analysed and a total of 10 rain events and 10 wind events have been selected since the data do not come from a unique campaign they are not continuous in time the analysis is limited to the periods 26 01 12 17 04 12 29 07 12 12 12 12 18 02 15 09 07 15 data of numeric particle concentration have been collected as number of particles per liter with 1min time resolution classified in 31 size bins between 0 25 to 32μm using an opc grimm optical particle counter these measurements have been performed by arpa lombardia regional agency for environment protection at the monitoring site pascal citt a studi station for the year 2012 and at the temporal monitoring site bonardi citt a studi for the year 2015 precipitation has been measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge and wind speed and direction by an anemometer at lambrate station arpa lombardia the data of relative humidity and temperature used for the selection of the events come from this station too the three measurement sites are located downtown milan in a homogeneous urban background area representative of the urban environment see fig 1 for a detailed analysis of the counting statistic of aerosol concentration see lonati et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2007 3 2 data processing the main goal of this work is to determine the removal efficiency of precipitation scavenging and also compare it with the removal efficiency of wind dispersion and dilution thus it was necessary to select respectively rain and wind events which were not influenced by each other and by the other issues listed in eq 3 volken and schumann 1993 kyrö et al et al 2009 paramonov et al 2011 with this aim meteorological variables have been analysed in order to select rain or wind events during which precipitation scavenging or wind removal was supposed to be the main cause for the change in concentration the first step for estimating of precipitation scavenging was the selection of events with a minimum length of 2h to avoid misrepresentations in order to prevent situations of air mass changes and turbulent mixing only precipitation events characterized by small variations of temperature wind speed and wind direction have been considered in addition since changes in relative humidity can cause hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles restrictions on relative humidity have also been adopted in particular the following limitations have been applied temperature 5 c relative humidity 20 wind speed 3m s wind direction 45 then in order to avoid instrumental errors a 3μm diameter upper threshold was considered for calculating the changes of aerosol concentration this because in milan coarse particles with diameter larger than 3μm are quite always numerically limited to less than some tens consequently the aerosol removal fluctuates too much to be considered statistically significant furthermore the events with evident and unexplainable growth of aerosol concentration were discarded in particular vehicular traffic causes a marked increase of the aerosol levels especially during the two rush hours occurring between 7 00 and 9 00 and between 17 30 and 19 30 in order to minimize this effect the data occurring during the two rush hours were discarded the events were broken into sub events and the final total removal was calculated as the mean of the sub events removal following the previous criteria a total of 10 rain events with average intensity of 1 06mm h was selected see table 1 and for all of them both the scavenging coefficient and the removal index were calculated we consider as wind event a period of time in which the wind speed reaches or exceeds a certain threshold for a minimum time duration for this study we have considered a threshold of 5m s and a minimum time duration of 3h in order to avoid the influence of wet scavenging only wind events not affected by precipitation were considered consequently a total of 10 wind events with average speed of 6 5m s were selected see table 2 and for each of them the removal index was calculated 4 results and discussion firstly the average scavenging coefficient calculated during precipitation events is shown and compared with other studies in literature then the removals triggered by precipitation scavenging for the 10 rain events and by dispersion and dilution for the 10 wind events have been analysed in terms of removal index and compared 4 1 rain scavenging each rain event is characterized by the fact that precipitation can be considered the major mechanism of aerosol removal the wind speeds are always small lower than 3m s and the events are characterized by an average rain intensity of 1 06mm h which mainly implies stratiform type events and thus low thermophoretic forces influence the average scavenging coefficient as a function of particle diameter is reported in table 3 as already mentioned the coefficient has been calculated only for particles in the range 0 25 3μm given the extremely limited numbers of particles related to the largest size classes according to the theory the size range related to the minimum collection efficiency the greenfield gap can be located around 0 2 1μm for this reason what we expected to see is an increase of the scavenging coefficient with the increase of the particles diameter in this case study for the majority of the events λ tends to increase until the particle diameter is around 0 5μm which can be interpreted as a local maximum after that the tendencies vary case by case and it is difficult to find an evident general trend the variations of λ for each diameter class are widespread reaching usually a factor of 10 with a peak up to 1000 in one case thus the values of the calculated scavenging coefficient as a function of the particle diameter do not agree with the behavior predicted by the greenfield gap this countertrend can be explained by considering that the study area is characterized by high aerosol levels which can greatly increase in short times due to the numerous punctual anthropogenic sources light rain events as the ones selected here sometimes are not able to efficiently contrast these particles increases the geometric mean of the 10 events is shown in fig 2 continuous line together with the results of other two studies carried by volken and schumann 1993 dashed line and davenport and peters davenport and peters 1978 diamods in these two studies the precipitation scavenging is analysed considering stratiform type rain events the average rain intensity was about 0 8mm h and 2mm h respectively which are similar to the ones examined here the differences in the aerosol characteristics are more marked instead because none of the two studies analyses a polluted site as milan volken and schumann analysed data from a field campaign at mt rigi switzerland with a pollutant load typical of semi rural site they found scavenging coefficients which are comparable with our results in the size range 1 3μm but smaller of about 3 times in the range 0 25 1μm however the most interesting thing is the presence of a local maximum which is shifted left to 1μm and is about 1 5 times lower than the peak found in milan probably the different characteristics of the aerosol can explain this displacement davenport and peters analysed 3 rain events in lexington kentucky usa limiting their analyses in two subranges 0 4 and 10μm of the size distribution unlike the theory and according to our results they found a less pronounced dependence of λ on particle diameter furthermore the scavenging coefficients related to the subrange of 0 4μm agree with our results 4 2 comparison between precipitation and wind removal the precipitation scavenging is one of the most efficient cleaning mechanism of the atmosphere our analyses demonstrate that dispersion and dilution carried out by the occurrence of high wind speeds are able to locally clean the atmosphere in a similar way in order to compare the two mechanisms the removal index introduced in section 3 has been used as performance indicator the values of ρ calculated for the 10 rain events dark grey boxplots ρ rain and the values of ρ calculated for the 10 wind events light grey boxplots ρ wind are shown in fig 3 as function of the particle diameter together with the respective geometric means dark grey line rain and light grey line wind firsty we can see that the variability of ρ rain values around their geometric mean is generally smaller than the variability of ρ wind values around their geometric mean this is especially true if we consider the largest diameter classes in which ρ wind seems to be very unstable reaching also negative values it is worth noting that the plot is reported in logarithmic scales thus the negative values of the removal index that are more and more frequent with the increase of the sample size cannot be shown one of the reasons explaining this behaviour is the occurrence of resuspension phenomena strong wind speeds as the ones analysed here can resuspend the coarse aerosol particles already deposited at the ground causing local increase of the numeric aerosol concentration even if the wind removal is characterized by greater variations the geometric means of the removal index for precipitation and wind show comparable average values 1 7 10 5 s 1 for precipitation and 1 10 5 s 1 for wind in particular for diameters smaller than 1 5μm the geometric mean of ρ rain varies between 1 3 10 5 and 2 10 5 s 1 with a small pick around 0 5μm the geometric mean of ρ wind varies between 1 3 10 5 and 2 3 10 5 s 1 showing a light negative trend for diameter larger than 1 5μm ρ rain remains quite constant around 1 5 10 5 s 1 while ρ wind undergoes a deep fall toward negative values thus concerning the aerosol removal due to precipitation there is not a visible positive trend with aerosol particle diameter contrary to what expected by the theory as similarly shown by the scavenging coefficient this is probably linked to the high variability of the aerosol dynamics strongly influenced by the presence of local anthropogenic aerosol sources that in short time can alter the aerosol concentration concerning the aerosol removal due to wind the expected negative trend has been confirmed by the results and resuspension phenomena can be considered as the main cause of coarse particles increases and thus negative ρ values 5 conclusions here the below cloud scavenging removal mechanism has been studied in milan urban area ten rain events have been accurately selected in the years 2012 and 2015 and the scavenging coefficients for aerosol particles between 0 25 and 3μm have been calculated the average values of this coefficient vary between 2 10 5 and 5 10 5 s 1 and are comparable with other studies in literature volken and schumann 1993 davenport and peters 1978 the precipitation scavenging efficiency has been compared to the removal efficiency due to the occurrence of high wind speeds through the introduction of a removal index ten wind events characterized by wind speed higher than 5m s have been selected in the years 2012 and 2015 the results show comparable average values of the removal index 1 7 10 5 s 1 for precipitation and 1 10 5 s 1 for wind removal but different trends considering the variation of the removal index as function of the aerosol particle diameter if the removal efficiency of precipitation tends to lightly increase with the increase of particle diameters the removal efficiency of strong winds sharply drop down for particles larger than 1 5μm the analyses have also shown the complexity and variability of aerosol dynamics in urban centers like milan whose characteristics make tricky the evaluation of the relative weights of the different removal mechanisms in particular the countless local aerosol emissions can greatly affect the analyses regardless of the scrupulous events selection applied to avoid the disturbances these local emissions continuously raise up the particles concentration and consequently can cause distorted evaluations of the effective aerosol removal acknowledgement the authors want to thanks

precipitation scavenging wind dispersion urban aerosol particle removal 1 introduction milan is the most industrialized and densely populated city of northern italy and is characterized by aerosol concentrations which often exceed the limits set by the european air quality directive commission and directive 2008 its location in the middle of the po valley is characterized by the presence of the alps to the north and west sides and the appennines to the south side which form a natural barrier protecting the city and generally the valley from the major circulations coming from northern europe and from the sea consequently rainfall events are limited the average annual precipitation is less than 1000mm and winds are generally weak or absent in milan the suburbs are in continuous demographic growth the metropolitan area reaches about 6 000 000 residents silibello et al 2008 causing an increase of vehicular traffic in wintertime the coupling of traffic and heating emissions together with calm weather and frequent thermal inversions worsen the air pollution conditions making milan to be one of the most polluted cities in all the european continent however some cities of the po valley such as cremona pavia or turin and also some industrial areas such as the one in brescia can have aerosol concentrations comparable with the ones in milan due to the specific orographic and geomorphological characteristics of this region the high suspended aerosol concentrations in low atmosphere cause short term health effects and increases the possibility of contracting serious acute or chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases pope 2000 the reduction of visibility schwartz 1996 and the modification of the local climate through the alteration of earth s radiation balance finlayson pitts and pitts 2000 are two additional environmental issues related to this phenomenon under this context it is important to understand what are the natural mechanisms which can decrease the aerosol particles numbers and how they work firstly the precipitation plays an important role in aerosol removal through the below cloud scavenging process by which the falling particles rain droplets and ice crystals deposits aerosol particles on the ground surface this process is influenced by rain droplet size distribution rain intensity and collision efficiency between particles and rain droplets seinfeld and pandis 2006 laakso et al 2003 the latter is affected by two main phenomena brownian diffusion and inertial impaction the aerosol particles in the atmosphere move according to a random motion the brownian diffusion which decreases with the increasing of the particle size d p 0 2 μm some of these particles collide with the falling raindrops and are deposited on the ground the deposition increases with the decrease of the particle diameter conversely inertial impaction is a process characteristic of particles above a certain size typically d p 1 μm which thanks to their inertia are not able to follow the streamlines of the raindrops and thus easily impact the drops surface for these reasons the scavenging efficiency reaches a minimum in the range between 0 2 and 1μm which is usually defined as the greenfield gap greenfield 1957 particles in this range are too big to be affected by brownian diffusion but at the same time they do not have enough mass to be exposed to inertial impaction secondly high wind speeds clean the atmosphere by dispersing and diluting the aerosol particles and preventing local accumulations hussein et al 2006 kgabi and mokgwetsi 2009 hussein et al 2011 the occurring of high wind speeds 5m s or greater in a urban and air polluted area like milan where several aerosol anthropogenic sources are located causes an average local decreasing of aerosol particles numbers for this reason the wind dispersion can be viewed as a local removal process what one can expect is a wind removal efficiency which is negatively correlated with the aerosol particle size harrison et al 2001 the smallest and lightest particles which are usually suspended for long periods in the atmosphere can be easily dispersed and diluted by the action of high wind speed causing a local decrease of the fine particles concentration the largest and heaviest particles characterized by short suspension time can be transported for shorter distances and can also be subjected to resuspension phenomena due to turbulent air flows caused by the blowing of strong winds under this process the particles that were previously deposited on the surface of any substrate are resuspended therefore it is possible to measure local and temporal increase of the coarse particles concentration it is important to clarify that these assumptions are true when the study area is far away from the sea in this case high wind speed can bring to an increase of the aerosol numeric concentration because of sea salt particles production at the ocean surface by bursting of air bubbles resulting from the entrainment of air induced by wind stress pant et al 2008 there are different studies davenport and peters 1978 nicholson et al 1991 volken and schumann 1993 mircea

size ranges and usually compared to theoretical predictions in almost all these works the analyses have been performed in sub rural sites or in areas characterized by an overall aerosol load lower than the one in milan here we calculated the rain scavenging coefficient within milan urban area for aerosol particles in 0 25 3μm size interval and we compared the results with the studies of davenport and peters 1978 and of volken and schumann 1993 analysing any similarity and dissimilarity furthermore we compared the removal efficiency of precipitation and winds through the introduction of a removal index in order to clarify how these two processes act the paper is organized as follows a summary of the theory of the aerosol removal mechanisms is reported in section 2 the instruments the data acquisition and processing are presented in section 3 the results are discussed in section 4 the conclusions are given in the last section 2 theory of the mechanisms of aerosol removal during a precipitation event some of the precipitation particles falling through the air collide with the aerosol particles collecting and taking them at the ground this process is called precipitation below cloud scavenging the temporal variability of the aerosol concentration due to this mechanism is described by eq 1 seinfeld and pandis 2006 1 d c d p d t λ c d p where c is the concentration of the aerosol particles with equivalent diameter d p μm and λ 1 s is the scavenging coefficient due to precipitation collection many factors influence this coefficient the size of the aerosol particle the size the velocity and the concentration of the precipitation particles the collection efficiency of precipitation since all of these are usually unknown it is possible to indirectly calculate the

eq 2 all the terms involved are known c 0 and c 1 are the aerosol concentrations at the beginning t 0 and at the end t 1 of the rain event while t 1 t 0 is the event duration in seconds when

p d t turb mixing d c d p d t instr errors d c d p d t emissions eq 3 shows some of the most important mechanisms advection hygroscopic growth turbulent mixing instrumental errors aerosol emissions whose influences cannot be easily ignored when one wants to investigate the aerosol dynamics in some cases these contributions can indeed be greater than the effect of precipitation collection conversely if there are no other contributions except precipitation removal all the right terms of eq 3 except the precipitation collection can be neglected laakso et al 2003 for example the air mass changes due to horizontal and vertical advection can cause errors in the evaluation of the precipitation scavenging efficiency this effect is low when stratiform winter events are taken into account high relative humidity causes the hygroscopic growth of small particles leading to an increase of coarse particles and to a decrease of fine particles turbulent mixing can bring to space and temporal changes of aerosol concentration by mixing two different air masses with different aerosol levels the instrumental errors are often due to wrong calibrations of the instruments or discrepancies caused by the different location of the instruments in case rain and aerosol concentration are not measured in the same exact site furthermore when there is a very small number of aerosol particles high fluctuations in the collection scavenging efficiency can be found for example in a urban and very polluted site as milan the number of particles greater than 3μm is heavy less than 100 and the correspondent value of the scavenging coefficient is characterized by a low level of significance besides it is important not to forget the influence of the numerous punctual aerosol emissions

removal and allowing to use eq 2 for the calculation of the scavenging coefficient according to the limitation of eq 2 valid for the precipitation mechanism only and in order to make a comparison between the aerosol removal operated by precipitation and the aerosol removal induced by wind dispersion and dilution considered as occurring independent mechanisms we have introduced a simple removal index ρ defined as follows 4 ρ d p 1 t 1 t 0 c 0 d p c 1 d p c 0 d p similarly to λ ρ is expressed in s 1 and is characterized by positive values when the aerosol concentration decreases c 0 and c 1 are the aerosol concentrations at the beginning t 0 and at the end t 1 of the rain or wind event while t 1 t 0 is the event duration in seconds in particular according to this index the removal efficiency is proportional to the variation of the aerosol concentration in a certain time range thus the need to compare two very different removal mechanisms as precipitation scavenging and wind dispersion and dilution is behind the use of this generic index 3 measurements 3 1 data acquisition here measurements of particle size distribution rain intensity and wind speed have been analysed and a total of 10 rain events and 10 wind events have been selected since the data do not come from a unique campaign they are not continuous in time the analysis is limited to the periods 26 01 12 17 04 12 29 07 12 12 12 12 18 02 15 09 07 15 data of numeric particle concentration have been collected as number of particles per liter with 1min time resolution classified in 31 size bins between 0 25 to 32μm using an opc grimm optical particle counter these measurements have been performed by arpa lombardia regional agency for environment protection at the monitoring site pascal citt a studi station for the year 2012 and at the temporal monitoring site bonardi citt a studi for the year 2015 precipitation has been measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge and wind speed and direction by an anemometer at lambrate station arpa lombardia the data of relative humidity and temperature used for the selection of the events come from this station too the three measurement sites are located downtown milan in a homogeneous urban background area representative of the urban environment see fig 1 for a detailed analysis of the counting statistic of aerosol concentration see lonati et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2007 3 2 data processing the main goal of this work is to determine the removal efficiency of precipitation scavenging and also compare it with the removal efficiency of wind dispersion and dilution thus it was necessary to select respectively rain and wind events which were not influenced by each other and by the other issues listed in eq 3 volken and schumann 1993 kyrö et al et al 2009 paramonov et al 2011 with this aim meteorological variables have been analysed in order to select rain or wind events during which precipitation scavenging or wind removal was supposed to be the main cause for the change in concentration the first step for estimating of precipitation scavenging was the selection of events with a minimum length of 2h to avoid misrepresentations in order to prevent situations of air mass changes and turbulent mixing only precipitation events characterized by small variations of temperature wind speed and wind direction have been considered in addition since changes in relative humidity can cause hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles restrictions on relative humidity have also been adopted in particular the following limitations have been applied temperature 5 c relative humidity 20 wind speed 3m s wind direction 45 then in order to avoid instrumental errors a 3μm diameter upper threshold was considered for calculating the changes of aerosol concentration this because in milan coarse particles with diameter larger than 3μm are quite always numerically limited to less than some tens consequently the aerosol removal fluctuates too much to be considered statistically significant furthermore the events with evident and unexplainable growth of aerosol concentration were discarded in particular vehicular traffic causes a marked increase of the aerosol levels especially during the two rush hours occurring between 7 00 and 9 00 and between 17 30 and 19 30 in order to minimize this effect the data occurring during the two rush hours were discarded the events were broken into sub events and the final total removal was calculated as the mean of the sub events removal following the previous criteria a total of 10 rain events with average intensity of 1 06mm h was selected see table 1 and for all of them both the scavenging coefficient and the removal index were calculated we consider as wind event a period of time in which the wind speed reaches or exceeds a certain threshold for a minimum time duration for this study we have considered a threshold of 5m s and a minimum time duration of 3h in order to avoid the influence of wet scavenging only wind events not affected by precipitation were considered consequently a total of 10 wind events with average speed of 6 5m s were selected see table 2 and for each of them the removal index was calculated 4 results and discussion firstly the average scavenging coefficient calculated during precipitation events is shown and compared with other studies in literature then the removals triggered by precipitation scavenging for the 10 rain events and by dispersion and dilution for the 10 wind events have been analysed in terms of removal index and compared 4 1 rain scavenging each rain event is characterized by the fact that precipitation can be considered the major mechanism of aerosol removal the wind speeds are always small lower than 3m s and the events are characterized by an average rain intensity of 1 06mm h which mainly implies stratiform type events and thus low thermophoretic forces influence the average scavenging coefficient as a function of particle diameter is reported in table 3 as already mentioned the coefficient has been calculated only for particles in the range 0 25 3μm given the extremely limited numbers of particles related to the largest size classes according to the theory the size range related to the minimum collection efficiency the greenfield gap can be located around 0 2 1μm for this reason what we expected to see is an increase of the scavenging coefficient with the increase of the particles diameter in this case study for the majority of the events λ tends to increase until the particle diameter is around 0 5μm which can be interpreted as a local maximum after that the tendencies vary case by case and it is difficult to find an evident general trend the variations of λ for each diameter class are widespread reaching usually a factor of 10 with a peak up to 1000 in one case thus the values of the calculated scavenging coefficient as a function of the particle diameter do not agree with the behavior predicted by the greenfield gap this countertrend can be explained by considering that the study area is characterized by high aerosol levels which can greatly increase in short times due to the numerous punctual anthropogenic sources light rain events as the ones selected here sometimes are not able to efficiently contrast these particles increases the geometric mean of the 10 events is shown in fig 2 continuous line together with the results of other two studies carried by volken and schumann 1993 dashed line and davenport and peters davenport and peters 1978 diamods in these two studies the precipitation scavenging is analysed considering stratiform type rain events the average rain intensity was about 0 8mm h and 2mm h respectively which are similar to the ones examined here the differences in the aerosol characteristics are more marked instead because none of the two studies analyses a polluted site as milan volken and schumann analysed data from a field campaign at mt rigi switzerland with a pollutant load typical of semi rural site they found scavenging coefficients which are comparable with our results in the size range 1 3μm but smaller of about 3 times in the range 0 25 1μm however the most interesting thing is the presence of a local maximum which is shifted left to 1μm and is about 1 5 times lower than the peak found in milan probably the different characteristics of the aerosol can explain this displacement davenport and peters analysed 3 rain events in lexington kentucky usa limiting their analyses in two subranges 0 4 and 10μm of the size distribution unlike the theory and according to our results they found a less pronounced dependence of λ on particle diameter furthermore the scavenging coefficients related to the subrange of 0 4μm agree with our results 4 2 comparison between precipitation and wind removal the precipitation scavenging is one of the most efficient cleaning mechanism of the atmosphere our analyses demonstrate that dispersion and dilution carried out by the occurrence of high wind speeds are able to locally clean the atmosphere in a similar way in order to compare the two mechanisms the removal index introduced in section 3 has been used as performance indicator the values of ρ calculated for the 10 rain events dark grey boxplots ρ rain and the values of ρ calculated for the 10 wind events light grey boxplots ρ wind are shown in fig 3 as function of the particle diameter together with the respective geometric means dark grey line rain and light grey line wind firsty we can see that the variability of ρ rain values around their geometric mean is generally smaller than the variability of ρ wind values around their geometric mean this is especially true if we consider the largest diameter classes in which ρ wind seems to be very unstable reaching also negative values it is worth noting that the plot is reported in logarithmic scales thus the negative values of the removal index that are more and more frequent with the increase of the sample size cannot be shown one of the reasons explaining this behaviour is the occurrence of resuspension phenomena strong wind speeds as the ones analysed here can resuspend the coarse aerosol particles already deposited at the ground causing local increase of the numeric aerosol concentration even if the wind removal is characterized by greater variations the geometric means of the removal index for precipitation and wind show comparable average values 1 7 10 5 s 1 for precipitation and 1 10 5 s 1 for wind in particular for diameters smaller than 1 5μm the geometric mean of ρ rain varies between 1 3 10 5 and 2 10 5 s 1 with a small pick around 0 5μm the geometric mean of ρ wind varies between 1 3 10 5 and 2 3 10 5 s 1 showing a light negative trend for diameter larger than 1 5μm ρ rain remains quite constant around 1 5 10 5 s 1 while ρ wind undergoes a deep fall toward negative values thus concerning the aerosol removal due to precipitation there is not a visible positive trend with aerosol particle diameter contrary to what expected by the theory as similarly shown by the scavenging coefficient this is probably linked to the high variability of the aerosol dynamics strongly influenced by the presence of local anthropogenic aerosol sources that in short time can alter the aerosol concentration concerning the aerosol removal due to wind the expected negative trend has been confirmed by the results and resuspension phenomena can be considered as the main cause of coarse particles increases and thus negative ρ values 5 conclusions here the below cloud scavenging removal mechanism has been studied in milan urban area ten rain events have been accurately selected in the years 2012 and 2015 and the scavenging coefficients for aerosol particles between 0 25 and 3μm have been calculated the average values of this coefficient vary between 2 10 5 and 5 10 5 s 1 and are comparable with other studies in literature volken and schumann 1993 davenport and peters 1978 the precipitation scavenging efficiency has been compared to the removal efficiency due to the occurrence of high wind speeds through the introduction of a removal index ten wind events characterized by wind speed higher than 5m s have been selected in the years 2012 and 2015 the results show comparable average values of the removal index 1 7 10 5 s 1 for precipitation and 1 10 5 s 1 for wind removal but different trends considering the variation of the removal index as function of the aerosol particle diameter if the removal efficiency of precipitation tends to lightly increase with the increase of particle diameters the removal efficiency of strong winds sharply drop down for particles larger than 1 5μm the analyses have also shown the complexity and variability of aerosol dynamics in urban centers like milan whose characteristics make tricky the evaluation of the relative weights of the different removal mechanisms in particular the countless local aerosol emissions can greatly affect the analyses regardless of the scrupulous events selection applied to avoid the disturbances these local emissions continuously raise up the particles concentration and consequently can cause distorted evaluations of the effective aerosol removal acknowledgement the authors want to thanks

on request 1 introduction deep soil water dsw is a critical water resource for sustaining high yields and maintaining vegetation growth especially in arid and semi arid regions yang et al 2022 2021 in water limited areas numerous deep rooted vegetation species use dsw including apple orchards tao et al 2021b pinus sylvestris in agroforestry huang et al 2021 alfalfa ali et al 2021 and platycladus orientalis in ecological forests chen et al 2023a however the use of dsw leads to water deficits reducing land productivity and grain yields zhao et al 2022 meanwhile dsw depletion significantly impacts soil microbial communities and functions soil chemical weathering and soil carbon cycling in deep soil grant and dietrich 2017 kong et al 2022 wang et al 2022b therefore understanding dsw use is essential for evaluating agricultural and forestry production and management dsw use tends to cause dried soil layers dsls due to the negative water balance between recharge and consumption as

response to dsw use wang et al 2022a zhang et al 2019 for example the stand age of apple trees positively correlated with the thickness and mean soil water content of dsls wang et al 2015 indicating that vegetation gradually uses soil water within and below dsls with increasing stand age li et al 2019 reported that dsw depletion is a one way mining pattern in semi arid zones with root systems continuing to penetrate soil to obtain more dsw as stand age increases a meta analysis showed that dsw decreased to a depth of 15 m with increasing planting years and forming water deficit did not

studies had limited soil depths with no information on soil water use in the deep profile 5 m from long term in situ monitoring for old aged vegetation it is essential to know dsw changes in the deep soil profile to characterize dsw use after dsls formation we measured soil water five times 2001 2005 2006 2007 2020 in the deep profile for three common deep rooted vegetation types pinus tabuliformis carr p tabuliformis caragana korshinskii kom c korshinskii platycladus orientalis l franco p orientalis planted in 1985 in 2020 we measured soil water soil particle composition and fine

identify whether old aged vegetation penetrates the depth of dsls using dsw deeper than dsls and 3 investigate the relationship between the final state of soil water and soil properties and root characteristics under three 36 year old vegetation types 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in xindiangou watershed 37 31 16 n 110 17 05 e on the northeast of suide county

and average annual precipitation of 442 mm fig s1 the soil is calcareous silt loam with loess parent material the topography of the watershed is cut by hundreds of gullies with loess hills accounting for 77 8 of the total area the depth of the water table is 100 m with precipitation the only water source for vegetation the planted vegetation species in this area are mainly pinus tabuliformis carr platycladus orientalis l franco caragana korshinskii kom salix cheilophila schneid artemisia sacrorum ledeb setaria viridis l beauv with a mixture of shrubs and forests 2 2 sampling and analysis we selected the three most commonly found vegetation types planted in 1985 p tabuliformis c korshinskii p orientalis fig 1 all vegetation was adjacent to an east facing slope located on the middle slope with a slope degree of 32 and elevation of 980 m to avoid the effect of deep soil spatial variability fixed sampling areas located on the upper middle backslope positions were designed for each vegetation type where all sites of soil vertical cores selected for each sampling soil water contents from the 0 10 m soil layer in 2001 2005 and 2006 and 0 22 m soil layer in 2007 were obtained from wang et al 2009a 2009b in three consecutive years of experiments at ages of 21 22 and 23 whether deep soil water is influenced by seasonal and intra year conditions was explored in 2020 a homemade hand auger with an inner diameter of 85 mm was used to collect soil samples with roots under p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis sampling dates are in table 1 vertical samples were taken at 20 cm intervals to 22 m below the surface soil soil samples without roots were used to determine soil water content using the oven drying method 105 c for 24 h soil particle composition was determined using the pipette method according to usda classification schemes soil samples with roots were sieved through 1 mm mesh and washed with water to collect the roots with tweezers a flatbed scanner epson

per inch root dry weights were determined using the oven drying method 60 c for 72 h precipitation from 1985 to 2020 followed a generally decreasing and then increasing trend with the lowest value 278 mm in 2000 fig s1a before 17 years of stand age the average multi year precipitation was 413 88 mm mean sd between 17 and 21 years precipitation decreased with an annual average of 355 60 mm precipitation at 22 and 23 years was 435 mm and 470 mm respectively closed to the average for multi year precipitation precipitation increased with an annual average of 505 112 mm from 23 to 36 years potential evapotranspiration had relatively low variability with a multi year mean of 884 90 mm on a multi year monthly scale precipitation and potential evapotranspiration followed a sinusoidal trend mainly concentrated from july to september fig s1b accounting for 62 and 32 of the annual average respectively the study reported the root growth of p tabuliformis from a rapid growth period starting at 5 years of age until it started to decline at approximately 20 years jing and peng 2021 and c korshinskii from 6 to 18 years wang et al 2021a thus the stand ages 17 36 years of each vegetation type were roughly at the old growth stage in our study the crown density of vegetation was evaluated by 20 m 20 m sampling plots the crown density of c korshinskii decreased by 48 at 36 years compared with 23 years with a 25 decrease in crown density table 1 the density and crown density of p tabulaeformis and p orientalis decreased slightly while tree height increased significantly 2 3 data analysis the soil desiccation index sdi defined as the ratio between actual soil available water and maximum soil available water li et al 2007 zhao et al 2020 was used to evaluate soil water deficit conditions 1 s d i θ v θ w θ fc θ w 100 where θ v is volumetric water content θ fc is stable field capacity and θ w is permanent wilting point stable field capacity related to the soil particle composition was about 50 80 of the field capacity however field capacity was difficult to acquired we determined the stable field capacity based on soil water content in the deep profile of the natural grassland 18 10 fig s2 sdi is generally divided into six classes a extreme dsl if sdi 0 b strong dsl if 0 sdi 25 c severe dsl if 25 sdi 50 d medium dsl if 50 sdi 75 e slight dsl if 75 sdi 100 and f no dsl if sdi 100 zhao et al 2019 soil water storage s mm was calculated as 2 s i 1 n θ v i h 10 where h is the thickness of each sampling layer cm and n is the number of soil layers we calculated three morphological characteristics of the fine roots fine root length density rld m m 3 fine root mass density rmd g m 3 and specific root length srl m g 1 expressed as 3 rld l v s 4 rmd m v s 5 s r l r l d r m d where l v s and m are total fine root length m total soil volume m 3 and fine root dry weight g in the core of the corresponding soil layer respectively because of minor deep soil water variability in deep loess deposits li et al 2019 the data have no duplicate samples in this study the standard error of measurement error range was used which is 1 5 in order to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in soil water at different time periods the average value of the absolute difference for water content at different time periods is used to compare with the measurement error if the average value of the absolute difference is lower than the measurement error no significant difference is considered all statistical analyses were performed using spss software spss statistics 20 0 ibm corporation usa 3 results 3 1 temporal dynamics of soil water of old aged vegetation the soil water content in the surface layer decreased with increasing depth remaining stable from 2 to 17 m the soil water content increased gradually at 17 m depth fig 2 the upper part of soil profiles 2 m varied between the five different vegetation stand ages deep soil 2 10 m had similar soil water contents over the years with coefficients of variation in each soil layer mostly 0 2 for all three vegetation types the multi year average soil water contents in 2 10 m soil profiles were 6 66 0 12 6 49 0 32 and 6 76 0 15 for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis respectively which did not significantly differ from the average value of the absolute difference in water content at different time periods comparing with the measurement error table 2 from 23 36 years soil water content below 17 m for p tabuliformis decreased significantly from 13 90 3 14 to 10 88 3 57 but was generally consistent for c korshinskii with average soil water contents of 11 87 2 73 in 2007 and 11 80 2 54 in 2020 coefficient of variation 0 2 unfortunately soil water changes from 2007 to 2020 could not be analyzed for p orientalis due to the lack of dsw data in 2007 3 2 soil water storage and soil desiccation indices soil water storage changes between 0 m and 2 m at the surface were ignored due to seasonal or single precipitation disturbances soil water storage below 2 m was calculated to reflect dsw recharge and soil water taken up by vegetation for p tabuliformis from 17 to 36 years old no significant change in water storage occurred between 2 and 10 m fig 3 p 0 05 the mean and coefficient of variation of multi year water storage for the 2 10 m soil layer was 538 7 mm and 1 59 at deeper depths water storage decreased by 28 1 mm from 10 to 17 m and 150 9 mm from 17 to 22 m in 23 and 36 year old stands correspondingly dsw consumption was 2 2 mm y 1 from 10 to 17 m and 11 6 mm y 1 from 17 to 22 m for c korshinskii soil water storage from 2 to 10 m decreased by 53 7 mm in 21 year old stands compared with 17 year old stands with 504 1 mm but began to recover in 22 year old stands with 482 7 mm nevertheless the multi year water storage from 2 to 10 m had weak variability with a coefficient of variation of 6 84 the 23 and 36 year old stands had similar water storage in the 10 17 m and 17 22 m soil layers for p orientalis different stand ages had similar soil water storage from 2 to 10 m with a mean of 543 2 mm and coefficient of variation of 1 24 fig 4 shows the sdis in different soil layers for the three vegetation types overall the 2 10 m and 10 17 m soil layers had significantly lower sdis than the 17 m soil layer across years for the three vegetation types the sdis at 2 10 m and 10 17 m did not significantly differ for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis all with strong sdi however in the 17 m soil layer the average sdi of p tabuliformis decreased significantly from 67 at 23 years to 45 at 36 years while the 23 year old c korshinskii stand generally had a similar mean and median sdi as the 36 year old stand for the 36 year old p orientalis stand the sdi in the 17 m soil layer reflected large variability with medium sdi for mean and median values 3 3 factors related to dsw for 36 year old vegetation the three deep soil profiles had uniformly distributed soil particle compositions fig s3 the clay silt and sand contents did not significantly differ within each vegetation with 11 01 2 32 10 39 3 22 and 10 45 2 61 clay 64 10 4 50 63 41 4 93 and 64 59 5 97 silt and 24 89 5 13 26 19 5 51 and 24 95 6 95 sand for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis respectively compared with clay and sand content silt content in the whole soil layer had low variability with 7 02 7 77 and 9 25 for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis respectively with corresponding values of 21 31 and 25 for clay content and 21 21 and 28 for sand content the rlds for the three vegetation types were mainly distributed in the shallow layer decreasing with increasing soil depth fig 5a in the deep layer 5 m the rlds were evenly distributed with depth the rlds accounted for 50 of the total profile above 2 2 m for p tabuliformis 1 2 m for c korshinskii and 1 8 m for p orientalis rmds had similar vertical distributions to rlds for the three vegetation types the 0 1 m soil layer had the greatest variations in rmd decreasing gradually with depth particularly below the 5 m soil layer where rmd tended to fluctuate slightly fig 5b no significant difference in rmd occurred among the three vegetation types in deep soil p 0 05 the deep layer had a greater srl than the shallow layer fig 5c a positive linear relationship occurred between srl and soil depth with coefficients of determination of 0 18 0 53 and 0 13 for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis respectively table 3 shows the pearson s correlation coefficients for soil water content with soil properties and root characteristics soil water content positively correlated with clay content for all three vegetation types p 0 01 soil water content significantly positively correlated with silt content for p tabuliformis p 0 05 and negatively correlated with sand content for c korshinskii and p orientalis indicating that dsw content distribution does not have a homogeneous relationship with silt and sand content no significant correlations occurred between rld and soil water content for p tabuliformis and c korshinskii but a negative correlation occurred for p orientalis 0 381 the rmd of c korshinskii and p orientalis significantly correlated with soil water content but the correlation coefficients were only 0 268 and 0 287 respectively among the three vegetation types only srl of c korshinskii significantly correlated with soil water content based on the significant pearson s correlation between soil water content and clay content a linear relationship between soil water content and clay content was determined for each vegetation type fig 6 with the highest coefficient of determination for p orientalis 0 8 followed by c korshinskii and p tabuliformis 4 discussion 4 1 dsw in dsls with strong sdi is not used by old aged vegetation large scale vegetation on the loess plateau not only significantly decrease runoff but also increase carbon storage feng et al 2016 however deep rooted species cause dsw deficits and soil desiccation huang et al 2022 in our study although the observation time distribution was quite uneven the soil water in dsls had strong sdi at 2 10 m from 17 to 36 years fig 4 with no significant difference between vegetation types in all years table 2 indicating that water can no longer be used in the 2 10 m soil layer under old aged vegetation in three consecutive years of experiments at ages of 21 22 and 23 deep soil water 2 10 m soil layer did not change significantly which indicated the formation of a stable dsls although the density of c korshinskii decreased by almost half in 2020 and the canopy density also significantly decreased no signs of soil water recovery this can be explained in two main ways on the one hand thinning c korshinskii still consume soil water which is recharged by precipitation the c korshinskii died naturally it indicated that the vegetation at the observation site is approaching its water consumption limit local precipitation and evapotranspiration are in balance at this time with no deep soil water recovery on the other hand the recovery of deep soil water was very slow as indicated by the pore water velocity traced by tritium isotopes in the loess plateau the pore water velocity of deep soil water was less than 0 5 m yr 1 chen et al 2023a li et al 2023 however some studies found dsw recovered in old aged vegetation using the space for time substitution 30 years due to species degradation and declining related physiological activities jia et al 2020 li et al 2021 indicating soil water from precipitation recharge was greater than vegetation use commonly recovery of dsls under old aged vegetation requires consideration of two main aspects precipitation and planting density one study showed that soil water recovery in old aged vegetation only occurred in areas where annual precipitation exceeded 550 mm liang et al 2018 however annual precipitation in the aging chronology at our experimental site was 442 mm fig s1 while planting density was the second most important influence on soil water content after stand age nan et al 2020 a high planting density for deep rooted vegetation further aggravates soil water depletion deng et al 2016 yang et al 2012 in our study the three vegetation types had relatively high planting densities which may explain the lack of dsw recovery table 1 4 2 dsw below dsls is used by old aged vegetation dsw used by vegetation is generally considered important for sustainable high yields coping with climate change and limited water resources chitra tarak et al 2018 germon et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in the face of global warming vegetation will experience considerable water stress allen et al 2010 schwalm et al 2017 there is growing evidence that vegetation used large amounts of dsw to alleviate drought stress in dryland farmland wang et al 2022a ecological forests barbeta et al 2015 and agroforestry huang et al 2021 two patterns of deep water use occur repeatable and one way li et al 2021 the long term one way pattern leads to dsls with old aged vegetation mostly leading to deep soil desiccation wang et al 2015 in our study soil water storage had weak variation with strong sdis in the 2 17 m soil layer for the three old aged vegetation types figs 3 and 4 suggesting the depletion of dsw in 2 17 m to a stable level which cannot continue to be consumed in dsls it is not clear whether old aged vegetation uses deeper soil water in our study old aged p tabuliformis continued to use dsw from 23 to 36 years while c korshinskii did not use dsw fig 3 likely due to 1 shrubs having a stronger self reliance on ecological communities than forests to cope with drought reducing the reliance on deep water cao et al 2011 36 year old c korshinskii had about 52 lower crown density than 23 year old c korshinskii table 1 while the crown density of p tabuliformis only decreased slightly although a decrease in canopy density for c korshinskii may increase infiltration and reduce water consumption ilstedt et al 2016 the intra year precipitation recharge depth commonly was two meter the limiting depth is five meter liu et al 2010 dsw temporally originate from decades of precipitation which is hardly influenced by the precipitation recharge in recent years chen et al 2023b the c korshinskii consumed large amounts of deep soil water resulting in a decrease in density after c korshinskii died naturally it indicated that the vegetation at the observation site is approaching its water consumption limit local precipitation and evapotranspiration are in balance at this time with no deep soil water recovery and depletion 2 different vegetation types have different root uptake strategies under low water availability chitra tarak et al 2018 with root water uptake explained by root distribution to some extent rothfuss and javaux 2017 c korshinskii had a greater proportion of root distribution in the shallow soil than p tabuliformis fig 5 3 differences in transpiration between old aged vegetation types using five years of sap flow data old aged p tabuliformis 40 years had stronger actual transpiration than old aged c korshinskii jian et al 2015 it is unknown whether the dsw of p orientalis has been consumed because of missing soil water data from 23 years stand age and normalized difference vegetation index were dominant factors for vertically varied soil water in loess zones huang et al 2022 however the study found weak relationships between dsw and root indices or soil physical and chemical properties within dsls wang et al 2010 the factors influencing dsw are complex due to plant soil interactions wang et al 2021b found a significant p 0 01 relationship between rld and soil water depletion in the 2 10 m soil layers of apple orchards however old aged vegetation had well developed root systems for gaining more available water dsw consumption mainly follows the primary mechanism of root water uptake deep water transport plant transpiration wang et al 2010 from the point of view of stand age the depth of root system gradually increases with the stand age and the depth and amount of deep water consumption also gradually increases li et al 2019 the condition of deep soil water varies in different areas after being absorbed by vegetation in tropical rainforests deep rooted vegetation absorbs a large amount of deep soil water during the dry season resulting in a significant reduction in soil water content rempe and dietrich 2018 however a number of in situ monitoring results showed that the rainy season precipitation can restore the soil water content of the deep soil because the average annual rainfall of the rainforest is more than 2000 mm christina et al 2017 markewitz et al 2010 in most of the loess plateau area deep soil water is depleted and cannot be recharged forming a one way pattern of water depletion li et al 2019 this pattern of water depletion decrease soil water availability soil water availability is a key factor affecting root growth and development and low water availability can increase root depth brunner et al 2015 pierret et al 2016 our study has found that low soil water availability has developed under old aged vegetation in this case we found soil water in three old aged vegetation types significantly correlated with soil clay content table 3 indicating that root characteristics had little effect on the depleted soil water under old aged vegetation with soil clay content the main factor limiting soil water content after a long period of dsw use 4 3 implications in water use management for old aged vegetation old aged vegetation consumed dsw with the formation of dsls most studies have focused on the top 5 m or 10 m soil layer he et al 2022 jia et al 2017 after forming stable dsls p tabuliformis continued to use deep soil layers reaching below 17 m figs 2 and 3 while we did not find that old aged c korshinskii and p orientalis continued to use the dsw the dsw deficit exceeded the maximum sampling depth in addition dsw in old aged vegetation was not restored these results provide theoretical support for the rational management of dsw use on the one hand we can manage rainwater resources to restore deep water song et al 2020 proposed rainwater collection and infiltration systems to promote dsw and organic carbon restoration however the pore water velocity in the unsaturated zone was low 0 4 m y 1 in the nearby area from chen et al 2023a so conventional rainwater collection and infiltration systems may not be adequate for deep soil water recovery old aged vegetation consumes a large amount of deep water with the dsls reaching depths of more than 10 m for stand age the depth of root gradually increases with stand age and the depth and amount of deep water consumption also gradually increases li et al 2019 under old aged vegetation the depth of deep water consumption has essentially reached its limit the natural recharge of precipitation alone will fail to recharge the soil to a certain deep layer in this case we can conduct supplementary irrigation through deep open boreholes such as 5 m or deeper allowing the water to recharge deep soil quickly zhang et al 2023 in addition old aged vegetation had reduced yield and productivity thus we should apply suitable forest manage methods for regulating stand density to balance the relationship between ecological restoration and soil water such as clear cutting or changing the land use type to renovate old aged vegetation to reduce deep water use wei and liang 2021 yang et al 2010 5 conclusions main findings of the paper about five soil water data for nearly 20 years 17 to 36 year stand age from in situ soil water monitoring of old aged vegetation to analyze whether old aged vegetation use dsw in the setting of the dsls we emphasize the use potential of deep soil water in the presence of dsls the results showed that p tabuliformis used deep water 17 22 m soil layer from 23 to 36 years average 11 6 mm y 1 while old aged c korshinskii did not uptake deep water we also found that the three vegetation types did not use dsw within the dsls based on historical soil water and soil water storage changes furthermore dsw content was related to clay content rather than vegetation type under long term deficit limitations of this work this study has a great advantage in terms of dataset with long term deep soil water monitoring 10 m over a span of about 20 years at the same experimental site to address deep soil water use of old aged vegetation after the formation of dsls however our sampling depth did not reach the maximum of root water uptake so that we could not quantitatively analyze the dsw use characteristics depth amount and degree he et al 2023 meanwhile sampling method using soil auger in our study cannot avoid the possible variability of soil structure although the soil texture of the deep profiles are quite similar at the watershed scale tao et al 2021a broader impacts this work deepens our concerns about the imbalance of water resources caused by excessive consumption of dsw in semi arid areas of the loess plateau on the one hand dsw use for various revegetation species in long term ecological restoration should be considered on the other hand this study will provide foundational information for optimal water resources management scheme from the perspective of long term deep soil drought zhang et al 2023 credit authorship contribution statement guangjie chen conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology visualization writing original draft qifan wu

on request 1 introduction deep soil water dsw is a critical water resource for sustaining high yields and maintaining vegetation growth especially in arid and semi arid regions yang et al 2022 2021 in water limited areas numerous deep rooted vegetation species use dsw including apple orchards tao et al 2021b pinus sylvestris in agroforestry huang et al 2021 alfalfa ali et al 2021 and platycladus orientalis in ecological forests chen et al 2023a however the use of dsw leads to water deficits reducing land productivity and grain yields zhao et al 2022 meanwhile dsw depletion significantly impacts soil microbial communities and functions soil chemical weathering and soil carbon cycling in deep soil grant and dietrich 2017 kong et al 2022 wang et al 2022b therefore understanding dsw use is essential for evaluating agricultural and forestry production and management dsw use tends to cause dried soil layers dsls due to the negative water balance between recharge and consumption as observed in recent decades in regions such as eastern amazonia jipp et al 1998 markewitz et al 2010 north america goulden and bales 2019 east africa robinsonhaile et al 2019 southern australia robinson et al 2006 and china s loess plateau huang and shao 2019 numerous studies have investigated the formation and evolution of dsls under perennial vegetation and intensive dryland farming in response to dsw use wang et al 2022a zhang et al 2019 for example the stand age of apple trees positively correlated with the thickness and mean soil water content of dsls wang et al 2015 indicating that vegetation gradually uses soil water within and below dsls with increasing stand age li et al 2019 reported that dsw depletion is a one way mining pattern in semi arid zones with root systems continuing to penetrate soil to obtain more dsw as stand age increases a meta analysis showed that dsw decreased to a depth of 15 m with increasing planting years and forming water deficit did not recover ali et al 2021 the occurrence of dsls is related to stand age forming under mid aged vegetation jia et al 2019 wang et al 2015 and stabilizing as the vegetation enters old age with decreasing transpiration hata et al 2016 however it is unclear whether old aged vegetation continues to use dsw under dsls determining dsw use by old aged vegetation will provide a foundation for regulating water management in fields with long term water deficits dsw use has been assessed using space for time substitution li et al 2019 in situ monitoring he et al 2022 isotope tracer technique pinheiro et al 2021 wang et al 2023 and the eco hydrological model li et al 2022 the results from in situ monitoring methods are the most valid avoiding spatial and temporal heterogeneity from soil climate and vegetation community for space for time substitution and essential assumption from the statistical and mechanistic models several studies have focused on dsw use under dsls using the in situ method liang et al 2022 yang et al 2017 for example 13 years of soil water monitoring revealed that vegetation improved the hydrological features of topsoil 0 0 4 m but exacerbated soil drying in the 0 4 4 0 m soil profile zhang et al 2018 a 4 year field study showed that dryland maize with high plant density tended to use more dsw increasing the risk of soil desiccation zhang et al 2019 however these studies had limited soil depths with no information on soil water use in the deep profile 5 m from long term in situ monitoring for old aged vegetation it is essential to know dsw changes in the deep soil profile to characterize dsw use after dsls formation we measured soil water five times 2001 2005 2006 2007 2020 in the deep profile for three common deep rooted vegetation types pinus tabuliformis carr p tabuliformis caragana korshinskii kom c korshinskii platycladus orientalis l franco p orientalis planted in 1985 in 2020 we measured soil water soil particle composition and fine roots to determine the main factors affecting dsw in old aged vegetation specifically this study aimed to 1 identify whether old aged vegetation continues to use dsw within dsls in semi arid zones 2 identify whether old aged vegetation penetrates the depth of dsls using dsw deeper than dsls and 3 investigate the relationship between the final state of soil water and soil properties and root characteristics under three 36 year old vegetation types 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in xindiangou watershed 37 31 16 n 110 17 05 e on the northeast of suide county yulin city in shaanxi province fig 1 the area is in a semi arid region with a temperate continental monsoon climate average altitude of 745 m long term 1985 2020 average annual temperature of 10 1 c and average annual precipitation of 442 mm fig s1 the soil is calcareous silt loam with loess parent material the topography of the watershed is cut by hundreds of gullies with loess hills accounting for 77 8 of the total area the depth of the water table is 100 m with precipitation the only water source for vegetation the planted vegetation species in this area are mainly pinus tabuliformis carr platycladus orientalis l franco caragana korshinskii kom salix cheilophila schneid artemisia sacrorum ledeb setaria viridis l beauv with a mixture of shrubs and forests 2 2 sampling and analysis we selected the three most commonly found vegetation types planted in 1985 p tabuliformis c korshinskii p orientalis fig 1 all vegetation was adjacent to an east facing slope located on the middle slope with a slope degree of 32 and elevation of 980 m to avoid the effect of deep soil spatial variability fixed sampling areas located on the upper middle backslope positions were designed for each vegetation type where all sites of soil vertical cores selected for each sampling soil water contents from the 0 10 m soil layer in 2001 2005 and 2006 and 0 22 m soil layer in 2007 were obtained from wang et al 2009a 2009b in three consecutive years of experiments at ages of 21 22 and 23 whether deep soil water is influenced by seasonal and intra year conditions was explored in 2020 a homemade hand auger with an inner diameter of 85 mm was used to collect soil samples with roots under p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis sampling dates are in table 1 vertical samples were taken at 20 cm intervals to 22 m below the surface soil soil samples without roots were used to determine soil water content using the oven drying method 105 c for 24 h soil particle composition was determined using the pipette method according to usda classification schemes soil samples with roots were sieved through 1 mm mesh and washed with water to collect the roots with tweezers a flatbed scanner epson model v700 epson japan was used to scan the sieved fresh roots fine root 2 mm characteristics were analyzed with the imaging analysis software winrhizo regent instruments inc canada at 300 dpi dots per inch root dry weights were determined using the oven drying method 60 c for 72 h precipitation from 1985 to 2020 followed a generally decreasing and then increasing trend with the lowest value 278 mm in 2000 fig s1a before 17 years of stand age the average multi year precipitation was 413 88 mm mean sd between 17 and 21 years precipitation decreased with an annual average of 355 60 mm precipitation at 22 and 23 years was 435 mm and 470 mm respectively closed to the average for multi year precipitation precipitation increased with an annual average of 505 112 mm from 23 to 36 years potential evapotranspiration had relatively low variability with a multi year mean of 884 90 mm on a multi year monthly scale precipitation and potential evapotranspiration followed a sinusoidal trend mainly concentrated from july to september fig s1b accounting for 62 and 32 of the annual average respectively the study reported the root growth of p tabuliformis from a rapid growth period starting at 5 years of age until it started to decline at approximately 20 years jing and peng 2021 and c korshinskii from 6 to 18 years wang et al 2021a thus the stand ages 17 36 years of each vegetation type were roughly at the old growth stage in our study the crown density of vegetation was evaluated by 20 m 20 m sampling plots the crown density of c korshinskii decreased by 48 at 36 years compared with 23 years with a 25 decrease in crown density table 1 the density and crown density of p tabulaeformis and p orientalis decreased slightly while tree height increased significantly 2 3 data analysis the soil desiccation index sdi defined as the ratio between actual soil available water and maximum soil available water li et al 2007 zhao et al 2020 was used to evaluate soil water deficit conditions 1 s d i θ v θ w θ fc θ w 100 where θ v is volumetric water content θ fc is stable field capacity and θ w is permanent wilting point stable field capacity related to the soil particle composition was about 50 80 of the field capacity however field capacity was difficult to acquired we determined the stable field capacity based on soil water content in the deep profile of the natural grassland 18 10 fig s2 sdi is generally divided into six classes a extreme dsl if sdi 0 b strong dsl if 0 sdi 25 c severe dsl if 25 sdi 50 d medium dsl if 50 sdi 75 e slight dsl if 75 sdi 100 and f no dsl if sdi 100 zhao et al 2019 soil water storage s mm was calculated as 2 s i 1 n θ v i h 10 where h is the thickness of each sampling layer cm and n is the number of soil layers we calculated three morphological characteristics of the fine roots fine root length density rld m m 3 fine root mass density rmd g m 3 and specific root length srl m g 1 expressed as 3 rld l v s 4 rmd m v s 5 s r l r l d r m d where l v s and m are total fine root length m total soil volume m 3 and fine root dry weight g in the core of the corresponding soil layer respectively because of minor deep soil water variability in deep loess deposits li et al 2019 the data have no duplicate samples in this study the standard error of measurement error range was used which is 1 5 in order to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in soil water at different time periods the average value of the absolute difference for water content at different time periods is used to compare with the measurement error if the average value of the absolute difference is lower than the measurement error no significant difference is considered all statistical analyses were performed using spss software spss statistics 20 0 ibm corporation usa 3 results 3 1 temporal dynamics of soil water of old aged vegetation the soil water content in the surface layer decreased with increasing depth remaining stable from 2 to 17 m the soil water content increased gradually at 17 m depth fig 2 the upper part of soil profiles 2 m varied between the five different vegetation stand ages deep soil 2 10 m had similar soil water contents over the years with coefficients of variation in each soil layer mostly 0 2 for all three vegetation types the multi year average soil water contents in 2 10 m soil profiles were 6 66 0 12 6 49 0 32 and 6 76 0 15 for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis respectively which did not significantly differ from the average value of the absolute difference in water content at different time periods comparing with the measurement error table 2 from 23 36 years soil water content below 17 m for p tabuliformis decreased significantly from 13 90 3 14 to 10 88 3 57 but was generally consistent for c korshinskii with average soil water contents of 11 87 2 73 in 2007 and 11 80 2 54 in 2020 coefficient of variation 0 2 unfortunately soil water changes from 2007 to 2020 could not be analyzed for p orientalis due to the lack of dsw data in 2007 3 2 soil water storage and soil desiccation indices soil water storage changes between 0 m and 2 m at the surface were ignored due to seasonal or single precipitation disturbances soil water storage below 2 m was calculated to reflect dsw recharge and soil water taken up by vegetation for p tabuliformis from 17 to 36 years old no significant change in water storage occurred between 2 and 10 m fig 3 p 0 05 the mean and coefficient of variation of multi year water storage for the 2 10 m soil layer was 538 7 mm and 1 59 at deeper depths water storage decreased by 28 1 mm from 10 to 17 m and 150 9 mm from 17 to 22 m in 23 and 36 year old stands correspondingly dsw consumption was 2 2 mm y 1 from 10 to 17 m and 11 6 mm y 1 from 17 to 22 m for c korshinskii soil water storage from 2 to 10 m decreased by 53 7 mm in 21 year old stands compared with 17 year old stands with 504 1 mm but began to recover in 22 year old stands with 482 7 mm nevertheless the multi year water storage from 2 to 10 m had weak variability with a coefficient of variation of 6 84 the 23 and 36 year old stands had similar water storage in the 10 17 m and 17 22 m soil layers for p orientalis different stand ages had similar soil water storage from 2 to 10 m with a mean of 543 2 mm and coefficient of variation of 1 24 fig 4 shows the sdis in different soil layers for the three vegetation types overall the 2 10 m and 10 17 m soil layers had significantly lower sdis than the 17 m soil layer across years for the three vegetation types the sdis at 2 10 m and 10 17 m did not significantly differ for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis all with strong sdi however in the 17 m soil layer the average sdi of p tabuliformis decreased significantly from 67 at 23 years to 45 at 36 years while the 23 year old c korshinskii stand generally had a similar mean and median sdi as the 36 year old stand for the 36 year old p orientalis stand the sdi in the 17 m soil layer reflected large variability with medium sdi for mean and median values 3 3 factors related to dsw for 36 year old vegetation the three deep soil profiles had uniformly distributed soil particle compositions fig s3 the clay silt and sand contents did not significantly differ within each vegetation with 11 01 2 32 10 39 3 22 and 10 45 2 61 clay 64 10 4 50 63 41 4 93 and 64 59 5 97 silt and 24 89 5 13 26 19 5 51 and 24 95 6 95 sand for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis respectively compared with clay and sand content silt content in the whole soil layer had low variability with 7 02 7 77 and 9 25 for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis respectively with corresponding values of 21 31 and 25 for clay content and 21 21 and 28 for sand content the rlds for the three vegetation types were mainly distributed in the shallow layer decreasing with increasing soil depth fig 5a in the deep layer 5 m the rlds were evenly distributed with depth the rlds accounted for 50 of the total profile above 2 2 m for p tabuliformis 1 2 m for c korshinskii and 1 8 m for p orientalis rmds had similar vertical distributions to rlds for the three vegetation types the 0 1 m soil layer had the greatest variations in rmd decreasing gradually with depth particularly below the 5 m soil layer where rmd tended to fluctuate slightly fig 5b no significant difference in rmd occurred among the three vegetation types in deep soil p 0 05 the deep layer had a greater srl than the shallow layer fig 5c a positive linear relationship occurred between srl and soil depth with coefficients of determination of 0 18 0 53 and 0 13 for p tabuliformis c korshinskii and p orientalis respectively table 3 shows the pearson s correlation coefficients for soil water content with soil properties and root characteristics soil water content positively correlated with clay content for all three vegetation types p 0 01 soil water content significantly positively correlated with silt content for p tabuliformis p 0 05 and negatively correlated with sand content for c korshinskii and p orientalis indicating that dsw content distribution does not have a homogeneous relationship with silt and sand content no significant correlations occurred between rld and soil water content for p tabuliformis and c korshinskii but a negative correlation occurred for p orientalis 0 381 the rmd of c korshinskii and p orientalis significantly correlated with soil water content but the correlation coefficients were only 0 268 and 0 287 respectively among the three vegetation types only srl of c korshinskii significantly correlated with soil water content based on the significant pearson s correlation between soil water content and clay content a linear relationship between soil water content and clay content was determined for each vegetation type fig 6 with the highest coefficient of determination for p orientalis 0 8 followed by c korshinskii and p tabuliformis 4 discussion 4 1 dsw in dsls with strong sdi is not used by old aged vegetation large scale vegetation on the loess plateau not only significantly decrease runoff but also increase carbon storage feng et al 2016 however deep rooted species cause dsw deficits and soil desiccation huang et al 2022 in our study although the observation time distribution was quite uneven the soil water in dsls had strong sdi at 2 10 m from 17 to 36 years fig 4 with no significant difference between vegetation types in all years table 2 indicating that water can no longer be used in the 2 10 m soil layer under old aged vegetation in three consecutive years of experiments at ages of 21 22 and 23 deep soil water 2 10 m soil layer did not change significantly which indicated the formation of a stable dsls although the density of c korshinskii decreased by almost half in 2020 and the canopy density also significantly decreased no signs of soil water recovery this can be explained in two main ways on the one hand thinning c korshinskii still consume soil water which is recharged by precipitation the c korshinskii died naturally it indicated that the vegetation at the observation site is approaching its water consumption limit local precipitation and evapotranspiration are in balance at this time with no deep soil water recovery on the other hand the recovery of deep soil water was very slow as indicated by the pore water velocity traced by tritium isotopes in the loess plateau the pore water velocity of deep soil water was less than 0 5 m yr 1 chen et al 2023a li et al 2023 however some studies found dsw recovered in old aged vegetation using the space for time substitution 30 years due to species degradation and declining related physiological activities jia et al 2020 li et al 2021 indicating soil water from precipitation recharge was greater than vegetation use commonly recovery of dsls under old aged vegetation requires consideration of two main aspects precipitation and planting density one study showed that soil water recovery in old aged vegetation only occurred in areas where annual precipitation exceeded 550 mm liang et al 2018 however annual precipitation in the aging chronology at our experimental site was 442 mm fig s1 while planting density was the second most important influence on soil water content after stand age nan et al 2020 a high planting density for deep rooted vegetation further aggravates soil water depletion deng et al 2016 yang et al 2012 in our study the three vegetation types had relatively high planting densities which may explain the lack of dsw recovery table 1 4 2 dsw below dsls is used by old aged vegetation dsw used by vegetation is generally considered important for sustainable high yields coping with climate change and limited water resources chitra tarak et al 2018 germon et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in the face of global warming vegetation will experience considerable water stress allen et al 2010 schwalm et al 2017 there is growing evidence that vegetation used large amounts of dsw to alleviate drought stress in dryland farmland wang et al 2022a ecological forests barbeta et al 2015 and agroforestry huang et al 2021 two patterns of deep water use occur repeatable and one way li et al 2021 the long term one way pattern leads to dsls with old aged vegetation mostly leading to deep soil desiccation wang et al 2015 in our study soil water storage had weak variation with strong sdis in the 2 17 m soil layer for the three old aged vegetation types figs 3 and 4 suggesting the depletion of dsw in 2 17 m to a stable level which cannot continue to be consumed in dsls it is not clear whether old aged vegetation uses deeper soil water in our study old aged p tabuliformis continued to use dsw from 23 to 36 years while c korshinskii did not use dsw fig 3 likely due to 1 shrubs having a stronger self reliance on ecological communities than forests to cope with drought reducing the reliance on deep water cao et al 2011 36 year old c korshinskii had about 52 lower crown density than 23 year old c korshinskii table 1 while the crown density of p tabuliformis only decreased slightly although a decrease in canopy density for c korshinskii may increase infiltration and reduce water consumption ilstedt et al 2016 the intra year precipitation recharge depth commonly was two meter the limiting depth is five meter liu et al 2010 dsw temporally originate from decades of precipitation which is hardly influenced by the precipitation recharge in recent years chen et al 2023b the c korshinskii consumed large amounts of deep soil water resulting in a decrease in density after c korshinskii died naturally it indicated that the vegetation at the observation site is approaching its water consumption limit local precipitation and evapotranspiration are in balance at this time with no deep soil water recovery and depletion 2 different vegetation types have different root uptake strategies under low water availability chitra tarak et al 2018 with root water uptake explained by root distribution to some extent rothfuss and javaux 2017 c korshinskii had a greater proportion of root distribution in the shallow soil than p tabuliformis fig 5 3 differences in transpiration between old aged vegetation types using five years of sap flow data old aged p tabuliformis 40 years had stronger actual transpiration than old aged c korshinskii jian et al 2015 it is unknown whether the dsw of p orientalis has been consumed because of missing soil water data from 23 years stand age and normalized difference vegetation index were dominant factors for vertically varied soil water in loess zones huang et al 2022 however the study found weak relationships between dsw and root indices or soil physical and chemical properties within dsls wang et al 2010 the factors influencing dsw are complex due to plant soil interactions wang et al 2021b found a significant p 0 01 relationship between rld and soil water depletion in the 2 10 m soil layers of apple orchards however old aged vegetation had well developed root systems for gaining more available water dsw consumption mainly follows the primary mechanism of root water uptake deep water transport plant transpiration wang et al 2010 from the point of view of stand age the depth of root system gradually increases with the stand age and the depth and amount of deep water consumption also gradually increases li et al 2019 the condition of deep soil water varies in different areas after being absorbed by vegetation in tropical rainforests deep rooted vegetation absorbs a large amount of deep soil water during the dry season resulting in a significant reduction in soil water content rempe and dietrich 2018 however a number of in situ monitoring results showed that the rainy season precipitation can restore the soil water content of the deep soil because the average annual rainfall of the rainforest is more than 2000 mm christina et al 2017 markewitz et al 2010 in most of the loess plateau area deep soil water is depleted and cannot be recharged forming a one way pattern of water depletion li et al 2019 this pattern of water depletion decrease soil water availability soil water availability is a key factor affecting root growth and development and low water availability can increase root depth brunner et al 2015 pierret et al 2016 our study has found that low soil water availability has developed under old aged vegetation in this case we found soil water in three old aged vegetation types significantly correlated with soil clay content table 3 indicating that root characteristics had little effect on the depleted soil water under old aged vegetation with soil clay content the main factor limiting soil water content after a long period of dsw use 4 3 implications in water use management for old aged vegetation old aged vegetation consumed dsw with the formation of dsls most studies have focused on the top 5 m or 10 m soil layer he et al 2022 jia et al 2017 after forming stable dsls p tabuliformis continued to use deep soil layers reaching below 17 m figs 2 and 3 while we did not find that old aged c korshinskii and p orientalis continued to use the dsw the dsw deficit exceeded the maximum sampling depth in addition dsw in old aged vegetation was not restored these results provide theoretical support for the rational management of dsw use on the one hand we can manage rainwater resources to restore deep water song et al 2020 proposed rainwater collection and infiltration systems to promote dsw and organic carbon restoration however the pore water velocity in the unsaturated zone was low 0 4 m y 1 in the nearby area from chen et al 2023a so conventional rainwater collection and infiltration systems may not be adequate for deep soil water recovery old aged vegetation consumes a large amount of deep water with the dsls reaching depths of more than 10 m for stand age the depth of root gradually increases with stand age and the depth and amount of deep water consumption also gradually increases li et al 2019 under old aged vegetation the depth of deep water consumption has essentially reached its limit the natural recharge of precipitation alone will fail to recharge the soil to a certain deep layer in this case we can conduct supplementary irrigation through deep open boreholes such as 5 m or deeper allowing the water to recharge deep soil quickly zhang et al 2023 in addition old aged vegetation had reduced yield and productivity thus we should apply suitable forest manage methods for regulating stand density to balance the relationship between ecological restoration and soil water such as clear cutting or changing the land use type to renovate old aged vegetation to reduce deep water use wei and liang 2021 yang et al 2010 5 conclusions main findings of the paper about five soil water data for nearly 20 years 17 to 36 year stand age from in situ soil water monitoring of old aged vegetation to analyze whether old aged vegetation use dsw in the setting of the dsls we emphasize the use potential of deep soil water in the presence of dsls the results showed that p tabuliformis used deep water 17 22 m soil layer from 23 to 36 years average 11 6 mm y 1 while old aged c korshinskii did not uptake deep water we also found that the three vegetation types did not use dsw within the dsls based on historical soil water and soil water storage changes furthermore dsw content was related to clay content rather than vegetation type under long term deficit limitations of this work this study has a great advantage in terms of dataset with long term deep soil water monitoring 10 m over a span of about 20 years at the same experimental site to address deep soil water use of old aged vegetation after the formation of dsls however our sampling depth did not reach the maximum of root water uptake so that we could not quantitatively analyze the dsw use characteristics depth amount and degree he et al 2023 meanwhile sampling method using soil auger in our study cannot avoid the possible variability of soil structure although the soil texture of the deep profiles are quite similar at the watershed scale tao et al 2021a broader impacts this work deepens our concerns about the imbalance of water resources caused by excessive consumption of dsw in semi arid areas of the loess plateau on the one hand dsw use for various revegetation species in long term ecological restoration should be considered on the other hand this study will provide foundational information for optimal water resources management scheme from the perspective of long term deep soil drought zhang et al 2023 credit authorship contribution statement guangjie chen conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology visualization writing original draft qifan wu

7618,study region the northwest german part of the north sea coast study focus low lying coastal areas are highly threatened by climate change this is due to rising sea level and changing water balance caused by climate change adaptation of coastal protection and inland drainage to climate change requires precise predictions of future conditions while information on sea level rise is globally available coastal water balance projections need to be specific for regions where often no discharge data is available to serve this demand a model based scenario analysis was carried out for four water boards in northwest germany these water boards are regional organisations responsible for drainage and surface water level regulation in marsh areas a water balance model was calibrated and validated against data of pumping stations and tidal water gates subsequently climate change impacts on runoff generation were estimated new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that runoff generation is expected to increase significantly in the wet season same as the frequency of periods with large runoff volumes the climate change impact signal is consistent over all investigated water board areas indicating that the climate change signal dominates the spatial variability in soil properties and land use the results emphasize the necessity to consider runoff generation projections for adjusting coastal drainage management the scenario projections can be directly used for regional adaptation planning processes taking into account the underlying uncertainties graphical abstract ga1 keywords coastal water boards climate change impact assessment runoff generation drainage demand hydrological model scenario analysis northwest germany data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large parts of the low lying areas along the german north sea coast are anthropogenic managed hydrological systems spiekermann et al 2018 bormann 2018 to protect the productive landscape against tidal inundations and storm floods inhabitants started building dikes and sea walls more than 1000 years ago due to the humid climate and the positive water balance of inland areas along the north sea the concurrent development of an efficient drainage system was necessary bormann 2018 therefore sluices and pumping stations were built to convey the excess water from the hinterland to the sea such drainage management has been improved over the past decades keeping all areas productive during the year similar defence and drainage systems were developed also at many other low lying coastal regions around the world being faced with similar challenges e g the netherlands van alphen et al 2015 ritzema and stuyt 2015 the us titus et al 1987 australia waddington et al 2022 and new zeeland kool et al 2020 due to land subsidence and mineralization of soils gradually pumping stations supplemented and finally replaced sluices at many locations resulting in improved drainage standards however drainage systems often reach their limitations already today if storm surges and intense rainfall happen at the same time kool et al 2020 van den hurk et al 2015 along shallow coastlines adaptation to future climate change already needs to be considered today according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc climate change will continue including sea level rise global warming and a change in precipitation patterns ipcc 2021 coastal areas are seen as high risk areas with regard to sea level rise coastal flooding and extreme events ipcc 2022 while a long term planning has been set up for coastal protection in lower saxony germany nlwkn 2007 2020 and other federal states along the north sea coast e g hofstede et al 2019 considering a sea level rise of at least 1 m until year 2100 no general planning is available for draining the low lying coastal areas in germany consequently the individual water boards which regulate surface water levels in a region are responsible for their own climate change adaptation planning in contrast for the netherlands the delta program tackles the issue in a more integrative way combining the management of the coastline flood risks and freshwater resources delta programme 2021 adaptation pathways are tested and compared searching for tipping points where system behaviour changes and where new different solutions are required haasnoot et al 2020 van alphen et al 2015 in the netherlands also the principles of controlled drainage have been suggested enabling the shift from a strategy of rapid removal of all excess water to one that continuously controls water levels individually in each plot ritzema and stuyt 2015 perceiving water as risk and resource at the same time such solutions offer more flexibility and spatially distributed solutions for the climate change adaptation of the drainage system of a single water board regionally specific information on potential climate change impacts is required however national and regional climate services in germany such as gerics 2023 and niklis 2023 only offer standard climate change indicators while specific information on changes in water balances or drainage demands is not available similarly most of the available international studies only focus on the impact of the regional sea level rise on coastal drainage systems haasnoot et al 2020 kool et al 2020 ritzema and stuyt 2015 they explicitly consider the connected uncertainties in sea level rise but widely ignore potential changes in the terrestrial water balance of the drained water board areas to serve this demand for an integrative climate adaptation of coastal regions climate change impact simulations are required which specify potential changes in the water balance for individual water boards for a successful long term adaptation of drainage management in addition to sea level rise hydrological projections must take into account the regional characteristics and the drainage management system spiekermann et al 2018 such projections are driven by regional climate projections and quantify the hydrological changes induced by regional climate change bormann et al 2018 climate impact simulations for a similar environment indicate a hydrological change for the german north sea coast characterized by dryer summers and increasing precipitation in wintertime bormann et al 2012 2018 von storch and claussen 2011 however robust local impact assessments must be based on validated hydrological models being based on local discharge measurements such information is widely not available for the anthropogenic managed marsh areas only for few water board areas in northwest germany discharge proxies such as pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimations are available in sufficient accuracy and resolution this challenge is explicitly addressed by the approach of this study based on such available data from four east frisian water boards and one federal agency the physically based hydrological model simulat diekkrüger and arning 1995 bormann 2008 is calibrated validated and applied to an ensemble of regional climate projections simulated hydrological changes are translated into hydrological change indicators and analysed for regional consistency we test whether 1 tidal gate flow estimates and pumping data are sufficient for model validation 2 simulated runoff generation is considerably affected by climate change projections and 3 climate change impact signals as well as the derived indicators are similar among the areas of neighbouring water boards in case significant and consistent change patterns for the study region are identified such indicators can be assumed to be appropriate for regional climate adaptation planning of coastal regions considering drainage for a future oriented integrative coastal zone management in general 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the target region east frisia the study area is located in north west germany along the ems estuary east frisia it consists of the area of four water boards emden norden oldersum and aurich covering 1332 km² in total table 1 the landscape is characterized by a flat terrain fig 1 partly lying up to 2 m below sea level table 1 most of the soils are marsh and fen soils and dairy farming is dominating agriculture in the moraine areas sandy soils dominate and crops such as maize wheat and rape dominate the landscape the climate of the region is humid average annual precipitation is around 823 mm while annual average temperature is around 10 c german weather service https www dwd de weather station emden to protect the landscape against the sea dikes were built and enforced over hundreds of years in east frisia protecting the land against the high tides and in particular against storm tides due to the wet climate and the positive water balance in the hinterland building dikes required an intense and sophisticated drainage management a dense network of ditches and canals was built over time 2410 km 2nd and 3rd level water courses and water is drained to the north sea via six tidal gates and five pumping stations for the lowest lying parts additional 44 internal pumping stations were installed to lift the water to the main drainage canals natural rivers do not exist in the study area drainage management strongly influences the water balance of the low lying areas focusing on keeping the feet of the inhabitants dry the water boards aim at adjusting constant water levels in the main drainage system that implies that a high correlation between precipitation and drainage rates is likely only in case of runoff generation events exceeding drainage capacity and in case of drought periods such assumption might fail 2 2 data availability for the study area spatial data sets were available on the topography a high resolution 1 m digital elevation model https www lgln niedersachsen de the soils a digital soil map 1 50 000 https www lbeg niedersachsen de the land use the alkis data set https www lgln niedersachsen de containing information on spatially distributed land cover the borders and the area of the four above mentioned water boards within the area of investigation data provided by the water boards spatial data sets were used for parameterization and spatial discretization of the simulat model diekkrüger and arning 1995 bormann 2008 see detailed model description in section 2 3 hourly time series of weather data temperature solar radiation air humidity wind speed available from 1997 to 2020 from weather station emden were used to drive the model for calibration and validation periods the weather station emden is the only station in the area of interest providing weather data in hourly resolution hourly precipitation time series were derived from the radolan radar online aneichung product of the german weather service https www dwd de radolan provides a spatially distributed hourly radar product which is calibrated by rain gauges of the official national meteorological network of the german weather service available from 2006 to 2020 table 2 due to the flat topography of the region and due to the anthropogenic regulation of the water flows discharge cannot be derived from water level measurements direct observation of discharge would be required such elaborate measurements are not carried out by the federal agency of lower saxony so that discharge measurements were not available to compare and evaluate the model instead proxies such as pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimations were used which were provided by the water boards table 1 and the federal agency nlwkn https www nlwkn niedersachsen de pumping rate estimates are derived from continuous water level observations and the recording of operating times and pump curve characteristics engels 2022 while for individual pumping stations highly resolved pump characteristics are recorded e g pumping station knock in the emden water board fig 1 for other pumping stations average parameters need to be estimated based on experience of the local staff e g oldersum water board uncertainty in the estimates is smaller if pump curve characteristics are available in high temporal resolution tidal flow through a tidal gate is regularly estimated using a formula being developed by the federal agency such formulae were calibrated using the results of exemplary flow measurements of tidal flow through the gates while measuring water levels and the geometry of the gates engels 2022 along the north sea coast in lower saxony the federal agency developed such formulae for several tidal gates rupert 2004 meyer 1983 the uncertainty in the estimates mainly depends on sedimentation processes on both sides of a tidal gate affecting the geometry of the outlet and therefore also the hydraulic conditions regular flushing reduces such errors in the estimates the availability of those time series is summarized in table 2 for the four water boards while the length of the time series is not sufficient for trend analysis it is suitable for model calibration and validation see section 3 1 for the analyses on the impacts of climate change on coastal hydrology a set of scenarios was applied covering pessimistic business as usual as well as moderate or even quite optimistic scenarios successful climate mitigation the ensemble combines traditional sres scenarios of the ipcc 2000 with scenarios based on representative concentration pathways of greenhouse gases until end of the 21st century rcp ipcc 2013 the ensemble is based on three different regional climate models rcm wettreg enke et al 2005 remo jacob 2001 and xds bürger et al 2005 the following rcm calculations for the different scenarios were used a1b remo wettreg a2 remo wettreg b1 remo wettreg rcp4 5 xds rcp8 5 xds although not the most recent climate change scenarios are used in this study such as ssp scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways see ipcc 2021 the selection of the ensemble members can be justified by two main reasons first the selected scenarios cover the same range of future climate developments as the ssp scenarios do ipcc 2021 therefore we cover the same bandwidth of climate projections second the target group of our study such as water boards and environmental agencies is familiar with the rcp and the sres scenario families spiekermann et al 2018 the selected scenarios are also part of a scenario ensemble on which the federal states and the german government agreed to be used for climate adaptation studies linke et al 2022 thus using the selected scenarios raises acceptance and makes it likely that results will be used for climate adaptation action in germany for the evaluation of the scenario calculations the climate scenarios were grouped into pessimistic scenarios business as usual a1b a2 rcp8 5 and moderate ones successful mitigation b1 rcp4 5 in order to feed and quantify the effects of two different contradictory storylines bias correction was not required for the two statistical climate models xds and wettreg because they are based on statistic approaches reproducing exactly the station specific statistics of climate variables for a control period however bias correction was carried out for the simulations of the dynamic climate model remo here a monthly linear scaling shrestha et al 2017 was applied to the remo simulations for the control period 1971 2000 to correct a long term overestimation of precipitation and temperature while remo simulations well represent the seasonality in temperature for the control period slight overestimation of average annual temperature of 0 32 c seasonality in precipitation is not well represented especially for the autumn and winter months remo significantly overestimates monthly precipitation fig 2 in average remo results show an overestimation of average monthly precipitation in the order of 28 mm per month at the german weather service station emden in order to reproduce seasonality in precipitation and temperature correctly monthly specific bias correction factors were applied to the model data for all months of the year 2 3 modelling approach the hydrological model simulat diekkrüger and arning 1995 bormann 2008 is a physically based and continuous hydrological soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat scheme it simulates one dimensional hydrological processes the model calculates daily water fluxes while internal computation of non linear processes such as evapotranspiration and infiltration is hourly simulat focuses on vertical water fluxes and is a typical svat scheme applied to calculate coupled water and nutrient fluxes the model was developed by diekkrüger and arning 1995 for the simulation of agrometeorological systems and later extended for the calculation of spatially distributed catchment water flows bormann 2008 it can be also applied to provide the lower boundary condition for meteorological models representing the hydrological processes at the land s surface therefore it is assumed to be able being used in climate change impact studies bormann et al 2012 2018 basic equations included in simulat are the richards equation to calculate soil water flux and the penman monteith equation for the potential evapotranspiration pet monteith 1965 actual evapotranspiration aet is calculated from pet taking into account the actual soil moisture state approaches of feddes et al 1978 for transpiration and ritchie 1972 for evaporation further processes considered by simulat are the separation of rainfall into surface runoff and infiltration performed by a semi analytical solution of the richards equation smith and parlange 1978 interflow based on darcy s law groundwater recharge lower boundary condition and snowmelt degree day approach a plant growth model is not included instead mean seasonal development of plant parameters is estimated by linear interpolation of literature values interception is simulated by applying a storage based approach where storage capacity is proportional to leaf area index evaporation from interception storage is assumed to happen with potential rate for the simulation of permeable moraine areas a separation of direct runoff drainage runoff and groundwater runoff as described in kunkel and wendland 2002 and herrmann et al 2013 later extended by herrmann 2018 was introduced simulat is a physically based model and therefore model parameters are in principal measurable at the local scale most model parameters were taken from literature e g braden 1995 löpmeier 1983 or derived by transfer functions such as the pedotransfer function of rawls and brakensiek 1985 a model intercomparison study of agroecosystem models indicated that simulat simulates the water dynamics of agricultural sites with the same quality as calibrated site models diekkrüger et al 1995 nevertheless manual parameter optimisation was carried out based on the result of a systematic sensitivity analysis to improve the representation of the annual water balance as well as the seasonal flow patterns of the water board areas for this purpose those parameters were optimized determining evapotranspiration such as leaf area index stomata resistance root zone depth see table 3 and the lower boundary condition was adjusted according to topography at the scale of hydrological response units hru runoff is calculated by accumulating the three runoff components surface runoff interflow and drainage runoff for each time step at the water board scale the water fluxes of the hru are weighted by area and added up runoff routing is not considered in this study because the low hydraulic heads in marsh areas are mainly influenced by operating pumps and sluices hydraulic heads therefore are temporarily variable in addition spatially resolved information on hydraulic heads is not available therefore we assume that a 1 d model is applicable to reproduce the vertical water balance to cope with missing information on small scale horizontal flow in the ditches and channels the time step of comparison between observed proxies pumping rates tidal gate flow rates and simulated runoff generation was adjusted in order to justify neglecting this process this comparison focused on weekly and monthly values of drainage demand instead of daily values 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation for model calibration and validation weekly and monthly tidal gate flow estimations and pumping rates table 2 were compared against simulated runoff generation rates the available time series were split according to the split sample test refsgaard and storm 1996 due to different data availability calibration and validation periods were selected individually for the different water board areas simulation statistics on the comparison of runoff generation against the sum of pumping rates and tidal gate flows is provided for calibration and validation periods for three of the four water board areas table 4 while for the water board aurich neither information on discharge nor on discharge proxies flow is available the area of the water board oldersum was divided into two parts due to their varying physiographic characteristics upstream downstream according to the classification by moriasi et al 2007 estimation of drainage demand by water flow simulation yields at least satisfactory results for all water boards with regard to coefficient of determination and model efficiency satisfactory goodness of fit r² 0 6 and nse 0 5 table 4 for emden and norden water board areas simulation results reflect the temporal dynamics even very well very good goodness of fit r² 0 85 and nse 0 8 table 4 good representation of seasonality and temporal variability of drainage volumes is also confirmed by the hydrographs presented in fig 3 the simulation of the annual discharge is also satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 for most of the simulated water board areas satisfactory goodness of fit bias 15 table 4 while simulation quality differs between calibration and validation periods while for emden norden and oldersum downstream simulation quality decreases from calibration to validation simulation for oldersum upstream increases this might be due to the fact that only monthly data are available for oldersum water board limiting the possibilities for the calibration of a process oriented model however considering the different nature of the water flows compared simulated runoff generation versus pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimates and the anthropogenic interference of the water system simulation quality is sufficient for a subsequent model application for climate impact scenario analysis 3 2 scenario analysis all climate scenarios applied in this study are featuring a temperature increase until end of the 21st century regional warming is projected for all seasons while increase in winter temperature seems to be larger than in summer projections on temperature increase in the far future 2071 2100 range from 1 4 to 2 8 c in summer and from 1 8 to 4 2 c in winter while the increase in annual average ranges from 1 6 to 2 7 c compared to the control period for the statistics see table 5 therefore an increase in pet can be assumed for all combinations of models and scenarios in all seasons compared to temperature the projected patterns in precipitation are much more specific depending on the season the emission scenario concentration pathway the model and on the time period in the future table 6 while for annual precipitation the projected changes are relatively small for all scenarios and time periods of projection max 6 increase for the pessimistic scenarios in far future seasonality of precipitation is much more affected precipitation is projected to decrease in summer 5 13 and to increase in winter 15 32 pessimistic scenarios tend to show a stronger change signal and time periods in the far future show a stronger change signal compared to the near future table 6 nevertheless this is just a characterization of the average behaviour while the change signal for the winter is quite robust for the middle and far future uncertainty is larger for the projection of summer precipitation individual climate models even project an increase in precipitation in summer xds regional climate model driving simulat model with the ensemble of climate projections results in an ensemble of runoff projections which we assume to be representative for the future drainage demand planning horizon for strategic regional water management planning is in the order of 50 60 years ahlhorn et al 2018 therefore focus on the expected climate change impact on drainage demand is set on the far future 2071 2100 we assume that such time horizon is also appropriate as horizon for long term strategic technical climate adaptation measures nevertheless projected drainage demands are also shown for the middle future 2041 2070 to investigate the urgency and potential needs for an early climate change adaptation the simulations reveal that the projected changes in the annual runoff generation are smaller than seasonal changes table 7 similar to the precipitation projections runoff generation is projected to increase significantly in the wet winter period while for the summer season a decrease is expected fig 4 this is consistent for all simulated water board areas for the far future the magnitude of expected changes in drainage demand is consistent for all water boards for the winter season 20 32 increase for the pessimistic scenarios 15 20 increase for the moderate ones while for the summer season there is only a conformity on the direction of change decrease in runoff generation seems to be more pronounced on marsh areas compared to moraine areas due to the soil hydraulic properties and changes seem to be more intensive for the far future table 7 this pattern is consistent for all water board areas for the pessimistic scenarios while for the moderate ones differences in runoff generation between the middle and the far future are small the simulation results for the aet show an increase for all seasons for all combinations of models and scenarios mainly driven by the projected increase in temperature for both moderate and pessimistic scenarios increase in absolute aet is largest in summer while relative change is largest in the winter months see table 8 for the ev emden water board area while in the winter months the increase in precipitation overcompensates for the slight absolute increase in aet resulting in an increase in drainage demand in the summer months the increase in eta and the decrease in precipitation add up to a significant reduction in runoff generation resulting also in a reduction of surface water availability analysing the frequency of the occurrence of large weekly runoff generation volumes in the future reveals a significant increase in particular for the far future 2071 2100 fig 5 the evaluation of the projections for the water board ev emden shows that for all investigated classes of runoff generation volumes ranging from 20 to more than 60 mm per week the frequency of events is continuously increasing in the future although downscaling and bias correction did not explicitly focus on extreme events the results indicate a potential intensification of wet periods in particular for the pessimistic scenarios in the far future like for the seasonal climate change effects shown before the results of this exemplary analysis for the water board ev emden are comparable to the other water boards regional differences in the climate effects are small between the water board regions e g table 7 change in frequency of wet periods in the future behave quite similar for the other three water boards not shown 4 discussion model calibration and validation indicate that the applied one dimensional and physics based water balance model is suitable to mimic the past drainage volumes of the low lying coastal region despite the main limitation of the model having no routing routine integrated seasonal dynamics and inter annual variability of runoff generation are well represented on the scale of the water boards however simulated daily runoff generation should not be directly compared to daily drainage rates because the drainage capacity of the water boards is limited due to technical dimensions and because runoff routing is not represented by the model this study indicated that an aggregation of daily runoff simulations to weekly rates resulted in reliable predictions to be able to represent also extreme runoff generation events as far as possible we decided to compare weekly and monthly drainage rates during calibration and validation so far comparable impact studies along the north sea coast were performed only for coastal river catchments brasseur et al 2017 hattermann et al 2015 or without model validation based on observed data like a priori model application bormann et al 2012 while continuous discharge measurements generally are not available in such anthropogenic influenced environments a quantitative model validation could be carried out for the first time based on discharge proxies such as pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimates the climate change impact analysis carried out in this study reveals robust climate change induced signals for all investigated water boards especially for the wet winter season direction and intensity of change in runoff generation are homogenous for all investigated water boards along the north sea coast for the pessimistic scenarios the largest climate change impacts were calculated with moderate scenarios indicating impacts in the same direction while changes in runoff generation were estimated largest for the far future the climate change impacts indicate an adaptation need already for the middle future such results are consistent with other studies focusing on climate change impacts on the discharge of coastal river catchments in northern germany e g hattermann et al 2015 brasseur et al 2017 this implies that also the increase in drainage demand can be expected to behave similar among the water boards due to the similarity of the change signals we conclude that during the wet season the spatially homogenous climate change signal dominates impact of soil heterogeneity among the water boards the simulated increase in runoff generation in winter is mainly governed by the climate scenario ensemble although the model has been proven to be sensitive to spatial heterogeneity of soil texture bormann 2012 and land use bormann et al 1999 hydrologic projections for the summer season are not as robust as for the winter on the one hand this is due to the fact that the precipitation projections are not as homogenous as for the winter season while differences in the calculations of regional aet are small on the other hand simulat model seems to be more sensitive to heterogeneity in soil and land use conditions in dry periods as suggested by the underlying hydrological process understanding therefore simulated hydrological change differs among the water boards during summer nevertheless according to bormann et al 2018 climate change impact dominates land use scenarios quantifying the impact of surface sealing in east frisia in general the simulated hydrological changes due to climate change are comparable to other studies on similar environments bormann et al 2012 hattermann et al 2015 brasseur et al 2017 for east frisia under climate change conditions this results in an increased runoff generation in the wet season winter time and a reduced runoff generation in the dry season summer time e g see also de girolamo et al 2022 in addition to the increase in runoff generation the predicted sea level rise will make drainage more difficult in future as discussed by ahlhorn et al 2018 and bormann et al 2018 for the german north sea coast tidal gate opening times will become shorter and pumps will have to convey water to higher sea water levels this suggests that both an increased drainage capacity as well as increased regional storage capacity can help to raise flexibility of the regional drainage system spiekermann et al 2018 while the projections for the far future provide essential information on the required increase of drainage capacity for the lifetime of the adapted infrastructure the projections for the middle future emphasize that an early adaptation is required because the existing drainage system might suffer an overload quite soon based on the homogeneity of the climate change impacts derived in this study sufficient knowledge is available to support planning of regional climate change adaptation measures although stakeholders often argue that more and specific impact assessments are required ahlhorn et al 2018 however uncertainties remain in the data and the description of the hydrological system since the system is highly anthropogenic influenced and the model can only be a simplification therefore supporting decision making under uncertainty would primarily accelerate the regional adaptation process 5 conclusion accurate information on probable climate change impacts as regularly asked by stakeholders is required for proper planning of climate change adaptation measures this study indicates that a 1 d physics based water balance model can be used for the assessment of the future drainage demand of low lying coastal areas pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimates are sufficient for hydrologic model validation the results of the model validated for three water board areas can be spatially transferred to drainage areas with similar climate change signals and physiographic characteristics this study also reveals a consistent challenge for all investigated water boards along the east frisian north sea coast all areas will have to cope with 1 an intensification of seasonality of drainage demand and 2 with an increasing frequency of large weekly runoff generation volumes while climate change impacts on reduced surface water availability during summer might differ the relative increase in winter drainage demand is almost equal for the neighbouring water board areas this indicates that also other water boards along the german north sea coast can make use of these results for their adaptation planning without a repetition of such study the study therefore derives an added value for long term water management planning the projected change in precipitation which may depend on the used climate ensemble combinations of climate models and scenarios is the dominant driver of the hydrological system the expected change in precipitation therefore is a robust indicator and valuable for awareness raising however the planning and dimensioning of concrete adaptation measures requires concrete estimation of climate impact on drainage demands the magnitude of such estimates can be determined based on the change signals simulated in this study despite the underlying uncertainties we conclude that adaptation planning of regional drainage can be based on exemplary impact studies as shown for four water boards in east frisia transferred to the entire region north sea coast of lower saxony credit authorship contribution

7618,study region the northwest german part of the north sea coast study focus low lying coastal areas are highly threatened by climate change this is due to rising sea level and changing water balance caused by climate change adaptation of coastal protection and inland drainage to climate change requires precise predictions of future conditions while information on sea level rise is globally available coastal water balance projections need to be specific for regions where often no discharge data is available to serve this demand a model based scenario analysis was carried out for four water boards in northwest germany these water boards are regional organisations responsible for drainage and surface water level regulation in marsh areas a water balance model was calibrated and validated against data of pumping stations and tidal water gates subsequently climate change impacts on runoff generation were estimated new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that runoff generation is expected to increase significantly in the wet season same as the frequency of periods with large runoff volumes the climate change impact signal is consistent over all investigated water board areas indicating that the climate change signal dominates the spatial variability in soil properties and land use the results emphasize the necessity to consider runoff generation projections for adjusting coastal drainage management the scenario projections can be directly used for regional adaptation planning processes taking into account the underlying uncertainties graphical abstract ga1 keywords coastal water boards climate change impact assessment runoff generation drainage demand hydrological model scenario analysis northwest germany data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large parts of the low lying areas along the german north sea coast are anthropogenic managed hydrological systems spiekermann et al 2018 bormann 2018 to protect the productive landscape against tidal inundations and storm floods inhabitants started building dikes and sea walls more than 1000 years ago due to the humid climate and the positive water balance of inland areas along the north sea the concurrent development of an efficient drainage system was necessary bormann 2018 therefore sluices and pumping stations were built to convey the excess water from the hinterland to the sea such drainage management has been improved over the past decades keeping all areas productive during the year similar defence and drainage systems were developed also at many other low lying coastal regions around the world being faced with similar challenges e g the netherlands van alphen et al 2015 ritzema and stuyt 2015 the us titus et al 1987 australia waddington et al 2022 and new zeeland kool et al 2020 due to land subsidence and mineralization of soils gradually pumping stations supplemented and finally replaced sluices at many locations resulting in improved drainage standards however drainage systems often reach their limitations already today if storm surges and intense rainfall happen at the same time kool et al 2020 van den hurk et al 2015 along shallow coastlines adaptation to future climate change already needs to be considered today according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc climate change will continue including sea level rise global warming and a change in precipitation patterns ipcc 2021 coastal areas are seen as high risk areas with regard to sea level rise coastal flooding and extreme events ipcc 2022 while a long term planning has been set up for coastal protection in lower saxony germany nlwkn 2007 2020 and other federal states along the north sea coast e g hofstede et al 2019 considering a sea level rise of at least 1 m until year 2100 no general planning is available for draining the low lying coastal areas in germany consequently the individual water boards which regulate surface water levels in a region are responsible for their own climate change adaptation planning in contrast for the netherlands the delta program tackles the issue in a more integrative way combining the management of the coastline flood risks and freshwater resources delta programme 2021 adaptation pathways are tested and compared searching for tipping points where system behaviour changes and where new different solutions are required haasnoot et al 2020 van alphen et al 2015 in the netherlands also the principles of controlled drainage have been suggested enabling the shift from a strategy of rapid removal of all excess water to one that continuously controls water levels individually in each plot ritzema and stuyt 2015 perceiving water as risk and resource at the same time such solutions offer more flexibility and spatially distributed solutions for the climate change adaptation of the drainage system of a single water board regionally specific information on potential climate change impacts is required however national and regional climate services in germany such as gerics 2023 and niklis 2023 only offer standard climate change indicators while specific information on changes in water balances or drainage demands is not available similarly most of the available international studies only focus on the impact of the regional sea level rise on coastal drainage systems haasnoot et al 2020 kool et al 2020 ritzema and stuyt 2015 they explicitly consider the connected uncertainties in sea level rise but widely ignore potential changes in the terrestrial water balance of the drained water board areas to serve this demand for an integrative climate adaptation of coastal regions climate change impact simulations are required which specify potential changes in the water balance for individual water boards for a successful long term adaptation of drainage management in addition to sea level rise hydrological projections must take into account the regional characteristics and the drainage management system spiekermann et al 2018 such projections are driven by regional climate projections and quantify the hydrological changes induced by regional climate change bormann et al 2018 climate impact simulations for a similar environment indicate a hydrological change for the german north sea coast characterized by dryer summers and increasing precipitation in wintertime bormann et al 2012 2018 von storch and claussen 2011 however robust local impact assessments must be based on validated hydrological models being based on local discharge measurements such information is widely not available for the anthropogenic managed marsh areas only for few water board areas in northwest germany discharge proxies such as pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimations are available in sufficient accuracy and resolution this challenge is explicitly addressed by the approach of this study based on such available data from four east frisian water boards and one federal agency the physically based hydrological model simulat diekkrüger and arning 1995 bormann 2008 is calibrated validated and applied to an ensemble of regional climate projections simulated hydrological changes are translated into hydrological change indicators and analysed for regional consistency we test whether 1 tidal gate flow estimates and pumping data are sufficient for model validation 2 simulated runoff generation is considerably affected by climate change projections and 3 climate change impact signals as well as the derived indicators are similar among the areas of neighbouring water boards in case significant and consistent change patterns for the study region are identified such indicators can be assumed to be appropriate for regional climate adaptation planning of coastal regions considering drainage for a future oriented integrative coastal zone management in general 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the target region east frisia the study area is located in north west germany along the ems estuary east frisia it consists of the area of four water boards emden norden oldersum and aurich covering 1332 km² in total table 1 the landscape is characterized by a flat terrain fig 1 partly lying up to 2 m below sea level table 1 most of the soils are marsh and fen soils and dairy farming is dominating agriculture in the moraine areas sandy soils dominate and crops such as maize wheat and rape dominate the landscape the climate of the region is humid average annual precipitation is around 823 mm while annual average temperature is around 10 c german weather service https www dwd de weather station emden to protect the landscape against the sea dikes were built and enforced over hundreds of years in east frisia protecting the land against the high tides and in particular against storm tides due to the wet climate and the positive water balance in the hinterland building dikes required an intense and sophisticated drainage management a dense network of ditches and canals was built over time 2410 km 2nd and 3rd level water courses and water is drained to the north sea via six tidal gates and five pumping stations for the lowest lying parts additional 44 internal pumping stations were installed to lift the water to the main drainage canals natural rivers do not exist in the study area drainage management strongly influences the water balance of the low lying areas focusing on keeping the feet of the inhabitants dry the water boards aim at adjusting constant water levels in the main drainage system that implies that a high correlation between precipitation and drainage rates is likely only in case of runoff generation events exceeding drainage capacity and in case of drought periods such assumption might fail 2 2 data availability for the study area spatial data sets were available on the topography a high resolution 1 m digital elevation model https www lgln

land cover the borders and the area of the four above mentioned water boards within the area of investigation data provided by the water boards spatial data sets were used for parameterization and spatial discretization of the simulat model diekkrüger and arning 1995 bormann 2008 see detailed model description in section 2 3 hourly time series of weather data temperature solar radiation air humidity wind speed available from 1997 to 2020 from weather station emden were used to drive the model for calibration and validation periods the weather station emden is the only station in the area of interest providing weather data in hourly resolution hourly precipitation time series were derived from the radolan radar online aneichung product of the german weather service https www dwd de radolan provides a spatially distributed hourly radar product which is calibrated by rain gauges of the official national meteorological network of the german weather service available from 2006 to 2020 table 2 due to the flat topography of the region and due to the anthropogenic regulation of the water flows discharge cannot be derived from water level measurements direct observation of discharge would be required such elaborate measurements are not carried out by the federal agency of lower saxony so that discharge measurements were not available to compare and evaluate the model instead proxies such as pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimations were used which were provided by the water boards table 1 and the federal agency nlwkn https www nlwkn niedersachsen de pumping rate estimates are derived from continuous water level observations and the recording of operating times and pump curve characteristics engels 2022 while for individual pumping stations highly resolved pump characteristics are recorded e g pumping station knock in the emden water board fig 1 for other pumping stations average parameters need to be estimated based on experience of the local staff e g oldersum water board uncertainty in the estimates is smaller if pump curve characteristics are available in high temporal resolution tidal flow through a tidal gate is regularly estimated using a formula being developed by the federal agency such formulae were calibrated using the results of exemplary flow measurements of tidal flow through the gates while measuring water levels and the geometry of the gates engels 2022 along the north sea coast in lower saxony the federal agency developed such formulae for several tidal gates rupert 2004 meyer 1983 the uncertainty in the estimates mainly depends on sedimentation processes on both sides of a tidal gate affecting the geometry of the outlet and therefore also the hydraulic conditions regular flushing reduces such errors in the estimates the availability of those time series is summarized in table 2 for the four water boards while the length of the time series is not sufficient for trend analysis it is suitable for model calibration and validation see section 3 1 for the analyses on the impacts of climate change on coastal hydrology a set of scenarios was applied covering pessimistic business as usual as well as moderate or even quite optimistic scenarios successful climate mitigation the ensemble combines traditional sres scenarios of the ipcc 2000 with scenarios based on representative concentration pathways of greenhouse gases until end of the 21st century rcp ipcc 2013 the ensemble is based on three different regional climate models rcm wettreg enke et al 2005 remo jacob 2001 and xds bürger et al 2005 the following rcm calculations for the different scenarios were used a1b remo wettreg a2 remo wettreg b1 remo wettreg rcp4 5 xds rcp8 5 xds although not the most recent climate change scenarios are used in this study such as ssp scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways see ipcc 2021 the selection of the ensemble members can be justified by two main reasons first the selected scenarios cover the same range of future climate developments as the ssp scenarios do ipcc 2021 therefore we cover the same bandwidth of climate projections second the target group of our study such as water boards and environmental agencies is familiar with the rcp and the sres scenario families spiekermann et al 2018 the selected scenarios are also part of a scenario ensemble on which the federal states and the german government agreed to be used for climate adaptation studies linke et al 2022 thus using the selected scenarios raises acceptance and makes it likely that results will be used for climate adaptation action in germany for the evaluation of the scenario calculations the climate scenarios were grouped into pessimistic scenarios business as usual a1b a2 rcp8 5 and moderate ones successful mitigation b1 rcp4 5 in order to feed and quantify the effects of two different contradictory storylines bias correction was not required for the two statistical climate models xds and wettreg because they are based on statistic approaches reproducing exactly the station specific statistics of climate variables for a control period however bias correction was carried out for the simulations of the dynamic climate model remo here a monthly linear scaling shrestha et al 2017 was applied to the remo simulations for the control period 1971 2000 to correct a long term overestimation of precipitation and temperature while remo simulations well represent the seasonality in temperature for the control period slight overestimation of average annual temperature of 0 32 c seasonality in precipitation is not well represented especially for the autumn and winter months remo significantly overestimates monthly precipitation fig 2 in average remo results show an overestimation of average monthly precipitation in the order of 28 mm per month at the german weather service station emden in order to reproduce seasonality in precipitation and temperature correctly monthly specific bias correction factors were applied to the model data for all months of the year 2 3 modelling approach the hydrological model simulat diekkrüger and arning 1995 bormann 2008 is a physically based and continuous hydrological soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat scheme it simulates one dimensional hydrological processes the model calculates daily water fluxes while internal computation of non linear processes such as evapotranspiration and infiltration is hourly simulat focuses on vertical water fluxes and is a typical svat scheme applied to calculate coupled water and nutrient fluxes the model was developed by diekkrüger and arning 1995 for the simulation of agrometeorological systems and later extended for the calculation of spatially distributed catchment water flows bormann 2008 it can be also applied to provide the lower boundary condition for meteorological models representing the hydrological processes at the land s surface therefore it is assumed to be able being used in climate change impact studies bormann et al 2012 2018 basic equations included in simulat are the richards equation to calculate soil water flux and the penman monteith equation for the potential evapotranspiration pet monteith 1965 actual evapotranspiration aet is calculated from pet taking into account the actual soil moisture state approaches of feddes et al 1978 for transpiration and ritchie 1972 for evaporation further processes considered by simulat are the separation of rainfall into surface runoff and infiltration performed by a semi analytical solution of the richards equation smith and parlange 1978 interflow based on darcy s law groundwater recharge lower boundary condition and snowmelt degree day approach a plant growth model is not included instead mean seasonal development of plant parameters is estimated by linear interpolation of literature values interception is simulated by applying a storage based approach where storage capacity is proportional to leaf area index evaporation from interception storage is assumed to happen with potential rate for the simulation of permeable moraine areas a separation of direct runoff drainage runoff and groundwater runoff as described in kunkel and wendland 2002 and herrmann et al 2013 later extended by herrmann 2018 was introduced simulat is a physically based model and therefore model parameters are in principal measurable at the local scale most model parameters were taken from literature e g braden 1995 löpmeier 1983 or derived by transfer functions such as the pedotransfer function of rawls and brakensiek 1985 a model intercomparison study of agroecosystem models indicated that simulat simulates the water dynamics of agricultural sites with the same quality as calibrated site models diekkrüger et al 1995 nevertheless manual parameter optimisation was carried out based on the result of a systematic sensitivity analysis to improve the representation of the annual water balance as well as the seasonal flow patterns of the water board areas for this purpose those parameters were optimized determining evapotranspiration such as leaf area index stomata resistance root zone depth see table 3 and the lower boundary condition was adjusted according to topography at the scale of hydrological response units hru runoff is calculated by accumulating the three runoff components surface runoff interflow and drainage runoff for each time step at the water board scale the water fluxes of the hru are weighted by area and added up runoff routing is not considered in this study because the low hydraulic heads in marsh areas are mainly influenced by operating pumps and sluices hydraulic heads therefore are temporarily variable in addition spatially resolved information on hydraulic heads is not available therefore we assume that a 1 d model is applicable to reproduce the vertical water balance to cope with missing information on small scale horizontal flow in the ditches and channels the time step of comparison between observed proxies pumping rates tidal gate flow rates and simulated runoff generation was adjusted in order to justify neglecting this process this comparison focused on weekly and monthly values of drainage demand instead of daily values 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation for model calibration and validation weekly and monthly tidal gate flow estimations and pumping rates table 2 were compared against simulated runoff generation rates the available time series were split according to the split sample test refsgaard and storm 1996 due to different data availability calibration and validation periods were selected individually for the different water board areas simulation statistics on the comparison of runoff generation against the sum of pumping rates and tidal gate flows is provided for calibration and validation periods for three of the four water board areas table 4 while for the water board aurich neither information on discharge nor on discharge proxies flow is available the area of the water board oldersum was divided into two parts due to their varying physiographic characteristics upstream downstream according to the classification by moriasi et al 2007 estimation of drainage demand by water flow simulation yields at least satisfactory results for all water boards with regard to coefficient of determination and model efficiency satisfactory goodness of fit r² 0 6 and nse 0 5 table 4 for emden and norden water board areas simulation results reflect the temporal dynamics even very well very good goodness of fit r² 0 85 and nse 0 8 table 4 good representation of seasonality and temporal variability of drainage volumes is also confirmed by the hydrographs presented in fig 3 the simulation of the annual discharge is also satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 for most of the simulated water board areas satisfactory goodness of fit bias 15 table 4 while simulation quality differs between calibration and validation periods while for emden norden and oldersum downstream simulation quality decreases from calibration to validation simulation for oldersum upstream increases this might be due to the fact that only monthly data are available for oldersum water board limiting the possibilities for the calibration of a process oriented model however considering the different nature of the water flows compared simulated runoff generation versus pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimates and the anthropogenic interference of the water system simulation quality is sufficient for a subsequent model application for climate impact scenario analysis 3 2 scenario analysis all climate scenarios applied in this study are featuring a temperature increase until end of the 21st century regional warming is projected for all seasons while increase in winter temperature seems to be larger than in summer projections on temperature increase in the far future 2071 2100 range from 1 4 to 2 8 c in summer and from 1 8 to 4 2 c in winter while the increase in annual average ranges from 1 6 to 2 7 c compared to the control period for the statistics see table 5 therefore an increase in pet can be assumed for all combinations of models and scenarios in all seasons compared to temperature the projected patterns in precipitation are much more specific depending on the season the emission scenario concentration pathway the model and on the time period in the future table 6 while for annual precipitation the projected changes are relatively small for all scenarios and time periods of projection max 6 increase for the pessimistic scenarios in far future seasonality of precipitation is much more affected precipitation is projected to decrease in summer 5 13 and to increase in winter 15 32 pessimistic scenarios tend to show a stronger change signal and time periods in the far future show a stronger change signal compared to the near future table 6 nevertheless this is just a characterization of the average behaviour while the change signal for the winter is quite robust for the middle and far future uncertainty is larger for the projection of summer precipitation individual climate models even project an increase in precipitation in summer xds regional climate model driving simulat model with the ensemble of climate projections results in an ensemble of runoff projections which we assume to be representative for the future drainage demand planning horizon for strategic regional water management planning is in the order of 50 60 years ahlhorn et al 2018 therefore focus on the expected climate change impact on drainage demand is set on the far future 2071 2100 we assume that such time horizon is also appropriate as horizon for long term strategic technical climate adaptation measures nevertheless projected drainage demands are also shown for the middle future 2041 2070 to investigate the urgency and potential needs for an early climate change adaptation the simulations reveal that the projected changes in the annual runoff generation are smaller than seasonal changes table 7 similar to the precipitation projections runoff generation is projected to increase significantly in the wet winter period while for the summer season a decrease is expected fig 4 this is consistent for all simulated water board areas for the far future the magnitude of expected changes in drainage demand is consistent for all water boards for the winter season 20 32 increase for the pessimistic scenarios 15 20 increase for the moderate ones while for the summer season there is only a conformity on the direction of change decrease in runoff generation seems to be more pronounced on marsh areas compared to moraine areas due to the soil hydraulic properties and changes seem to be more intensive for the far future table 7 this pattern is consistent for all water board areas for the pessimistic scenarios while for the moderate ones differences in runoff generation between the middle and the far future are small the simulation results for the aet show an increase for all seasons for all combinations of models and scenarios mainly driven by the projected increase in temperature for both moderate and pessimistic scenarios increase in absolute aet is largest in summer while relative change is largest in the winter months see table 8 for the ev emden water board area while in the winter months the increase in precipitation overcompensates for the slight absolute increase in aet resulting in an increase in drainage demand in the summer months the increase in eta and the decrease in precipitation add up to a significant reduction in runoff generation resulting also in a reduction of surface water availability analysing the frequency of the occurrence of large weekly runoff generation volumes in the future reveals a significant increase in particular for the far future 2071 2100 fig 5 the evaluation of the projections for the water board ev emden shows that for all investigated classes of runoff generation volumes ranging from 20 to more than 60 mm per week the frequency of events is continuously increasing in the future although downscaling and bias correction did not explicitly focus on extreme events the results indicate a potential intensification of wet periods in particular for the pessimistic scenarios in the far future like for the seasonal climate change effects shown before the results of this exemplary analysis for the water board ev emden are comparable to the other water boards regional differences in the climate effects are small between the water board regions e g table 7 change in frequency of wet periods in the future behave quite similar for the other three water boards not shown 4 discussion model calibration and validation indicate that the applied one dimensional and physics based water balance model is suitable to mimic the past drainage volumes of the low lying coastal region despite the main limitation of the model having no routing routine integrated seasonal dynamics and inter annual variability of runoff generation are well represented on the scale of the water boards however simulated daily runoff generation should not be directly compared to daily drainage rates because the drainage capacity of the water boards is limited due to technical dimensions and because runoff routing is not represented by the model this study indicated that an aggregation of daily runoff simulations to weekly rates resulted in reliable predictions to be able to represent also extreme runoff generation events as far as possible we decided to compare weekly and monthly drainage rates during calibration and validation so far comparable impact studies along the north sea coast were performed only for coastal river catchments brasseur et al 2017 hattermann et al 2015 or without model validation based on observed data like a priori model application bormann et al 2012 while continuous discharge measurements generally are not available in such anthropogenic influenced environments a quantitative model validation could be carried out for the first time based on discharge proxies such as pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimates the climate change impact analysis carried out in this study reveals robust climate change induced signals for all investigated water boards especially for the wet winter season direction and intensity of change in runoff generation are homogenous for all investigated water boards along the north sea coast for the pessimistic scenarios the largest climate change impacts were calculated with moderate scenarios indicating impacts in the same direction while changes in runoff generation were estimated largest for the far future the climate change impacts indicate an adaptation need already for the middle future such results are consistent with other studies focusing on climate change impacts on the discharge of coastal river catchments in northern germany e g hattermann et al 2015 brasseur et al 2017 this implies that also the increase in drainage demand can be expected to behave similar among the water boards due to the similarity of the change signals we conclude that during the wet season the spatially homogenous climate change signal dominates impact of soil heterogeneity among the water boards the simulated increase in runoff generation in winter is mainly governed by the climate scenario ensemble although the model has been proven to be sensitive to spatial heterogeneity of soil texture bormann 2012 and land use bormann et al 1999 hydrologic projections for the summer season are not as robust as for the winter on the one hand this is due to the fact that the precipitation projections are not as homogenous as for the winter season while differences in the calculations of regional aet are small on the other hand simulat model seems to be more sensitive to heterogeneity in soil and land use conditions in dry periods as suggested by the underlying hydrological process understanding therefore simulated hydrological change differs among the water boards during summer nevertheless according to bormann et al 2018 climate change impact dominates land use scenarios quantifying the impact of surface sealing in east frisia in general the simulated hydrological changes due to climate change are comparable to other studies on similar environments bormann et al 2012 hattermann et al 2015 brasseur et al 2017 for east frisia under climate change conditions this results in an increased runoff generation in the wet season winter time and a reduced runoff generation in the dry season summer time e g see also de girolamo et al 2022 in addition to the increase in runoff generation the predicted sea level rise will make drainage more difficult in future as discussed by ahlhorn et al 2018 and bormann et al 2018 for the german north sea coast tidal gate opening times will become shorter and pumps will have to convey water to higher sea water levels this suggests that both an increased drainage capacity as well as increased regional storage capacity can help to raise flexibility of the regional drainage system spiekermann et al 2018 while the projections for the far future provide essential information on the required increase of drainage capacity for the lifetime of the adapted infrastructure the projections for the middle future emphasize that an early adaptation is required because the existing drainage system might suffer an overload quite soon based on the homogeneity of the climate change impacts derived in this study sufficient knowledge is available to support planning of regional climate change adaptation measures although stakeholders often argue that more and specific impact assessments are required ahlhorn et al 2018 however uncertainties remain in the data and the description of the hydrological system since the system is highly anthropogenic influenced and the model can only be a simplification therefore supporting decision making under uncertainty would primarily accelerate the regional adaptation process 5 conclusion accurate information on probable climate change impacts as regularly asked by stakeholders is required for proper planning of climate change adaptation measures this study indicates that a 1 d physics based water balance model can be used for the assessment of the future drainage demand of low lying coastal areas pumping rates and tidal gate flow estimates are sufficient for hydrologic model validation the results of the model validated for three water board areas can be spatially transferred to drainage areas with similar climate change signals and physiographic characteristics this study also reveals a consistent challenge for all investigated water boards along the east frisian north sea coast all areas will have to cope with 1 an intensification of seasonality of drainage demand and 2 with an increasing frequency of large weekly runoff generation volumes while climate change impacts on reduced surface water availability during summer might differ the relative increase in winter drainage demand is almost equal for the neighbouring water board areas this indicates that also other water boards along the german north sea coast can make use of these results for their adaptation planning without a repetition of such study the study therefore derives an added value for long term water management planning the projected change in precipitation which may depend on the used climate ensemble combinations of climate models and scenarios is the dominant driver of the hydrological system the expected change in precipitation therefore is a robust indicator and valuable for awareness raising however the planning and dimensioning of concrete adaptation measures requires concrete estimation of climate impact on drainage demands the magnitude of such estimates can be determined based on the change signals simulated in this study despite the underlying uncertainties we conclude that adaptation planning of regional drainage can be based on exemplary impact studies as shown for four water boards in east frisia transferred to the entire region north sea coast of lower saxony credit authorship contribution

environment of the lake interfacial mass flux methods are usually divided into pore water concentration diffusion model dm and non diffusion model ndm jiang et al 2022 the dm uses fick s first law fl to calculate the interfacial mass flux by measuring the concentrations of the overlying water and pore water the ndm estimates the mass flux during the test cycle by measuring the changes in concentration in the overlying water column based on the law of mass conservation koomklang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 notably many factors affect the mass flux across the swi for example the difference in the physical and chemical properties of the overlying water column and sediments causes seasonal variations in the interfacial mass flux seiki et al 1989 wen et al 2022 turbulent diffusion caused by wind wave disturbances can increase the interfacial mass flux by 8 to 10 fold tang et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 therefore the theoretical value of dm is often lower than the actual value the ndm cannot truly reflect the influence of natural flow turbulence and porosity on the diffusion of water soluble organic substances therefore it is insufficient to characterize the temporal and spatial changes in the interfacial mass flux affected by sediment differences and seasonal succession the mass flux across the swi may vary by several orders of magnitude in different regions and seasons in the lake li et al 2021b in particular short term disturbances will also cause a sudden increase in the interfacial mass flux yuan et al 2021 and increase the risk of eutrophication in local areas huang et al 2016 qin et al 2019 notably the estimation model of interfacial mass flux can describe the temporal and spatial changes of hydrodynamics and sediment and can more accurately monitor and manage the water environment the swi can be described as a three dimensional mixed layer that encompasses both water and sediment facies voermans et al 2018 proposed a mechanistic model to describe interfacial mass transport there are three transport regimes in this model wherein the molecular dispersive or turbulent transport regime dominates the mass flux of a passive tracer across the swi since the model was proposed many scholars have conducted relevant studies grant et al 2020 2012 for instance fan et al 2020 conducted annular flume tests and used parametric analysis methods to explore the relationship between the effective diffusivity coefficient hydrodynamics and bed elements liu et al 2021 used machine learning techniques to explore the relationship between the effective diffusivity coefficient and surface flow conditions bedforms and sediment characteristics these studies show that the model can be used to characterize the transport processes across the swi under different conditions such as bed roughness and hydrodynamics to quantify the interfacial mass flux however owing to the difficulty in obtaining hydrodynamic conditions at the swi there is a consensus in the literature regarding the applicability of this model in an actual water environment baiyangdian lake bl is the largest shallow lake in north china however owing to human activities bl has suffered from water pollution and ecological degradation therefore many scholars have studied sediment pollution plankton and water quality changes in the bl han et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wen et al 2022 found that the sediments of the bl were seriously affected by nitrogen pollution necessitating the need for ecological environment management li et al 2022 found that endogenous release is an important cause of water pollution thus an accurate description of the interfacial mass flux is essential for ecological restoration and management of the bl in this study based on the effective diffusion coefficient theory we constructed an interfacial mass flux estimation framework including sediment analysis in situ observations and a hydrodynamic model and applied it to estimate the nh4 n release flux across the swi of bl the results can provide guidance for the ecological environment management and dredging activities in bl as well as provide new insights for studying the interfacial transport processes 2 methods 2 1 study area bl 38 44 38 59 n 115 45 116 26 e is located in xiong an new area of hebei province it is the largest freshwater lake on the north china plain there are approximately 143 small lakes and more than 3700 ditches eight main streams including the baigou ping bao cao fu tang xiaoyi and zhulong rivers converge from the north west and south in this study bl was divided into seven areas shaochedian scd nanliuzhuang nlz zaolinzhuang zlz quantou qt caiputai cpt xiaobaiyangdian xbyd and mapeng mp fig 1a this region is characterized by a temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature between 6 8 and 12 7 c and the precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer long et al 2010 bl is known as the kidney of north china however owing to the lack of upstream and downstream collaborative protection during early economic and social development processes the water environment in bl is polluted 2 2 methods of sediment analysis grain size analysis of sediments using gravity sedimentation technique lavery et al 2001 determination of grain size distribution by observing the settling velocity of grains in the medium

organic matter in the sediment to carbon dioxide calculation of organic matter content in the sample by k2cr2o7 consumption measurement of ph in sediments using potentiometric methods the air dried sediment was vigorously stirred to form a suspension and the ph was measured using a ph meter the concentration of nh4 n in sediment was measured using nessler s reagent spectrophotometry a mixture consisting of sediment sample and 2 mol l kcl was shaken using an oscillator the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the supernatant was measured using a spectrophotometer 2 3 framework to estimate the interfacial mass flux based on the effective diffusivity coefficient feimf edc the framework to estimate the interfacial mass flux based on effective diffusivity coefficient feimf edc includes five steps fig 1b 1 analysis of sediments 2 in situ observations and the determination of shear velocity 3 construction of a hydrodynamic model for the study area 4 calculation of the shear velocity and 5 estimation of the interfacial mass flux 2 3 1 analysis of sediments the analysis of sediments mainly included the measurement of porosity effective grain and organic matter content of sediments combined with the actual situation of the bl exploration and sampling sites were established fig 1b blue point the exploration sites were used to investigate the physical and chemical indexes of the sediments and the sampling sites were used to obtain the distribution of the nh4 n content in the sediments and overlying water column the exploration sites were evenly arranged at a spacing of 1000 m and the sites were then added to the central area of the lake the sampling sites were based on exploration sites to select key areas such as the lake center and coast we selected a total of 237 exploration sites and 41 sampling sites fig 1 2 3 2 in situ observations and shear velocity we conducted long term in situ measurements from june to december 2021 in this study an acoustic doppler velometer velometer vector 6 mhz adv was used to obtain high frequency and high precision continuous observations of the water temperature water depth and three dimensional velocity of bl the locations of these devices are shown in fig 1 the relationship between the flow velocity u and shear velocity u at the swi e2 e3 was established by fitting the observed u and u values at the swi using the log profile method colesd 1956 2 u u 1 k ln z k s b 3 k s 3 d 90 1 1 1 e 25 λ where u is the flow velocity at a height z above the sediment bed u is the shear velocity and k is the von karman constant k 0 4 the roughness height k s depends on the characteristic grain diameter d 90 and the wavelength δ and amplitude λ of bedforms we assumed that the study region is a flat bed namely δ tends to 0 and λ tends to 2 3 3 construction of the hydrodynamic model for the study area the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model is used to simulate the hydrodynamics of bl the model uses stretched or sigma vertical coordinates and cartesian or curvilinear orthogonal horizontal coordinates gao et al 2018 the hydrodynamic process of the model satisfied the basic laws of mass momentum and energy conservation to improve the computational efficiency vertical hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations were assumed the model used the internal external mode separation method to solve the continuity and momentum equations considering the simulation accuracy computational efficiency and computational stability bl was discretized into 29 288 orthogonal horizontal grids with 79 293 nodes 100 100 m the grid elevation is obtained by interpolating the measured data the details of the model construction and parameter calibration are presented in sun et al 2022 2 3 4 calculation of the shear velocity the simulation results of the hydrodynamic model were substituted into e2 to determine the shear velocity distribution in the study area 2 3 5 estimation of the mass flux of swi the

size 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of sediments 3 1 1 porosity and effective grain size the sediment porosity in the study area varied within 0 47 0 92 and the effective grain size varied from 0 001 to 0 011 mm the distributions of sediment porosity and effective grain sizes in the different regions are shown in fig 2 the results indicated differences in the porosities of each area the porosity distributions of nlz and mp were relatively uniform the range of qt variation was the largest and the minimum porosity was also observed in this area the effective grain sizes in different regions were considerably different the maximum and minimum effective grain sizes were observed in qt and zlz respectively simultaneously we observed that the effective grain of the zlz is low compared with those of other areas which may result in the relatively low permeability coefficient of the area the distribution of sediment grain size depends on the depositional environment shi et al 2002 hydrodynamics is an important factor affecting the distribution of grain size chen et al 2022 the smaller flow velocity in the zlz may be the main reason for the significantly lower particle size than in other areas sun et al 2022 3 1 2 organic matter content ph value and nh4 n content the organic matter content of sediments varied within 0 3 5 86 with a mean of 2 7 the areas with organic matter content greater than 5 0 included scd xbyd mp and qt and the organic matter content in other areas was less than 5 0 the ph value of the sediments varied between 7 79 and 9 53 with a mean of 8 6 indicating a weakly alkaline environment the maximum and minimum ph values were observed in mp and scd respectively the background value of the local soil environment is slightly alkaline the ph of the soil in the study area is approximately 8 5 varying within 8 0 8 6 and rarely below 8 0 or above 9 0 therefore we considered that the alkaline hazard of sediments can be ignored the spatial distributions of the organic matter content ph value and nh4 n content in the sediments are shown in fig 3 notably the nh4 n content varied between 1 8 and 106 57 mg kg and the maximum value was observed in nlz the nh4 n content is enriched in nlz and xbyd and that in zlz and scd is low nh4 n pollution in bl mainly originates from agricultural non point source pollution industrial wastewater and domestic sewage carried by rivers considering nlz as an example domestic sewage is discharged into the fu river in baoding city after entering the lake a large number of pollutants were deposited at the entrance and in the lake resulting in the enrichment of nh4 n in the sediments of nlz after the establishment of xiong an new area the water environment management of bl has been highly prioritized the water quality of the rivers entering the lake has continuously improved agricultural non point sources have been controlled and sediment release has become an important source of nh4 n in the lake area 3 2 in situ observation results and the determination of the shear velocity the in situ observation results of the water depth flow velocity and shear velocity are shown in fig 4a the study period of the water level variation can be divided into three stages low water level stage from early june to mid july s1 1 7 0 1 m transition stage from mid july to early august s2 and high water level stage from early august to late november s3 2 3 0 1 m water level variation is affected by many factors such as the lake bottom topography engineering scheduling and basin climate cui et al 2010 combined with the operation of bl the main reason for the s2 stage is water replenishment from the yellow river to hebei and other projects water level fluctuations in stages s1 and s3 were mainly caused by rainfall in the lake area and the inflow of natural rivers into the lake wang et al 2014 the horizontal flow velocity at the bottom was approximately 0 1 cm s in june and began to increase significantly in july the mean increase was nearly 10 fold and the flow velocity reached 5 cm s the shear velocity also exhibited a consistent variation with the horizontal velocity notably the observed values of the flow and shear velocities fig 4a indicate that the two are positively correlated currently the overall shear velocity distribution in the study area cannot be measured directly or obtained using a mathematical model whereas the mean velocity can be obtained relatively easily therefore we established a correlation between the flow velocity and shear velocity in bl and used the established relationship and a hydrodynamic model to derive the shear velocity distribution in the study area the measured flow and shear velocities were fitted according to e1 the results are shown in fig 4b and the fitting relationship e9 can be obtained where b 4 68 and r 2 0 63 previous studies have shown that b ranged from 4 14 to 7 fu et al 2013 considering that most of the previous studies were laboratory scale tests the actual water involved in this study is more complex and may be affected by external factors such as biological disturbance therefore the shear velocity may be biased however in general the results measured in this study are close to those obtained by relevant tests and the fitting relationship shows that the two are positively correlated which can be used to obtain the shear velocity of the swi in the study area 9 u u 1 k ln z k s 4 68 3 3 variation of the permeability reynolds number based on the shear velocity distribution and sediment investigation results e3 was used to calculate re k fig 5 shows the variations in re k in the nlz qt and mp regions the molecular and dispersive regime intersect at re k 0 2 the red dotted line above this line the interfacial transport process is dominated by the dispersive regime otherwise it is dominated by the molecular regime the mean values of re k in the nlz qt and mp regions were 3 66 10 3 7 06 10 6 and 3 73 10 3 respectively the maximum re k values at mp and nlz were 0 048 and 0 042 respectively which exceeded the molecular regime threshold the maximum re k value at qt is less than 10 5 namely this region is always dominated by the molecular regime in general the interfacial transport process in the above three regions was dominated by the molecular regime however the nlz and mp regions were dominated by the dispersive regime from march to august and the turbulent regime did not occur evidently the same region exhibits different regimes at different times considering mp as an example the maximum re k value in the same year is tens of thousands of times the minimum value simultaneously we observed that the variation in re k values in different regions is not the same for example re k at mp was at a relatively high level from march to june and was close to 0 however the re k at nlz was high from march to august the maximum re k value at mp was 2 70 fold that at nlz and the re k value at qt was close to 0 at all times in summary the re k of bl showed clear temporal and spatial differences considering that the re k value has an important influence on the transport process we cannot simply assume that the interfacial transport process is dominated by the molecular regime and the re k and the interfacial mass flux need be estimated more accurately 3 4 distribution of the nh4 n release flux in july fig 6a the nh4 n release flux of bl varied from 6 12 to 62 30 mg m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 27 44 mg m 2 d 1 without considering the hydrodynamic and bed elements the nh4 n release flux estimated by fl varied from 6 12 to 54 65 mg m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 26 57 mg m 2 d 1 overall the spatial distribution of the nh4 n release flux obtained by the two models was similar showing low values in the middle and high values in the north and south the nh4 n release flux was highest at nlz and was also relatively high at mp xbyd and qt however the estimation result of feimf edc is higher than that of fl comparing previous studies on nh4 n release flux in bl the results estimated using fl were consistent with those reported by zhu et al 2019 5 35 48 76 mg m 2 d 1 and du et al 2018 1 61 33 30 mg m 2 d 1 wen et al 2022 4 01 18 75 mg m 2 d 1 and zhang et al 2021a 1 71 7 43 mg m 2 d 1 analyzed the nh4 n release flux in summer li et al 2021a analyzed the dredged and non dredged nh4 n release flux which ranged from 0 16 to 7 72 mg m 2 d 1 without dredging and decreased after dredging due to the differences in sampling site distribution sampling time and flux estimation methods nh4 n release flux in bl varied in different studies but in general they all varied within a certain range the difference between the two models appears at nlz region i and the junction of mp and xbyd region ii fig 6a fig 6 b1 b4 shows the comparison of the estimation results of the two methods in regions i and ii notably the estimation results of feimf edc are greater than those of fl in these regions in particular re k exceeded the molecular regime threshold and the interfacial transport process was dominated by the dispersive regime fig 6 b5 b6 shows the distribution of the difference between d eff and d if d eff d 0 the interfacial transport process in this region is considered to be dominated by the molecular regime and when d eff d 0 the interfacial transport process is dominated by dispersive regime considering region ii as an example the estimation results of the two models were the same and the release flux estimated by the feimf edc was significantly larger than that estimated by fl with a large difference the flow velocity distribution fig 6c shows that the flow velocity in some areas of region i exceeds 0 02 m s and that in region ii varied from 0 to 0 002 m s and that in some areas exceeds 0 01 m s combined with the release flux estimation results and fig 6 b5 b6 we observed that d eff at a region with a large flow velocity is significantly larger than d and the release flux is also significantly greater considering the middle position of region i as an example the release flux increased by 14 compared with the estimation result of fl therefore we considered that a high flow velocity was the reason for the increase in the release flux fl assumes that advection bioturbation is not significant this assumes that the interfacial mass transport is dominated by molecular diffusion and estimates the interfacial mass flux by the concentration gradient lavery et al 2001 however factors affecting this process include the overlying water environmental factors and physical properties of the sediment therefore feimf edc can better reflect the influence of the aforementioned factors on the interfacial mass flux 3 5 distribution of nh4 n release flux in extreme weather the hydrodynamic processes in shallow lakes are significantly affected by wind fields this section describes the simulation of the nh4 n release flux at the swi under extreme weather conditions the wind field was set based on observations of strong typhoons by cao et al 2009 based on the conditions in the study area the maximum wind speed was set to 15 m s moderate gale after the wind speed was gradually increased from 2 to 15 m s the high wind speed was maintained for 12 h and then decreased to the normal value the simulation results are shown in fig 7 under such extreme weather conditions the flow velocities in nlz and mp were consistent with the change in wind speed and the flow velocity at mp was larger than that at nlz overall with the sudden increase in flow velocity caused by strong typhoons the nlz and mp regions have different degrees of dispersive regimes but the turbulent regime was not observed the re k at mp quickly exceeded the molecular diffusion threshold and lasted for approximately 40 h which was 1 6 fold that of nlz the histogram in fig 7c shows the release flux at nlz and mp at different times we found that the release flux at nlz and mp increase first and then decrease with an increase in the wind speed the growth rate at mp was greater than that at nlz initially both regions experienced molecular diffusion and the release flux at nlz was larger than that at mp the dominant factor influencing this difference was the vertical concentration gradient of the pore water with the continuous increase in wind speed the release flux at mp gradually exceeded that at nlz when the wind speed reaches the maximum value the release flux at mp reached 180 28 mg m 2 d 1 which is 1 66 fold that at nlz and 5 48 fold that under no wind condition notably strong wind events can increase the flow velocity and re k in some areas leading to the change in release flux that shows a similar trend to the change in wind field this also indicates that the feimf edc can better reflect the sudden increase in the interfacial mass flux caused by short term hydrodynamic disturbances induced by extreme weather such as strong typhoons 3 6 comparison of feimf edc with other models research on the interfacial transport process can be divided into in situ and laboratory scale tests according to the test conditions the in situ test calculates the mass flux at the swi by measuring the rate of change in the concentration of the overlying water column on site this method truly reflects the transport process however the test is difficult costly and has a long cycle and has therefore not been widely used homoky et al 2016 laboratory scale tests generally send sediment samples collected in the field to a laboratory for measurement and analysis according to the difference between the measured indicators and the calculation principle these tests can be divided into two types the first type is the ndm which requires regular measurements of the concentration of the overlying water column to obtain the mass flux although this model can depict the actual situation as much as possible it is limited by the inevitable external disturbance caused by sampling and other processes therefore the obtained mass flux still has a large error the second type is the dm which is based on the fl this model is widely used to estimate the flux of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus at the swi the molecular diffusion coefficient is determined based on the interfacial temperature the main indicators measured were porosity overlying water and pore water concentration however because fl only considers the influence of molecular diffusion on the mass transport process the calculation accuracy of this model is limited when the disturbance at the swi caused by external factors such as wind driven flow is large lei et al 2018 additionally this model has insufficient response sensitivity when the dominant factor in the transport process contains time varying attributes wind driven currents are the main form of lake flow in shallow lakes such as bl the wind field induces the water column to flow through drag which has a significant impact on the interfacial mass transport hu 2016 li et al 2017 however in general the flow velocity at the interface is slow and the transport process is dominated by molecular diffusion liu et al 2021 this is also the reason why studies often assume that the transport process at the swi depends on molecular diffusion however our study found that the interfacial transport process of bl was sometimes dominated by the dispersive regime under the combined action of permeability difference and hydrodynamic conditions in particular the flux estimated by fl is underestimated in areas with a large shear velocity or permeability for example in the eastern part of the mp with low nh4 n content in the sediment fig 3c owing to the large rainfall runoff in the flood season the hydrodynamic conditions in this area were strong in july and the maximum flow velocity was 0 14 m s fig 6b this resulted in a high level of shear velocity at the bed surface and the nh4 n release flux was 23 4 higher than that obtained by fl the hydrodynamic conditions significantly influence the interfacial transport process chen et al 2021 huang et al 2022 therefore when formulating a refined water quality management strategy it is necessary to consider the increase in mass flux caused by the spatial and temporal differences in hydrodynamics the feimf edc can also overcome the problem of underestimation caused by traditional methods when hydrodynamic conditions rapidly change under the influence of extreme weather fig 7 in section 3 5 we assumed that the wind scale had a moderate value notably the short term winds in typhoon affected areas are much larger than this scale therefore those in lakes in the low latitude coastal areas of china may be more apparent the mean sediment diameter in taihu lake was approximately 0 032 mm and the size distribution range was considerably larger than that of bl 0 001 0 011 mm at the same flow velocity the re k of taihu lake may be more than five fold that of bl namely the transport process is more likely to be dominated by the dispersive regime and may even be dominated by the turbulent regime liu et al 2017 studies have shown that after typhoon morakot the concentrations of total phosphorus tp and other nutrients in taihu lake significantly increased ding et al 2012 in lake okeechobee which is also a large shallow lake the release flux of phosphorus across the swi is 6 18 times the molecular diffusion flux under the action of wind havens et al 2007 therefore using the feimf edc to estimate the interfacial mass flux of lakes susceptible to typhoons or monsoons is more significant and meaningful than that of bl 3 7 merits and opportunities for improvement of feimf edc the feimf edc proposed in this study can reflect the combined effects of various factors on the interfacial mass flux in particular it can better characterize the temporal and spatial changes in the mass flux at the swi when the permeability and shear velocity have a significant influence the merits of the feimf edc are as follows 1 the feimf edc describes the material transport flux at the swi in three regimes molecular dispersive and turbulent the molecular regime process is influenced by the interface temperature and the dispersive and turbulent regimes are influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions at the interface and the physical properties of the sediments this framework uses two dimensionless numbers rek and sc to simplify and unify several key influencing factors the temporal and spatial differences in the effective diffusion coefficients were used to characterize the changes in key factors affecting material transport such as hydrodynamics and permeability which can be used to analyze the mass flux across the swi with higher accuracy 2 this study estimated the nh4 n release flux at the swi however this model can also be used to estimate the release flux of tp total nitrogen tn and other related indicators as required the feimf edc is an interfacial mass flux estimation framework that can be applied to a variety of dissolved substances 3 the target of this study was located inland in northern china but this model can also be applied to shallow lakes with obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity of sediment and hydrodynamics additionally heavy rainfall caused by extreme weather water diversion projects and upstream flood discharges may cause sudden short term changes in the hydrodynamic conditions schernewski 2003 tang et al 2020 the feimf edc can also respond to changes in the interfacial mass flux caused by similar factors thus providing a basis for predicting the water quality risk and ensuring its control the deficiencies and improvements of feimf edc 1 in this study we try to use the flow velocity to calculate the shear velocity near the bed surface however owing to the influence of model accuracy the model cannot fully reflect the instantaneous change of hydrodynamic factors and the underestimation of velocity is a common limitation this phenomenon is attributed to the model itself chen et al 2020 used the efdc to calculate the hydrodynamics of a large shallow lake affected by the wind field and found that the simulated flow velocity was lower than the measured flow velocity they attempted to correct the wind resistance coefficient to rectify the simulated flow velocity 2 this study attempts to obtain the shear velocity by fitting the log profile method additionally it can be combined with machine learning deep learning and other methods ahmed et al 2019 liu et al 2021 to improve the fitting accuracy of the shear velocity relationship 4 conclusions in this study the effective diffusion coefficient theory was combined with in situ observations for the first time and an estimation framework namely feimf edc was built to estimate the interfacial mass flux this framework was used to analyze the temporal and spatial variations of the nh4 n release flux across the swi of bl our results show that 1 the interfacial transport process in bl may be dominated by a dispersive regime the nh4 n release flux varies within 6 12 62 30 mg m 2 d 1 which is greater than that estimated by fick s first law the transport process is dominated by a molecular regime under extreme weather conditions the nh4 n release flux is more than five fold that under windless conditions 2 the feimf edc includes many techniques such as the investigation of sediment in situ observations and hydrodynamic modeling it has good applicability in shallow lakes showing obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity of sediment and hydrodynamics and can provide a basis for the accurate formulation of water environment monitoring and

the accumulation of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in sediments michalak et al 2013 external forcing processes such as wind wave disturbances can promote the release of nutrients enriched

concentration in the overlying water column based on the law of mass conservation koomklang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 notably many factors affect the mass flux across the swi for example the difference in the physical and chemical properties of the overlying water column and sediments causes seasonal variations in the interfacial mass flux seiki et al 1989 wen et al 2022 turbulent diffusion caused by wind wave disturbances can increase the interfacial mass flux by 8 to 10 fold tang et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 therefore the theoretical value of dm is often lower than the actual value the ndm cannot truly reflect the influence of natural flow turbulence and porosity on the diffusion of water soluble organic substances therefore it is insufficient to characterize the temporal and spatial changes in the interfacial mass flux affected by sediment differences and seasonal succession the mass flux across the swi may vary by several orders of magnitude in different regions and seasons in the lake li et al 2021b in particular short term disturbances will also cause a sudden increase in the interfacial mass flux yuan et al 2021 and increase the risk of eutrophication in local areas huang et al 2016 qin et al 2019 notably the estimation model of interfacial mass flux can describe the temporal and spatial changes of hydrodynamics and sediment and can more accurately monitor and manage the water environment the swi can be described as a three dimensional mixed layer that encompasses both water and sediment facies voermans et al 2018 proposed a mechanistic model to describe interfacial mass transport there are three transport regimes in this model wherein the molecular dispersive or turbulent transport regime dominates the mass flux of a passive tracer across the swi since the model was proposed many scholars have conducted relevant studies grant et al 2020 2012 for instance fan et al 2020 conducted annular flume tests and used parametric analysis methods to explore the relationship between the effective diffusivity coefficient hydrodynamics and bed elements liu et al 2021 used machine learning techniques to explore the relationship between the effective diffusivity coefficient and surface flow conditions bedforms and sediment characteristics these studies show that the model can be used to characterize the transport processes across the swi under different conditions such as bed roughness and hydrodynamics to quantify the interfacial mass flux however owing to the difficulty in obtaining hydrodynamic conditions at the swi there is a consensus in the literature regarding the applicability of this model in an actual water environment baiyangdian lake bl is the largest shallow lake in north china however owing to human activities bl has suffered from water pollution and ecological degradation therefore many scholars have studied sediment pollution plankton and water quality changes in the bl han et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wen et al 2022 found that the sediments of the bl were seriously affected by nitrogen pollution necessitating the need for ecological environment management li et al 2022 found that endogenous release is an important cause of water pollution thus an accurate description of the interfacial mass flux is essential for ecological restoration and management of the bl in this study based on the effective diffusion coefficient theory we constructed an interfacial mass flux estimation framework including sediment analysis in situ observations and a hydrodynamic model and applied it to estimate the nh4 n release flux across the swi of bl the results can provide guidance for the ecological environment management and dredging activities in bl as well as provide new insights for studying the interfacial transport processes 2 methods 2 1 study area bl 38 44 38 59 n 115 45 116 26 e is located in xiong an new area of hebei province it is the largest freshwater lake on the north china plain there are approximately 143 small lakes and more than 3700 ditches eight main streams including the baigou ping bao cao fu tang xiaoyi and zhulong rivers converge from the north west and south in this study bl was divided into seven areas shaochedian scd nanliuzhuang nlz zaolinzhuang zlz quantou qt caiputai cpt xiaobaiyangdian xbyd and mapeng mp fig 1a this region is characterized by a temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature between 6 8 and 12 7 c and the precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer long et al 2010 bl is known as the kidney of north china however owing to the lack of upstream and downstream collaborative protection during early economic and social development processes the water environment in bl is polluted 2 2 methods of sediment analysis grain size analysis of sediments using gravity sedimentation technique lavery et al 2001 determination of grain size distribution by observing the settling velocity of grains in the medium porosity θ was calculated by measuring sediment wet weight w w sediment dry weight w d and the ratio of average surface sediment density to water density ρ e1 urban et al 1997 1 θ w w w d 100 w w w d

organic matter in the sediment to carbon dioxide calculation of organic matter content in the sample by k2cr2o7 consumption measurement of ph in sediments using potentiometric methods the air dried sediment was vigorously stirred to form a suspension and the ph was measured using a ph meter the concentration of nh4 n in sediment was measured using nessler s reagent spectrophotometry a mixture consisting of sediment sample and 2 mol l kcl was shaken using an oscillator the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the supernatant was measured using a spectrophotometer 2 3 framework to estimate the interfacial mass flux based on the effective diffusivity coefficient feimf edc the framework to estimate the interfacial mass flux based on effective diffusivity coefficient feimf edc includes five steps fig 1b 1 analysis of sediments 2 in situ observations and the determination of shear velocity 3 construction of a hydrodynamic model for the study area 4 calculation of the shear velocity and 5 estimation of the interfacial mass flux 2 3 1 analysis of sediments the analysis of sediments mainly included the measurement of porosity effective grain and organic matter content of sediments combined with the actual situation of the bl exploration and sampling sites were established fig 1b blue point the exploration sites were used to investigate the physical and chemical indexes of the sediments and the sampling sites were used to obtain the distribution of the nh4 n content in the sediments and overlying water column the exploration sites were evenly arranged at a spacing of 1000 m and the sites were then added to the central area of the lake the sampling sites were based on exploration sites to select key areas such as the lake center and coast we selected a total of 237 exploration sites and 41 sampling sites fig 1 2 3 2 in situ observations and shear velocity we conducted long term in situ measurements from june to december 2021 in this study an acoustic doppler velometer velometer vector 6 mhz adv was used to obtain high frequency and high precision continuous observations of the water temperature water depth and three dimensional velocity of bl the locations of these devices are shown in fig 1 the relationship between the flow velocity u and shear velocity u at the swi e2 e3 was established by fitting the observed u and u values at the swi using the log profile method colesd 1956 2 u u 1 k ln z k s b 3 k s 3 d 90 1 1 1 e 25 λ where u is the flow velocity at a height z above the sediment bed u is the shear velocity and k is the von karman constant k 0 4 the roughness height k s depends on the characteristic grain diameter d 90 and the wavelength δ and amplitude λ of bedforms we assumed that the study region is a flat bed namely δ tends to 0 and λ tends to 2 3 3 construction of the hydrodynamic model for the study area the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model is used to simulate the hydrodynamics of bl the model uses stretched or sigma vertical coordinates and cartesian or curvilinear orthogonal horizontal coordinates gao et al 2018 the hydrodynamic process of the model satisfied the basic laws of mass momentum and energy conservation to improve the computational efficiency vertical hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations were assumed the model used the internal external mode separation method to solve the continuity and momentum equations considering the simulation accuracy computational efficiency and computational stability bl was discretized into 29 288 orthogonal horizontal grids with 79 293 nodes 100 100 m the grid elevation is obtained by interpolating the measured data the details of the model construction and parameter calibration are presented in sun et al 2022 2 3 4 calculation of the shear velocity the simulation results of the hydrodynamic model were substituted into e2 to determine the shear velocity distribution in the study area 2 3 5 estimation of the mass flux of swi the

size 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of sediments 3 1 1 porosity and effective grain size the sediment porosity in the study area varied within 0 47 0 92 and the effective grain size varied from 0 001 to 0 011 mm the distributions of sediment porosity and effective grain sizes in the different regions are shown in fig 2 the results indicated differences in the porosities of each area the porosity distributions of nlz and mp were relatively uniform the range of qt variation was the largest and the minimum porosity was also observed in this area the effective grain sizes in different regions were considerably different the maximum and minimum effective grain sizes were observed in qt and zlz respectively simultaneously we observed that the effective grain of the zlz is low compared with those of other areas which may result in the relatively low permeability coefficient of the area the distribution of sediment grain size depends on the depositional environment shi et al 2002 hydrodynamics is an important factor affecting the distribution of grain size chen et al 2022 the smaller flow velocity in the zlz may be the main reason for the significantly lower particle size than in other areas sun et al 2022 3 1 2 organic matter content ph value and nh4 n content the organic matter content of sediments varied within 0 3 5 86 with a mean of 2 7 the areas with organic matter content greater than 5 0 included scd xbyd mp and qt and the organic matter content in other areas was less than 5 0 the ph value of the sediments varied between 7 79 and 9 53 with a mean of 8 6 indicating a weakly alkaline environment the maximum and minimum ph values were observed in mp and scd respectively the background value of the local soil environment is slightly alkaline the ph of the soil in the study area is approximately 8 5 varying within 8 0 8 6 and rarely below 8 0 or above 9 0 therefore we considered that the alkaline hazard of sediments can be ignored the spatial distributions of the organic matter content ph value and nh4 n content in the sediments are shown in fig 3 notably the nh4 n content varied between 1 8 and 106 57 mg kg and the maximum value was observed in nlz the nh4 n content is enriched in nlz and xbyd and that in zlz and scd is low nh4 n pollution in bl mainly originates from agricultural non point source pollution industrial wastewater and domestic sewage carried by rivers considering nlz as an example domestic sewage is discharged into the fu river in baoding city after entering the lake a large number of pollutants were deposited at the entrance and in the lake resulting in the enrichment of nh4 n in the sediments of nlz after the establishment of xiong an new area the water environment management of bl has been highly prioritized the water quality of the rivers entering the lake has continuously improved agricultural non point sources have been controlled and sediment release has become an important source of nh4 n in the lake area 3 2 in situ observation results and the determination of the shear velocity the in situ observation results of the water depth flow velocity and shear velocity are shown in fig 4a the study period of the water level variation can be divided into three stages low water level stage from early june to mid july s1 1 7 0 1 m transition stage from mid july to early august s2 and high water level stage from early august to late november s3 2 3 0 1 m water level variation is affected by many factors such as the lake bottom topography engineering scheduling and basin climate cui et al 2010 combined with the operation of bl the main reason for the s2 stage is water replenishment from the yellow river to hebei and other projects water level fluctuations in stages s1 and s3 were mainly caused by rainfall in the lake area and the inflow of natural rivers into the lake wang et al 2014 the horizontal flow velocity at the bottom was approximately 0 1 cm s in june and began to increase significantly in july the mean increase was nearly 10 fold and the flow velocity reached 5 cm s the shear velocity also exhibited a consistent variation with the horizontal velocity notably the observed values of the flow and shear velocities fig 4a indicate that the two are positively correlated currently the overall shear velocity distribution in the study area cannot be measured directly or obtained using a mathematical model whereas the mean velocity can be obtained relatively easily therefore we established a correlation between the flow velocity and shear velocity in bl and used the established relationship and a hydrodynamic model to derive the shear velocity distribution in the study area the measured flow and shear velocities were fitted according to e1 the results are shown in fig 4b and the fitting relationship e9 can be obtained where b 4 68 and r 2 0 63 previous studies have shown that b ranged from 4 14 to 7 fu et al 2013 considering that most of the previous studies were laboratory scale tests the actual water involved in this study is more complex and may be affected by external factors such as biological disturbance therefore the shear velocity may be biased however in general the results measured in this study are close to those obtained by relevant tests and the fitting relationship shows that the two are positively correlated which can be used to obtain the shear velocity of the swi in the study area 9 u u 1 k ln z k s 4 68 3 3 variation of the permeability reynolds number based on the shear velocity distribution and sediment investigation results e3 was used to calculate re k fig 5 shows the variations in re k in the nlz qt and mp regions the molecular and dispersive regime intersect at re k 0 2 the red dotted line above this line the interfacial transport process is dominated by the dispersive regime otherwise it is dominated by the molecular regime the mean values of re k in the nlz qt and mp regions were 3 66 10 3 7 06 10 6 and 3 73 10 3 respectively the maximum re k values at mp and nlz were 0 048 and 0 042 respectively which exceeded the molecular regime threshold the maximum re k value at qt is less than 10 5 namely this region is always dominated by the molecular regime in general the interfacial transport process in the above three regions was dominated by the molecular regime however the nlz and mp regions were dominated by the dispersive regime from march to august and the turbulent regime did not occur evidently the same region exhibits different regimes at different times considering mp as an example the maximum re k value in the same year is tens of thousands of times the minimum value simultaneously we observed that the variation in re k values in different regions is not the same for example re k at mp was at a relatively high level from march to june and was close to 0 however the re k at nlz was high from march to august the maximum re k value at mp was 2 70 fold that at nlz and the re k value at qt was close to 0 at all times in summary the re k of bl showed clear temporal and spatial differences considering that the re k value has an important influence on the transport process we cannot simply assume that the interfacial transport process is dominated by the molecular regime and the re k and the interfacial mass flux need be estimated more accurately 3 4 distribution of the nh4 n release flux in july fig 6a the nh4 n release flux of bl varied from 6 12 to 62 30 mg m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 27 44 mg m 2 d 1 without considering the hydrodynamic and bed elements the nh4 n release flux estimated by fl varied from 6 12 to 54 65 mg m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 26 57 mg m 2 d 1 overall the spatial distribution of the nh4 n release flux obtained by the two models was similar showing low values in the middle and high values in the north and south the nh4 n release flux was highest at nlz and was also relatively high at mp xbyd and qt however the estimation result of feimf edc is higher than that of fl comparing previous studies on nh4 n release flux in bl the results estimated using fl were consistent with those reported by zhu et al 2019 5 35 48 76 mg m 2 d 1 and du et al 2018 1 61 33 30 mg m 2 d 1 wen et al 2022 4 01 18 75 mg m 2 d 1 and zhang et al 2021a 1 71 7 43 mg m 2 d 1 analyzed the nh4 n release flux in summer li et al 2021a analyzed the dredged and non dredged nh4 n release flux which ranged from 0 16 to 7 72 mg m 2 d 1 without dredging and decreased after dredging due to the differences in sampling site distribution sampling time and flux estimation methods nh4 n release flux in bl varied in different studies but in general they all varied within a certain range the difference between the two models appears at nlz region i and the junction of mp and xbyd region ii fig 6a fig 6 b1 b4 shows the comparison of the estimation results of the two methods in regions i and ii notably the estimation results of feimf edc are greater than those of fl in these regions in particular re k exceeded the molecular regime threshold and the interfacial transport process was dominated by the dispersive regime fig 6 b5 b6 shows the distribution of the difference between d eff and d if d eff d 0 the interfacial transport process in this region is considered to be dominated by the molecular regime and when d eff d 0 the interfacial transport process is dominated by dispersive regime considering region ii as an example the estimation results of the two models were the same and the release flux estimated by the feimf edc was significantly larger than that estimated by fl with a large difference the flow velocity distribution fig 6c shows that the flow velocity in some areas of region i exceeds 0 02 m s and that in region ii varied from 0 to 0 002 m s and that in some areas exceeds 0 01 m s combined with the release flux estimation results and fig 6 b5 b6 we observed that d eff at a region with a large flow velocity is significantly larger than d and the release flux is also significantly greater considering the middle position of region i as an example the release flux increased by 14 compared with the estimation result of fl therefore we considered that a high flow velocity was the reason for the increase in the release flux fl assumes that advection bioturbation is not significant this assumes that the interfacial mass transport is dominated by molecular diffusion and estimates the interfacial mass flux by the concentration gradient lavery et al 2001 however factors affecting this process include the overlying water environmental factors and physical properties of the sediment therefore feimf edc can better reflect the influence of the aforementioned factors on the interfacial mass flux 3 5 distribution of nh4 n release flux in extreme weather the hydrodynamic processes in shallow lakes are significantly affected by wind fields this section describes the simulation of the nh4 n release flux at the swi under extreme weather conditions the wind field was set based on observations of strong typhoons by cao et al 2009 based on the conditions in the study area the maximum wind speed was set to 15 m s moderate gale after the wind speed was gradually increased from 2 to 15 m s the high wind speed was maintained for 12 h and then decreased to the normal value the simulation results are shown in fig 7 under such extreme weather conditions the flow velocities in nlz and mp were consistent with the change in wind speed and the flow velocity at mp was larger than that at nlz overall with the sudden increase in flow velocity caused by strong typhoons the nlz and mp regions have different degrees of dispersive regimes but the turbulent regime was not observed the re k at mp quickly exceeded the molecular diffusion threshold and lasted for approximately 40 h which was 1 6 fold that of nlz the histogram in fig 7c shows the release flux at nlz and mp at different times we found that the release flux at nlz and mp increase first and then decrease with an increase in the wind speed the growth rate at mp was greater than that at nlz initially both regions experienced molecular diffusion and the release flux at nlz was larger than that at mp the dominant factor influencing this difference was the vertical concentration gradient of the pore water with the continuous increase in wind speed the release flux at mp gradually exceeded that at nlz when the wind speed reaches the maximum value the release flux at mp reached 180 28 mg m 2 d 1 which is 1 66 fold that at nlz and 5 48 fold that under no wind condition notably strong wind events can increase the flow velocity and re k in some areas leading to the change in release flux that shows a similar trend to the change in wind field this also indicates that the feimf edc can better reflect the sudden increase in the interfacial mass flux caused by short term hydrodynamic disturbances induced by extreme weather such as strong typhoons 3 6 comparison of feimf edc with other models research on the interfacial transport process can be divided into in situ and laboratory scale tests according to the test conditions the in situ test calculates the mass flux at the swi by measuring the rate of change in the concentration of the overlying water column on site this method truly reflects the transport process however the test is difficult costly and has a long cycle and has therefore not been widely used homoky et al 2016 laboratory scale tests generally send sediment samples collected in the field to a laboratory for measurement and analysis according to the difference between the measured indicators and the calculation principle these tests can be divided into two types the first type is the ndm which requires regular measurements of the concentration of the overlying water column to obtain the mass flux although this model can depict the actual situation as much as possible it is limited by the inevitable external disturbance caused by sampling and other processes therefore the obtained mass flux still has a large error the second type is the dm which is based on the fl this model is widely used to estimate the flux of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus at the swi the molecular diffusion coefficient is determined based on the interfacial temperature the main indicators measured were porosity overlying water and pore water concentration however because fl only considers the influence of molecular diffusion on the mass transport process the calculation accuracy of this model is limited when the disturbance at the swi caused by external factors such as wind driven flow is large lei et al 2018 additionally this model has insufficient response sensitivity when the dominant factor in the transport process contains time varying attributes wind driven currents are the main form of lake flow in shallow lakes such as bl the wind field induces the water column to flow through drag which has a significant impact on the interfacial mass transport hu 2016 li et al 2017 however in general the flow velocity at the interface is slow and the transport process is dominated by molecular diffusion liu et al 2021 this is also the reason why studies often assume that the transport process at the swi depends on molecular diffusion however our study found that the interfacial transport process of bl was sometimes dominated by the dispersive regime under the combined action of permeability difference and hydrodynamic conditions in particular the flux estimated by fl is underestimated in areas with a large shear velocity or permeability for example in the eastern part of the mp with low nh4 n content in the sediment fig 3c owing to the large rainfall runoff in the flood season the hydrodynamic conditions in this area were strong in july and the maximum flow velocity was 0 14 m s fig 6b this resulted in a high level of shear velocity at the bed surface and the nh4 n release flux was 23 4 higher than that obtained by fl the hydrodynamic conditions significantly influence the interfacial transport process chen et al 2021 huang et al 2022 therefore when formulating a refined water quality management strategy it is necessary to consider the increase in mass flux caused by the spatial and temporal differences in hydrodynamics the feimf edc can also overcome the problem of underestimation caused by traditional methods when hydrodynamic conditions rapidly change under the influence of extreme weather fig 7 in section 3 5 we assumed that the wind scale had a moderate value notably the short term winds in typhoon affected areas are much larger than this scale therefore those in lakes in the low latitude coastal areas of china may be more apparent the mean sediment diameter in taihu lake was approximately 0 032 mm and the size distribution range was considerably larger than that of bl 0 001 0 011 mm at the same flow velocity the re k of taihu lake may be more than five fold that of bl namely the transport process is more likely to be dominated by the dispersive regime and may even be dominated by the turbulent regime liu et al 2017 studies have shown that after typhoon morakot the concentrations of total phosphorus tp and other nutrients in taihu lake significantly increased ding et al 2012 in lake okeechobee which is also a large shallow lake the release flux of phosphorus across the swi is 6 18 times the molecular diffusion flux under the action of wind havens et al 2007 therefore using the feimf edc to estimate the interfacial mass flux of lakes susceptible to typhoons or monsoons is more significant and meaningful than that of bl 3 7 merits and opportunities for improvement of feimf edc the feimf edc proposed in this study can reflect the combined effects of various factors on the interfacial mass flux in particular it can better characterize the temporal and spatial changes in the mass flux at the swi when the permeability and shear velocity have a significant influence the merits of the feimf edc are as follows 1 the feimf edc describes the material transport flux at the swi in three regimes molecular dispersive and turbulent the molecular regime process is influenced by the interface temperature and the dispersive and turbulent regimes are influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions at the interface and the physical properties of the sediments this framework uses two dimensionless numbers rek and sc to simplify and unify several key influencing factors the temporal and spatial differences in the effective diffusion coefficients were used to characterize the changes in key factors affecting material transport such as hydrodynamics and permeability which can be used to analyze the mass flux across the swi with higher accuracy 2 this study estimated the nh4 n release flux at the swi however this model can also be used to estimate the release flux of tp total nitrogen tn and other related indicators as required the feimf edc is an interfacial mass flux estimation framework that can be applied to a variety of dissolved substances 3 the target of this study was located inland in northern china but this model can also be applied to shallow lakes with obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity of sediment and hydrodynamics additionally heavy rainfall caused by extreme weather water diversion projects and upstream flood discharges may cause sudden short term changes in the hydrodynamic conditions schernewski 2003 tang et al 2020 the feimf edc can also respond to changes in the interfacial mass flux caused by similar factors thus providing a basis for predicting the water quality risk and ensuring its control the deficiencies and improvements of feimf edc 1 in this study we try to use the flow velocity to calculate the shear velocity near the bed surface however owing to the influence of model accuracy the model cannot fully reflect the instantaneous change of hydrodynamic factors and the underestimation of velocity is a common limitation this phenomenon is attributed to the model itself chen et al 2020 used the efdc to calculate the hydrodynamics of a large shallow lake affected by the wind field and found that the simulated flow velocity was lower than the measured flow velocity they attempted to correct the wind resistance coefficient to rectify the simulated flow velocity 2 this study attempts to obtain the shear velocity by fitting the log profile method additionally it can be combined with machine learning deep learning and other methods ahmed et al 2019 liu et al 2021 to improve the fitting accuracy of the shear velocity relationship 4 conclusions in this study the effective diffusion coefficient theory was combined with in situ observations for the first time and an estimation framework namely feimf edc was built to estimate the interfacial mass flux this framework was used to analyze the temporal and spatial variations of the nh4 n release flux across the swi of bl our results show that 1 the interfacial transport process in bl may be dominated by a dispersive regime the nh4 n release flux varies within 6 12 62 30 mg m 2 d 1 which is greater than that estimated by fick s first law the transport process is dominated by a molecular regime under extreme weather conditions the nh4 n release flux is more than five fold that under windless conditions 2 the feimf edc includes many techniques such as the investigation of sediment in situ observations and hydrodynamic modeling it has good applicability in shallow lakes showing obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity of sediment and hydrodynamics and can provide a basis for the accurate formulation of water environment monitoring and
