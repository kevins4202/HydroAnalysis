tracking 1 introduction unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are playing a crucial role in scientific commercial and military applications compared with underwater manned systems uuv can perform dull dirty dangerous 3d missions such as geological sampling inspection of underwater structures intelligence surveillance reconnaissance isr anti submarine warfare asw and so on gafurov and klochkov 2015 yuh 2000 zhu et al 2018 to meet the needs of those different missions the motion of these vehicles must be accurately controlled in the three dimensional space consequently the motion control for under actuated uuvs have gradually become a hot topic in the field of marine engineering as a typical problem the trajectory tracking control is concerned with the design of control laws that force a vehicle to reach and track a predefined desired trajectory i e a geometric path with an associated timing law due to highly nonlinear dynamics and the parameter perturbation of uuvs and the unknown ocean currents it is a great challenge to develop accuracy spatial trajectory tracking controller for uuvs considering the cost total weight and efficiency the motion control actuators for most of uuvs are usually configured as underactuated mode in practical engineering aguiar and hespanha 2007 the type of underactuated uuvs have fewer independent motion control actuators than degrees of freedom dof the type of uuvs in this work are equipped with only three independent actuators it is easy to prove that the underactuated uuvs are a class of underactuated mechanical systems with second order nonholonomic constraints and drift items do and pan 2006 wichlund et al 1995 the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated uuvs is extremely challenging and great meaningful because the famous brockett s necessary condition shows that asymptotic stabilization of these underactuated uuvs cannot be achieved with any smooth or continuous time invariant feedback controllers brockett 1983 pomet 1992 and the underactuated control laws can be used to handle actuator failure for fully actuated uuvs or over actuated uuvs for marine vehicles the existing tracking control strategies are mostly handled the planar trajectory tracking problem behal et al 2002 chen et al 2016 do et al 2002 2005 elmokadem et al 2016 2017 harmouche et al 2014 jiang 2002 lefeber et al 2003 ramezani al and tavanaei sereshki 2019a b repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 wang and li 2012 yan et al 2015 yu et al 2012 although these works have successfully solved the planar trajectory tracking problem in theory the spatial trajectory tracking problem of uuvs cannot be solved by simply expanding the above research results some scholars tried to extend these results above to spatial trajectory tracking but these attempts have ended in failure nowadays the spatial trajectory tracking problem of uuvs has made some achievements aguiar and hespanha 2007 bechlioulis et al 2017 do 2013 gan et al 2018 liu et al 2017 qiao et al 2017 rezazadegan et al 2015 however in the above mentioned research results most of works considered the spatial trajectory tracking problem for fully actuated uuvs and only a few of the articles are about the spatial trajectory tracking for underactuated uuvs aguiar and hespanha 2007 rezazadegan et al 2015 throughout the existing research results the design methods of the tracking controllers include backstepping and lyapunov s direct method aguiar and hespanha 2007 behal et al 2002 do 2013 do et al 2002 2005 jiang 2002 liu et al 2017 repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 rezazadegan et al 2015 shen et al 2018 sliding mode control elmokadem et al 2016 2017 gan et al 2018 ramezani al and tavanaei sereshki 2019a b wang and li 2012 yan et al 2015 yu et al 2012 adaptive control aguiar and hespanha 2007 chen et al 2016 ramezani al and tavanaei sereshki 2019a b wang et al 2018 saturated state feedback control harmouche et al 2014 qiao et al 2017 and fuzzy control wang et al 2018 among these methods the sliding mode control smc is one of the most effective means to handle the problem of motion control for underactuated uuvs with external disturbance and model uncertainties because it is natural strong robustness with regard to internal and external disturbance moreover smc has also the advantages of reduced order decoupling fast response good dynamic characteristics and so on edwards and spurgeon 1998 shtessel et al 2014 therefore smc can solve the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated uuvs well the traditional smc originated from the variable structure system vss in the late 1950s and has become the most successful method for dealing with bounded uncertainty disturbances and parasitic dynamics of nonlinear system edwards and spurgeon 1998 shtessel et al 2014 utkin 1993 however the tracking errors can only asymptotically converge into a neighborhood of the origin along the traditional sliding surfaces therefore terminal sliding mode control tsmc is proposed to stabilize the tracking errors in finite time zak 1988 to avoid the singularity of tsmc non singular tsmc is developed in the work of ref feng et al 2002 to further improve the convergence rate and overcome the chattering a nonlinear pid smc is proposed chiu 2012 in the aforementioned works the smc based control algorithms have been employed to handle the planar trajectory tracking for underactuated marine vehicles and the spatial trajectory tracking for fully actuated uuvs in ref yan et al 2015 a globally finite time tracking control strategy was developed based on the pid smc which drives an underactuated uuv to track the planar trajectory this tracking controller was able to stabilize all tracking errors in finite time and was strongly strong robustness against model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents in view of the aforementioned advantages the pid smc should be used to solve the spatial trajectory tracking problem in this paper a globally finite time tracking control scheme is proposed based on the pid smc and the cascaded approach which drives an underactuated uuv with model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents to track the desired spatial trajectory the trajectory tracking guidance is developed by extending the horizontal virtual vehicle method and then the dynamic equations of the position and attitude tracking errors are obtained the kinematic tracking controllers are deduced using the equivalent control of the pid smc which stabilize the position and attitude tracking errors in finite time however the kinematic controllers are not the actual control inputs of underactuated uuvs thus the velocity tracking errors should be introduced to design the actual control inputs the dynamic tracking controllers and their dynamic equations are established and then the dynamic equations of the tracking errors are transformed into the cascaded form after that the trajectory tracking dynamic controllers are designed based on the pid smc which achieve the stabilization of the velocity tracking errors the spatial trajectory tracking problem of underactuated uuvs is solved successfully under model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents using the finite time stability theory the closed loop trajectory tracking system for underactuated uuvs is proved to be globally finite time stable finally simulation results are presented and discussed which demonstrate the performance of the developed trajectory tracking control strategy and its robustness with regard to model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents 2 problem statement it is usually considered that an underactuated uuv sailing in the underwater three dimensional space is modeled as a submerged rigid body subject to external forces and torques therefore several definitions are introduced which are used to describe the spatial motion of underactuated uuvs to analyze the stability of the closed loop trajectory tracking system for underactuated uuvs several useful lemmas regarding the finite time stability are presented then the kinematic and dynamic equations of the motion of an underactuated uuv sailing in the underwater three dimensional space are briefly described finally the trajectory tracking control objectives are given 2 1 several definitions and lemmas the

underactuated uuv in this work the spatial trajectory tracking problem of an underactuated uuv is considered such underactuated uuv is only equipped with three independent actuators located at the aft of uuv namely a pair of the identical stern thrusters sternplanes and rudder to provide the forward force the pitch moment and the yaw moment this type of uuv lacks independent control input in the sway heave and roll to analyze the spatial motion of an uuv it is necessary that two coordinate frames are defined as indicated in fig 1 namely the inertial coordinate frame n and the body fixed coordinate frame b the frame n is familiarly chosen the north east down ned coordinate system and its origin is defined relative to the earth s reference ellipsoid for the ned the x axis points towards due north the y axis points towards positive east while the z axis points downwards normal to the earth s surface the frame b is fixed to the vehicle its origin is usually chosen to coincide with the midpoint of the connection between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy for uuvs the body axes x b y b and z b are chosen to coincide with the principal axis of inertia and they are generally defined as see fig 1 1 x b longitudinal axis directed from aft to fore 2 y b transversal axis directed to starboard 3 z b normal axis directed from top to bottom for the spatial motion of uuvs it is usually necessary that six independent coordinates are defined to determine its position and orientation however the roll motion of uuvs is neglected because it can t be directly controlled by any actuators and is usually self stabilizing that is the spatial motion of uuvs can be described by five independent coordinates the first three coordinates correspond to the position of the vehicle in the frame n denoted as p b n n x y z t and the last two coordinates describe its orientation denoted as θ n b θ ψ t then the position and orientation of an underactuated uuv are summed up η p b n n t θ n b t t ℝ 3 s 2 and the linear and angular velocity of an under actuated uuv are described as ν b n b u v w t and ω b n b q r t and they are summed up ν ν b n b t ω b n b t t ℝ 5 the linear velocity transformation r b n φ θ n b so 3 is used to describe the translational motion of an underactuated uuv which is defined in the terms of euler angles about the z y and x axes zyx convention fossen 2011 and the roll angle φ in r b n φ θ n b is set to zero denoted as r b n θ n b r b n 0 θ n b hence the kinematic equations of the translational motion are represented as 14 p b n n r b n θ n b ν b n b where the rotation matrix r b n θ n b is specifically defined as 15 r b n θ n b cos ψ cos θ sin ψ cos ψ sin θ sin ψ cos θ cos ψ sin ψ sin θ sin θ 0 cos θ in the meantime the kinematic equations of the rotational motion are described as 16 θ n b t θ θ n b ω b n b where the transformation matrix t θ θ n b is specifically defined as 17 t θ θ n b 1 0 0 1 cos θ assumption 1 i this vehicle is a neutrally buoyant rigid body that its mass distribution is homogeneous ii the roll motion of this vehicle is neglected iii the order of the hydrodynamic drag terms is lower than two in the dynamic equations iv the shape structure of this vehicle is symmetrical regarding three principal planes of symmetry v the wind wave and current are neglected according to assumption 1 the dynamic equations of motion for underactuated uuvs are simplified as follows fossen 2011 18 m 11 u m 22 v r m 33 w q x u u x u u u u τ 1 m 22 v m 11 u r y v v y v v v v m 33 w m 11 u q z w w z w w w w

hydrodynamic coefficients of the linear drag terms x u u y v v z w w m q q and n r r indicate hydrodynamic coefficients of the quadratic drag terms z g and z b represent the z b coordinate component of the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy in the body fixed coordinate frame b respectively w and b are gravity and buoyancy of the vehicle respectively τ 1 denotes the forward force τ 5 and τ 6 express the pitch torques and the yaw torques respectively because this underactuated uuv is neutrally buoyant the buoyancy b equals the gravity w i e b w m g in this work the hydrodynamic coefficients of this underactuated uuv are assumed that there are 20 parameter perturbation remark 1 for underactuated uuvs in the practical engineering their control inputs the output of the motion control actuators and velocities are bounded that is there are positive constants τ i max i 1 5 6 and ν i max i 1 2 3 5 6 such as 0 τ 1 τ 1 max τ 5 τ 5 max τ 6 τ 6 max 0 u ν 1 max v ν 2 max w ν 3 max

n r r where ˆ denotes the nominal value of the hydrodynamic coefficients for the underactuated uuv based on the hydrodynamic analysis and engineering practice it is shown that the supremum of the parameter perturbation of the underactuated uuv does not exceed 20 therefore these parameters m i i i 1 2 3 5 6 x u y v z w m q n r x u u y v v z w w m q q and n r r are equal to the 20 nominal value of the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients respectively 2 3 control objectives for the trajectory tracking problem of underactuated uuvs it is necessary to be pre provided with the desired

trajectory tracking guidance the trajectory tracking guidance is the system that continuously computes the desired orientation velocity and acceleration of a uuv to guide the vehicle to track the desired trajectory fossen 2011 in this work the spatial tracking guidance is established based on the virtual vehicle method this tracking guidance utilizes p r n t p r n t p r n t and the sway and heave dynamic equations of the underactuated uuv to calculate the motion states of the virtual vehicle that is the position coordinates the desired reference trajectory p r n t are the inputs of this trajectory tracking guidance and its outputs are the motion states of the virtual vehicle furthermore the trajectory tracking error equations are derived by using the outputs of the spatial tracking guidance and the motion equations of the underactuated uuv 3 1 the kinematics and dynamics of the virtual vehicle in this work the ideal of this spatial trajectory tracking guidance originates from the planar trajectory tracking research work of repoulias repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 and yan yan et al 2015 that is the tracking guidance is developed by extending the horizontal virtual vehicle method to construct the tracking guidance it is natural assumption that the tracking target of an underactuated uuv in the spatial trajectory tracking mission is set to a virtual vehicle sailing along the predefined desired spatial trajectory the virtual vehicle should satisfy the following assumptions assumption 4 the dynamics of the virtual vehicle is exactly the same as the actual uuv and its hydrodynamic coefficients are identical with the nominal value of the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients for the actual uuv assumption 5 i the coordinate origin of the body fixed coordinate frame

or left depending on the curvature of the predefined trajectory the sign of the sway velocity v r is completely determined by the yaw angular velocity r r of the virtual vehicle because the surge

combined with the underactuated dynamics of the virtual vehicle the surge acceleration and jerk are calculated as eqs 29 and 30 similarly the heave acceleration and jerk are obtained as eqs 31 and 32 step 3 from fig 2 by definitions of the float and course angle we can obtain the expressions 33 and 34 of the desired float and course angle of the virtual vehicle according to assumption 5 the

controller design through the foregoing discussion the spatial trajectory tracking control problem is transformed into how to stabilize the trajectory tracking errors in this section the tracking controller based on the pid smc and the cascaded control method is proposed which globally stabilizes the tracking errors 43 and 44 the trajectory tracking problems can usually be divided into two separate control objectives geometric position and attitude tracking task and dynamic linear and angular velocity tracking task the linear velocity tracking errors ν e are selected as the virtual control inputs of the kinematical subsystem 45 and 46 the equivalent control laws of the pid smc are applied to develop these virtual control inputs furthermore the trajectory tracking error dynamic system is transformed into the cascaded form of a kinematical subsystem and a dynamic subsystem the dynamic subsystem 51 and 52 is chosen as the driving subsystem in the cascaded structure and the kinematical subsystem 45 and 46 is the driven subsystem theorem 2 consider the kinematical subsystem 45 and 46 the control inputs of which are the linear velocity tracking errors ν e the desired

y e and z e the first order pi sliding surface vector s 0 t is introduced 55 s 0 t p e n t κ 0 0 t s i g α p e n τ d τ p e n 0 where s 0 t s 01 t s 02 t s 03 t t is three dimensional first order pi sliding surface vector the initial value of the sliding surface vector s 0 t is zero that is the initial states of the system 45 and 46 are located on the designed sliding surface vector s 0 t taking the time derivatives of the sliding surface vector s 0 t the calculation result is obtained 56 s 0 t p e n t κ 0 s i g α p e n t as the initial states of the system 45 and 46 are located on the sliding surface vector s 0 t the reaching segment of smc is eliminated further since the kinematics subsystem of the underactuated uuv is completely accurate it is assumed that the states of the motion of the uuv is completely measurable the equivalent control law can well achieve the stabilization of the position tracking errors x e y e and z e to only consider the equivalent control for the pid smc i e s 0 t 0 and substituting eq 45 into eq 56 the desired control inputs of the kinematical subsystem 45 and 46 can be solved as follows α ν r b n θ n b t κ 0 s i g α p e n t r b n θ n b t r b

tracking task has been achieved in theorem 2 however this control law 53 is not the actual control inputs of the underactuated uuv therefore in order to completely implement the trajectory tracking control objectives the dynamic tracking task needs to be implemented to stabilize the velocity tracking errors 44 and this virtual control law 53 is extended to the actual control inputs in the subsequent section to achieve these two objectives the following error vector e is introduced 59 e ν e α ν where e e u e v e w t then substituting eqs 53 and 59 into eq 45 the dynamic equation 45 of the position tracking errors x e y e and z e become 60 p e n κ 0 s i g α p e n r b n θ n b e f 1 t p e n g t p e n e where f 1 t p e n κ 0 s i g α p e n g t p e n e r b n θ n b e substituting eq 59 into the dynamic equation 51 of the linear velocity tracking errors u e v e and w e the dynamic equations of the tracking errors e u e v and e w are obtained as follows 61 e u m 22 v r m 33 w q x u u

compared to u and u r the relationship between u and u r becomes 23 u 106 u r however both the surge velocity u and the desired surge velocity u r are positive according to assumption 5 and the dynamic characteristics of this uuv consequently the relationship between u and u r is not expressed as 23 u 106 u r then the dynamic tracking controller 65 and 66 do not appear the singular values proof to stabilize the tracking errors e u e v and e w a first order pi sliding surface and two second order pid sliding surfaces are introduced to develop the dynamic tracking controller the

trajectory tracking errors p e n and e to globally converge to the origin in finite time 4 3 boundedness of the pitch and yaw angular velocity in this subsection it is mainly shown that the bounded input bounded output bibo stability of the pitch and yaw angular velocity is discussed in detail firstly the bounded stability of the pitch angular velocity q is investigated the candidate clf is defined as follows 119 v dyn 5 1 2 m 55 q 2 taking the time derivative of the clf 119 and substituting the pitch motion equation in eq 18 the calculation result is 120 v dyn 5 m 55 q q q m 33 m 11 u w m q q m q q q q τ 5 b g z w sin θ if the derivative v dyn 5 of the clf 119 is less than zero it means that 121 m 33 m 11 u w m q q m q q q 2 τ 5 b g z w sin θ 0 q 0 m 33 m 11 u w m q q m q q q 2 τ 5 b g z w sin θ 0 q 0 solving the inequality equation 121 the calculation result is obtained 122 q m q q m q 2 4 m q q m 11 m 33 u w b g z w sin θ τ 5 2 m q q q m q m q 2 4 m q q m 33 m 11 u w τ 5 b g z w sin θ 2 m q q in addition the pitch angular velocity q of the underactuated uuv is bounded by the limitation of its self motion characteristics that is q q max so to ensure that the derivative v dyn 5 of the clf 119 is less than zero the pitch angular velocity q satisfies the following conditions 123 q max q m q m q 2 4 m q q m 11 m 33 u w b g z w sin θ τ 5 2 m q q q max q m q m q 2 4 m q q m 33 m 11 u w τ 5 b g z w sin θ 2 m q q that being said the derivative v dyn 5 of the clf 119 is negative definite when the pitch angular velocity q satisfies the conditions 123 that is the clf v dyn 5 is decreasing about time therefore the absolute value of the pitch angular velocity q is also decreasing about time when the pitch angular velocity q go beyond the scope given by eq 123 the derivative v dyn 5 of the clf 119 becomes positive definite furthermore the clf v dyn 5 will become an increasing function of time thereby the absolute value of the pitch angular velocity q also become increasing about time and it eventually return to the range given by eq 123 in addition since the control input τ 5 the linear velocities u and w and the sine of the pitch angle sin θ all are bounded the pitch angular velocity q is bibo stable next the bounded stability of the yaw angular velocity r is discussed the candidate clf is defined as follows 124 v dyn 6 1 2 m 66 r 2 differentiating the clf 124 and substituting the yaw motion equation in eq 18 the calculation result is 125 v dyn 6 m 66 r r r m 11 m 22 u v n r r n r r r r τ 6 the necessary and sufficient conditions that the derivative of the clf 124 is negative definite are as follows 126 m 11 m 22 u v n r r n r r r r τ 6 0 r 0 m 11 m 22 u v n r r n r r r r τ 6 0 r 0 considering the boundedness of the yaw angular velocity r the solution of the inequality equation 126 can be obtained 127 r max r n r n r 2 4 n r r m 22 m 11 u v τ 6 2 n r r r max r n r n r 2 4 n r r m 33 m 11 u w τ 6 2 n r r analogous to the stability analysis of the pitch angular velocity q the absolute value of the yaw angular velocity r is decreasing about time when it satisfies the conditions 127 once the yaw angular velocity r is out of range given by eq 127 the absolute value of the yaw angular velocity r will become an increasing function of time until it converges to this scope given by eq 127 furthermore because the control input τ 6 and the linear velocities u and v all are bounded the yaw angular velocity r is bibo stable remark 5 according to the aforementioned discussion it is well known that the trajectory tracking control law 53 83 91 and 102 can drive arbitrary tracking errors p e n and e to converge to the origin in the finite times t s 01 t s 11 t s 11 t s 02 t s 12 t s 12 and t s 03 t s 13 t s 13 respectively firstly the arbitrary tracking errors e under the dynamic tracking controllers 83 91 and 102 are stabilized in the finite times t s 11 t s 11 t s 12 t s 12 and t s 13 t s 13 respectively then the tracking errors p e n converge to the origin in the finite times t s 01 t s 02 and t s 03 respectively that being said the spatial trajectory tracking mission can be successfully achieved in the finite time in addition the pitch and yaw angular velocities have been proved to be bibo stable 5 numerical simulation and discussion in this section to support our propositions a number of numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed spatial trajectory tracking control law performs very well in terms of short transient time high tracking accuracy convergence of all arbitrary tracking errors to the origin within the finite time and strong robustness with respect to model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents the simulation platform is based on the motion model of the underactuated

control law is adopted to force the underactuated uuv to track the above desired trajectory that is the same values for the various control gains are filled into the equations of the tracking controller obviously the design of this tracking controller is independent of the desired trajectory to be tracked the controller gains of this tracking controller are chosen as follows κ 01 0 15 κ 02

all hydrodynamic coefficients and the constant unknown ocean currents with velocity 0 5 m s and direction 30 which is used to reveal the robustness concerning the parameter perturbation and ocean currents to illustrate the performance of this tracking control algorithm more comprehensively typical spatial curves are taken as the reference desired trajectories to be tracked by an underactuated uuv in the following numerical simulations which include the helical spatial straight planar comb shaped trajectory now that the uuv under this tracking controller can track the straight trajectory accurately this tracking control algorithm overcomes the persistent excitation pe condition considering the actual operational needs of uuvs the predefined reference trajectory in this simulation is composed of spatial straight helical and planar comb shaped trajectory according to theorem 1 the desired pitch angular velocity q r and yaw angular velocity r r are constant zero when the under actuated uuv sails on the straight predefined reference trajectory these facts do not satisfy the persistent excitation pe condition the spatial trajectory tracking control strategy can effectively overcome this problem and perform both the straight trajectory tracking and curvilinear trajectory tracking mission the predefined reference trajectory in n is expressed as 128 x r t t 100 m t 100 s 1

spatial trajectory tracking controller 53 83 91 and 102 track the predefined reference trajectory 128 130 from stationary state the initial trajectory tracking errors are as following x e 20 m y e 40

strategy of the position of the underactuated uuv in the three dimensional underwater space are shown in fig 3 the o n x n y n and o n x n z n projections of the three dimensional trajectory tracking results are demonstrated in fig 4 these results can be seen clearly that the underactuated uuv track the predefined reference trajectory accurately and quickly fig 5 displays the tracking response and errors of the position of the underactuated uuv from these figure the trajectory tracking errors of the position of the underactuated uuv tracked the predefined trajectory 128 130 after 120 s the absolute values of the position tracking errors x e y e and z e are less than 0 2 m 0 2 m and 0 01 m without current while these absolute values of the position tracking errors are less 1 18 m 0 92 m and 0 12 m under current in fig 6 the tracking responses of the linear velocities and their tracking errors are revealed due to the initial position tracking error there is a significant transient process in the tracking response of the surge velocity when the current disturbances exist there are some certain errors in the tracking responses of all linear velocities the tracking errors of all linear velocities can be stabilized into the neighborhood 0 05 m s 0 05 m s 0 08 m s 0 08 m s and almost zero surge sway and heave velocity without current meanwhile these absolute values of their tracking errors in the stable segment are less than 0 09 m s 0 61 m s and 0 05 m s under current when the underactuated uuv changes its depth its heave velocity comes into being spikes compared to the no current disturbances all linear velocities of the uuv have large tracking errors under the current disturbances especially yaw and heave velocity fig 7 shows the tracking responses of the pitch and yaw angles and their tracking errors the tracking errors of the pitch and yaw angle during steady state can remain a small neighborhood of the origin of 0 015 and 2 without current besides their absolute values are less than 1 63 and 21 6 under current in the spiral dive phase of the underactuated uuv the tracking errors of the sway and heave velocity and the pitch and yaw angle exhibit sinusoidal curves as a function of time when the underactuated uuv changes its depth there are spikes in the pitch angle with or without current disturbances the tracking response of the pitch and angular velocity and their tracking errors are demonstrated in fig 8 these tracking errors during steady state can be stabilized to almost zero without current disturbances and to a small neighborhood of the origin of 0 0013 rad s and 0 0163 rad s with current disturbances when the under actuated uuv changes its depth its pitch angular velocity emerges the peak with a maximum not exceeding 0 1 rad s when the underactuated uuv performs a spiral dive mission the tracking errors of its yaw angular velocity appears the sinusoidal curves as a function of time the surge control force the pitch control torque and yaw control torque are illustrated in fig 9 6 conclusion in this work the globally finite time control scheme was developed for the spatial trajectory tracking control of underactuated uuvs with model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents this trajectory tracking control scheme is made up of the spatial tracking guidance and dynamic controller the spatial tracking guidance was derived using the expansion of dynamic virtual vehicle method the dynamic tracking controller was proposed by the pid smc and cascaded control technology the proposed trajectory tracking control scheme guarantees the finite time convergence of all tracking errors to a small neighborhood of the origin and the boundedness of all uuv s motion states the results of numerical

22485,in this paper the subject of the spatial trajectory tracking control for underactuated unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs is addressed in the presence of model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents the spatial trajectory tracking guidance is established based on the dynamic virtual vehicle method which continuously computes the desired motion states of an uuv to be used by the

model parameters uncertainties keywords globally finite time stability underactuated unmanned underwater vehicle proportional integral derivative sliding mode control three dimensional trajectory tracking 1 introduction unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are playing a crucial role in scientific commercial and military applications compared with underwater manned systems uuv can perform dull dirty dangerous 3d missions such as geological sampling inspection of underwater structures intelligence surveillance reconnaissance isr anti submarine warfare asw and so on gafurov and klochkov 2015 yuh 2000 zhu et al 2018 to meet the needs of those different missions the motion of these vehicles must be accurately controlled in the three dimensional space consequently the motion control for under actuated uuvs have gradually become a hot topic in the field of marine engineering as a typical problem the trajectory tracking control is concerned with the design of control laws that force a vehicle to reach and track a predefined desired trajectory i e a geometric path with an associated timing law due to highly nonlinear dynamics and the parameter perturbation of uuvs and the unknown ocean currents it is a great challenge to develop accuracy spatial trajectory tracking controller for uuvs considering the cost total weight and efficiency the motion control actuators for most of uuvs are usually configured as underactuated mode in practical engineering aguiar and hespanha 2007 the type of underactuated uuvs have fewer independent motion control actuators than degrees of freedom dof the type of uuvs in this work are equipped with only three independent actuators it is easy to prove that the underactuated uuvs are a class of underactuated mechanical systems with second order nonholonomic constraints and drift items do and pan 2006 wichlund et al 1995 the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated uuvs is extremely challenging and great meaningful because the famous brockett s necessary condition shows that asymptotic stabilization of these underactuated uuvs cannot be achieved with any smooth or continuous time invariant feedback controllers brockett 1983 pomet 1992 and the underactuated control laws can be used to handle actuator failure for fully actuated uuvs or over actuated uuvs for marine vehicles the existing tracking control strategies are mostly handled the planar trajectory tracking problem behal et al 2002 chen et al 2016 do et al 2002 2005 elmokadem et al 2016 2017 harmouche et al 2014 jiang 2002 lefeber et al 2003 ramezani al and tavanaei sereshki 2019a b repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 wang and li 2012 yan et al 2015 yu et al 2012 although these works have successfully solved the planar trajectory tracking problem in theory the spatial trajectory tracking problem of uuvs cannot be solved by simply expanding the above research results some scholars tried to extend these results above to spatial trajectory tracking but these attempts have ended in failure nowadays the spatial trajectory tracking problem of uuvs has made some achievements aguiar and hespanha 2007 bechlioulis et al 2017 do 2013 gan et al 2018 liu et al 2017 qiao et al 2017 rezazadegan et al 2015 however in the above mentioned research results most of works considered the spatial trajectory tracking problem for fully actuated uuvs and only a few of the articles are about the spatial trajectory tracking for underactuated uuvs aguiar and hespanha 2007 rezazadegan et al 2015 throughout the existing research results the design methods of the tracking controllers include backstepping and lyapunov s direct method aguiar and hespanha 2007 behal et al 2002 do 2013 do et al 2002 2005 jiang 2002 liu et al 2017 repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 rezazadegan et al 2015 shen et al 2018 sliding mode control elmokadem et al 2016 2017 gan et al 2018 ramezani al and tavanaei sereshki 2019a b wang and li 2012 yan et al 2015 yu et al 2012 adaptive control aguiar and hespanha 2007 chen et al 2016 ramezani al and tavanaei sereshki 2019a b wang et al 2018 saturated state feedback control harmouche et al 2014 qiao et al 2017 and fuzzy control wang et al 2018 among these methods the sliding mode control smc is one of the most effective means to handle the problem of motion control for underactuated uuvs with external disturbance and model uncertainties because it is natural strong robustness with regard to internal and external disturbance moreover smc has also the advantages of reduced order decoupling fast response good dynamic characteristics and so on edwards and spurgeon 1998 shtessel et al 2014 therefore smc can solve the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated uuvs well the traditional smc originated from the variable structure system vss in the late 1950s and has become the most successful method for dealing with bounded uncertainty disturbances and parasitic dynamics of nonlinear system edwards and spurgeon 1998 shtessel et al 2014 utkin 1993 however the tracking errors can only asymptotically converge into a neighborhood of the origin along the traditional sliding surfaces therefore terminal sliding mode control tsmc is proposed to stabilize the tracking errors in finite time zak 1988 to avoid the singularity of tsmc non singular tsmc is developed in the work of ref feng et al 2002 to further improve the convergence rate and overcome the chattering a nonlinear pid smc is proposed chiu 2012 in the aforementioned works the smc based control algorithms have been employed to handle the planar trajectory tracking for underactuated marine vehicles and the spatial trajectory tracking for fully actuated uuvs in ref yan et al 2015 a globally finite time tracking control strategy was developed based on the pid smc which drives an underactuated uuv to track the planar trajectory this tracking controller was able to stabilize all tracking errors in finite time and was strongly strong robustness against model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents in view of the aforementioned advantages the pid smc should be used to solve the spatial trajectory tracking problem in this paper a globally finite time tracking control scheme is proposed based on the pid smc and the cascaded approach which drives an underactuated uuv with model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents to track the desired spatial trajectory the trajectory tracking guidance is developed by extending the horizontal virtual vehicle method and then the dynamic equations of the position and attitude tracking errors are obtained the kinematic tracking controllers are deduced using the equivalent control of the pid smc which stabilize the position and attitude tracking errors in finite time however the kinematic controllers are not the actual control inputs of underactuated uuvs thus the velocity tracking errors should be introduced to design the actual control inputs the dynamic tracking controllers and their dynamic equations are established and then the dynamic equations of the tracking errors are transformed into the cascaded form after that the trajectory tracking dynamic controllers are designed based on the pid smc which achieve the stabilization of the velocity tracking errors the spatial trajectory tracking problem of underactuated uuvs is solved successfully under model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents using the finite time stability theory the closed loop trajectory tracking system for underactuated uuvs is proved to be globally finite time stable finally simulation results are presented and discussed which demonstrate the performance of the developed trajectory tracking control strategy and its robustness with regard to model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents 2 problem statement it is usually considered that an underactuated uuv sailing in the underwater three dimensional space is modeled as a submerged rigid body subject to external forces and torques therefore several definitions are introduced which are used to describe the spatial motion of underactuated uuvs to analyze the stability

underactuated uuv in this work the spatial trajectory tracking problem of an underactuated uuv is considered such underactuated uuv is only equipped with three independent actuators located at the aft of uuv namely a pair of the identical stern thrusters sternplanes and rudder to provide the forward force the pitch moment and the yaw moment this type of uuv lacks independent control input in the sway heave and roll to analyze the spatial motion of an uuv it is necessary that two coordinate frames are defined as indicated in fig 1 namely the inertial coordinate frame n and the body fixed coordinate frame b the frame n is familiarly chosen the north east down ned coordinate system and its origin is defined relative to the earth s reference ellipsoid for the ned the x axis points towards due north the y axis points towards positive east while the z axis points downwards normal to the earth s surface the frame b is fixed to the vehicle its origin is usually chosen to coincide with the midpoint of the connection between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy for uuvs the body axes x b y b and z b are chosen to coincide with the principal axis of inertia and they are generally defined as see fig 1 1 x b longitudinal axis directed from aft to fore 2 y b transversal axis directed to starboard 3 z b normal axis directed from top to bottom for the spatial motion of uuvs it is usually necessary that six independent coordinates are defined to determine its position and orientation however the roll motion of uuvs is neglected because it can t be directly controlled by any actuators and is usually self stabilizing that is the spatial motion of uuvs can be described by five independent coordinates the first three coordinates correspond to the position of the vehicle in the frame n denoted as p b n n x y z t and the last two coordinates describe its orientation denoted as θ n b θ ψ t then the position and orientation of an underactuated uuv are summed up η p b n n t θ n b t t ℝ 3 s 2 and the linear and angular velocity of an under actuated uuv are described as ν b n b u v w t and ω b n b q r t and they are summed up ν ν b n b t ω b n b t t ℝ 5 the linear velocity transformation r b n φ θ n b so 3 is used to describe the translational motion of an underactuated uuv which is defined in the terms of euler angles about the z y and x axes zyx convention fossen 2011 and the roll angle φ in r b n φ θ n b is set to zero denoted as r b n θ n b r b n 0 θ n b hence the kinematic equations of the translational motion are represented as 14 p b n n r b n θ n b ν b n b where the rotation matrix r b n θ n b is specifically defined as 15 r b n θ n b cos ψ cos θ sin ψ cos ψ sin θ sin ψ cos θ cos ψ sin ψ sin θ sin θ 0 cos θ in the meantime the kinematic equations of the rotational motion are described as 16 θ n b t θ θ n b ω b n b where the transformation matrix t θ θ n b is specifically defined as 17 t θ θ n b 1 0 0 1 cos θ assumption 1 i this vehicle is a neutrally buoyant rigid body that its mass distribution is homogeneous ii the roll motion of this vehicle is neglected iii the order of the hydrodynamic drag terms is lower than two

trajectory tracking guidance the trajectory tracking guidance is the system that continuously computes the desired orientation velocity and acceleration of a uuv to guide the vehicle to track the desired trajectory fossen 2011 in this work the spatial tracking guidance is established based on the virtual vehicle method this tracking guidance utilizes p r n t p r n t p r n t and the sway and heave dynamic equations of the underactuated uuv to calculate the motion states of the virtual vehicle that is the position coordinates the desired reference trajectory p r n t are the inputs of this trajectory tracking guidance and its outputs are the motion states of the virtual vehicle furthermore the trajectory tracking error equations are derived by using the outputs of the spatial tracking guidance and the motion equations of the underactuated uuv 3 1 the kinematics and dynamics of the virtual vehicle in this work the ideal of this spatial trajectory tracking guidance originates from the planar trajectory tracking research work of repoulias repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 and yan yan et al 2015 that is the tracking guidance is developed by extending the horizontal virtual vehicle method to construct the tracking guidance it is natural assumption that the tracking target of an underactuated uuv in the spatial trajectory tracking mission is set to a virtual vehicle sailing along the predefined desired spatial trajectory the virtual vehicle should satisfy the following assumptions assumption 4 the dynamics of the virtual vehicle is exactly the same as the actual uuv and its hydrodynamic coefficients are identical with the nominal value of the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients for the actual uuv assumption 5 i the coordinate origin of the body fixed coordinate frame

combined with the underactuated dynamics of the virtual vehicle the surge acceleration and jerk are calculated as eqs 29 and 30 similarly the heave acceleration and jerk are obtained as eqs 31 and 32 step 3 from fig 2 by definitions of the float and course angle we can obtain the expressions 33 and 34 of the desired float and course angle of the virtual vehicle according to assumption 5 the

controller design through the foregoing discussion the spatial trajectory tracking control problem is transformed into how to stabilize the trajectory tracking errors in this section the tracking controller based on the pid smc and the cascaded control method is proposed which globally stabilizes the tracking errors 43 and 44 the trajectory tracking problems can usually be divided into two separate control objectives geometric position and attitude tracking task and dynamic linear and angular velocity tracking task the linear velocity tracking errors ν e are selected as the virtual control inputs of the kinematical subsystem 45 and 46 the equivalent control laws of the pid smc are applied to develop these virtual control inputs furthermore the trajectory tracking error dynamic system is transformed into the cascaded form of a kinematical subsystem and a dynamic subsystem the dynamic subsystem 51 and 52 is chosen as the driving subsystem in the cascaded structure and the kinematical subsystem 45 and 46 is the driven subsystem theorem 2 consider the kinematical subsystem 45 and 46 the control inputs of which are the linear velocity tracking errors ν e the desired

sliding surface vector s 0 t the reaching segment of smc is eliminated further since the kinematics subsystem of the underactuated uuv is completely accurate it is assumed that the states of the motion of the uuv is completely measurable the equivalent control law can well achieve the stabilization of the position tracking errors x e y e and z e to only consider the equivalent control for the pid smc i e s 0 t 0 and substituting eq 45 into eq 56 the desired control inputs of the kinematical subsystem 45 and 46 can be solved as follows α ν r b n θ n b t κ 0 s i g α p e n t r b n θ n b t r b

tracking task has been achieved in theorem 2 however this control law 53 is not the actual control inputs of the underactuated uuv therefore in order to completely implement the trajectory tracking control objectives the dynamic tracking task needs to be implemented to stabilize the velocity tracking errors 44 and this virtual control law 53 is extended to the actual control inputs in the subsequent section to achieve these two objectives the following error vector e is introduced 59 e ν e α ν where e e u e v e w t then substituting eqs 53 and 59 into eq 45 the dynamic equation 45 of

compared to u and u r the relationship between u and u r becomes 23 u 106 u r however both the surge velocity u and the desired surge velocity u r are positive according to assumption 5 and the

lemma 3 the second subsystem in eq 61 under the dynamic tracking control law 102 is the globally finite time stability 4 2 stability analysis of the full closed loop system in the previous section the globally finite time trajectory tracking control strategy has been developed respectively in the kinematic and dynamic level and the trajectory tracking closed loop system of the underactuated uuv has been transformed into the cascaded form a kinematical subsystem and a dynamic subsystem in the proof of theorems 2 and 3 the kinematical subsystem p e n f 1 t p e n and the dynamic subsystem e f 2 t e are ugfts however the full close loop cascaded system 62 does not prove to be ugfts in order to prove the stability of this cascaded system 62 the finite time stability theory of the time varying cascaded system lemma 4 is introduced it is seen from the previous section that the first two conditions of lemma 4 have been certified and are held then the last two conditions in lemma 4 need to be verified 1 verification of the condition 3 in lemma 4 consider the candidate clf 110 v dyn 4 t p e n 1 2 x e 2 1 2 y e 2 1 2 z e 2 along the trajectory of the dynamic subsystem p e n f 1 t p e n the first order time derivative of the clf 110 can be calculated as follows 111 v dyn 4 p e n f 1 t p e n t p e n κ 01 x e 1 α 01 κ 02 y e 1 α 02 κ 03 z e 1 α 03 and taking the first order partial

β 2 s the positive semi defined function w s and the continuous non decreasing function β 4 s are chosen as β 1 s 1 4 s 2 β 2 s s 2 w s min κ 01 κ 02 κ 03 s s 1 min κ 01 κ 02 κ 03 s 2 s 1 113 β 4 s 2 s β 4 s 2 s such that the condition 3 in lemma 4 is held that is β 1 p e n v dyn 4 t p e n β 2 p e n v dyn 4 p e n f 1 t p e n t p e n w x 1 v dyn 4 t p e n p e n β 4 x 1 2 verification of the condition 4 in lemma 4 from eq 60 the function g t p e n e satisfies the following condition 114 g t p e n e r b n θ ψ e e e 1 γ e β 5 p e n where the non negative continuous γ s and β 5 s are defined as follows 115 γ s s 1 β 5 s 1 from eq 113 the inverse function of k class functions β 1 s is calculated as β 1 1 s 2 s 1 2 thus it can be obtained 116 β 4 β 1 1 s 4 s 1 2 β 5 β 1 1 s 1 then the following non decreasing function is introduced 117 β 6 s 5 s 1 2 such that β 6 s β 4 β 1 1 s β 5 β 1 1 s and this non decreasing function β 6 s satisfies the following conditions β 6 a 0 a 0 118 a d s β 6 s a d s 5 s 1 2 a 1 5 s 1 2 d s 1 5 s 1 2 a through the analysis above the closed loop tracking error system 62 satisfies all four conditions of lemma 4 thus it is easily seen that the closed loop tracking error system 62 is ugfts under the spatial trajectory tracking control law 83 91 and 102 that being said the spatial trajectory tracking control law 83 91 and 102 can force arbitrary trajectory tracking errors p e n and e to globally converge to the origin in finite time 4 3 boundedness of the pitch and yaw angular velocity in this subsection it is mainly shown that the bounded input bounded output bibo stability of the pitch and yaw angular velocity is discussed in detail firstly the bounded stability of the pitch angular velocity q is investigated the candidate clf is defined as follows 119 v dyn 5 1 2 m 55 q 2 taking the time derivative of the clf 119 and substituting the pitch motion equation in eq 18 the calculation result is 120 v dyn 5 m 55 q q q m 33 m 11 u w m q q m q q q q τ 5 b g z w sin θ if the derivative v dyn 5 of the clf 119 is less than zero it means that 121 m 33 m 11 u w m q q m q q q 2 τ 5 b g z w sin θ 0 q 0 m 33 m 11 u w m q q m q q q 2 τ 5 b g z w sin θ 0 q 0 solving the inequality equation 121 the calculation result is obtained 122 q m q q m q 2 4 m q q m 11 m 33 u w b g z w sin θ τ 5 2 m q q q m q m q 2 4 m q q m 33 m 11 u w τ 5 b g z w sin θ 2 m q q in addition the pitch angular velocity q of the underactuated uuv is bounded by the limitation of its self motion characteristics that is q q max so to ensure that the derivative v dyn 5 of the clf 119 is less than zero the pitch angular velocity q satisfies the following conditions 123 q max q m q m q 2 4 m q q m 11 m 33 u w b g z w sin θ τ 5 2 m q q q max q m q m q 2 4 m q q m 33 m 11 u w τ 5 b g z w sin θ 2 m q q that being said the derivative v dyn 5 of the clf 119 is negative definite when the pitch angular velocity q satisfies the conditions 123 that is the clf v dyn 5 is decreasing about time therefore the absolute value of the pitch angular velocity q is also decreasing about time when the pitch angular velocity q go beyond the scope given by eq 123 the derivative v dyn 5 of the clf 119 becomes positive definite furthermore the clf v dyn 5 will become an increasing function of time thereby the absolute value of the pitch angular velocity q also become increasing about time and it eventually return to the range given by eq 123 in addition since the control input τ 5 the linear velocities u and w and the sine of the pitch angle sin θ all are bounded the pitch angular velocity q is bibo stable next the bounded stability of the yaw angular velocity r is discussed the candidate clf is defined as follows 124 v dyn 6 1 2 m 66 r 2 differentiating the clf 124 and substituting the yaw motion equation in eq 18 the calculation result is 125 v dyn 6 m 66 r r r m 11 m 22 u v n r r n r r r r τ 6 the necessary and sufficient conditions that the derivative of the clf 124 is negative definite are as follows 126 m 11 m 22 u v n r r n r r r r τ 6 0 r 0 m 11 m 22 u v n r r n r r r r τ 6 0 r 0 considering the boundedness of the yaw angular velocity r the solution of the inequality equation 126 can be obtained 127 r max r n r n r 2 4 n r r m 22 m 11 u v τ 6 2 n r r r max r n r n r 2 4 n r r m 33 m 11 u w τ 6 2 n r r analogous to the stability analysis of the pitch angular velocity q the absolute value of the yaw angular velocity r is decreasing about time when it satisfies the conditions 127 once the yaw angular velocity r is out of range given by eq 127 the absolute value of the yaw angular velocity r will become an increasing function of time until it converges to this scope given by eq 127 furthermore because the control input τ 6 and the linear velocities u and v all are bounded the yaw angular velocity r is bibo stable remark 5 according to the aforementioned discussion it is well known that the trajectory tracking control law 53 83 91 and 102 can drive arbitrary tracking errors p e n and e to converge to the origin in the finite times t s 01 t s 11 t s 11 t s 02 t s 12 t s 12 and t s 03 t s 13 t s 13 respectively firstly the arbitrary tracking errors e under the dynamic tracking controllers 83 91 and 102 are stabilized in the finite times t s 11 t s 11 t s 12 t s 12 and t s 13 t s 13 respectively then the tracking errors p e n converge to the origin in the finite times t s 01 t s 02 and t s 03 respectively that being said the spatial trajectory tracking mission can be successfully achieved in the finite time in addition the pitch and yaw angular velocities have been proved to be bibo stable 5 numerical simulation and discussion in this section to support our propositions a number of numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed spatial trajectory tracking control law performs very well in terms of short transient time high tracking accuracy convergence of all arbitrary tracking errors to the origin within the finite time and strong robustness with respect to model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents the simulation platform is based on the motion model of the underactuated

all hydrodynamic coefficients and the constant unknown ocean currents with velocity 0 5 m s and direction 30 which is used to reveal the robustness concerning the parameter perturbation and ocean currents to illustrate the performance of this tracking control algorithm more comprehensively typical spatial curves are taken as the reference desired trajectories to be tracked by an underactuated uuv in the following numerical simulations which include the helical spatial straight planar comb shaped trajectory now that the uuv under this tracking controller can track the straight trajectory accurately this tracking control algorithm overcomes the persistent excitation pe condition considering the actual operational needs of uuvs the predefined reference trajectory in this simulation is composed of spatial straight helical and planar comb shaped trajectory according to theorem 1 the desired pitch angular velocity q r and yaw angular velocity r r are constant zero when the under actuated uuv sails on the straight predefined reference trajectory these facts do not satisfy the persistent excitation pe condition the spatial trajectory tracking control strategy can effectively overcome this problem and perform both the straight trajectory tracking and curvilinear trajectory tracking mission the predefined reference trajectory in n is expressed as 128 x r t t 100 m t 100 s 1

absolute values of the position tracking errors x e y e and z e are less than 0 2 m 0 2 m and 0 01 m without current while these absolute values of the position tracking errors are less 1 18 m 0 92 m and 0 12 m under current in fig 6 the tracking responses of the linear velocities and their tracking errors are revealed due to the initial position tracking error there is a significant transient process in the tracking response of the surge velocity when the current disturbances exist there are some certain errors in the tracking responses of all linear velocities the tracking errors of all linear velocities can be stabilized into the neighborhood 0 05 m s 0 05 m s 0 08 m s 0 08 m s and almost zero surge sway and heave velocity without current meanwhile these absolute values of their tracking errors in the stable segment are less than 0 09 m s 0 61 m s and 0 05 m s under current when the underactuated uuv changes its depth its heave velocity comes into being spikes compared to the no current disturbances all linear velocities of the uuv have large tracking errors under the current disturbances especially yaw and heave velocity fig 7 shows the tracking responses of the pitch and yaw angles and their tracking errors the tracking errors of the pitch and yaw angle during steady state can remain a small neighborhood of the origin of 0 015 and 2 without current besides their absolute values are less than 1 63 and 21 6 under current in the spiral dive phase of the underactuated uuv the tracking errors of the sway and heave velocity and the pitch and yaw angle exhibit sinusoidal curves as a function of time when the underactuated uuv changes its depth there are spikes in the pitch angle with or without current disturbances the tracking response of the pitch and angular velocity and their tracking errors are demonstrated in fig 8 these tracking errors during steady state can be stabilized to almost zero without current disturbances and to a small neighborhood of the origin of 0 0013 rad s and 0 0163 rad s with current disturbances when the under actuated uuv changes its depth its pitch angular velocity emerges the peak with a maximum not exceeding 0 1 rad s when the underactuated uuv performs a spiral dive mission the tracking errors of its yaw angular velocity appears the sinusoidal curves as a function of time the surge control force the pitch control torque and yaw control torque are illustrated in fig 9 6 conclusion in this work the globally finite time control scheme was developed for the spatial trajectory tracking control of underactuated uuvs with model parameter perturbation and unknown ocean currents this trajectory tracking control scheme is made up of the spatial tracking guidance and dynamic controller the spatial tracking guidance was derived using the expansion of dynamic virtual vehicle method the dynamic tracking controller was proposed by the pid smc and cascaded control technology the proposed trajectory tracking control scheme guarantees the finite time convergence of all tracking errors to a small neighborhood of the origin and the boundedness of all uuv s motion states the results of numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed tracking control algorithm can effectively drive uuv to perform the spatial trajectory tracking tasks and be provided with strongly robust with regard to model parameter perturbation and constant unknown current the proposed tracking control algorithm can force the underactuated uuv to accurately track the spatial desired trajectory in future works the

efficiency maneuverability agility and noise ozmen koca et al 2016 niu and xu 2014 sfakiotakis 1999 yu et al 2016c yu et al 2016a zhao et al 2009 on the contrary underwater animals such as fish have amazing swimming abilities and they are superior to classic auvs in many respects thus biomimetic type of novel auvs namely robotic fish are needed including advanced swimming mechanisms for higher degree of precision maneuverability and high efficiency ay et al 2018 sfakiotakis et al 2016 wu et al 2014 yu et al 2016b similar to real fish an ideal biomimetic robotic fish should interact with its environment and control locomotion patterns to adapt to its dynamic circumstances these situations enable to operate in dynamic and unpredictable conditions and robotic fish can quickly response to the changes in underwater liu and hu 2006 w wang et al 2017 z wang et al 2017 therefore one of the critical key point in the design of a biomimetic robotic fish is the intelligent swimming to provide autonomous mobility the high maneuverability of fish not only ensure from their excellent body structures but also from natural control mechanisms which generate the transition of motion patterns zhang et al 2016 neurobiologists have discovered that locomotion control in vertebrate and invertebrate animals are generally provided with a special neural network structure described as central pattern generator cpg cpgs are the biological neuron circuits that can produce behavior based rhythmic oscillatory and robust output patterns according to biological view point cpg networks have three significant features as follow ijspeert 2008 li et al 2014c niu and xu 2014 m wang et al 2014 w wang et al 2014 i output patterns are produced without any receiving input signals ii cpgs create multiple coupled neural circuits with constructed synaptic relations iii cpg circuits can be controlled by multiple connections from motor cortex in the brain these synaptic connections are constructed directly or through the brainstem and sensory feedback control mechanism is provided to response the external stimulus considering these three features four main advantages are also arisen li et al 2014b 2015 yu et al 2014a i cpg outputs exhibit limit cycle behaviors to overcome the external disturbances ii complex dynamic model is not required and parameter modulation is simple while determining the locomotion pattern iii closed loop sensory feedback cpg models can be derived iv cpgs are very suitable for multi degrees of freedom motion control in bioinspired robotic systems therefore cpg based neural control methods have begun to be used with different control structures to obtain uncertain locomotor behaviors and cpgs have been widely studied to various bioinspired robots for intelligent robust stable adaptable and hierarchical control solutions hu et al 2014 li et al 2014b yu et al 2014b zhu et al 2018 biped robots liu et al 2016 robotic fish yu et al 2014a zhang et al 2016 multi legged robots ijspeert 2008 salamander robots ijspeert et al 2005 and snake like li et al 2014a w wang et al 2017 z wang et al 2017 wen et al 2015 robots have been controlled with different cpg models considering the locomotion control methods of previous autonomous robotic fish prototypes in the literature it can be seen that there are two general controls methods as sine based and cpg based niu and xu 2014 ozmen koca et al 2016 yu et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 since first robotic fish prototypes robotuna and robopike were developed in 1990s there have been designed various kinds of robotic fish and controlled with sine based methods liu and hu 2006 ryuh et al 2015 draper laboratory designed an autonomous underwater robot named vcuuv that could avoid the obstacles liu and hu 2004 yu et al developed different types of robotic fish to study swimming performances shao et al 2008 yu et al 2007 2005 in 2006 a kind of carangiform robotic fish namely g9 is designed by hu et al which imitate the carp swimming motion liu and hu 2006 however robotic fish prototype should swim with different and extraordinary locomotion patterns in order to achieve given tasks and also complicated hydrodynamic and kinematic models are needed to perform traditional control laws niu and xu 2014 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 therefore various cpg controllers have been designed and performed to bioinspired robotic fish over the past few decades wang et al demonstrated the ring coupled linearized amplitude controlled phase oscillators to generate forward and backward swimming motions m wang et al 2014 w wang et al 2014 wang and xie 2014 crespi studied the forward and turning motions of ostraciiform robotic fish with amplitude controlled phase oscillators lachat et al 2006 niu et al performed open loop swimming performance of anguilliform robotic fish with andronov hopf oscillators with three dimensional ring models niu et al 2014 yu et al realized various cpg models to obtain three dimensional swimming patterns wu et al 2015 yu et al 2016c yu et al 2014a 2013 zhang et al examined agile swimming motions with hopf oscillators and studied three dimensional motion control to avoid obstacles zhang et al 2016 many researchers have performed different experiments to validate the adaptability of the cpg based locomotion control methods ding et al 2009 li et al 2015 niu et al 2014 wang et al 2013 yu et al 2013 but the closed loop sensory feedback cpg methods have been less studied due to complexity of biological based models and difficulty of real time implementations closed loop sensory feedback cpgs exhibit robust stable and adaptable motor outputs depending on the external stimulus incoming from sensory neurons this type of cpg control provides the adaptation of locomotor swimming patterns according to dynamic and unexpected conditions in environment the main contributions of this paper are summarized as below to develop an effective sensory

rather than high complexity cpg methods to perform appropriate cruising routes by using an intelligent control approach which has significant role both for combining data from onboard sensors and for making the right decision by synthesizing these data to enable robot locomotion to provide proper solutions with limitless intermediate cruising routes in complex real world explorations in the case of robot is faced with more than one obstacle at the same time by fuzzy control approach the developed biomimetic robotic fish i rof swims like a carangiform type with two link propulsive tail mechanism the control mechanism is composed of a biologically based cpg model and a fuzzy logic sub controller to generate stable adaptable and smooth gait transitions the cpg model is designed as a network of coupled lamprey oscillators with sensory neuron mechanism in the cpg network each oscillator only couples with a previous oscillator using unidirectional inhibitory synapses and a brainstem model is constructed to determine the phase locked behavior in order to provide autonomous swimming a closed loop fuzzy logic controller is also designed as a brain model finally a finite state

main components as well streamlined rigid body including cog control mechanism two link tail mechanism driving with servomotors communication and control unit front sight unit with distance sensors and flexible caudal fin all of the components are designed considering the body shape and dimensions of a real carangiform and component locations are realized according to balance of the lift force anterior rigid body is made of molded polylactic acid and houses communication and control unit cog control mechanism battery pack 10 dof imu and balancing weights cog control mechanism provides to

prototype can be found in our previous works ay et al 2018 ozmen koca et al 2018 3 autonomous locomotion control with sensory feedback 3 1 cpg model biological cpgs in the spinal cord are neural oscillators that generate rhythmic muscle activation patterns such as walking running crawling and swimming moreover cpgs exhibit robust stable adaptable and rich dynamic output activities yu et al 2016a zhang et al 2016 from biological point of view these neural circuit models are well suited to locomotion control of the robotic fish and smooth transitions of different rhythmic locomotion patterns can be generated according to environmental conditions in the field of engineering cpg models are summarized in three levels as biophysical connectionist and abstract the connectionist level attracts attention with its simple and realistic biologically based neuron models ijspeert 2008 in order to design an effective autonomous locomotion control of the robotic fish prototype three criteria should be considered first criteria is to adapt easy parameter modulation this feature provides several kinds of swimming gaits easily second is that the constructed cpg network should include sensory feedback mechanism in order to react against external stimulus last criteria is that the cpg network should combine onboard sensory information to provide high maneuverability capabilities in each complicated or unstable environments in order to response these mentioned criteria of effective autonomous locomotion control a connectionist level cpg network with sensory feedback mechanism is provided for proposed robotic fish although there is feedback input in abstract level cpg models the effect of these inputs on cpg outputs is similar to the on off response in other words they do not exhibit filtered soft transition properties lamprey is one of the earliest swimming vertebrate which is inspired to develop a new cpg approach by li li et al 2014c this approach includes connectionist level properties with its rich dynamic oscillatory activities and also it satisfies combining intelligent structures with locomotion control in this study the framework of the constructed artificial lamprey neural spinal cord structure is presented in order to provide aimed criteria of effective autonomous locomotion control for the developed robotic fish prototype the constructed cpg model produces rhythmic outputs and amplitude frequency phase difference and offset of the output can be easily modulated the cpg circuit consists of a motor control unit mcu and two oscillators which generate motion of the tail links in fig 2 neural cpg oscillator is given and divided into two symmetric segments each segment has four different interneurons named crossed interneuron cin lateral interneuron lin excitatory interneuron ein motor neuron mn and sensory neuron sn the mathematical model of an oscillator is express as follows 1 τ x c i n i x c i n i k 1 n w i k s c i n i k 2 τ x l i n i x l i n i k 1 n w i k s l i n i k j 1 n w j j 1 c l i n j 1 3 x e i n i a 1 e x c i n a 2 4 τ x m n i x m n i β a k 1 n w i k s m n i k 5 y j max x m n 1 0 max x m n 2 0 here i is the left and right segments of the oscillator j is the oscillator number and k represents the number of neurons in the oscillator x i is the membrane potential y j is the oscillator output parameters τ and a are the period and amplitude respectively β is the offset and it is assigned opposite values to the two mns to resume oscillation w ik and w ij are the synaptic weights of the interneuron and oscillator s i gives the membrane potential of the presynaptic neuron and c j with w ij give the neurotransmitter potential to the postsynaptic neuron top line of the subscript defines the opposite segment in the same oscillator in the designed sensory feedback mechanism each sn is defined as below 6 τ r e s x s n i x s n i p λ i f λ λ τ f x s n i x s n i o t h e r w i s e where x sn i is the membrane potential of the sn τ res is the response time constant of the stimulus τ f is the fall time constant of the stimulus p is the correction coefficient of the stimulus λ is the external stimulus amount respectively λ is the threshold value the threshold value assigns whether the response should be generated when the external stimulus is important because in other cases sn is zero it should be noted that each sn emits excitatory synapses to all mns mcu behaves as a brainstem to determine the phase difference of the links and it is designed in the same form but there are two different synapses w l r w r l from its own ein to lin w l r α α γ and w r l γ α γ α and γ are the phase coefficients of mcu and the range of these parameters is 0 1 in addition sns are not use and equal to zero in the mcu in the oscillator model a unidirectional inhibitory chained cpg circuit is established to generate the rhythmic oscillatory outputs 3 2 autonomous fuzzy swimming control using an intelligent control approach has significant role both for combining data from onboard sensors and for making the right cruise decision by synthesizing these data to enable robot locomotion developed robotic fish prototype includes two feedback perceptions with a 10 dof imu and three infrared sensors the evaluation of these sensor data are challenging fuzzy control approach provides proper solutions with limitless intermediate cruising routes in complex real world explorations in the case of robot is faced with more than one obstacle at the same time for this propose fuzzy based autonomous and yaw control structures are developed with sensory feedback cpg network the robotic fish which has a motion combination with fsm can autonomously swim depending on the sensory feedback information received from the left right and front infrared sensors in the nose the autonomous closed loop block diagram of the robotic fish is shown in fig 3 the figure also includes the fuzzy yaw control block discussed in the next section here ψ is the yaw angle of the robotic fish according to earth fixed frame the linear measurement ranges of the distance data obtained from the sensors are determined as 6 80 cm the position of the front sensor is centered in the same direction as the x axis and the left and right sensors are positioned with the front sensor at angular intervals of 45 s l s r and s f are the infrared sensors in the left right and front position of the nose respectively at the same time obstacle scanning angle of each sensor is determined as approximately 40 the percentages of the obstacle data from the sensors constitute the input variables of the fuzzy controller at the fuzzy controller output λ parameter of the sns is determined at the output of sn the parameter β which is the offset value of the cpg model is obtained thus depending on the distance of the static or dynamic obstacles the β value is generated according to the motion of the robotic fish this sensory feedback control structure allows that the robotic fish prototype can swim in autonomous mode with avoiding the obstacles values of the cpg parameters are determined as a 1 20 a 2 20 τ 0 0779 α 0 8 γ 0 τ res 0 4 τ f 0 1095 and p 2 according to the closed loop sensory feedback system mamdani type fuzzy controller is designed a general mamdani fuzzy controller is composed of four parts such as the fuzzifier rule base inference mechanism and defuzzifier three infrared sensors i e s l s r and s f are mounted on the robot and the inputs of the controller are determined as the sensor values the defuzzifier output is the amount of stimulus λ in the designed controller rule base includes the if then rules as follows 7 r j i f x 1 i s m 1 j a n d x n i s m n j t h e n y i s q j j 1 2 m here x s l s f s r t ω x and y ω y are the linguistic variables of inputs and output r j indicates the jth rule m j q j are the fuzzy sets and depend on the μ m j x μ q j y m is also the rule number the fuzzy controller executes a nonlinear mapping from ω x to ω y according to this mapping output surfaces for three inputs are given in fig 4 in the defuzzifier the centroid method is performed and can be expressed as 8 y k j 1 m max μ q j y y j j 1 m max μ q j y here yj is the crisp output of the jth rule finally inputs of the controller can be determined with the following equation 9 s i γ m i v i s b i k i l f r here v s is the sensor voltage m is the linearized slope and b is the line function constant k is a positive constant that determines the calibration point and is set to 4 for gp2y0a21yk0f γ is the percentile constant which is determined with the ratio of measurement distance it is noted that m 1 m and b 1 b the input and output membership functions are given in fig 5 and the rule base of the fuzzy controller for the variation of output according to the input variables is presented in table 1 it is noted that the autonomous swimming control rules are determined by considering the control accuracy and the characteristics of the robotic fish for the analysis of the sensory feedback closed loop control structure random obstacles are generated for 30 s mechanical filtered distance measurements from the infrared sensors which are also the input variables of the fuzzy controller are given in fig 6 depending on the state of the obstacles change of the external stimulus λ which is obtained from the fuzzy controller output is presented in fig 7 fig 7 also shows the membrane potential of the sn against the external stimulus λ produced at the fuzzy controller output this output is also β parameter of the cpg model the cpg outputs produced against this input variable are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that oscillator outputs exhibit rhythmic robust adaptable and rapid dynamic output activities in addition outputs are quite smooth to generate oscillatory swimming motions 4 experimental results as shown in fig 9 an experimental system is established to examine the robotic fish prototype in a real experimental pool pool dimensions are 200 cm wide 300 cm long and 66 cm depth the system also includes one sony fdr ax53 4k top camera two gopro hero5 black edition 4k underwater action cameras and one user computer with i7 2 4 ghz processor 8 gb ddr4 ram and 2 gb graphics card experimental images are recorded at 3840x2160 p 30fps and 2704x1520 p 30fps with top camera and underwater cameras respectively the completely experimental system can be decomposed into an environment an image capturing subsystem a communication subsystem a data processing and a robotic fish subsystem including sensory feedback controller 4 1 characteristic performance of the robotic fish in order to analyze the characteristic performance of the robotic fish open loop cpg control is performed with different input parameters in these analyzes it is assumed that there is no external stimulus the open loop block scheme of the robotic fish is given in fig 10 input variables are the link angles of the robotic fish θ 1 θ 2 flapping frequency f depending on the period τ offset β and phase difference coefficients α γ the unidirectional left and right synaptic weights between all oscillators are equalized to 1 phase difference φ 12 are determined with α γ and γ is fixed at 0 2 α is only altered in the interval of 0 1 various parameters of robotic fish such as linear and angular speed variations corresponding to flapping frequency and β offset changes are examined with 84 real experiments within 20 days in the pool environment to obtain characteristics of the robotic fish these experiments are performed with different three cases case 1 forward speed change according to the variation of the flapping frequency for three amplitude values case 2 forward speed change according to the variation of the flapping frequency for three phase differences case 3 includes three subcases a linear turning speed change according to different offset variation at different flapping frequencies b angular turning speed change according to offset variation at different flapping frequencies c turning radius change according to offset variation at different flapping frequencies fig 11 presents the experimental results for three different cases using the determined parameters of the robotic fish in case 1 experiments with the cpg parameters of β 0 α 0 8 and φ 12 45 for three different amplitude values a 1 10 a 2 20 a l 20 a 2 20 a 1 20 a 2 30 are performed as the increase of the flapping frequency increases the driving force of the tail the forward speed increases proportional to the flapping frequency the reason for choosing a maximum of 30 of amplitude is that the mechanical limit value of rotation angle of each joint is 45 in the experiments the limit value has not been reached in order to obtain stable motion and not cause stress in case 1 the maximum forward speed of 0 4224 m s or in other words a forward speed of 0 8448 bl s depending on the body length bl is reached at 2 hz in case 2 the analysis of the forward speed changes for different amplitude values is reexamined for different phase values in the same experimental conditions analyzes according to three different phase values are performed with a 1 20 a 2 20 β 0 and α 0 5 as the phase difference between the tail joints of the fish increases the driving force produced by the tail decreases and the maximum speed value 0 4258 m s or 0 8516 bl s is reached at 60 where the phase value is minimum case 3 includes the analysis of the turning motion of the robotic fish for a 1 10 a 2 20 α 0 8 and φ 12 45 in case 3 a the linear turning speed maintains approximately constant values at fixed frequency despite of the offset variation angular turning speed also increases with offset increase for constant amplitude and frequency values in case 3 b also as seen in cases 3 a and b the linear and angular turning speeds of the fish increase as the fish flapping frequency increases according to case 3 results the maximum linear velocity is 0 3266 m s at 2 hz and the maximum angular turning speed is obtained as 0 62 rad s at 2 hz in case 3 c two different results about the turning radius of the robotic fish are reached the first result is that the turning radius for the fixed flapping frequency is inversely proportional to the increase of the offset value the second result is also that the turning radius for the fixed offset value is greater at lower frequencies from case 3 c the minimum turning radius of the robotic fish is 0 4387 m at 1 hz 4 2 closed loop autonomous swimming closed loop experiments are examined with 56 real experiments within 20 days in the pool environment and the closed loop control parameters are given in table 2 for autonomous swimming experiments three different scenarios are created by avoiding the obstacles of the robotic fish for these scenarios the video images obtained from the top camera are transferred to the kinovea program and the paths of the region marked on the robotic fish are found after that video images analyzed in kinovea are converted to sequential snapshots according to the sampling periods determined in matlab environment in the first scenario the robotic fish is positioned close to the upper left edge of the experimental pool the robotic fish performs the forward motion in the forward direction determined by the decision mechanism and the combination of motion while the front and right sensors detect and control the pool sides without hitting the edges thus robotic fish can swim with avoiding the obstacles and move with u shape from the starting to the destination point experimental images of the first scenario are presented for 16 88 s in fig 12 a in fig 12 b robotic fish trajectory is given obtained with kinovea in order to prove the edge following performance in the second scenario three circular obstacles are randomly placed inside the pool to form the corners of a triangle thus a scenario where the robotic fish is faced with random swimming motions and where there are similar obstacles that are likely to be encountered in a natural environment is formed experimental images of the second scenario are presented for 7 83 s in fig 13 the third scenario is designed to show the ability of the robotic fish prototype to move in narrow and hard to reach areas where people and classic underwater vehicles cannot for this purpose the robotic fish is forced to pass through a narrow area created by three circular obstacles without hitting them experimental images of the third scenario are presented for 8 44 s in fig 14 thus autonomous swimming experiments of the robotic fish prototype are performed for three different scenarios created with the different obstacle sequences according to these experiments it is observed that the designed control structure is quite effective for the robotic fish prototype these results have created a foundation to face in a natural environment in the light of the robotic fish it can be seen from these results that a preliminary study is performed for the robotic fish to swim in a natural environment in the future 4 3 multi task swimming while any task defined by user input is carried out by the robotic fish prototype in the case of a possible obstacle the priority task of the prototype is to pass the obstacle without hitting after the obstacle is exceeded the robotic fish should continue to perform the task given by the user thus the robot provides the response to the obstacles that it may encounter in the natural environment while performing the assigned task in fig 15 a fsm included in the closed loop system is designed to decide to priority of user defined tasks or tasks required by the autonomous swimming this structure provides to perform multi tasks in the same cycle in order to analyze priority task success two different scenarios which include yaw control as user defined task and allow the robotic fish to encounter obstacles are created in the fsm diagram d 0 represents the initial state of the robotic fish d 1 represents the forward swimming motion d 2 defines the autonomous swimming control with avoiding obstacles and d 3 is the user defined yaw control task values on cycle indicate how the transition between each other depends on the conditions output membership functions are determined with the same output functions of the autonomous fuzzy controller in fig 15 ψ ref is the reference yaw angle eψ is the yaw angle error and δψ is the variation of yaw angle it is noted that the yaw control rules are determined by considering the control accuracy and the characteristics of the robotic fish obtained from open loop analyzes furthermore ir parameter which gives the vectorial value of the obstacle distance defines whether there is any obstacle information in the infrared sensors of the robotic fish the case of ir 0 indicates that the fish face an obstacle this parameter is defined by equation 10 as follows 10 i r s l 2 s r 2 s f 2 experimental yaw control scenarios with obstacle avoidance are performed for two different reference yaw angles 30 45 and presented with the time dependent variations in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively as seen in fig 16 the yaw angle of the robotic fish encountered an obstacle to the right of the swimming direction in 2 22 s which is the time before reaching the desired reference input value it is oriented again towards the value of yaw angle which should be reached with the first given task after it pass over the obstacle approximately in 3 s it remains at the reference input value 30 with small oscillations at the end of approximately 8 2 s in the second scenario shown in fig 17 the yaw angle of the robotic fish encountered an obstacle to the right of the swimming direction in 2 35 s which is the time before reaching the desired reference input value it is directed to the reference yaw angle with the first given task again after exceeding this obstacle within approximately 2 5 s it remains at the reference input value with small oscillations at the end of about 4 8 s when the results for these two scenarios are examined it is clearly seen that the yaw control performance of the robotic fish is quite good even in the presence of obstacles it is also studied that the escape performance of the robot is very fast according to the all experiments the proposed closed loop control structure achieves the effective and robust responses and this control structure is very applicable and suitable for real world missions and explorations 5 comparisons and discussions among underwater vehicle types fish like underwater robots are able to swim with over 80 percent efficiency while classic rotary propellers move with approximately 40 50 percent efficiency in ichthyology body and or caudal fin bcf is the most widely used swimming mode because of its grater thrust force excellent mobility and high acceleration abilities bcf swimming mode includes five undulatory propulsion types as anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform thunniform and ostraciiform sfakiotakis 1999 carangiform swimmers are one of the most widely used models in biomimetic underwater robot design the reason of the usage of carangiform is related to the reduction of hydrodynamics effects and the ease of propulsion mechanism design in these regards table 3 is given for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system by comparing the other cpg based biomimetic underwater robot approaches in order to compare the maneuvering performance of the robots in the table the parameters from the second column to the eighth column should be evaluated together for instance when evaluating speed parameters the flapping frequency should also be considered furthermore since the physical properties of each robot such as size weight and etc are different from each other body length bl speed is more realistic in defining speed parameters the rest of columns are significant to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed cpg with the designed robot model considering computational complexity and adaptation of sensory feedback for closed loop control performance cpg level also defines how much biological features of living forms can be imparted to a biomimetic robot it can be clearly seen that the proposed robotic fish has high swimming speed performance with low flapping frequency considering the flapping frequency of the high speed robot in the table although thunniform swimmer hu et al 2015 has the best forward speed performance it has different propulsion type from carangiform and also its flapping frequency is bigger than the proposed robotic fish compared with carangiform robots the proposed robot swims with higher bl speed at low flapping frequency the selected flapping frequency is appropriate value for working space of rc servo motors used in propulsion mechanism it is known that the increase in the number of joints increases the turning maneuverability from this perspective the proposed robotic fish has an effective turning maneuverability with high turning rate and low turning radius considering figs 8 10 sn neurons produce soft transition membrane potentials that are more suitable for the biologically based structure rather than classic on off control outputs when the robot encounters the obstacle thus the proposed cpg method with connectionist level effectively realizes the sn based closed loop control this method also has middle computational complexity while the others have high complexity as a result the proposed biomimetic carangiform robotic fish has high cruising speed and high maneuverability performance to accomplish real world explorations and given missions according to experimental results and comparisons see in table 3 6 conclusion in this paper a sensory feedback closed loop control structure is designed and autonomous swimming control of the robotic fish prototype is presented the developed robotic fish possesses a biomimetic concept and it is designed considering the biological properties of a real carangiform fish the proposed control structure is composed of a biological based cpg a fuzzy logic sub controller and a fsm algorithm the cpg model is constructed as a unidirectional network of coupled lamprey oscillators with sensory neurons external stimulus from environment are obtained with these neurons in the cpg network a brainstem model with the mcu is designed to achieve the phase locked behavior the closed loop fuzzy logic controller behaves as a decision making mechanism to provide the autonomous swimming in addition fsm algorithm is adapted to determine the priority of tasks and perform multi tasks in the same cycle the whole control structure provides stable adaptable and smooth gait transitions according to the environmental changes in order to analyze the characteristic performance of the robotic fish open loop cpg control is firstly performed with three cases in the case 1 and 2 forward speed is analyzed according to the variation of the flapping frequency for three amplitude values and phase differences respectively in the case 3 three subcases are performed as linear turning speed angular turning speed and turning radius changes according to different offset variations at different flapping frequencies in the closed loop experiments the sensory feedback mechanism is firstly examined and observed as the success of sensory feedback mechanism the smooth and adaptable gait transitions are obtained for autonomous swimming three different scenarios are created by avoiding the obstacles of the robotic fish in the first scenario the robotic fish is positioned close to the upper left edge of the experimental pool and it follows the pool walls in the second scenario three circular obstacles are randomly placed to form the corners of a triangle to establish a natural environment the third scenario is designed to show the capability of the robotic fish to swim in narrow and hard to reach areas where people and classic underwater vehicles cannot after that encountering obstacles while taking on a primary task which is determined with yaw control are performed with two different reference angles it is observed from the experimental results that autonomous swimming performance of the robotic fish is excellent and yaw control performance is quite good even in the presence of obstacles the escape performance of the robot is also very fast all experiments show that the proposed closed loop control structure achieves the effective and robust responses for real world missions and explorations in the future work three dimensional trajectory tracking will be performed and swimming performance of the robotic fish will be analyzed in different watercourses conflicts of interest the authors

fuzzy logic autonomous swimming control 1 introduction in recent years autonomous underwater vehicle auv has become more and more important issue with increasing underwater researches and applications such as investigation of living forms fault detection in electricity and oil pipelines underwater archaeology coastline security and military operations as research areas and mission description of auvs are expanding specific abilities are needed for better performance however traditional auvs that have been developed based on classic propeller technology are severely missing in terms of efficiency maneuverability agility and noise ozmen koca et al 2016 niu and xu 2014 sfakiotakis 1999 yu et al 2016c yu et al 2016a zhao et al 2009 on the contrary underwater animals such as fish have amazing swimming abilities and they are superior to classic auvs in many respects thus biomimetic type of novel auvs namely robotic fish are needed including advanced swimming mechanisms for higher degree of precision maneuverability and high efficiency ay et al 2018 sfakiotakis et al 2016 wu et al 2014 yu et al 2016b similar to real fish an ideal biomimetic robotic fish should interact with its environment and control locomotion patterns to adapt to its dynamic circumstances these situations enable to operate in dynamic and unpredictable conditions and robotic fish can quickly response to the changes in underwater liu and hu 2006 w wang et al 2017 z wang et al 2017 therefore one of the critical key point in the design of a biomimetic robotic fish is the intelligent swimming to provide autonomous mobility the high maneuverability of fish not only ensure from their excellent body structures but also from natural control mechanisms which generate the transition of motion patterns zhang et al 2016 neurobiologists have discovered that locomotion control in vertebrate and invertebrate animals are generally provided with a special neural network structure described as central pattern generator cpg cpgs are the biological neuron circuits that can produce behavior based rhythmic oscillatory and robust output patterns according to biological view point cpg networks have three significant features as follow ijspeert 2008 li et al 2014c niu and xu 2014 m wang et al 2014 w wang et al 2014 i output patterns are produced without any receiving input signals ii cpgs create multiple coupled neural circuits with constructed synaptic relations iii cpg circuits can be controlled by multiple connections from motor cortex in the brain these synaptic connections are constructed directly or through the brainstem and sensory feedback control mechanism is provided to response the external stimulus considering these three features four main advantages are also arisen li et al 2014b 2015 yu et al 2014a i cpg outputs exhibit limit cycle behaviors to overcome the external disturbances ii complex dynamic model is not required and parameter modulation is simple while determining the locomotion pattern iii closed loop sensory feedback cpg models can be derived iv cpgs are very suitable for multi degrees of freedom motion control in bioinspired robotic systems therefore cpg based neural control methods have begun to be used with different control structures to obtain uncertain locomotor behaviors and cpgs have been widely studied to various bioinspired robots for intelligent robust stable adaptable and hierarchical control solutions hu et al 2014 li et al 2014b yu et al 2014b zhu et al 2018 biped robots liu et al 2016 robotic fish yu et al 2014a zhang et al 2016 multi legged robots ijspeert 2008 salamander robots ijspeert et al 2005 and snake like li et al 2014a w wang et al 2017 z wang et al 2017 wen et al 2015 robots have been controlled with different cpg models considering the locomotion control methods of previous autonomous robotic fish prototypes in the literature it can be seen that there are two general controls methods as sine based and cpg based niu and xu 2014 ozmen koca et al 2016 yu et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 since first robotic fish prototypes robotuna and robopike were developed in 1990s there have been designed various kinds of robotic fish and controlled with sine based methods liu and hu 2006 ryuh et al 2015 draper laboratory designed an autonomous underwater robot named vcuuv that could avoid the obstacles liu and hu 2004 yu et al developed different types of robotic fish to study swimming performances shao et al 2008 yu et al 2007 2005 in 2006 a kind of carangiform robotic fish namely g9 is designed by hu et al which imitate the carp swimming motion liu and hu 2006 however robotic fish prototype should swim with different and extraordinary locomotion patterns in order to achieve given tasks and also complicated hydrodynamic and kinematic models are needed to perform traditional control laws niu and xu 2014 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 therefore various cpg controllers have been designed and performed to bioinspired robotic fish over the past few decades wang et al demonstrated the ring coupled linearized amplitude controlled phase oscillators to generate forward and backward swimming motions m wang et al 2014 w wang et al 2014 wang and xie 2014 crespi studied the forward and turning motions of ostraciiform robotic fish with amplitude controlled phase oscillators lachat et al 2006 niu et al performed open loop swimming performance of anguilliform robotic fish with andronov hopf oscillators with three dimensional ring models niu et al 2014 yu et al realized various cpg models to obtain three dimensional swimming patterns wu et al 2015 yu et al 2016c yu et al 2014a 2013 zhang et al examined agile swimming motions with hopf oscillators and studied three dimensional motion control to avoid obstacles zhang et al 2016 many researchers have performed different experiments to validate the adaptability of the cpg based locomotion control methods ding et al 2009 li et al 2015 niu et al 2014 wang et al 2013 yu et al 2013 but the closed loop sensory feedback cpg methods have been less studied due to complexity of biological based models and difficulty of real time implementations closed loop sensory feedback cpgs exhibit robust stable and adaptable motor outputs depending on the external stimulus incoming from sensory neurons this type of cpg control provides the adaptation of locomotor swimming patterns according to dynamic and unexpected conditions in environment the main contributions of this paper are summarized as below to develop an effective sensory

rather than high complexity cpg methods to perform appropriate cruising routes by using an intelligent control approach which has significant role both for combining data from onboard sensors and for making the right decision by synthesizing these data to enable robot locomotion to provide proper solutions with limitless intermediate cruising routes in complex real world explorations in the case of robot is faced with more than one obstacle at the same time by fuzzy control approach the developed biomimetic robotic fish i rof swims like a carangiform type with two link propulsive tail mechanism the control mechanism is composed of a biologically based cpg model and a fuzzy logic sub controller to generate stable adaptable and smooth gait transitions the cpg model is designed as a network of coupled lamprey oscillators with sensory neuron mechanism in the cpg network each oscillator only couples with a previous oscillator using unidirectional inhibitory synapses and a brainstem model is constructed to determine the phase locked behavior in order to provide autonomous swimming a closed loop fuzzy logic controller is also designed as a brain model finally a finite state

prototype can be found in our previous works ay et al 2018 ozmen koca et al 2018 3 autonomous locomotion control with sensory feedback 3 1 cpg model biological cpgs in the spinal cord are neural oscillators that generate rhythmic muscle activation patterns such as walking running crawling and swimming moreover cpgs exhibit robust stable adaptable and rich dynamic output activities yu et al 2016a zhang et al 2016 from biological point of view these neural circuit models are well suited to locomotion control of the robotic fish and smooth transitions of different rhythmic locomotion patterns can be generated according to environmental conditions in the field of engineering cpg models are summarized in three levels as biophysical connectionist and abstract the connectionist level attracts attention with its simple and realistic biologically based neuron models ijspeert 2008 in order to design an effective autonomous locomotion control of the robotic fish prototype three criteria should be considered first criteria is to adapt easy parameter modulation this feature provides several kinds of swimming gaits easily second is that the constructed cpg network should include sensory feedback mechanism in order to react against external stimulus last criteria is that the cpg network should combine onboard sensory information to provide high maneuverability capabilities in each complicated or unstable environments in order to response these mentioned criteria of effective autonomous locomotion control a connectionist level cpg network with sensory feedback mechanism is provided for proposed robotic fish although there is feedback input in abstract level cpg models the effect of these inputs on cpg outputs is similar to the on off response in other words they do not exhibit filtered soft transition properties lamprey is one of the earliest swimming vertebrate which is inspired to develop a new cpg approach by li li et al 2014c this approach includes connectionist level properties with its rich dynamic oscillatory activities and also it satisfies combining intelligent structures with locomotion control in this study the framework of the constructed artificial lamprey neural spinal cord structure is presented in order to provide aimed criteria of effective autonomous locomotion control for the developed robotic fish prototype the constructed cpg model produces rhythmic outputs and amplitude frequency phase difference and offset of the output can be easily modulated the cpg circuit consists of a motor control unit mcu and two oscillators which generate motion of the tail links in fig 2 neural cpg oscillator is given and divided into two symmetric segments each segment has four different interneurons named crossed interneuron cin lateral interneuron lin excitatory interneuron ein motor neuron mn and sensory neuron sn the mathematical model of an oscillator is express as follows 1 τ x c i n i x c i n i k 1 n w i k s c i n i k 2 τ x l i n i x l i n i k 1 n w i k s l i n i k j 1 n w j j 1 c l i n j 1 3 x e i n i a 1 e x c i n a 2 4 τ x m n i x m n i β a k 1 n w i k s m n i k 5 y j max x m n 1 0 max x m n 2 0 here i is the left and right segments of the oscillator j is the oscillator number and k represents the number of neurons in the oscillator x i is the membrane potential y j is the oscillator output parameters τ and a are the period and amplitude respectively β is the offset and it is assigned opposite values to the two mns to resume oscillation w ik and w ij are the synaptic weights of the interneuron and oscillator s i gives the membrane potential of the presynaptic neuron and c j with w ij give the neurotransmitter potential to the postsynaptic neuron top line of the subscript defines the opposite segment in the same oscillator in the designed sensory feedback mechanism each sn is defined as below 6 τ r e s x s n i x s n i p λ i f λ λ τ f x s n i x s n i o t h e r w i s e where x sn i is the membrane potential of the sn τ res is the response time constant of the stimulus τ f is the fall time constant of the stimulus p is the correction coefficient of the stimulus λ is the external stimulus amount respectively λ is the threshold value the threshold value assigns whether the response should be generated when the external stimulus is important because in other cases sn is zero it should be noted that each sn emits excitatory synapses to all mns mcu behaves as a brainstem to determine the phase difference of the links and it is designed in the same form but there are two different synapses w l r w r l from its own ein to lin w l r α α γ and w r l γ α γ α and γ are the phase coefficients of mcu and the range of these parameters is 0 1 in addition sns are not use and equal to zero in the mcu in the oscillator model a unidirectional inhibitory chained cpg circuit is established to generate the rhythmic oscillatory outputs 3 2 autonomous fuzzy swimming control using an intelligent control approach has significant role both for combining data from onboard sensors and for making the right cruise decision by synthesizing these data to enable robot locomotion developed robotic fish prototype includes two feedback perceptions with a 10 dof imu and three infrared sensors the evaluation of these sensor data are challenging fuzzy control approach provides proper solutions with limitless intermediate cruising routes in complex real world explorations in the case of robot is faced with more than one obstacle at the same time for this propose fuzzy based autonomous and yaw control structures are developed with sensory feedback cpg network the robotic fish which has a motion combination with fsm can autonomously swim depending on the sensory feedback information received from the left right and front infrared sensors in the nose the autonomous closed loop block diagram of the robotic fish is shown in fig 3 the figure also includes the fuzzy yaw control block discussed in the next section here ψ is the yaw angle of the robotic fish according to earth fixed frame the linear measurement ranges of the distance data obtained from the sensors are determined as 6 80 cm the position of the front sensor is centered in the same direction as the x axis and the left and right sensors are positioned with the front sensor at angular intervals of 45 s l s r and s f are the infrared sensors in the left right and front position of the nose respectively at the same time obstacle scanning angle of each sensor is determined as approximately 40 the percentages of the obstacle data from the sensors constitute the input variables of the fuzzy controller at the fuzzy controller output λ parameter of the sns is determined at the output of sn the parameter β which is the offset value of the cpg model is obtained thus depending on the distance of the static or dynamic obstacles the β value is generated according to the motion of the robotic fish this sensory feedback control structure allows that the robotic fish prototype can swim in autonomous mode with avoiding the obstacles values of the cpg parameters are determined as a 1 20 a 2 20 τ 0 0779 α 0 8 γ 0 τ res 0 4 τ f 0 1095 and p 2 according to the closed loop sensory feedback system mamdani type fuzzy controller is designed a general mamdani fuzzy controller is composed of four parts such as the fuzzifier rule base inference mechanism and defuzzifier three infrared sensors i e s l s r and s f are mounted on the robot and the inputs of the controller are determined as the sensor values the defuzzifier output is the amount of stimulus λ in the designed controller rule base includes the if then rules as follows 7 r j i f x 1 i s m 1 j a n d x n i s m n j t h e n y i s q j j 1 2 m here x s l s f s r t ω x and y ω y are the linguistic variables of inputs and output r j indicates the jth rule m j q j are the fuzzy sets and depend on the μ m j x μ q j y m is also the rule number the fuzzy controller executes a nonlinear mapping from ω x to ω y according to this mapping output surfaces for three inputs are given in fig 4 in the defuzzifier the centroid method is performed and can be expressed as 8 y k j 1 m max μ q j y y j j 1 m max μ q j y here yj is the crisp output of the jth rule finally inputs of the controller can be determined with the following equation 9 s i γ m i v i s b i k i l f r here v s is the sensor voltage m is the linearized slope and b is the line function constant k is a positive constant that determines the calibration point and is set to 4 for gp2y0a21yk0f γ is the percentile constant which is determined with the ratio of measurement distance it is noted that m 1 m and b 1 b the input and output membership functions are given in fig 5 and the rule base of the fuzzy controller for the variation of output according to the input variables is presented in table 1 it is noted that the autonomous swimming control rules are determined by considering the control accuracy and the characteristics of the robotic fish for the analysis of the sensory feedback closed loop control structure random obstacles are generated for 30 s mechanical filtered distance measurements from the infrared sensors which are also the input variables of the fuzzy controller are given in fig 6 depending on the state of the obstacles change of the external stimulus λ which is obtained from the fuzzy controller output is presented in fig 7 fig 7 also shows the membrane potential of the sn against the external stimulus λ produced at the fuzzy controller output this output is also β parameter of the cpg model the cpg outputs produced against this input variable are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that oscillator outputs exhibit rhythmic robust adaptable and rapid dynamic output activities in addition outputs are quite smooth to generate oscillatory swimming motions 4 experimental results as shown in fig 9 an experimental system is established to examine the robotic fish prototype in a real experimental pool pool dimensions are 200 cm wide 300 cm long and 66 cm depth the system also includes one sony fdr ax53 4k top camera two gopro hero5 black edition 4k underwater action cameras and one user computer with i7 2 4 ghz processor 8 gb ddr4 ram and 2 gb graphics card experimental images are recorded at 3840x2160 p 30fps and 2704x1520 p 30fps with top camera and underwater cameras respectively the completely experimental system can be decomposed into an environment an image capturing subsystem a communication subsystem a data processing and a robotic fish subsystem including sensory feedback controller 4 1 characteristic performance of the robotic fish in order to analyze the characteristic performance of the robotic fish open loop cpg control is performed with different input parameters in these analyzes it is assumed that there is no external stimulus the open loop block scheme of the robotic fish is given in fig 10 input variables are the link angles of the robotic fish θ 1 θ 2 flapping frequency f depending on the period τ offset β and phase difference coefficients α γ the unidirectional left and right synaptic weights between all oscillators are equalized to 1 phase difference φ 12 are determined with α γ and γ is fixed at 0 2 α is only altered in the interval of 0 1 various parameters of robotic fish such as linear and angular speed variations corresponding to flapping frequency and β offset changes are examined with 84 real experiments within 20 days in the pool environment to obtain characteristics of the robotic fish these experiments are performed with different three cases case 1 forward speed change according to the variation of the flapping frequency for three amplitude values case 2 forward speed change according to the variation of the flapping frequency for three phase differences case 3 includes three subcases a linear turning speed change according to different offset variation at different flapping frequencies b angular turning speed change according to offset variation at different flapping frequencies c turning radius change according to offset variation at different flapping frequencies fig 11 presents the experimental results for three different cases using the determined parameters of the robotic fish in case 1 experiments with the cpg parameters of β 0 α 0 8 and φ 12 45 for three different amplitude values a 1 10 a 2 20 a l 20 a 2 20 a 1 20 a 2 30 are performed as the increase of the flapping frequency increases the driving force of the tail the forward speed increases proportional to the flapping frequency the reason for choosing a maximum of 30 of amplitude is that the mechanical limit value of rotation angle of each joint is 45 in the experiments the limit value has not been reached in order to obtain stable motion and not cause stress in case 1 the maximum forward speed of 0 4224 m s or in other words a forward speed of 0 8448 bl s depending on the body length bl is reached at 2 hz in case 2 the analysis of the forward speed changes for different amplitude values is reexamined for different phase values in the same experimental conditions analyzes according to three different phase values are performed with a 1 20 a 2 20 β 0 and α 0 5 as the phase difference between the tail joints of the fish increases the driving force produced by the tail decreases and the maximum speed value 0 4258 m s or 0 8516 bl s is reached at 60 where the phase value is minimum case 3 includes the analysis of the turning motion of the robotic fish for a 1 10 a 2 20 α 0 8 and φ 12 45 in case 3 a the linear turning speed maintains approximately constant values at fixed frequency despite of the offset variation angular turning speed also increases with offset increase for constant amplitude and frequency values in case 3 b also as seen in cases 3 a and b the linear and angular turning speeds of the fish increase as the fish flapping frequency increases according to case 3 results the maximum linear velocity is 0 3266 m s at 2 hz and the maximum angular turning speed is obtained as 0 62 rad s at 2 hz in case 3 c two different results about the turning radius of the robotic fish are reached the first result is that the turning radius for the fixed flapping frequency is inversely proportional to the increase of the offset value the second result is also that the turning radius for the fixed offset value is greater at lower frequencies from case 3 c the minimum turning radius of the robotic fish is 0 4387 m at 1 hz 4 2 closed loop autonomous swimming closed loop experiments are examined with 56 real experiments within 20 days in the pool environment and the closed loop control parameters are given in table 2 for autonomous swimming experiments three different scenarios are created by avoiding the obstacles of the robotic fish for these scenarios the video images obtained from the top camera are transferred to the kinovea program and the paths of the region marked on the robotic fish are found after that video images analyzed in kinovea are converted to sequential snapshots according to the sampling periods determined in matlab environment in the first scenario the robotic fish is positioned close to the upper left edge of the experimental pool the robotic fish performs the forward motion in the forward direction determined by the decision mechanism and the combination of motion while the front and right sensors detect and control the pool sides without hitting the edges thus robotic fish can swim with avoiding the obstacles and move with u shape from the starting to the destination point experimental images of the first scenario are presented for 16 88 s in fig 12 a in fig 12 b robotic fish trajectory is given obtained with kinovea in order to prove the edge following performance in the second scenario three circular obstacles are randomly placed inside the pool to form the corners of a triangle thus a scenario where the robotic fish is faced with random swimming motions and where there are similar obstacles that are likely to be encountered in a natural environment is formed experimental images of the second scenario are presented for 7 83 s in fig 13 the third scenario is designed to show the ability of the robotic fish prototype to move in narrow and hard to reach areas where people and classic underwater vehicles cannot for this purpose the robotic fish is forced to pass through a narrow area created by three circular obstacles without hitting them experimental images of the third scenario are presented for 8 44 s in fig 14 thus autonomous swimming experiments of the robotic fish prototype are performed for three different scenarios created with the different obstacle sequences according to these experiments it is observed that the designed control structure is quite effective for the robotic fish prototype these results have created a foundation to face in a natural environment in the light of the robotic fish it can be seen from these results that a preliminary study is performed for the robotic fish to swim in a natural environment in the future 4 3 multi task swimming while any task defined by user input is carried out by the robotic fish prototype in the case of a possible obstacle the priority task of the prototype is to pass the obstacle without hitting after the obstacle is exceeded the robotic fish should continue to perform the task given by the user thus the robot provides the response to the obstacles that it may encounter in the natural environment while performing the assigned task in fig 15 a fsm included in the closed loop system is designed to decide to priority of user defined tasks or tasks required by the autonomous swimming this structure provides to perform multi tasks in the same cycle in order to analyze priority task success two different scenarios which include yaw control as user defined task and allow the robotic fish to encounter obstacles are created in the fsm diagram d 0 represents the initial state of the robotic fish d 1 represents the forward swimming motion d 2 defines the autonomous swimming control with avoiding obstacles and d 3 is the user defined yaw control task values on cycle indicate how the transition between each other depends on the conditions output membership functions are determined with the same output functions of the autonomous fuzzy controller in fig 15 ψ ref is the reference yaw angle eψ is the yaw angle error and δψ is the variation of yaw angle it is noted that the yaw control rules are determined by considering the control accuracy and the characteristics of the robotic fish obtained from open loop analyzes furthermore ir parameter which gives the vectorial value of the obstacle distance defines whether there is any obstacle information in the infrared sensors of the robotic fish the case of ir 0 indicates that the fish face an obstacle this parameter is defined by equation 10 as follows 10 i r s l 2 s r 2 s f 2 experimental yaw control scenarios with obstacle avoidance are performed for two different reference yaw angles 30 45 and presented with the time dependent variations in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively as seen in fig 16 the yaw angle of the robotic fish encountered an obstacle to the right of the swimming direction in 2 22 s which is the time before reaching the desired reference input value it is oriented again towards the value of yaw angle which should be reached with the first given task after it pass over the obstacle approximately in 3 s it remains at the reference input value 30 with small oscillations at the end of approximately 8 2 s in the second scenario shown in fig 17 the yaw angle of the robotic fish encountered an obstacle to the right of the swimming direction in 2 35 s which is the time before reaching the desired reference input value it is directed to the reference yaw angle with the first given task again after exceeding this obstacle within approximately 2 5 s it remains at the reference input value with small oscillations at the end of about 4 8 s when the results for these two scenarios are examined it is clearly seen that the yaw control performance of the robotic fish is quite good even in the presence of obstacles it is also studied that the escape performance of the robot is very fast according to the all experiments the proposed closed loop control structure achieves the effective and robust responses and this control structure is very applicable and suitable for real world missions and explorations 5 comparisons and discussions among underwater vehicle types fish like underwater robots are able to swim with over 80 percent efficiency while classic rotary propellers move with approximately 40 50 percent efficiency in ichthyology body and or caudal fin bcf is the most widely used swimming mode because of its grater thrust force excellent mobility and high acceleration abilities bcf swimming mode includes five undulatory propulsion types as anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform thunniform and ostraciiform sfakiotakis 1999 carangiform swimmers are one of the most widely used models in biomimetic underwater robot design the reason of the usage of carangiform is related to the reduction of hydrodynamics effects and the ease of propulsion mechanism design in these regards table 3 is given for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system by comparing the other cpg based biomimetic underwater robot approaches in order to compare the maneuvering performance of the robots in the table the parameters from the second column to the eighth column should be evaluated together for instance when evaluating speed parameters the flapping frequency should also be considered furthermore since the physical properties of each robot such as size weight and etc are different from each other body length bl speed is more realistic in defining speed parameters the rest of columns are significant to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed cpg with the designed robot model considering computational complexity and adaptation of sensory feedback for closed loop control performance cpg level also defines how much biological features of living forms can be imparted to a biomimetic robot it can be clearly seen that the proposed robotic fish has high swimming speed performance with low flapping frequency considering the flapping frequency of the high speed robot in the table although thunniform swimmer hu et al 2015 has the best forward speed performance it has different propulsion type from carangiform and also its flapping frequency is bigger than the proposed robotic fish compared with carangiform robots the proposed robot swims with higher bl speed at low flapping frequency the selected flapping frequency is appropriate value for working space of rc servo motors used in propulsion mechanism it is known that the increase in the number of joints increases the turning maneuverability from this perspective the proposed robotic fish has an effective turning maneuverability with high turning rate and low turning radius considering figs 8 10 sn neurons produce soft transition membrane potentials that are more suitable for the biologically based structure rather than classic on off control outputs when the robot encounters the obstacle thus the proposed cpg method with connectionist level effectively realizes the sn based closed loop control this method also has middle computational complexity while the others have high complexity as a result the proposed biomimetic carangiform robotic fish has high cruising speed and high maneuverability performance to accomplish real world explorations and given missions according to experimental results and comparisons see in table 3 6 conclusion in this paper a sensory feedback closed loop control structure is designed and autonomous swimming control of the robotic fish prototype is presented the developed robotic fish possesses a biomimetic concept and it is designed considering the biological properties of a real carangiform fish the proposed control structure is composed of a biological based cpg a fuzzy logic sub controller and a fsm algorithm the cpg model is constructed as a unidirectional network of coupled lamprey oscillators with sensory neurons external stimulus from environment are obtained with these neurons in the cpg network a brainstem model with the mcu is designed to achieve the phase locked behavior the closed loop fuzzy logic controller behaves as a decision making mechanism to provide the autonomous swimming in addition fsm algorithm is adapted to determine the priority of tasks and perform multi tasks in the same cycle the whole control structure provides stable adaptable and smooth gait transitions according to the environmental changes in order to analyze the characteristic performance of the robotic fish open loop cpg control is firstly performed with three cases in the case 1 and 2 forward speed is analyzed according to the variation of the flapping frequency for three amplitude values and phase differences respectively in the case 3 three subcases are performed as linear turning speed angular turning speed and turning radius changes according to different offset variations at different flapping frequencies in the closed loop experiments the sensory feedback mechanism is firstly examined and observed as the success of sensory feedback mechanism the smooth and adaptable gait transitions are obtained for autonomous swimming three different scenarios are created by avoiding the obstacles of the robotic fish in the first scenario the robotic fish is positioned close to the upper left edge of the experimental pool and it follows the pool walls in the second scenario three circular obstacles are randomly placed to form the corners of a triangle to establish a natural environment the third scenario is designed to show the capability of the robotic fish to swim in narrow and hard to reach areas where people and classic underwater vehicles cannot after that encountering obstacles while taking on a primary task which is determined with yaw control are performed with two different reference angles it is observed from the experimental results that autonomous swimming performance of the robotic fish is excellent and yaw control performance is quite good even in the presence of obstacles the escape performance of the robot is also very fast all experiments show that the proposed closed loop control structure achieves the effective and robust responses for real world missions and explorations in the future work three dimensional trajectory tracking will be performed and swimming performance of the robotic fish will be analyzed in different watercourses conflicts of interest the authors

through 15 mm enhancements and it was enhanced from 90 up to 150 mm through 30 mm enhancements in order to observe effect of the gap on flow characteristics moreover another important parameter was the submersion level that ranged from 7 5 until 60 mm through 7 5 mm increments hd d 0 25 2 during the experiments five hundred instantaneous images were used in order to obtain reynolds stress correlation corresponding streamline topology and the mean velocity vector field the investigation represented that the alternative cylinder attenuates the dimension of the wake zone in accordance with l d 0 location the wake zone obviously happens between tandem cylinders at the starting of l d 1 location when the space between tandem cylinders deepens the dimension of the wake zone rises keywords flow around the horizontal cylinder particle image velocimetry wake structure tandem cylinders 1 introduction eddies back of the bluff body creates a primary problem in fluid dynamics owing to geometrical primitiveness furthermore it has a key instrument role in different fields of engineering and science by virtue of its practical significance these fields cover numerous industries such as civil engineering mechanical and aerospace engineering power industries and undersea technologies grasp of the flow construction can ensure different remedies for above mentioned fields a great amount of researchers examined on the flow construction around cylinders positioned at vertically in shallow and deep water wolanski et al 1984 ingram and chu 1987 akilli et al 2004 2005 2008 chen and jirka 1995 on the other hand some other researchers conducted studies on the flow construction around cylinders placed at horizontal cylinders cokgor and avci 2001 teh et al 2003 akoz et al 2010 kahraman et al 2012 the forces on single horizontal cylinder were investigated by cokgor and avci 2001 they represented that the more submersion ratio raised the more drag and lift coeffients reduced akoz et al 2010 examined the flow characteristics of the single horizontal cylinder positioned on the surface boundary by means of piv technique the results displayed that concurrence of cylinder and bed surface improved the submersion mechanism hydrodynamically even within a wake zone which it was diminished in dimension in longitudinal destination basis on reynolds number the flow structure around single horizontal cylinder placed coincidently on a free plane in the shallow water through piv technique was studied by kahraman et al 2012 the influence of the reynolds and froude numbers on flow construction was examined in their study the results showed that changing of reattachment position of braked flow to the free plane violently linked on the diameter of cylinder and was influenced with the froude number tumen ozdil and akilli özdiln f akilli 2015 examined the flow structure around a horizontal cylinder experimentally to observe the influence of the submersion ratio of cylinder they analyzed the instantaneous and time averaged velocity vector areas in the wake zone utilizing particle image velocimetry they concluded that the size of jet like flow velocity raised with the increment of submersion ratio triantafyllou et al triantafyllou and dimas 1989 analytically examined the structures of the flow passing a cylinder for half submersion level the results revealed that the adjacent wake subjected to a convective sheridan et al 1995 investigated the flow construction of a cylinder around open plane two appropriate wake conditions were viewed they were viewed to have restricted uniformity for this reason the flow structure was categorized as metastable tryggvason et al 1991 indicated that production of a secondary swirl at the plane reduced due to the moving of surface intensity to restrict robust surface bending the reduced production of the secondary vorticity may modify the mutual effect of vortices with a open plane sheridan et al 1997 researched flow structures for single cylinder positioned near at free surface they concluded the existence of three situations the first one was its extension to the free plane the second one was its extension to the cylinder and the third one was a middle situation in between the flow around single horizontal cylinder that was located coincidently on a free and partially immersed plane was examined by hatipoglu and avci 2003 they concluded that the range of departure region diminished in parallel with the increase of submersion ratio tsutsui 2012 examined the flow behavior around tandem circular cylinders and oscillating fluid force moving on cylinders the first parameter was the gap ratio for this study he also used reynolds number as the second parameter he searched out that the shear layer separated from the lower and upper parts of the initial cylinder by turns reattached to the lower and upper parts of the downstream cylinder the results showed that the interval flow was forced reverse by the flow where it was attached in former position of the second cylinder he concluded that the stage variation between the oscillating lift and drag coefficient of the first and second cylinders were t t 5 16 and 3 16 respectively singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 numerically observed flows around tandem circular cylinders for a series of reynolds numbers in changing space sizes at a low reynolds number their analyses included the governing equations on an unconstructed arranged mesh by means of a second order certain finite volume technique they observed that flow area was notably affected by the space between reynolds number and cylinders sumner et al sumner et al 1999 analyzed on an impulsively initiated flow area for tandem cylinders utilizing particle image velocimetry piv they performed their test for longitudinal pitch proportion series of l d 1 3 and for reynolds numbers ranging from re 1200 to 3800 when the cylinders were in contact three dissimilar kinds of fluid behaviors basis on l d were determined a bluff body motion forced streamwise development and side enlargement of the space recursive regions at small and medium l d and free generation of excursive regions alike to sole repulsively initiated cylinder at greater l d wang et al 2015 investigated the flow characteristics around two tandem cylinders located parallel and close to a plane wall in this study reynolds number was selected as 6300 according to cylinder diameter furthermore the space height to cylinder diameter ratio g and the cylinder center to center gap ratio l were altered from 0 15 to 2 and 1 5 to 6 respectively according to piv test results it was observed that the flow was affected with the change of g and l values for g 0 3 the flow can be called as vortex shedding suppression regime for 0 3 g 1 the flow can be called as intermediate gap regime and for g 1 the flow can be called as large gap regime moreover for 1 l 2 the flow can be called as extended body regime for 2 l 4 the flow can be re attachment regime and for l 4 the flow can be impinging regime sanaati and kato 2014 studied the closeness interference and synchronization between tandem flexible cylinders they used two identical flexible cylinders and they were examined for two distinct separation distances according to the results in a small center to center separation space as 2 75 diameters there is no upper branch in the initial cross flow lock in zone on the above cylinder with the increment of first separation both cylinders showed amplitude replies parallel with isolated cylinder furthermore for decreasing velocity serie of 1 82 ur 5 1 robust stage concur was observed they were also concluded that for a departure of 5 5 diameters the wakes were vigorously concurred therein the zone of great cylinder oscillation extent as 2 91 ur 5 1 deng et al 2019 examined a numerical model using navier stokes equations to associate free plane waves around two horizontal cylinders they used the volume of fluid approach to investigate the flow characteristics they concluded that the numerical results were in consistency with previous results obtained from experimental studies moreover the vertical gap between the cylinders has a direct influence on the hydrodynamic powers at the below location whilst for the above location it can be affected only for small vertical spacing shao et al 2019 performed a numerical study with tandem square cylinders at reynolds number having 100 they investigated the effect of the vortex stimulated swing and gap rate between the cylinders to examine the effects of the parameters four distinct systems setup were evaluated as situation 1 two stable tandem square cylinders situation 2 simply the trailing square cylinder rotation situation 3 simply the leading square cylinder rotation and situation 4 two square cylinders rotation according to the results as in situation 1 and situation 2 fixed leading cylinder situation the spacing ratio has significant effect for situation 3 and 4 rotational leading cylinder situation the genesis of vortex shedding in the space zone was occurred with a smaller crucial gap rate compared to situation 1 and 2 qu et al 2017 studied the effect of tsunami waves on cylinders to simulate the inshore and offshore infrastructures they studied numerical models on tsunami like waves around cylinders to show the distinctions between solitary and tsunami waves they chose wave height cylinder spacing distance and submersion depth as considered parameters they concluded that tsunami like waves can created nearly 16 and 10 higher vertical and horizontal burdens compared to solitary waves respectively moreover both tsunami and solitary like wave burdens increased with the increment of wave height xu et al xu et al 2019 employed experimental research about flow induced vibration for two cylinders located in tandem they selected four different gap ratios as 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 and they used two imaginary spring damping vibrators to carry out the experiments the obtained results referred that the flow excited oscillation structures of the upstream cylinder are in parallel with the results obtained from a sole cylinder for gap rates of 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 with the diminished velocity does not overlap 12 furthermore for spacing ratio of 1 57 the flow induced vibration reply of the upstream cylinder in the tandem cylinders was obtained distinct from that of the isolated cylinder d souza et al d souza et al 2016 presented a study about flow characteristics around two tandem cylinders throughout a acting plane wall they chose the spectral element approach to carry out the models in reynolds number of 200 to show the effect of moving wall gap ratio and longitudinal center to center separation was varied between 0 2 to 5 0 and 1 5 to 8 0 respectively they concluded that beforetime transmission from intermediate to co shedding order was observed for gap ratio of 0 5 moreover similar to freestream situation of tandem arrangement the existence of plane acting wall created shielding influence of the upstream cylinder in mean lift and drag coefficients of the downstream cylinder at gap ratio of 0 5 more et al 2015 studied an experimental research about flow features around two similar tandem square cylinders in the study the downstream cylinder was held stationary and the upstream cylinder was vibrated in the transverse destination furthermore reynolds number was selected as 295 to show the influence of the spacing ratio on flow characteristics the spacing ratios are altered between 1 5 and 5 they concluded that there was a significant influence gap between the cylinders on flow construction and vortex shedding moreover there was a crucial space that vortex shedding of the upstream cylinder was prevented raiola et al 2016 investigated an experimental study about near wake of two tandem cylinders under crossflow with additional ground interference according to the cylinder diameters reynold number picked as 4 9 103 in this study three different longitudinal pitch ratios and wall gap ratios were selected as 1 5 3 6 and 0 3 1 3 respectively according to the obtained results when the wall gap ratio was 1 the ground effected the flow area with dissymmetry in the normal von karman wake furthermore as the wall gap ratio was diminished to 0 3 a prolonged low speed zone occurred in close downstream of the cylinders li et al 2018 performed a numerical analysis with smagorinsky sub grid scale model in large eddy simulations for the flow around two tandem cylinders in order to show the effect of horizontal plane wall space ratios were varied as 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 and also pitch ratios were selected as 2 and 5 they performed six sets of simulations in reynolds number of 1 31 104 basis on the obtained yields for pitch ratios the wall closeness had a diminishing influence on the mean drag coefficient of the upstream cylinder moreover in pitch ratio of 2 a squares cavity like flow occurred among the cylinders and the flow excursive inside the cavity an increment in the unsteadiness of the swirl flow generation is observed in the downstream and upstream zones of the pipeline bearman and zdravkovich 1978 implemented a research on the flow construction around a horizontally positioned cylinder they revealed that eddy was compressed for the space ratio with smaller than 0 3 they demonstrated that the karman generation can be degradation considering the fact that cylinder is located at close the wall as a pipeline is located on an erodible bed the pipeline is suspended and erosion occurs along the pipeline large eddies brings out extra powers on the pipeline due to the scouring process because of the spreading of the scouring processes the pipe is buried the above mentioned process relies on the hydrodynamic attitude of the flow along the pipeline for this reason examination of flow structures along the pipeline becomes significant there are restricted data concerning the flow structures around horizontal circular cylinders located especially far from the bottom and free planes in shallow water the flow construction around horizontal tandem cylinders was presented for various height ranges from hd d 0 25 up to 2 in this study the goal of the research is firstly to show the flow construction around tandem horizontal cylinders for various heights in the close to wake zone furthermore this study includes detailed examination on the wake zone for the tandem horizontal cylinders to examine complex swirl flow construction 2 material and methods in the present study all of the tests were exerted in a closed water duct the water duct carried out experiments were 750 mm in depth 1000 mm in width and 8000 mm in length water was moved into an emplacement room from inside a honeycomb part a pump which was performed to circulate the water and was operated by an electric motor having changing speed controllers to form the average flow in the experiment part the analysis of the flow structure around tandem horizontal cylinders was performed for different submersion height rate the section of submersion part of the cylinder from the open plane in the research the overall tests were performed in the shallow water of which level hw was 60 mm moreover cylinders diameter having constant value was 30 mm lastly the experiment part was built of plexiglas sheet having 15 mm thickness the demonstration of test setup was given in fig 1 the overall studies were taken under a fully developed flow therefore the cylinder was located in 4000 mm away from the start of the channel during tests the free stream velocity was u 167 mm s that indicated reynolds number basis on diameter of cylinder of red 5000 the studies were carried out for tandem horizontal cylinders having gap with l d ranged from 0 to 5 in the water channel the piv technique was utilized to evaluate instantaneous velocity vectors in a zone lighted by laser sheet dantec piv system was utilized to conduct velocity vector measurements the flow area lighting was ensured using two nd being yag having energy yield of 120 mj strikes laser of a wavelength of 532 nm dantec dynamics that was managing the data obtaining was employed to concur the view reception and laser unit the measurements were done in two distinct planes to completely monitor the excursive flow zone by particle image velocimetry technique an 8 bit cross correlation charge coupled apparatus ccd camera with 1600 pixels x 1200 pixels resolution and accoutered with a nikon af micro 60 f 2 8 d lenses was used to take images 32 32 pixels rectangular influential query windows were performed for the image processing to observe an instantaneous velocity field totally 3168 99 32 velocity vectors were acquired during the experiments the time interval between the laser sheet thickness and pulses enlightening the measurement plane were 1750 and about 2 mm respectively after the imaging process erroneous vectors were extracted and modified utilizing interpolation among surrounding vectors in the post processing using displacement vector area velocity vectors were computed the swirl models of the wake were computed via the velocity area utilizing a finite difference scheme circulation and streamlines were acquired using the velocity data the total area of image was 180 60 mm2 while patterns of instantaneous particle views total 500 views were obtained at a rate of 15 hz the uncertainty in velocity relative to depth averaged velocity was estimated as 2 for this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 interpretation of time averaged results the flow structure with the inclusion of reynolds stress uv u 2 corresponding to streamline topology ψ and the time averaged velocity vectors v for bare cylinder situation was demonstrated in fig 2 the cylinder was submerged in shallow water from hd d 0 25 to hd d 2 with gradually 0 25 of increments to examine the effect of the various rates of water height as it can be observed in the fig 2 for hd d 2 condition a improving focal f and a main excursive bubble f1 were sighted as implied by kahraman et al 2012 the main excursive bubble extends in a great field in the swirl zone the positive values are determined by rigid lines whereas negative values are determined by hyphen lines in the last colon of fig 2 the reynolds stress uv u 2 contours represented in the last colon demonstrates that there is a negative form appearing for hd d 2 situation whereas positive form begins to happen because of the free plane influence for hd d 1 75 configuration the streamline topology ψ presented in the middle colon indicates that a discreted flow zone becomes at the downstream of the cylinder with division plane beginning from both parts of the cylinder reasoning two foci f downstream of the cylinder for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations owing to the shear layer at the top part of the cylinder the other focal appears for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations as it may be seen in velocity vectors v there is a low velocity zone that demonstrates the wake region at merely downstream of the cylinder for theses situation viz the velocity vectors in the outer of the swirl zone are larger than these in the swirl zone the considerable back flow happens within this wake zone for these situations the time averaged streamline topology ψ obviously notices that greater extended wake zone happens for hd d 1 25 situation compared to the hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situation for this reason saddle spot position of crossing streamlines occurs later for hd d 1 25 situation checked against to the situations of hd d 1 75 saddle spot refers to the concurrence of the departure lines viz shear layers arising on each part of the cylinder unite in adjacent zone to the cylinder and hereby swirl flow zone starts to be lost however on account of the negligible influence of free and bottom planes at hd d 1 5 situation the minimum swirl diameter is monitored the last colon points out that important polarities are centralized at a space of nearly one cylinder diameter downstream at the basis of the cylinder the mentioned outcome complies with experiment that was presented in deep water by akilli et al 2004 reynolds stress intensification uv u 2 happen at close of the cylinder basis when the flow passes downstream the intensification of reynolds stress uv u 2 firstly enhances attains its top value of 0 09 and then begins reducing moreover the well characterized reynolds stress uv u2 model owing to surges in the shear layers a great intensified reynolds stress uv u2 zone being adjacent to the basis of the cylinder occur due to the entrainment of free stream flow into swirl zone on the other hand for hd d 1 0 75 0 5 situations a well portrait eddy happens at the cylinder downstream a significant investigation is that there is a division in the front part of the cylinder for hd d 1 and 0 75 situations as shown by akoz et al akoz 2012 when the stagnation spot acts towards the top part of the cylinder a great size of the velocity vectors v takes place through the shear layers therefore it induces a disturbance at the free plane of the flow for this reason a limited size focal f emerges and preserves its asset for only hd d 1 0 75 situations and be lost for hd d 0 25 and 0 5 situations the streamline topology ψ shown in the middle colon clearly indicates that the departure is a result of the submersion grade of the cylinder in shallow water however boundary layer at the lower part of the cylinder prolongs upwards downstream as the hd d grade improves it gives rise to greater swirl compared to the lower hd d grade for hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations viz the separation of the shear layer is hindered and it carries through the size of the shear layers in streamwise destination the turbulent boundary layer at the lower part of the cylinder is more protesting and departure is delayed in fig 2 the reynolds stress uv u 2 shown in the last colon obviously remarks that the positive layers are dominant and negative layers are lost because of the motion of the flow in the up part for hd d 1 and 0 75 situations videlicet the shear layer couldn t occur at the top left one fourth of the cylinder because of the fact that the cylinder is placed coincidently with open plane its mean is that the momentum transported in the swirl zone depresses and karman street disappears for hd d 0 5 and 0 25 situations well characterized layer groups constructions are monitored in reynolds stress uv u 2 correlations as given in the third colon but the most significant case is that the wake zone enlarges throughout the streamwise way as the dimensionless value of the submersion grade proportion hd d rises in the hd d 0 25 situation there is a less back flow than the one at the upper hd d rate when the hd d grade rises the center of the focal f in the wake zone is proceeded further downstream the outcomes are consistent with the study of ataei and kordkandi ataie ashtiani and aslani kordkandi 2013 the attached boundary layer at the lower part of the cylinder lengthens further downstream in other words back flow and declination are more robust when the cylinder is submerged in deeper the equation brings up a poorer wake at hd d 0 25 situation checked against to upper hd d levels furthermore there is an enhancement in flow velocity on account of the decline of the congestion rate for hd d 0 25 situation little swirl has smaller addition to the obvious carrying of upstream fluid destination for this situation in figs 3 8 time averaged velocity vector fields v streamline patterns ψ and reynolds stress uv u 2 are represented respectively for various situations of gap ratio l d to figure out the influence of second cylinder and space between cylinders on the flow construction the colons from top to bottom correspond to velocity vector fields v presented in the first column streamline patterns ψ presented in the second column and reynolds stress uv u 2 represented in the last colon for hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 situations respectively the entire shape of the patterns of streamline topology ψ shows that the volume and extent of the wake zone declines compared to single cylinder situation due to the existence of the downstream cylinder for instance there is a vigorous up flow however a poorer deviation in comparison to the single cylinder situation as observed in the second colon of fig 3 flow characteristics are generally similar for hd d 1 25 1 5 1 75 situations the mentioned figure represents no depression of vortex shedding and the bluff body wake attitude for hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations however the submersion level doesn t has much influence on the depression of vortex shedding for hd d 0 25 and 0 5 situations due to the low blockage level on the other hand the wake zone downstream of the second cylinder extends as a result of proximity to the bed or free plane for hd d 0 75 1 and 2 situations the shear layers do not merge with each other which makes more extended shear layers separate from lower part of the cylinder just after the cylinder for hd d 0 75 1 and single cylinder situations remain significantly similar the mentioned attitude of the flow averts the momentum transmission from the free plane into the wake zone reynolds stress uv u 2 shown in the right colon remarks that positive rigid lines and negative hyphen lines contours keep horizontal and expand in the streamwise destination the time averaged velocity vector area v and coincident with streamline topology ψ and vorticity field demonstrated in the figure describe that the submersion level has a considerable impact on the swirl flow construction both velocity vector field v and streamline topology in the left colon of the figure demonstrates that there are 2 foci f and 1 saddle spot s close to the basis of the cylinder for the situation of hd d 1 75 1 5 1 25 moreover in the last colon the dispersion of positive counter clockwise rotating and negative clockwise rotating contours is almost symmetrical with respect to the cylinder centerline at this submersion level at hd d 1 75 1 5 situations shear layers become closer to each other and small scale oscillating foci f are observed while the large scale foci f are observed at hd d 1 25 situation this behavior is basis on the impact of the bed on flow features due to the proximity of the cylinders to the bed the boundary layer is more resistant and amortized by the bed for the hd d 1 75 and 1 5 situations the shear layers emerging on both parts of the cylinder combine to each other and the flow momentum rises for the mentioned situations time averaged velocity vector fields v besides points out that the size of the velocity in the swirl zone of the cylinder is relatively small at these submersion level values check againts to the velocity of free stream but a well characterized single focal f is viewed in the near wake zone for hd d 2 situation as it can be observed in fig 4 flow construction modifies and the foci f are adjacent to other cylinder in addition center of the focal f are symmetrical yet dimensions of the foci f are distinct on account of the mutual effect with the other cylinder viz size of the bottom part focal f is less than the extent of the up part focal f since lower part of plane is more durable to the flow and compensates the extend of the focus f however the dimension of the upper part focus f is bigger compared to the dimension of the bottom part focus f since the free plane is more flexible than the bottom plane for hd d 1 situation the flow wake region with two foci f is determined and the saddle spot s takes place below the free plane between the cylinders the line that is determined with a rigid line corresponds to the streamline and reattaches to the open plane on the other hand a well defined swirl begins to be observed between cylinders for the situations of hd d 1 75 and 2 at this gap ratio while there is no focus f for the same situations of l d 0 gap ratio it is clear that this occurrence is a function of dimensionless gap ratio l d moreover a well defined swirl is also observed for situations of hd d 0 5 0 75 in terms of reynolds stress uv u 2 intensification although positive and negative contours are symmetric and become closer to each other downstream of the far cylinder for situations of hd d 1 25 1 5 1 75 only positive or only negative contour is observed downstream of the far cylinder for the situations of hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 while negative contour defined as hyphen lines is dominated by positive contour defined as rigid lines for hd d 1 75 situation positive contour is dominated by negative contour for hd d 1 25 situation on the other hand just as there is only negative contour due of the influence of the bottom plane viscous effect for hd d 2 situation and there is only positive contour for hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations in terms of streamline topology ψ a well defined swirl is observed downstream of the other cylinder for the hd d 0 75 1 and 2 situations due to the blockage issue however foci f are not well defined far cylinder downstream because of the fact that the centers of these foci f are too close to each other for the hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations fig 5 remarks that the downstream cylinder has little impact on the swirl flow characteristic because of the large gap between cylinders viz while 2 foci f are observed between the cylinders for the hd d 1 75 situation at this gap ratio a well defined swirl is observed between the cylinders for same situation at l d 1 the general trend is that the wake zone between the cylinders lengthens as a result of larger space between the cylinders compared to l d 1 configuration the second important difference for hd d 1 situation is that while two foci f and a saddle spot s are observed between the cylinders for hd d 1 at l d 1 situation a well defined swirl is observed between the cylinders due to the effect of the space between cylinders for the above mentioned situation at l d 1 5 moreover the center of this swirl is closer to the far cylinder compared to the first cylinder because the fluid velocity moves the center of the swirl towards the far cylinder there is a remarkable upward flow between the cylinders for the hd d 1 situation the flow comes across the resistance downward flow which is constituted in front of the other cylinder and this flow cannot improve this interaction can forestall the horseshoe vortex generation at the basis of the other cylinder there is no vertical departure the upward flow is dominant however there is a downward flow between the cylinders for the hd d 2 situation the flow encounters the resistance upward flow which is created in front of the other cylinder the downward flow is dominant for this situation and this flow attains the maximum value near the far cylinder there is a more robust back flow for the hd d 1 and 2 situations compared to the hd d 0 75 situation the wake region covers a wider space with the rise in the gap between the cylinders so the dimension of the wake zone rises the departure of the flow is clear for hd d 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 situations for in these levels the shear layer is discreted from the lower or free plane of the cylinders the velocity of the flow approaching the downstream cylinder diminishes resulting in excursive bubble for the hd d 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 situations while the size of the swirl is bigger for the hd d 0 75 situation than the size of the swirl for the hd d 0 5 situation because the flow velocity is stronger for the hd d 0 5 situation compared to hd d 0 75 situation however the far cylinder does not affect the flow construction for hd d 0 25 situation because of the low blockage rate time averaged velocity vector fields v and corresponding streamline topology ψ shown in the first and second column reveal that two foci f and a stagnation spot s are observed between the cylinders for the hd d 1 25 1 5 1 75 situations two foci f are symmetrical with each other for hd d 1 5 situation on the other hand focuses of foci f are symmetrical but the size of these foci f is not equal for hd d 1 25 and 1 75 situations owing to the impact of free and bottom planes the size of upper part focus f of the cylinder is larger than that of the bottom part focus f of the cylinder for hd d 1 25 situation because the cylinders are located closer to the free plane and flow velocity is smaller at this area than that at the bottom part the same formation occurs for hd d 1 75 situation but dimension of the bottom part focus f of the cylinder is larger than that of the upper part focus f of the cylinder because the cylinders are positioned closer to the bottom plane the flow region attached to the wake inclines to speed up on account of forward the extra fluid because of the fact that the wake is a re excursive region that does not conduce to the net fluid transport reynolds stress uv u 2 correlations of images demonstrated in the right colon of fig 5 remarks that the dispersion of positive and negative contour is almost symmetric with respect to the centerline of cylinder for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations reynolds stress uv u 2 correlations reveal that contours are divided into two parts for these situations the discrete shear layers demonstrate a great grade of reynolds stress uv u 2 values and the place of maximum reynolds stress uv u 2 coincides with saddle spot s located at the similar streamwise space associated with the production of intensive fluctuations in the place saddle spot s placed approximately at 1 16d 1d 1 16d downstream of the other cylinder for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations respectively therefore reynolds stress uv u 2 intensification the prominent ones occur adjacently to basis of the cylinder when the flow departs downstream the reynolds stress uv u 2 intensification of the wake behind the cylinder rises firstly arrives the peak value of 0 0555 0 0554 0 0408 from the basis of the cylinder and then diminishes owing to fluctuations in the shear layers beside the well characterized reynolds stress uv u 2 pattern a weaker zone close to the basis of the cylinder happens result in the entrainment of free stream flow in the swirl zone it is clear that the flow construction for hd d 1 25 and 1 5 at l d 1 5 situations are very similar to those obtained for the same situations at l d 1 fig 6 indicates that the widest wake region is seen for hd d 1 situation besides the prolonged swirl zone that is the signal of the weakening of karman vortex shedding can smoothly be observed from the figures since the shear layer don t entrain into each other it results in more extended shear layers forming on the upper or bottom part of the cylinder for the submersion level rate of hd d 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 situations this attitude of the flow averts the momentum transmission from the free stream flow in the swirl zone the velocity vector fields v have also the same structure for these submersion level ratios in terms of reynolds stress uv u 2 concentration either positive or negative contour is observed for these submersion level ratios while negative contour is observed for hd d 2 situation due to the lack of bottom surface effect positive contour is observed for hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations because of the lack of free surface effect positive and negative sheets extend in the streamwise destination the second important point to mention is that a developing circulation bubble is observed on the shoulder of the first cylinder for hd d 0 75 and 1 situations as mentioned above because the velocity which is beneath the cylinder cannot reach this area and a circulation happens on the shoulder of the cylinder nevertheless fig 7 shows that the length of the foci f and density of the foci f is the biggest for hd d 1 25 situation namely the prolongation is the most prominent for the submersion level rate of hd d 1 25 situation owing to the lack of the lower part surface impact on the other hand the length of the foci f is the lowest for hd d 1 5 situation owing to being away from the free surface and bottom surface and so their effects the first column of fig 7 point outs that the far cylinder hasn t much impact on the swirl flow structure owing to the large gap between the cylinders for hd d 1 5 situation the shear layers of the cylinder cant over towards each other after the first cylinder for this situation viz shear layers entrain into each other for the submersion level ratios of hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations this behavior of the flow provides the momentum transmission from the free stream flow in the swirl zone and the flow after these two foci f points starts to become uniform the dispersion of positive and negative contour is almost symmetric in point of the cylinder centerline and they are condensed between the cylinders for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations moreover a well defined swirl is observed between the cylinders for hd d 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 situations as the submersion level rate rises the width of the swirl increases while the swirl covers the wake zone between the cylinders for hd d 0 75 and 0 5 situations the swirl grows in cross for hd d 1 and 2 situations the other observation is that developing circulation bubble is observed on the shoulder of first cylinder for hd d 0 75 and 1 situations as mentioned by akoz et al 2010 the high magnitude flow takes place along the shear layer the colons from right to left correspond to reynolds stress uv u 2 streamline topology ψ and velocity vector fields v for l d 3 respectively in fig 8 the general trend is that the impact of cylinder downstream on the flow construction disappears the flow characteristics between the cylinders are similar to bare cylinder situation for this gap ratio the shape of the patterns of velocity vectors v between the cylinders is similar for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations the wake zone between the cylinders lengthens as a result of the mutual effect between the cylinders for these submersion level ratios in terms of streamline topology ψ there are two foci f and a stagnation spot s for these submersion level ratios the size of these foci f are symmetrical for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations the reynolds stress uv u 2 correlation displays that contours are divided into two equal parts for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations furthermore the dispersion of positive and negative sheets is almost symmetrical concerning the cylinder centerline the swirl spreads the wake flow region for hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations the widest wake zone is seen for hd d 1 situation furthermore the lengthened wake zone that is the marker of the weakening of karman vortex shedding can be readily observed from the views since the shear layer does not entrain into each other it results in extended shear layers forming on the upper part of the cylinder for the submersion level ratios of hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations this attitude of the flow forestalls the momentum transmission from the free stream flow in the swirl zone the velocity vector fields v also have the same structure for these submersion level ratios in terms of reynolds stress uv u 2 intensification positive rigid lines contour is observed for these submersion level ratios owing to the lack of free plane effect on the other hand negative contour is observed for hd d 2 situation due to the lack of bottom plane impact positive rigid lines and negative hyphen lines layers lengthen in the streamwise destination for all above mentioned situations fig 9 compares the impact of gap with distinct submersion level rates having hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 on the flow structure the figure indicates that the different vertical elevations have a considerable impact on the swirl flow characterictic for the submersion level ratio of hd d 1 the time averaged velocity vector field v indicates that the wake zone extends and prolonged free stream destination owing to the interplay of the cylinder with the free plane the entire shape of the patterns of velocity vectors v like to that of hd d 0 75 0 5 situations velocity vector area v also refers that the size in the swirl zone is weaker at hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 rates as compared to the velocity of the free stream symmetrical time averaged vortex structure is obtained for the mentioned situations moreover small scale vortical structures are obtained owing to impingement of the vortices for them prolonged wake zone that is the sign of the improvement of karman vortex shedding can readily be observed from the figures for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations the shorter shear layers compose both parts of the cylinder for the submersion level rates of hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situation because shear layers entrain into each other the mentioned flow characteristic is a typical signal of momentum transmission from the free stream flow into the swirl zone viz karman vortex shedding improves by increasing gap between cylinders the crosscut spatial content of each sheet stays relatively tight for these situations and also the existence of the other cylinder stimulates streamlines to distort to the upper part in streamline topology ψ in fig 9 see fig 10 in the mid colon of fig 9 demonstrates streamline topology ψ for distinct submersion level rates the initial significant matter is that the wake zone becomes greater streamwise and extends by the interaction between the cylinder free and bottom surfaces that can be observed for hd d 1 and 2 situations similar flow structure is also observed for hd d 0 75 situation on the other hand the size of the wake suddenly decreases with respect to the rising of the vertical elevation as seen in figure for hd d 0 5 and 0 25 situations the wake flow zone covers between cylinders for these situations and horseshoe vortex formation is observed for hd d 0 75 1 and 2 situations due to the large gap ratio 3 2 developing of strouhal number with the space ratio and distribution of saddle point between tandem cylinders the developing of non dimensional vortex shedding frequency strouhal number for the tandem cylinders configuration is demonstrated in fig 11 as a result of the space rate the strouhal number value in fig 11 remarks that the maximum value of vortex shedding frequencies 0 176 is determined for hd d 1 5 situation at l d 0 location but the minimum value of vortex shedding frequencies 0 114 is determined for hd d 1 5 situation at l d 4 however with the growth of the l d rate different occurrences are observed as the space ratio rises to a value of 0 5 the ratio of the vortex shedding frequencies increases suddenly for hd d 1 25 situation on the other hand the space ratio rises to a value of 0 5 the ratio of the vortex shedding frequencies decreases for hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations the magnitude of the vortex shedding frequencies is larger for hd d 1 25 situation until l d 2 configuration compared to hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations however the value of the frequencies is bigger for hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations compared to hd d 1 25 situation until l d 4 location at l d 4 and 5 locations the value of the frequencies is the same for hd d 1 25 and 1 75 situations the general trend is that the value of the vortex shedding frequencies decreases for hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations as the space ratio between cylinders increases however the magnitude of the vortex shedding frequencies has high value for hd d 1 25 situation at the beginning while the value of the vortex shedding frequencies decreases severely for the same situation after l d 2 configuration as can be seen from fig 12 saddle point can be readily observed between tandem cylinders after l d 2 saddle point is observed as 1 83 for l d 2 in the all submersion height ratios hd d on the other hand saddle point increases for l d 2 5 in the hd d 1 25 and 1 75 while it decreases for same space rate in the hd d 1 5 the maximum value of saddle point is observed for l d 3 in the hd d 1 25 but it decreases for l d 3 in the hd d 1 75 due to the free surface effect however it increases again for l d 5 in the hd d 1 75 because the second cylinder starts to lose its effect see table 1 4 conclusions in the present paper the experimental yields served profoundly comprehension on the flow construction round tandem horizontal circular cylinders positioned at distinct elevations between free and bottom planes the yields provided from piv represented that the vortical flow construction was obviously viewed since the cylinders were placed on distinct elevations between free and bottom planes of the shallow water time averaged data demonstrated that there was a distinction between the main f1 and improving excursive bubble f in mark of the way of spin for the hd d 2 situation this generation gives rise to the sweep and this induced the flow transmission between wake flow zone and core for the mentioned situations merely one vortex was obviously viewed for hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 submersion height ratios for l d 1 5 and 3 gap ratios on the other hand two foci which were not well defined were observed for hd d 1 submersion level ratio for l d 1 gap ratio while only one swirl was observed for hd d 1 75 situation for l d 1 gap ratio due to the effect of downstream cylinder moreover two foci and a stagnation spot were viewed for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations for l d 1 5 and 3 gap ratios the extent of the departure zone and the departure point was influenced by the gap ratio the extent of the separation zone in the cylinder downstream increased with increasing space ratio viz the boundary layer departure point on the cylinder acted further and modified in downstream and this situation resulted in a turbulent stirring and high amount of the reynolds shear stress a large proportion of turbulent transportation happened owing to the reverse pressure gradient for these situations these turbulent transfer brought up a degradation of construction such as offshore constructions bridges marine and pipeline concerning the reynolds shear stress models negative and positive contours kept horizontal and lengthened in the streamwise way for hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 whereas negative and positive layers were symmetric for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations reynolds stress layers lengthened through the bed owing to the bed frictional for hd d 2 however reynolds shear stress layers for hd d 1 lengthened along the open stream destination owing to the influence of the open plane the creation of vortical flow construction round bluff construction like pipelines leads to scour process for this reason it gives rise to constructional degradation of bluff body owing to the extremely energetic construction the vortices that compose in the swirl zone have extremely turbulent structure moreover the submersion height ratio highly affected the changing of turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stress that became more robust with the cylinder location in the mid stage of flow the turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stress values were highly great for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations owing to the greater momentum transport from the center zone into the swirl zone 
22487,flow characteristic around a horizontal cylinder and tandem horizontal cylinders were compared in shallow water of which height was kept constant as hw 60 mm in this study the other parameters taken constant were free stream velocity and diameter of circular cylinders of which values were u 167 mm s and d 30 mm respectively to evaluate the time averaged and instantaneous velocity vector area in the wake zone at reynolds number red 5000 basis on the diameter of cylinder particle image velocimetry piv was operated the gap l between the tandem cylinders was enhanced from 0 until 90 mm through 15 mm enhancements and it was enhanced from 90 up to 150 mm through 30 mm enhancements in order to observe effect of the gap on flow characteristics moreover another important parameter was the submersion level that ranged from 7 5 until 60 mm through 7 5 mm increments hd d 0 25 2 during the experiments five hundred instantaneous images were used in order to obtain reynolds stress correlation corresponding streamline topology and the mean velocity vector field the investigation represented that the alternative cylinder attenuates the dimension of the wake zone in accordance with l d 0 location the wake zone obviously happens between tandem cylinders at the starting of l d 1 location when the space between tandem cylinders deepens the dimension of the wake zone rises keywords flow around the horizontal cylinder particle image velocimetry wake structure tandem cylinders 1 introduction eddies back of the bluff body creates a primary problem in fluid dynamics owing to geometrical primitiveness furthermore it has a key instrument role in different fields of engineering and science by virtue of its practical significance these fields cover numerous industries such as civil engineering mechanical and aerospace engineering power industries and undersea technologies grasp of the flow construction can ensure different remedies for above mentioned fields a great amount of researchers examined on the flow construction around cylinders positioned at vertically in shallow and deep water wolanski et al 1984 ingram and chu 1987 akilli et al 2004 2005 2008 chen and jirka 1995 on the other hand some other researchers conducted studies on the flow construction around cylinders placed at horizontal cylinders cokgor and avci 2001 teh et al 2003 akoz et al 2010 kahraman et al 2012 the forces on single horizontal cylinder were investigated by cokgor and avci 2001 they represented that the more submersion ratio raised the more drag and lift coeffients reduced akoz et al 2010 examined the flow characteristics of the single horizontal cylinder positioned on the surface boundary by means of piv technique the results displayed that concurrence of cylinder and bed surface improved the submersion mechanism hydrodynamically even within a wake zone which it was diminished in dimension in longitudinal destination basis on reynolds number the flow structure around single horizontal cylinder placed coincidently on a free plane in the shallow water through piv technique was studied by kahraman et al 2012 the influence of the reynolds and froude numbers on flow construction was examined in their study the results showed that changing of reattachment position of braked flow to the free plane violently linked on the diameter of cylinder and was influenced with the froude number tumen ozdil and akilli özdiln f akilli 2015 examined the flow structure around a horizontal cylinder experimentally to observe the influence of the submersion ratio of cylinder they analyzed the instantaneous and time averaged velocity vector areas in the wake zone utilizing particle image velocimetry they concluded that the size of jet like flow velocity raised with the increment of submersion ratio triantafyllou et al triantafyllou and dimas 1989 analytically examined the structures of the flow passing a cylinder for half submersion level the results revealed that the adjacent wake subjected to a convective sheridan et al 1995 investigated the flow construction of a cylinder around open plane two appropriate wake conditions were viewed they were viewed to have restricted uniformity for this reason the flow structure was categorized as metastable tryggvason et al 1991 indicated that production of a secondary swirl at the plane reduced due to the moving of surface intensity to restrict robust surface bending the reduced production of the secondary vorticity may modify the mutual effect of vortices with a open plane sheridan et al 1997 researched flow structures for single cylinder positioned near at free surface they concluded the existence of three situations the first one was its extension to the free plane the second one was its extension to the cylinder and the third one was a middle situation in between the flow around single horizontal cylinder that was located coincidently on a free and partially immersed plane was examined by hatipoglu and avci 2003 they concluded that the range of departure region diminished in parallel with the increase of submersion ratio tsutsui 2012 examined the flow behavior around tandem circular cylinders and oscillating fluid force moving on cylinders the first parameter was the gap ratio for this study he also used reynolds number as the second parameter he searched out that the shear layer separated from the lower and upper parts of the initial cylinder by turns reattached to the lower and upper parts of the downstream cylinder the results showed that the interval flow was forced reverse by the flow where it was attached in former position of the second cylinder he concluded that the stage variation between the oscillating lift and drag coefficient of the first and second cylinders were t t 5 16 and 3 16 respectively singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 numerically observed flows around tandem circular cylinders for a series of reynolds numbers in changing space sizes at a low reynolds number their analyses included the governing equations on an unconstructed arranged mesh by means of a second order certain finite volume technique they observed that flow area was notably affected by the space between reynolds number and cylinders sumner et al sumner et al 1999 analyzed on an impulsively initiated flow area for tandem cylinders utilizing particle image velocimetry piv they performed their test for longitudinal pitch proportion series of l d 1 3 and for reynolds numbers ranging from re 1200 to 3800 when the cylinders were in contact three dissimilar kinds of fluid behaviors basis on l d were determined a bluff body motion forced streamwise development and side enlargement of the space recursive regions at small and medium l d and free generation of excursive regions alike to sole repulsively initiated cylinder at greater l d wang et al 2015 investigated the flow characteristics around two tandem cylinders located parallel and close to a plane wall in this study reynolds number was selected as 6300 according to cylinder diameter furthermore the space height to cylinder diameter ratio g and the cylinder center to center gap ratio l were altered from 0 15 to 2 and 1 5 to 6 respectively according to piv test results it was observed that the flow was affected with the change of g and l values for g 0 3 the flow can be called as vortex shedding suppression regime for 0 3 g 1 the flow can be called as intermediate gap regime and for g 1 the flow can be called as large gap regime moreover for 1 l 2 the flow can be called as extended body regime for 2 l 4 the flow can be re attachment regime and for l 4 the flow can be impinging regime sanaati and kato 2014 studied the closeness interference and synchronization between tandem flexible cylinders they used two identical flexible cylinders and they were examined for two distinct separation distances according to the results in a small center to center separation space as 2 75 diameters there is no upper branch in the initial cross flow lock in zone on the above cylinder with the increment of first separation both cylinders showed amplitude replies parallel with isolated cylinder furthermore for decreasing velocity serie of 1 82 ur 5 1 robust stage concur was observed they were also concluded that for a departure of 5 5 diameters the wakes were vigorously concurred therein the zone of great cylinder oscillation extent as 2 91 ur 5 1 deng et al 2019 examined a numerical model using navier stokes equations to associate free plane waves around two horizontal cylinders they used the volume of fluid approach to investigate the flow characteristics they concluded that the numerical results were in consistency with previous results obtained from experimental studies moreover the vertical gap between the cylinders has a direct influence on the hydrodynamic powers at the below location whilst for the above location it can be affected only for small vertical spacing shao et al 2019 performed a numerical study with tandem square cylinders at reynolds number having 100 they investigated the effect of the vortex stimulated swing and gap rate between the cylinders to examine the effects of the parameters four distinct systems setup were evaluated as situation 1 two stable tandem square cylinders situation 2 simply the trailing square cylinder rotation situation 3 simply the leading square cylinder rotation and situation 4 two square cylinders rotation according to the results as in situation 1 and situation 2 fixed leading cylinder situation the spacing ratio has significant effect for situation 3 and 4 rotational leading cylinder situation the genesis of vortex shedding in the space zone was occurred with a smaller crucial gap rate compared to situation 1 and 2 qu et al 2017 studied the effect of tsunami waves on cylinders to simulate the inshore and offshore infrastructures they studied numerical models on tsunami like waves around cylinders to show the distinctions between solitary and tsunami waves they chose wave height cylinder spacing distance and submersion depth as considered parameters they concluded that tsunami like waves can created nearly 16 and 10 higher vertical and horizontal burdens compared to solitary waves respectively moreover both tsunami and solitary like wave burdens increased with the increment of wave height xu et al xu et al 2019 employed experimental research about flow induced vibration for two cylinders located in tandem they selected four different gap ratios as 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 and they used two imaginary spring damping vibrators to carry out the experiments the obtained results referred that the flow excited oscillation structures of the upstream cylinder are in parallel with the results obtained from a sole cylinder for gap rates of 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 with the diminished velocity does not overlap 12 furthermore for spacing ratio of 1 57 the flow induced vibration reply of the upstream cylinder in the tandem cylinders was obtained distinct from that of the isolated cylinder d souza et al d souza et al 2016 presented a study about flow characteristics around two tandem cylinders throughout a acting plane wall they chose the spectral element approach to carry out the models in reynolds number of 200 to show the effect of moving wall gap ratio and longitudinal center to center separation was varied between 0 2 to 5 0 and 1 5 to 8 0 respectively they concluded that beforetime transmission from intermediate to co shedding order was observed for gap ratio of 0 5 moreover similar to freestream situation of tandem arrangement the existence of plane acting wall created shielding influence of the upstream cylinder in mean lift and drag coefficients of the downstream cylinder at gap ratio of 0 5 more et al 2015 studied an experimental research about flow features around two similar tandem square cylinders in the study the downstream cylinder was held stationary and the upstream cylinder was vibrated in the transverse destination furthermore reynolds number was selected as 295 to show the influence of the spacing ratio on flow characteristics the spacing ratios are altered between 1 5 and 5 they concluded that there was a significant influence gap between the cylinders on flow construction and vortex shedding moreover there was a crucial space that vortex shedding of the upstream cylinder was prevented raiola et al 2016 investigated an experimental study about near wake of two tandem cylinders under crossflow with additional ground interference according to the cylinder diameters reynold number picked as 4 9 103 in this study three different longitudinal pitch ratios and wall gap ratios were selected as 1 5 3 6 and 0 3 1 3 respectively according to the obtained results when the wall gap ratio was 1 the ground effected the flow area with dissymmetry in the normal von karman wake furthermore as the wall gap ratio was diminished to 0 3 a prolonged low speed zone occurred in close downstream of the cylinders li et al 2018 performed a numerical analysis with smagorinsky sub grid scale model in large eddy simulations for the flow around two tandem cylinders in order to show the effect of horizontal plane wall space ratios were varied as 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 and also pitch ratios were selected as 2 and 5 they performed six sets of simulations in reynolds number of 1 31 104 basis on the obtained yields for pitch ratios the wall closeness had a diminishing influence on the mean drag coefficient of the upstream cylinder moreover in pitch ratio of 2 a squares cavity like flow occurred among the cylinders and the flow excursive inside the cavity an increment in the unsteadiness of the swirl flow generation is observed in the downstream and upstream zones of the pipeline bearman and zdravkovich 1978 implemented a research on the flow construction around a horizontally positioned cylinder they revealed that eddy was compressed for the space ratio with smaller than 0 3 they demonstrated that the karman generation can be degradation considering the fact that cylinder is located at close the wall as a pipeline is located on an erodible bed the pipeline is suspended and erosion occurs along the pipeline large eddies brings out extra powers on the pipeline due to the scouring process because of the spreading of the scouring processes the pipe is buried the above mentioned process relies on the hydrodynamic attitude of the flow along the pipeline for this reason examination of flow structures along the pipeline becomes significant there are restricted data concerning the flow structures around horizontal circular cylinders located especially far from the bottom and free planes in shallow water the flow construction around horizontal tandem cylinders was presented for various height ranges from hd d 0 25 up to 2 in this study the goal of the research is firstly to show the flow construction around tandem horizontal cylinders for various heights in the close to wake zone furthermore this study includes detailed examination on the wake zone for the tandem horizontal cylinders to examine complex swirl flow construction 2 material and methods in the present study all of the tests were exerted in a closed water duct the water duct carried out experiments were 750 mm in depth 1000 mm in width and 8000 mm in length water was moved into an emplacement room from inside a honeycomb part a pump which was performed to circulate the water and was operated by an electric motor having changing speed controllers to form the average flow in the experiment part the analysis of the flow structure around tandem horizontal cylinders was performed for different submersion height rate the section of submersion part of the cylinder from the open plane in the research the overall tests were performed in the shallow water of which level hw was 60 mm moreover cylinders diameter having constant value was 30 mm lastly the experiment part was built of plexiglas sheet having 15 mm thickness the demonstration of test setup was given in fig 1 the overall studies were taken under a fully developed flow therefore the cylinder was located in 4000 mm away from the start of the channel during tests the free stream velocity was u 167 mm s that indicated reynolds number basis on diameter of cylinder of red 5000 the studies were carried out for tandem horizontal cylinders having gap with l d ranged from 0 to 5 in the water channel the piv technique was utilized to evaluate instantaneous velocity vectors in a zone lighted by laser sheet dantec piv system was utilized to conduct velocity vector measurements the flow area lighting was ensured using two nd being yag having energy yield of 120 mj strikes laser of a wavelength of 532 nm dantec dynamics that was managing the data obtaining was employed to concur the view reception and laser unit the measurements were done in two distinct planes to completely monitor the excursive flow zone by particle image velocimetry technique an 8 bit cross correlation charge coupled apparatus ccd camera with 1600 pixels x 1200 pixels resolution and accoutered with a nikon af micro 60 f 2 8 d lenses was used to take images 32 32 pixels rectangular influential query windows were performed for the image processing to observe an instantaneous velocity field totally 3168 99 32 velocity vectors were acquired during the experiments the time interval between the laser sheet thickness and pulses enlightening the measurement plane were 1750 and about 2 mm respectively after the imaging process erroneous vectors were extracted and modified utilizing interpolation among surrounding vectors in the post processing using displacement vector area velocity vectors were computed the swirl models of the wake were computed via the velocity area utilizing a finite difference scheme circulation and streamlines were acquired using the velocity data the total area of image was 180 60 mm2 while patterns of instantaneous particle views total 500 views were obtained at a rate of 15 hz the uncertainty in velocity relative to depth averaged velocity was estimated as 2 for this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 interpretation of time averaged results the flow structure with the inclusion of reynolds stress uv u 2 corresponding to streamline topology ψ and the time averaged velocity vectors v for bare cylinder situation was demonstrated in fig 2 the cylinder was submerged in shallow water from hd d 0 25 to hd d 2 with gradually 0 25 of increments to examine the effect of the various rates of water height as it can be observed in the fig 2 for hd d 2 condition a improving focal f and a main excursive bubble f1 were sighted as implied by kahraman et al 2012 the main excursive bubble extends in a great field in the swirl zone the positive values are determined by rigid lines whereas negative values are determined by hyphen lines in the last colon of fig 2 the reynolds stress uv u 2 contours represented in the last colon demonstrates that there is a negative form appearing for hd d 2 situation whereas positive form begins to happen because of the free plane influence for hd d 1 75 configuration the streamline topology ψ presented in the middle colon indicates that a discreted flow zone becomes at the downstream of the cylinder with division plane beginning from both parts of the cylinder reasoning two foci f downstream of the cylinder for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations owing to the shear layer at the top part of the cylinder the other focal appears for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations as it may be seen in velocity vectors v there is a low velocity zone that demonstrates the wake region at merely downstream of the cylinder for theses situation viz the velocity vectors in the outer of the swirl zone are larger than these in the swirl zone the considerable back flow happens within this wake zone for these situations the time averaged streamline topology ψ obviously notices that greater extended wake zone happens for hd d 1 25 situation compared to the hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situation for this reason saddle spot position of crossing streamlines occurs later for hd d 1 25 situation checked against to the situations of hd d 1 75 saddle spot refers to the concurrence of the departure lines viz shear layers arising on each part of the cylinder unite in adjacent zone to the cylinder and hereby swirl flow zone starts to be lost however on account of the negligible influence of free and bottom planes at hd d 1 5 situation the minimum swirl diameter is monitored the last colon points out that important polarities are centralized at a space of nearly one cylinder diameter downstream at the basis of the cylinder the mentioned outcome complies with experiment that was presented in deep water by akilli et al 2004 reynolds stress intensification uv u 2 happen at close of the cylinder basis when the flow passes downstream the intensification of reynolds stress uv u 2 firstly enhances attains its top value of 0 09 and then begins reducing moreover the well characterized reynolds stress uv u2 model owing to surges in the shear layers a great intensified reynolds stress uv u2 zone being adjacent to the basis of the cylinder occur due to the entrainment of free stream flow into swirl zone on the other hand for hd d 1 0 75 0 5 situations a well portrait eddy happens at the cylinder downstream a significant investigation is that there is a division in the front part of the cylinder for hd d 1 and 0 75 situations as shown by akoz et al akoz 2012 when the stagnation spot acts towards the top part of the cylinder a great size of the velocity vectors v takes place through the shear layers therefore it induces a disturbance at the free plane of the flow for this reason a limited size focal f emerges and preserves its asset for only hd d 1 0 75 situations and be lost for hd d 0 25 and 0 5 situations the streamline topology ψ shown in the middle colon clearly indicates that the departure is a result of the submersion grade of the cylinder in shallow water however boundary layer at the lower part of the cylinder prolongs upwards downstream as the hd d grade improves it gives rise to greater swirl compared to the lower hd d grade for hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations viz the separation of the shear layer is hindered and it carries through the size of the shear layers in streamwise destination the turbulent boundary layer at the lower part of the cylinder is more protesting and departure is delayed in fig 2 the reynolds stress uv u 2 shown in the last colon obviously remarks that the positive layers are dominant and negative layers are lost because of the motion of the flow in the up part for hd d 1 and 0 75 situations videlicet the shear layer couldn t occur at the top left one fourth of the cylinder because of the fact that the cylinder is placed coincidently with open plane its mean is that the momentum transported in the swirl zone depresses and karman street disappears for hd d 0 5 and 0 25 situations well characterized layer groups constructions are monitored in reynolds stress uv u 2 correlations as given in the third colon but the most significant case is that the wake zone enlarges throughout the streamwise way as the dimensionless value of the submersion grade proportion hd d rises in the hd d 0 25 situation there is a less back flow than the one at the upper hd d rate when the hd d grade rises the center of the focal f in the wake zone is proceeded further downstream the outcomes are consistent with the study of ataei and kordkandi ataie ashtiani and aslani kordkandi 2013 the attached boundary layer at the lower part of the cylinder lengthens further downstream in other words back flow and declination are more robust when the cylinder is submerged in deeper the equation brings up a poorer wake at hd d 0 25 situation checked against to upper hd d levels furthermore there is an enhancement in flow velocity on account of the decline of the congestion rate for hd d 0 25 situation little swirl has smaller addition to the obvious carrying of upstream fluid destination for this situation in figs 3 8 time averaged velocity vector fields v streamline patterns ψ and reynolds stress uv u 2 are represented respectively for various situations of gap ratio l d to figure out the influence of second cylinder and space between cylinders on the flow construction the colons from top to bottom correspond to velocity vector fields v presented in the first column streamline patterns ψ presented in the second column and reynolds stress uv u 2 represented in the last colon for hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 situations respectively the entire shape of the patterns of streamline topology ψ shows that the volume and extent of the wake zone declines compared to single cylinder situation due to the existence of the downstream cylinder for instance there is a vigorous up flow however a poorer deviation in comparison to the single cylinder situation as observed in the second colon of fig 3 flow characteristics are generally similar for hd d 1 25 1 5 1 75 situations the mentioned figure represents no depression of vortex shedding and the bluff body wake attitude for hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations however the submersion level doesn t has much influence on the depression of vortex shedding for hd d 0 25 and 0 5 situations due to the low blockage level on the other hand the wake zone downstream of the second cylinder extends as a result of proximity to the bed or free plane for hd d 0 75 1 and 2 situations the shear layers do not merge with each other which makes more extended shear layers separate from lower part of the cylinder just after the cylinder for hd d 0 75 1 and single cylinder situations remain significantly similar the mentioned attitude of the flow averts the momentum transmission from the free plane into the wake zone reynolds stress uv u 2 shown in the right colon remarks that positive rigid lines and negative hyphen lines contours keep horizontal and expand in the streamwise destination the time averaged velocity vector area v and coincident with streamline topology ψ and vorticity field demonstrated in the figure describe that the submersion level has a considerable impact on the swirl flow construction both velocity vector field v and streamline topology in the left colon of the figure demonstrates that there are 2 foci f and 1 saddle spot s close to the basis of the cylinder for the situation of hd d 1 75 1 5 1 25 moreover in the last colon the dispersion of positive counter clockwise rotating and negative clockwise rotating contours is almost symmetrical with respect to the cylinder centerline at this submersion level at hd d 1 75 1 5 situations shear layers become closer to each other and small scale oscillating foci f are observed while the large scale foci f are observed at hd d 1 25 situation this behavior is basis on the impact of the bed on flow features due to the proximity of the cylinders to the bed the boundary layer is more resistant and amortized by the bed for the hd d 1 75 and 1 5 situations the shear layers emerging on both parts of the cylinder combine to each other and the flow momentum rises for the mentioned situations time averaged velocity vector fields v besides points out that the size of the velocity in the swirl zone of the cylinder is relatively small at these submersion level values check againts to the velocity of free stream but a well characterized single focal f is viewed in the near wake zone for hd d 2 situation as it can be observed in fig 4 flow construction modifies and the foci f are adjacent to other cylinder in addition center of the focal f are symmetrical yet dimensions of the foci f are distinct on account of the mutual effect with the other cylinder viz size of the bottom part focal f is less than the extent of the up part focal f since lower part of plane is more durable to the flow and compensates the extend of the focus f however the dimension of the upper part focus f is bigger compared to the dimension of the bottom part focus f since the free plane is more flexible than the bottom plane for hd d 1 situation the flow wake region with two foci f is determined and the saddle spot s takes place below the free plane between the cylinders the line that is determined with a rigid line corresponds to the streamline and reattaches to the open plane on the other hand a well defined swirl begins to be observed between cylinders for the situations of hd d 1 75 and 2 at this gap ratio while there is no focus f for the same situations of l d 0 gap ratio it is clear that this occurrence is a function of dimensionless gap ratio l d moreover a well defined swirl is also observed for situations of hd d 0 5 0 75 in terms of reynolds stress uv u 2 intensification although positive and negative contours are symmetric and become closer to each other downstream of the far cylinder for situations of hd d 1 25 1 5 1 75 only positive or only negative contour is observed downstream of the far cylinder for the situations of hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 while negative contour defined as hyphen lines is dominated by positive contour defined as rigid lines for hd d 1 75 situation positive contour is dominated by negative contour for hd d 1 25 situation on the other hand just as there is only negative contour due of the influence of the bottom plane viscous effect for hd d 2 situation and there is only positive contour for hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations in terms of streamline topology ψ a well defined swirl is observed downstream of the other cylinder for the hd d 0 75 1 and 2 situations due to the blockage issue however foci f are not well defined far cylinder downstream because of the fact that the centers of these foci f are too close to each other for the hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations fig 5 remarks that the downstream cylinder has little impact on the swirl flow characteristic because of the large gap between cylinders viz while 2 foci f are observed between the cylinders for the hd d 1 75 situation at this gap ratio a well defined swirl is observed between the cylinders for same situation at l d 1 the general trend is that the wake zone between the cylinders lengthens as a result of larger space between the cylinders compared to l d 1 configuration the second important difference for hd d 1 situation is that while two foci f and a saddle spot s are observed between the cylinders for hd d 1 at l d 1 situation a well defined swirl is observed between the cylinders due to the effect of the space between cylinders for the above mentioned situation at l d 1 5 moreover the center of this swirl is closer to the far cylinder compared to the first cylinder because the fluid velocity moves the center of the swirl towards the far cylinder there is a remarkable upward flow between the cylinders for the hd d 1 situation the flow comes across the resistance downward flow which is constituted in front of the other cylinder and this flow cannot improve this interaction can forestall the horseshoe vortex generation at the basis of the other cylinder there is no vertical departure the upward flow is dominant however there is a downward flow between the cylinders for the hd d 2 situation the flow encounters the resistance upward flow which is created in front of the other cylinder the downward flow is dominant for this situation and this flow attains the maximum value near the far cylinder there is a more robust back flow for the hd d 1 and 2 situations compared to the hd d 0 75 situation the wake region covers a wider space with the rise in the gap between the cylinders so the dimension of the wake zone rises the departure of the flow is clear for hd d 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 situations for in these levels the shear layer is discreted from the lower or free plane of the cylinders the velocity of the flow approaching the downstream cylinder diminishes resulting in excursive bubble for the hd d 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 situations while the size of the swirl is bigger for the hd d 0 75 situation than the size of the swirl for the hd d 0 5 situation because the flow velocity is stronger for the hd d 0 5 situation compared to hd d 0 75 situation however the far cylinder does not affect the flow construction for hd d 0 25 situation because of the low blockage rate time averaged velocity vector fields v and corresponding streamline topology ψ shown in the first and second column reveal that two foci f and a stagnation spot s are observed between the cylinders for the hd d 1 25 1 5 1 75 situations two foci f are symmetrical with each other for hd d 1 5 situation on the other hand focuses of foci f are symmetrical but the size of these foci f is not equal for hd d 1 25 and 1 75 situations owing to the impact of free and bottom planes the size of upper part focus f of the cylinder is larger than that of the bottom part focus f of the cylinder for hd d 1 25 situation because the cylinders are located closer to the free plane and flow velocity is smaller at this area than that at the bottom part the same formation occurs for hd d 1 75 situation but dimension of the bottom part focus f of the cylinder is larger than that of the upper part focus f of the cylinder because the cylinders are positioned closer to the bottom plane the flow region attached to the wake inclines to speed up on account of forward the extra fluid because of the fact that the wake is a re excursive region that does not conduce to the net fluid transport reynolds stress uv u 2 correlations of images demonstrated in the right colon of fig 5 remarks that the dispersion of positive and negative contour is almost symmetric with respect to the centerline of cylinder for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations reynolds stress uv u 2 correlations reveal that contours are divided into two parts for these situations the discrete shear layers demonstrate a great grade of reynolds stress uv u 2 values and the place of maximum reynolds stress uv u 2 coincides with saddle spot s located at the similar streamwise space associated with the production of intensive fluctuations in the place saddle spot s placed approximately at 1 16d 1d 1 16d downstream of the other cylinder for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations respectively therefore reynolds stress uv u 2 intensification the prominent ones occur adjacently to basis of the cylinder when the flow departs downstream the reynolds stress uv u 2 intensification of the wake behind the cylinder rises firstly arrives the peak value of 0 0555 0 0554 0 0408 from the basis of the cylinder and then diminishes owing to fluctuations in the shear layers beside the well characterized reynolds stress uv u 2 pattern a weaker zone close to the basis of the cylinder happens result in the entrainment of free stream flow in the swirl zone it is clear that the flow construction for hd d 1 25 and 1 5 at l d 1 5 situations are very similar to those obtained for the same situations at l d 1 fig 6 indicates that the widest wake region is seen for hd d 1 situation besides the prolonged swirl zone that is the signal of the weakening of karman vortex shedding can smoothly be observed from the figures since the shear layer don t entrain into each other it results in more extended shear layers forming on the upper or bottom part of the cylinder for the submersion level rate of hd d 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 situations this attitude of the flow averts the momentum transmission from the free stream flow in the swirl zone the velocity vector fields v have also the same structure for these submersion level ratios in terms of reynolds stress uv u 2 concentration either positive or negative contour is observed for these submersion level ratios while negative contour is observed for hd d 2 situation due to the lack of bottom surface effect positive contour is observed for hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations because of the lack of free surface effect positive and negative sheets extend in the streamwise destination the second important point to mention is that a developing circulation bubble is observed on the shoulder of the first cylinder for hd d 0 75 and 1 situations as mentioned above because the velocity which is beneath the cylinder cannot reach this area and a circulation happens on the shoulder of the cylinder nevertheless fig 7 shows that the length of the foci f and density of the foci f is the biggest for hd d 1 25 situation namely the prolongation is the most prominent for the submersion level rate of hd d 1 25 situation owing to the lack of the lower part surface impact on the other hand the length of the foci f is the lowest for hd d 1 5 situation owing to being away from the free surface and bottom surface and so their effects the first column of fig 7 point outs that the far cylinder hasn t much impact on the swirl flow structure owing to the large gap between the cylinders for hd d 1 5 situation the shear layers of the cylinder cant over towards each other after the first cylinder for this situation viz shear layers entrain into each other for the submersion level ratios of hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations this behavior of the flow provides the momentum transmission from the free stream flow in the swirl zone and the flow after these two foci f points starts to become uniform the dispersion of positive and negative contour is almost symmetric in point of the cylinder centerline and they are condensed between the cylinders for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations moreover a well defined swirl is observed between the cylinders for hd d 0 5 0 75 1 and 2 situations as the submersion level rate rises the width of the swirl increases while the swirl covers the wake zone between the cylinders for hd d 0 75 and 0 5 situations the swirl grows in cross for hd d 1 and 2 situations the other observation is that developing circulation bubble is observed on the shoulder of first cylinder for hd d 0 75 and 1 situations as mentioned by akoz et al 2010 the high magnitude flow takes place along the shear layer the colons from right to left correspond to reynolds stress uv u 2 streamline topology ψ and velocity vector fields v for l d 3 respectively in fig 8 the general trend is that the impact of cylinder downstream on the flow construction disappears the flow characteristics between the cylinders are similar to bare cylinder situation for this gap ratio the shape of the patterns of velocity vectors v between the cylinders is similar for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations the wake zone between the cylinders lengthens as a result of the mutual effect between the cylinders for these submersion level ratios in terms of streamline topology ψ there are two foci f and a stagnation spot s for these submersion level ratios the size of these foci f are symmetrical for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations the reynolds stress uv u 2 correlation displays that contours are divided into two equal parts for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations furthermore the dispersion of positive and negative sheets is almost symmetrical concerning the cylinder centerline the swirl spreads the wake flow region for hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations the widest wake zone is seen for hd d 1 situation furthermore the lengthened wake zone that is the marker of the weakening of karman vortex shedding can be readily observed from the views since the shear layer does not entrain into each other it results in extended shear layers forming on the upper part of the cylinder for the submersion level ratios of hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 situations this attitude of the flow forestalls the momentum transmission from the free stream flow in the swirl zone the velocity vector fields v also have the same structure for these submersion level ratios in terms of reynolds stress uv u 2 intensification positive rigid lines contour is observed for these submersion level ratios owing to the lack of free plane effect on the other hand negative contour is observed for hd d 2 situation due to the lack of bottom plane impact positive rigid lines and negative hyphen lines layers lengthen in the streamwise destination for all above mentioned situations fig 9 compares the impact of gap with distinct submersion level rates having hd d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 on the flow structure the figure indicates that the different vertical elevations have a considerable impact on the swirl flow characterictic for the submersion level ratio of hd d 1 the time averaged velocity vector field v indicates that the wake zone extends and prolonged free stream destination owing to the interplay of the cylinder with the free plane the entire shape of the patterns of velocity vectors v like to that of hd d 0 75 0 5 situations velocity vector area v also refers that the size in the swirl zone is weaker at hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 rates as compared to the velocity of the free stream symmetrical time averaged vortex structure is obtained for the mentioned situations moreover small scale vortical structures are obtained owing to impingement of the vortices for them prolonged wake zone that is the sign of the improvement of karman vortex shedding can readily be observed from the figures for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations the shorter shear layers compose both parts of the cylinder for the submersion level rates of hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situation because shear layers entrain into each other the mentioned flow characteristic is a typical signal of momentum transmission from the free stream flow into the swirl zone viz karman vortex shedding improves by increasing gap between cylinders the crosscut spatial content of each sheet stays relatively tight for these situations and also the existence of the other cylinder stimulates streamlines to distort to the upper part in streamline topology ψ in fig 9 see fig 10 in the mid colon of fig 9 demonstrates streamline topology ψ for distinct submersion level rates the initial significant matter is that the wake zone becomes greater streamwise and extends by the interaction between the cylinder free and bottom surfaces that can be observed for hd d 1 and 2 situations similar flow structure is also observed for hd d 0 75 situation on the other hand the size of the wake suddenly decreases with respect to the rising of the vertical elevation as seen in figure for hd d 0 5 and 0 25 situations the wake flow zone covers between cylinders for these situations and horseshoe vortex formation is observed for hd d 0 75 1 and 2 situations due to the large gap ratio 3 2 developing of strouhal number with the space ratio and distribution of saddle point between tandem cylinders the developing of non dimensional vortex shedding frequency strouhal number for the tandem cylinders configuration is demonstrated in fig 11 as a result of the space rate the strouhal number value in fig 11 remarks that the maximum value of vortex shedding frequencies 0 176 is determined for hd d 1 5 situation at l d 0 location but the minimum value of vortex shedding frequencies 0 114 is determined for hd d 1 5 situation at l d 4 however with the growth of the l d rate different occurrences are observed as the space ratio rises to a value of 0 5 the ratio of the vortex shedding frequencies increases suddenly for hd d 1 25 situation on the other hand the space ratio rises to a value of 0 5 the ratio of the vortex shedding frequencies decreases for hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations the magnitude of the vortex shedding frequencies is larger for hd d 1 25 situation until l d 2 configuration compared to hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations however the value of the frequencies is bigger for hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations compared to hd d 1 25 situation until l d 4 location at l d 4 and 5 locations the value of the frequencies is the same for hd d 1 25 and 1 75 situations the general trend is that the value of the vortex shedding frequencies decreases for hd d 1 5 and 1 75 situations as the space ratio between cylinders increases however the magnitude of the vortex shedding frequencies has high value for hd d 1 25 situation at the beginning while the value of the vortex shedding frequencies decreases severely for the same situation after l d 2 configuration as can be seen from fig 12 saddle point can be readily observed between tandem cylinders after l d 2 saddle point is observed as 1 83 for l d 2 in the all submersion height ratios hd d on the other hand saddle point increases for l d 2 5 in the hd d 1 25 and 1 75 while it decreases for same space rate in the hd d 1 5 the maximum value of saddle point is observed for l d 3 in the hd d 1 25 but it decreases for l d 3 in the hd d 1 75 due to the free surface effect however it increases again for l d 5 in the hd d 1 75 because the second cylinder starts to lose its effect see table 1 4 conclusions in the present paper the experimental yields served profoundly comprehension on the flow construction round tandem horizontal circular cylinders positioned at distinct elevations between free and bottom planes the yields provided from piv represented that the vortical flow construction was obviously viewed since the cylinders were placed on distinct elevations between free and bottom planes of the shallow water time averaged data demonstrated that there was a distinction between the main f1 and improving excursive bubble f in mark of the way of spin for the hd d 2 situation this generation gives rise to the sweep and this induced the flow transmission between wake flow zone and core for the mentioned situations merely one vortex was obviously viewed for hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 submersion height ratios for l d 1 5 and 3 gap ratios on the other hand two foci which were not well defined were observed for hd d 1 submersion level ratio for l d 1 gap ratio while only one swirl was observed for hd d 1 75 situation for l d 1 gap ratio due to the effect of downstream cylinder moreover two foci and a stagnation spot were viewed for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations for l d 1 5 and 3 gap ratios the extent of the departure zone and the departure point was influenced by the gap ratio the extent of the separation zone in the cylinder downstream increased with increasing space ratio viz the boundary layer departure point on the cylinder acted further and modified in downstream and this situation resulted in a turbulent stirring and high amount of the reynolds shear stress a large proportion of turbulent transportation happened owing to the reverse pressure gradient for these situations these turbulent transfer brought up a degradation of construction such as offshore constructions bridges marine and pipeline concerning the reynolds shear stress models negative and positive contours kept horizontal and lengthened in the streamwise way for hd d 0 5 0 75 and 1 whereas negative and positive layers were symmetric for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations reynolds stress layers lengthened through the bed owing to the bed frictional for hd d 2 however reynolds shear stress layers for hd d 1 lengthened along the open stream destination owing to the influence of the open plane the creation of vortical flow construction round bluff construction like pipelines leads to scour process for this reason it gives rise to constructional degradation of bluff body owing to the extremely energetic construction the vortices that compose in the swirl zone have extremely turbulent structure moreover the submersion height ratio highly affected the changing of turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stress that became more robust with the cylinder location in the mid stage of flow the turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stress values were highly great for hd d 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 situations owing to the greater momentum transport from the center zone into the swirl zone 
22488,the ice loads occurring in ship ice interaction are uncertain for many reasons this article addresses some of those uncertainties by studying adjacent frames and identifying cases where the peak ice load occurs on a certain frame in these cases we looked at photos of ice to identify what type of an ice response caused the load to peak we further selected the cases where the peak load was caused by a rotation of an already broken ice cusp this rotation allowed us to measure the cusp dimensions from the photos which enabled us to study two research questions first how the cusp area distribution is affected by the ice thickness and ship speed second how the peak load distribution is affected by the cusp dimensions and ship speed both of these questions were modeled with hierarchical bayesian models where the gaussian process priors compel the distribution parameters to smoothly change in varying conditions the models predict that the cusp area increases with increasing ice thickness and deceasing ship speed whereas the peak load increases with increasing cusp volume and decreasing ship speed the models were tested with posterior predictive checks which demonstrated good agreement with the models and the measurements keywords ship ice interaction ice condition ice cusp ice load hierarchical model gaussian process 1 introduction the location dimensions and magnitude of loads occurring on ship hull when the ship is breaking ice are uncertain because of many reasons the loads are affected by the diverse ice breaking conditions because of the constantly changing ship ice contact geometry daley 1991 and highly varying ice mechanical properties timco and weeks 2010 another uncertainty comes from the way the loads are measured on certain frames and the fact that the load resulting from the hull ice interaction moves along the ship hull and the magnitude varies as the ship is advancing in ice see fig 1 if the loads were measured on one or two frames alone the measured load would be uncertain compared to the peak load measured with three frames in two cases first the peak load could have occurred on the previous frame and the measured load is caused by pushing a broken ice cusp second the measured load could be from the initial crushing of the ice piece which breaks on the next frame creating the peak load this is demonstrated in fig 1 with two measured frames the load on the frame 112 5 would be deemed a peak load however measuring the load on frame 113 reveals that the load on frame 112 5 is not a peak load in these cases the measured load would be only a fraction of the peak load the method for identifying the cases where the measured load is the peak load is shown in section 2 3 due to the complex breaking process and several parameters affecting the location dimensions and magnitude of the loading multiple full scale experimental studies have been conducted over several decades to obtain knowledge on the matters some studies have compared ice loads and ice pressures to the ice and operational conditions see e g glen and blount 1984 st john et al 1990 st john and minnick 1995 kotisalo and kujala 1999 frederking 2000 hänninen et al 2001 leira et al 2009 matsuzawa et al 2010 kotilainen et al 2017 2018a others have studied the maximum ice loads in time windows of certain length e g kujala et al 2007 the highest local ice pressures e g jordaan et al 1993 the distribution for the ice loads e g kujala et al 2009 suyuthi et al 2012a 2012b and the extreme ice loads in different parts of the bow chai et al 2018 kotilainen et al 2017 showed that if loads on one frame are studied as a function of ice and operational conditions a hierarchical bayesian model could be developed to predict the load distribution in different conditions in addition to the full scale experiments there are many simulation studies about the icebreaking process these simulations allow predicting ice breaking pattern and the corresponding ice loads on the ship sawamura et al 2009 su 2011 lubbad and løset 2011 li et al 2018 in these simulations one important aspect is to determine the broken cusp s dimensions especially the characteristic length which induces the ice loads the cusp sizes have been examined in multiple studies mckindra and lutton 1981 timco 1984 sodhi et al 1985 tatinclaux 1986 lau et al 1988 1993 lau and williams 1991 irani and timco 1993 izumiyama et al 1994 which are summarized in lau et al 1999 mckindra and lutton 1981 studied ice cusp sizes in 36 full scale ice trials they found that in most trials the cusp areas followed a log normal distribution and that the ice thickness was a good predictor for the cusp area tatinclaux 1986 found in model scale experiments that the average cusp size was proportional to the ice thickness this was also found in izumiyama et al 1994 when the effect of ship speed on cusp size is concerned varsta 1983 and valanto 2001 suggested that the decreasing ice cusp sizes with increasing ship speed can be attributed to the interaction between ice and water this article continues the paper kotilainen et al 2018b where the authors studied stereo camera photos from ship s bow shoulder in order to analyze how different ice response modes e g pushed ice floes cracks propagating in ice or rotating cusps affect the peak load distribution in the ship s bow shoulder from that study we analyze further the cases where the peak load was caused by an already broken rotating ice cusp and answer two questions 1 how the ice thickness and ship speed affect the area of the rotating cusp 2 how the rotating cusp s size and ship speed affect the measured peak load answering the first question allows us to study the way the ice breaking pattern varies in different conditions this enables simulation users to calibrate their models ice breaking pattern with more empirical cusp areas to better reflect their variation with ice thickness and ship speed because the cusp rotates where the stereo camera is located it is possible to measure both the thickness and the area of the cusp the second question allows us to investigate ice loads that occurred in the same ice response modes and study how the cusp sizes affected the loads by answering both questions it is possible to simulate the cusp sizes in certain ice thickness and ship speed combinations and further simulating corresponding ice loads when those cusps rotate both these questions are answered with a model based hierarchical analysis introduced in kotilainen et al 2017 where it was used to predict ice loads on ship bow in varying ice thicknesses and ship speeds 2 data 2 1 ship and instrumentation the loads were measured onboard the polar supply and research vessel s a agulhas ii in the baltic sea during an ice trial in spring 2012 the ship was built to polar class pc5 and the hull strength is in accordance with dnv ice 10 the ship s main dimensions are presented in table 1 the ship is powered by a diesel electric propulsion system consisting of four diesel generators each producing 3 mw two 4 5 mw electric motors provide power for two controllable pitch propellers additionally there are two bow thrusters and one stern thruster for fine maneuvering the ice loads in this paper refer to the ice induced force measured on the transverse frames using shear strain gauges with a sampling frequency of 200 hz fig 2 shows the nine instrumented frames two at the bow 134 5 134 three at the bow shoulder 113 112 and four at the aft shoulder 41 39 5 the shear force acting between the sensors is determined from the force strain ratio by measuring the difference between shear strains on the upper and lower parts of the frame suominen et al 2017a in addition the strains occurring in the hull plating were measured with one directional strain gauges two each on bow and bow shoulder six on aft shoulder the studied frames are the three adjacent frames on bow shoulder 113 112 5 and 112 a stereo camera system taking pictures with a frequency of 3 hz was mounted above those frames kulovesi and lehtiranta 2014 the ship speed was measured by the ship s gps 2 2 voyage the voyage started from rauma on 19th of march 2012 due to a mild winter the ice covered only the northern part of the bothnian bay the ship arrived in the icy waters in the morning of march 21st and returned to open waters for the night a similar procedure was done on the 22nd of march fig 3 shows the map illustrating first day ice trial voyage and the ice concentrations suominen et al 2013 the measurements were ongoing while the ship was in ice and a total of 24 h of data was collected 2 3 peak load measurement if we assume that the ice cusp does not move i e ice does not drift the ice load moves from one frame to the next at the time it takes for the ship to move a single frame spacing 40 cm the loads are considered as a system of three adjacent frames and we study the cases where the highest peak load occurs on the middle frame the procedure is explained in more detail below the loads on the middle frame are identified applying a rayleigh separator 0 5 with a threshold 20 kn the forces below the threshold are discarded as noise and the force maximums are identified the rayleigh separator compares the minimum force between two maximum force peaks if the minimum is lower than the separator multiplied by the lower of the maximum force peaks the loads are considered to be separate otherwise they are considered as a one continuous load kotilainen et al 2017 now the ice loading process on the middle frame is examined more thoroughly first there is the approaching stage where the load starts growing but the middle frame is not yet in contact with the ice the measured loads on this stage are a result of reflections from other frames which are in contact with the ice after that there is the contact stage where the ice piece is being pushed rotated or crushed by the middle frame the load continues to grow until it peaks and starts to decline the peak load has multiple potential causes for it 1 the ice piece could have failed by bending or shearing 2 the ice could have moved or rotated or 3 the ship ice contact spot could have moved to the next frame as the ship has moved in ice after that there is the disengaging stage where e g the broken ice piece is pushed away and the load on the middle frame decreases however the load on the middle frame could happen in three situations a the peak load occurs in the previous frame and what is measured on the middle frame is the disengaging stage that has moved onto middle frame b the peak load occurs on middle frame or c the first contact occurs on middle frame but the contact spot moves to the next frame where the peak load occurs if only one frame is instrumented we cannot distinguish between these situations in order to identify the situation adjacent frames must to be studied the situation a can be identified by studying the previous frame 113 if the force on 113 is higher than on 112 5 it is considered to be situation a otherwise it is either b or c similarly the situation c can be identified by studying the forces on the next frame 112 if the force on 112 is higher than on 112 5 the situation is considered to be of type c otherwise it is either a or b we are interested in situation b and therefore the force on frame 112 5 must be higher than the forces on either 113 or 112 next we must decide the length of the time window where the forces are compared in order to identify the situation b the length of the time window is based on ship s movement to make sure that the highest load peak occurred on the middle frame we selected a time window of double frame spacing 80 cm backward and forward in time for a total time window of 160 cm the time window is obtained by measuring the ship speed at the instant the load peaks on 112 5 next we calculate how long it takes for the ship to move 80 cm for example if the ship speed was 4 m s the time window would be 0 8 m 4 m s 0 2 s backward and forward within this time window the maximum load on 112 5 must be higher than the maximum loads on either 113 or 112 after identifying the peak loads we need to identify the reason that caused the load to decline what happens to the ice 2 4 identifying ice response modes the stereo camera was mounted on the bow shoulder above the instrumented frames taking photos with a 3 hz frequency the next objective is to analyze the photos at the instants when the load peaked on frame 112 5 in order to find out what happened to the ice at those instants see fig 4 unfortunately the loads and stereo camera photos were measured with different computers so their timestamps are not synchronized automatically however the synchronization was done manually the timestamps were initially synchronized with a wristwatch at the start of each day after that the difference in timestamps was assumed to change slowly this assumption allows the difference to be updated at each clear event such as when an ice cusp rotated on the instrumented frames after the synchronization we looked at the stereo camera photos to determine what happened to the ice when the peak load occurred kotilainen et al 2018b recognized twelve ice response modes for example modes where the ice cusp is pushed rotated or a crack propagates in ice sheet in the bow shoulder area the response mode is usually either pushing or rotating an already broken cusp or crushing the intact ice whereas the bending failure is inhibited by the large flare angle in this paper we study the cases where the cusp rotated for a couple of reasons first this mode had the highest number of cases in it second the highest measured loads occurred in these cases third we are able to measure the cusp s dimensions which are believed to influence the load lastly the cases are comparable in a sense that there was no macro scale ice breaking that is the ice cusp has already been broken from the ice sheet and rotates against the ship hull this eliminates quite many of the unknown parameters from the ship ice interaction leaving the main hydrodynamic effect of rotating and submerging the ice cusp however this process is still uncertain since the cusp could be crushed locally while it is rotating or the cusp could hit the nearby ice floes as the ship pushes the cusp against them both of these events increase the measured peak load compared to the case of pure rotation 2 5 ice cusp measurement the measuring of the ice cusp was done from the stereo camera photos the camera was positioned above the instrumented frames 113 112 on the bow shoulder at 7 7 m above the waterline as the distance from the cusp edge to the camera was constantly changing 3d information from the stereo cameras was used in order to measure the thickness h at varying depths kulovesi and lehtiranta 2014 conversely the cusp area a was measured by its footprint i e the open water area the cusp leaves on the ice sheet because the distance to the waterline remains constant no 3d information from the stereo camera was needed and hence the cusp area could be determined from the pixel size alone the measured cusp area and thickness are illustrated in fig 5 in addition to these measurements we also measured the cusp leverage l i e the maximum distance from ship hull to the cusp edge and estimated the cusp volume v by multiplying the measured cusp area a with the ice thickness h the measurement uncertainties are discussed in section 5 3 hierarchical models and validation both the cusp area and the peak loads are modeled with bayesian hierarchical models gelman et al 2014 in these models the respective model parameters are given gaussian process priors rasmussen and williams 2006 the priors constrain the inferred model parameters to change smoothly as a function of varying conditions x the smoothness of the model parameters are approximated from the data as described in kotilainen et al 2017 this results in posterior where the parameters have a probability distribution whose parameters change smoothly in different conditions x the results are shown by discretizing the covariate conditions in 40 40 grid and predicting the expectation and standard deviation of the parameters in each grid the predictions are shown as contour lines 3 1 cusp area model instead of modeling the cusp area a directly we decided to model its square root a a which we call cusp side length plotting the histogram of a shows that it follows a gaussian distribution well now the task is to infer the way the a i varies in different covariate conditions x i ship speed and ice thickness each point a i is modeled with gaussian distribution where the mean μ a is given a gaussian process that depends on the covariates x i whereas the variance σ a 2 is assumed to be constant across different conditions x i the total variance of a i is the sum of expected variance σ a 2 and the variance of the mean σ μ 2 x i v a r a x i σ a 2 σ μ 2 x i where σ μ 2 x i k x i x i although the first term is constant across x i the second term varies with each x i and hence also the sum varies with x i 3 2 peak load model selection because the selection of different covariates produces different models we need compare them the comparison is done by 10 fold cross validation vanhatalo et al 2013 in 10 fold cross validation the data is divided into 10 blocks one block is removed and the model is inferred based on the nine remaining blocks the model is then used to calculate the likelihood of the data from the removed data block this procedure is repeated for each block and we report the sum of the negative logarithms of the likelihood called negative log predictive density the peak loads y are modeled to have a weibull distribution where the logarithms of both the scale λ and shape r parameters are given gaussian process priors the parameters are assumed to change in different conditions x by giving them an additive model which includes constant intercept linear component against each covariate and a component modeling the joint effect of covariates with a squared exponential covariance function similar to kotilainen et al 2018a for the covariates x all the models included ship speed and one of the following describing the size of the ice cusp volume v area a thickness h or leverage l i e maximum distance from the hull in addition to the 10 fold cross validation we studied each covariate s correlation with the peak load to find out how the covariates alone affect the peak loads table 2 shows both of these scores correlations reveal that all the cusp size covariates had a positive correlation with the peak load higher peak loads with increasing cusp size whereas the ship speed had a negative correlation with the peak loads lower peak loads with increasing ship speed the cross validation scores show that the models with cusp volume and area are relatively similar in their predictive capabilities nevertheless the cusp volume v was chosen as the model s covariate for the following reasons 1 highest correlation with the peak loads 2 best out of sample predictive capability 10 fold cross validation and 3 when the ice density remains constant the cusp volume corresponds to its mass there is a physical interpretation of the force required to accelerate the cusp f m a and pushing it to underwater 3 3 model validation the models are used to estimate the model parameters and their uncertainties in covariate conditions x i where the peak loads were measured the models are then validated by utilizing posterior predictive checks in these checks we use monte carlo technique to the models to simulate cusp areas or peak loads in conditions x i to generate replicated datasets after this the replicated datasets are compared to the measured data using graphical comparisons the graphical comparisons are done by comparing the histograms from one replicated dataset and the measured dataset to visually check that there are no clear discrepancies with the simulated and measured data in order to check if the measured data could have been generated by the model we use yet another check in this check we simulate 1000 replicates in each covariate location where the data was measured the simulations in each covariate location are ordered and we compare corresponding measure to the simulations to find what the measurement s quantile would be compared to the simulations talts et al 2018 if the measurements can be considered to be generated from the hierarchical model these quantiles should be uniformly distributed that is they should have an equal probability of either being high low or anything between in each covariate location 4 results fig 6 displays the model results for the mean and total standard deviation of the cusp area together with the actual cusp area measurements which are represented by the circle area the cusp areas increase with increasing ice thickness and decrease with increasing ship speeds the uncertainty for the mean of the cusp area is lowest in covariate location where most of the data occurred as expected the posterior predictive tests for the cusp area model are shown in fig 7 the top histogram shows that there are no clear discrepancies between one replicated dataset and the measured cusp sizes the scatterplot shows the quantiles of each measured cusp area compared to the 1000 simulated cusp areas in that covariate location if the model is correct the quantiles are uniformly distributed in all conditions inspecting the scatter visually there are no covariate locations where there are too many either high or low quantiles in addition the heterogeneous distribution of colors in all conditions suggest that the variance is also calibrated quite well the bottom histogram shows the observed quantiles in 10 bins together with the expected value 24 2 in dark grey line and the 0 05 0 95 interval from the binomial distribution with n 242 and p 0 1 16 31 all the observed quantiles are within the expected interval and therefore the fit is good all these tests suggest that the measured cusp sizes could have been realizations from simulating the model and therefore the model fit is good fig 8 shows the posterior expectation and standard deviation of the weibull ice load model parameters with contours together with the measured loads to illustrate the type of loads predicted by the model the covariates were divided into a 40 40 grid in each grid cell 1000 series of 100 ice loads were simulated for each series median and maximum loads were recorded the predicted loads shown in the bottom row are medians of those recorded values the loads increase with increasing cusp volume and decreasing ship speed the model results for the maximum loads are further displayed in fig 9 in order to display some of the simulation uncertainty the figure shows the 25 75 quantile of the maximum predicted load as a grey area with the 50 quantile marked as a black line the predictions are more uncertain in conditions where less loads were measured the posterior predictive tests for the ice load model are shown in figs 10 and 11 the upper histogram in fig 10 display that the model could have produced the ice loads however there is quite a lot of variation of histograms of the measured and predicted loads as the number of loads is small in most bins the lower histogram shows that most of replicated maximum loads are simulated roughly on the interval 200 400 kn the measured maximum load 206 kn is at the low end of this interval but still consistent with the replications the quantiles in fig 11 show a good heterogeneous mix of colors in all conditions x i as desired the histogram shows that one of the quantile bins is outside binomial 0 05 0 95 interval but this is also expected as the bin has a 90 chance of being in that range if the model is correct all the checks indicate that the model fit is good as they reveal no clear discrepancies with the measured data 5 discussion studying only certain kind of ice response modes allows us to compare similar loads and study how different ice floe sizes and ship speeds affect the peak loads on the frame the uncertainty related to where the load peaks is reduced by introducing the peak load concept as the load is a peak load there are no ice loads from the approaching or disengaging stage which would correspond to lower censored loads compared to the maximum peak load including these censored loads would make the load distribution almost surely exponentially declining however with the censored loads excluded the load distribution would not necessarily be exponentially declining yet as the peak load is the maximum of the load s time series weibull distribution is reasonable as it is used on modeling the extreme value distributions the load measurement is also sensitive to the load length fig 1 suggests that there is a decreasing smooth load travelling across ship frames with the short load length and the contact spot located between the frames the combined measured load is much smaller than the smooth load would indicate this means that the measured peak load is uncertain in the sense that it could have peaked between the frames and thus a lower value than the true highest peak load was measured this phenomenon is studied in suominen et al 2017b the time window where the loads are compared assumes two things the first assumption is that ship speed does not change within that time window because the ship has a lot of inertia the distance traveled is short and there are no extremely thick ice this assumption is true to a high degree the second assumption is that the ice cusp does not move parallel to the ship s motion initially this assumption is okay as the movement of the ice sheet is negligible compared to the ship speed when these cusps broken by the ship are dragging against the hull friction causes the cusps to move along with the ship this causes the cusps to move slower from one frame to the next compared to the stationary cusps for this reason a wider time window was selected the case presented in figs 4 and 5 illustrates some measurement uncertainties first the area might not be fully measured as the footprint extends beyond the area that is seen in the photo these situations are relatively rare and the approximated area is not too far off as the area left out from the photo is quite a small one if this measurement needed improvement it could done by summing the footprint areas from two different photos second the measurement ignores the part of the cusp that could be underneath the ship fortunately the cusps are mostly shaped like wedges and thus the area under the ship is small third the cusp thickness is not constant throughout the entire cusp rather it can vary because some ice layers have broken from different areas of the cusp when the cusp formed this is remedied by taking the average of the two thicknesses where it could be two measurements fourth the force measurements occasionally display large negative forces for the frame 112 the measured negative loads could result from either the instrumentation set up and load determination method when a narrow load is acting between frames or the internal structural load carrying mechanism see suominen et al 2015 2017a here it is believed to be caused by external loading acting outside the measurement area as the internal structural interaction between the frames is intensified because the frame 112 is connected to both frames 112 5 and 111 5 with horizontal plates from the web of the frames at mid span the measured cusp areas increase with increasing ice thicknesses corresponding to the observations of lau et al 1999 and others and decreasing ship speed as noted by varsta 1983 and valanto 2001 in the simulation models by su 2011 and others the broken ice cusps are deleted after the initial breaking we cannot distinguish if the cusp is the same size when it originally broke from the intact ice field or if the ship had broken it again the measurements from kotilainen et al 2018b show that peak loads occur in many more ice response modes than just ice breaking by crack propagation alone this would lead to an underestimation of the number of loads since the highest loads seem to occur in other ice response modes than in crack propagation in addition to the fact that the loads seem to follow weibull distributions with varying distribution parameters and the number of loads probably affects the highest measured load the highest measured loads are different in simulations and full scale tests the original motivation for this paper was to study if the bigger cusps in lower speeds would cause the effect of higher loads in smaller speeds with low ice thicknesses seen in kotilainen et al 2018a however even with the same sized cusps the peak loads are higher with lower speeds this can be seen in fig 8 by looking at the measurements circles in high speed and low volume conditions there are many low loads and no high loads in contrast in low speed and low volume conditions there are more high loads and not as many low loads this is contradictory to varsta 1983 who predicts that the increasing hydrodynamic pressure should increase the loads in higher speeds one plausible explanation for these measurements could be the increased ice concentration leading to two effects first this would increase the ice resistance slowing down the ship second this would increase the probability of the cusp jamming between the hull and the ice field resulting in increased loads even though the original cusps could have broken again it is still possible to learn the cusp size distribution at the bow shoulder as the parallel part of the ship begins there it is reasonable to assume that they would not be broken further at the later contacts and thus would represent the final cusp area distribution when compared to the distribution of all cusp areas there are three differences first we are studying only cases that caused the peak load of over 20 kn on the middle bow shoulder frame leading us to neglect smaller rotating cusps that caused loads below the threshold second only cusps that are seen by the stereo camera are studied this omits very large cusps but these would not have been recorded anyway as they do not rotate but are rather pushed aside or crushed third we have also omitted cases where the threshold was exceeded but because multiple tiny floes on the frame it was not possible to tell which one of them caused the load see kotilainen et al 2018b for details it could be also possible that the cusp is too large that it would fit into the photo frame the measured peak loads could be predicted by ice thickness and ship speed but the cross validation reveals that the cusp area and volume are better covariates for predicting the peak loads of these the cusp volume area multiplied by thickness is a better predictor in addition the cusp areas could be predicted well based on the ice thickness and ship speed this suggests that in order to make more accurate predictions of peak loads from rotating cusps in different ice thickness and ship speed conditions the predictions should be done in steps first one should predict the cusp areas in different ice thicknesses and ship speeds second the predicted cusp areas should be multiplied with the ice thickness to obtain the cusp volumes finally the cusp volumes should be used together with the ship speed to predict the peak loads the model could be improved by considering a physical model this model would combine the forces required to rotate translate and submerge the cusp the rotational component should depend on the cusp s rotational moment and the angle that cusp rotates the rotational moment can be calculated if we assume that the rotational axis is parallel to the ship s hull and goes through the cusp s center of gravity the vertices needed to capture the 3d information of the cusp can be located above and under water at the points where the cusp area was determined with the ice thickness separating the z coordinates the assumption here would be that the cusps are of uniform thickness the rotational angle could be analyzed from the stereo camera photos by analyzing how much the cusp s surface recognized by the stereo camera program rotates between each photo the translational force of the cusp being pushed in the water would be very difficult to measure but potentially possible by tracking where the cusp s center of gravity moves in the photos the submerging component is again easier to measure because the stereo camera photos can be utilized to measure the z coordinate of the points when the measured ice cusp position is compared with the pure rotation case the submersion component can be measured determining the contact forces with the cusp and other ice pieces seems very difficult suggesting that these cases should be removed from the analysis in future studies other ice response modes could be studied with a similar method mounting a camera above the instrumented bow frames where the flare angle is lower would allow us to measure the forming cusp sizes and the corresponding loads of ice bending failure 6 conclusion the uncertainties regarding the load measurement were reduced by studying the adjacent frames and selecting events when the load peaked on the middle frame then we studied what happened to the ice on the frame when the load peaked from different ice response modes rotating cusps were selected because we could measure the cusp sizes in those cases we modeled how the distributions for the cusp areas and the corresponding peak loads changed in different conditions ice cusp area increases in higher thicknesses and smaller ship speeds whereas the peak load corresponding to the rotating cusp increases in higher cusp volumes and lower ship speeds posterior predictive checks indicate that both models are predicting the measured data well model could be improved by implementing a physical model and measuring the rotational translational and submerging components

22488,the ice loads occurring in ship ice interaction are uncertain for many reasons this article addresses some of those uncertainties by studying adjacent frames and identifying cases where the peak ice load occurs on a certain frame in these cases we looked at photos of ice to identify what type of an ice response caused the load to peak we further selected the cases where the peak load was caused by a rotation of an already broken ice cusp this rotation allowed us to measure the cusp dimensions from the photos which enabled us to study two research questions first how the cusp area distribution is affected by the ice thickness and ship speed second how the peak load distribution is affected by the cusp dimensions and ship speed both of these questions were modeled with hierarchical bayesian models where the gaussian process priors compel the distribution parameters to smoothly change in varying conditions the models predict that the cusp area increases with increasing ice thickness and deceasing ship speed whereas the peak load increases with increasing cusp volume and decreasing ship speed the models were tested with posterior predictive checks which demonstrated good agreement with the models and the measurements keywords ship ice interaction ice condition ice cusp ice load hierarchical model gaussian process 1 introduction the location dimensions and magnitude of loads occurring on ship hull when the ship is breaking ice are uncertain because of many reasons the loads are affected by the diverse ice breaking conditions because of the constantly changing ship ice contact geometry daley 1991 and highly varying ice mechanical properties timco and weeks 2010 another uncertainty comes from the way the loads are measured on certain frames and the fact that the load resulting from the hull ice interaction moves along the ship hull and the magnitude varies as the ship is advancing in ice see fig 1 if the loads were measured on one or two frames alone the measured load would be uncertain compared to the peak load measured with three frames in two cases first the peak load could have occurred on the previous frame and the measured load is caused by pushing a broken ice cusp second the measured load could be from the initial crushing of the ice piece which breaks on the next frame creating the peak load this is demonstrated in fig 1 with two measured frames the load on the frame 112 5 would be deemed a peak load however measuring the load on frame 113 reveals that the load on frame 112 5 is not a peak load in these cases the measured load would be only a fraction of the peak load the method for identifying the cases where the measured load is the peak load is shown in section 2 3 due to the complex breaking process and several parameters affecting the location dimensions and magnitude of the loading multiple full scale experimental studies have been conducted over several decades to obtain knowledge on the matters some studies have compared ice loads and ice pressures to the ice and operational conditions see e g glen and blount 1984 st john et al 1990 st john and minnick 1995 kotisalo and kujala 1999 frederking 2000 hänninen et al 2001 leira et al 2009 matsuzawa et al 2010 kotilainen et al 2017 2018a others have studied the maximum ice loads in time windows of certain length e g kujala et al 2007 the highest local ice pressures e g jordaan et al 1993 the distribution for the ice loads e g kujala et al 2009 suyuthi et al 2012a 2012b and the extreme ice loads in different parts of the bow chai et al 2018 kotilainen et al 2017 showed that if loads on one frame are studied as a function of ice and operational conditions a hierarchical bayesian model could be developed to predict the load distribution in different conditions in addition to the full scale experiments there are many simulation studies about the icebreaking process these simulations allow predicting ice breaking pattern and the corresponding ice loads on the ship sawamura et al 2009 su 2011 lubbad and løset 2011 li et al 2018 in these simulations one important aspect is to determine the broken cusp s dimensions especially the characteristic length which induces the ice loads the cusp sizes have been examined in multiple studies mckindra and lutton 1981 timco 1984 sodhi et al 1985 tatinclaux 1986 lau et al 1988 1993 lau and williams 1991 irani and timco 1993 izumiyama et al 1994 which are summarized in lau et al 1999 mckindra and lutton 1981 studied ice cusp sizes in 36 full scale ice trials they found that in most trials the cusp areas followed a log normal distribution and that the ice thickness was a good predictor for the cusp area tatinclaux 1986 found in model scale experiments that the average cusp size was proportional to the ice thickness this was also found in izumiyama et al 1994 when the effect of ship speed on cusp size is concerned varsta 1983 and valanto 2001 suggested that the decreasing ice cusp sizes with increasing ship speed can be attributed to the interaction between ice and water this article continues the paper kotilainen et al 2018b where the authors studied stereo camera photos from ship s bow shoulder in order to analyze how different ice response modes e g pushed ice floes cracks propagating in ice or rotating cusps affect the peak load distribution in the ship s bow shoulder from that study we analyze further the cases where the peak load was caused by an already broken rotating ice cusp and answer two questions 1 how the ice thickness and ship speed affect the area of the rotating cusp 2 how the rotating cusp s size and ship speed affect the measured peak load answering the first question allows us to study the way the ice breaking pattern varies in different conditions this enables simulation users to calibrate their models ice breaking pattern with more empirical cusp areas to better reflect their variation with ice thickness and ship speed because the cusp rotates where the stereo camera is located it is possible to measure both the thickness and the area of the cusp the second question allows us to investigate ice loads that occurred in the same ice response modes and study how the cusp sizes affected the loads by answering both questions it is possible to simulate the cusp sizes in certain ice thickness and ship speed combinations and further simulating corresponding ice loads when those cusps rotate both these questions are answered with a model based hierarchical analysis introduced in kotilainen et al 2017 where it was used to predict ice loads on ship bow in varying ice thicknesses and ship speeds 2 data 2 1 ship and instrumentation the loads were measured onboard the polar supply and research vessel s a agulhas ii in the baltic sea during an ice trial in spring 2012 the ship was built to polar class pc5 and the hull strength is in accordance with dnv ice 10 the ship s main dimensions are presented in table 1 the ship is powered by a diesel electric propulsion system consisting of four diesel generators each producing 3 mw two 4 5 mw electric motors provide power for two controllable pitch propellers additionally there are two bow thrusters and one stern thruster for fine maneuvering the ice loads in this paper refer to the ice induced force measured on the transverse frames using shear strain gauges with a sampling frequency of 200 hz fig 2 shows the nine instrumented frames two at the bow 134 5 134 three at the bow shoulder 113 112 and four at the aft shoulder 41 39 5 the shear force acting between the sensors is determined from the force strain ratio by measuring the difference between shear strains on the upper and lower parts of the frame suominen et al 2017a in addition the strains occurring in the hull plating were measured with one directional strain gauges two each on bow and bow shoulder six on aft shoulder the studied frames are the three adjacent frames on bow shoulder 113 112 5 and 112 a stereo camera system taking pictures with a frequency of 3 hz was mounted above those frames kulovesi and lehtiranta 2014 the ship speed was measured by the ship s gps 2 2 voyage the voyage started from rauma on 19th of march 2012 due to a mild winter the ice covered only the northern part of the bothnian bay the ship arrived in the icy waters in the morning of march 21st and returned to open waters for the night a similar procedure was done on the 22nd of march fig 3 shows the map illustrating first day ice trial voyage and the ice concentrations suominen et al 2013 the measurements were ongoing while the ship was in ice and a total of 24 h of data was collected 2 3 peak load measurement if we assume that the ice cusp does not move i e ice does not drift the ice load moves from one frame to the next at the time it takes for the ship to move a single frame spacing 40 cm the loads are considered as a system of three adjacent frames and we study the cases where the highest peak load occurs on the middle frame the procedure is explained in more detail below the loads on the middle frame are identified applying a rayleigh separator 0 5 with a threshold 20 kn the forces below the threshold are discarded as noise and the force maximums are identified the rayleigh separator compares the minimum force between two maximum force peaks if the minimum is lower than the separator multiplied by the lower of the maximum force peaks the loads are considered to be separate otherwise they are considered as a one continuous load kotilainen et al 2017 now the ice loading process on the middle frame is examined more thoroughly first there is the approaching stage where the load starts growing but the middle frame is not yet in contact with the ice the measured loads on this stage are a result of reflections from other frames which are in contact with the ice after that there is the contact stage where the ice piece is being pushed rotated or crushed by the middle frame the load continues to grow until it peaks and starts to decline the peak load has multiple potential causes for it 1 the ice piece could have failed by bending or shearing 2 the ice could have moved or rotated or 3 the ship ice contact spot could have moved to the next frame as the ship has moved in ice after that there is the disengaging stage where e g the broken ice piece is pushed away and the load on the middle frame decreases however the load on the middle frame could happen in three situations a the peak load occurs in the previous frame and what is measured on the middle frame is the disengaging stage that has moved onto middle frame b the peak load occurs on middle frame or c the first contact occurs on middle frame but the contact spot moves to the next frame where the peak load occurs if only one frame is instrumented we cannot distinguish between these situations in order to identify the situation adjacent frames must to be studied the situation a can be identified by studying the previous frame 113 if the force on 113 is higher than on 112 5 it is considered to be situation a otherwise it is either b or c similarly the situation c can be identified by studying the forces on the next frame 112 if the force on 112 is higher than on 112 5 the situation is considered to be of type c otherwise it is either a or b we are interested in situation b and therefore the force on frame 112 5 must be higher than the forces on either 113 or 112 next we must decide the length of the time window where the forces are compared in order to identify the situation b the length of the time window is based on ship s movement to make sure that the highest load peak occurred on the middle frame we selected a time window of double frame spacing 80 cm backward and forward in time for a total time window of 160 cm the time window is obtained by measuring the ship speed at the instant the load peaks on 112 5 next we calculate how long it takes for the ship to move 80 cm for example if the ship speed was 4 m s the time window would be 0 8 m 4 m s 0 2 s backward and forward within this time window the maximum load on 112 5 must be higher than the maximum loads on either 113 or 112 after identifying the peak loads we need to identify the reason that caused the load to decline what happens to the ice 2 4 identifying ice response modes the stereo camera was mounted on the bow shoulder above the instrumented frames taking photos with a 3 hz frequency the next objective is to analyze the photos at the instants when the load peaked on frame 112 5 in order to find out what happened to the ice at those instants see fig 4 unfortunately the loads and stereo camera photos were measured with different computers so their timestamps are not synchronized automatically however the synchronization was done manually the timestamps were initially synchronized with a wristwatch at the start of each day after that the difference in timestamps was assumed to change slowly this assumption allows the difference to be updated at each clear event such as when an ice cusp rotated on the instrumented frames after the synchronization we looked at the stereo camera photos to determine what happened to the ice when the peak load occurred kotilainen et al 2018b recognized twelve ice response modes for example modes where the ice cusp is pushed rotated or a crack propagates in ice sheet in the bow shoulder area the response mode is usually either pushing or rotating an already broken cusp or crushing the intact ice whereas the bending failure is inhibited by the large flare angle in this paper we study the cases where the cusp rotated for a couple of reasons first this mode had the highest number of cases in it second the highest measured loads occurred in these cases third we are able to measure the cusp s dimensions which are believed to influence the load lastly the cases are comparable in a sense that there was no macro scale ice breaking that is the ice cusp has already been broken from the ice sheet and rotates against the ship hull this eliminates quite many of the unknown parameters from the ship ice interaction leaving the main hydrodynamic effect of rotating and submerging the ice cusp however this process is still uncertain since the cusp could be crushed locally while it is rotating or the cusp could hit the nearby ice floes as the ship pushes the cusp against them both of these events increase the measured peak load compared to the case of pure rotation 2 5 ice cusp measurement the measuring of the ice cusp was done from the stereo camera photos the camera was positioned above the instrumented frames 113 112 on the bow shoulder at 7 7 m above the waterline as the distance from the cusp edge to the camera was constantly changing 3d information from the stereo cameras was used in order to measure the thickness h at varying depths kulovesi and lehtiranta 2014 conversely the cusp area a was measured by its footprint i e the open water area the cusp leaves on the ice sheet because the distance to the waterline remains constant no 3d information from the stereo camera was needed and hence the cusp area could be determined from the pixel size alone the measured cusp area and thickness are illustrated in fig 5 in addition to these measurements we also measured the cusp leverage l i e the maximum distance from ship hull to the cusp edge and estimated the cusp volume v by multiplying the measured cusp area a with the ice thickness h the measurement uncertainties are discussed in section 5 3 hierarchical models and validation both the cusp area and the peak loads are modeled with bayesian hierarchical models gelman et al 2014 in these models the respective model parameters are given gaussian process priors rasmussen and williams 2006 the priors constrain the inferred model parameters to change smoothly as a function of varying conditions x the smoothness of the model parameters are approximated from the data as described in kotilainen et al 2017 this results in posterior where the parameters have a probability distribution whose parameters change smoothly in different conditions x the results are shown by discretizing the covariate conditions in 40 40 grid and predicting the expectation and standard deviation of the parameters in each grid the predictions are shown as contour lines 3 1 cusp area model instead of modeling the cusp area a directly we decided to model its square root a a which we call cusp side length plotting the histogram of a shows that it follows a gaussian distribution well now the task is to infer the way the a i varies in different covariate conditions x i ship speed and ice thickness each point a i is modeled with gaussian distribution where the mean μ a is given a gaussian process that depends on the covariates x i whereas the variance σ a 2 is assumed to be constant across different conditions x i the total variance of a i is the sum of expected variance σ a 2 and the variance of the mean σ μ 2 x i v a r a x i σ a 2 σ μ 2 x i where σ μ 2 x i k x i x i although the first term is constant across x i the second term varies with each x i and hence also the sum varies with x i 3 2 peak load model selection because the selection of different covariates produces different models we need compare them the comparison is done by 10 fold cross validation vanhatalo et al 2013 in 10 fold cross validation the data is divided into 10 blocks one block is removed and the model is inferred based on the nine remaining blocks the model is then used to calculate the likelihood of the data from the removed data block this procedure is repeated for each block and we report the sum of the negative logarithms of the likelihood called negative log predictive density the peak loads y are modeled to have a weibull distribution where the logarithms of both the scale λ and shape r parameters are given gaussian process priors the parameters are assumed to change in different conditions x by giving them an additive model which includes constant intercept linear component against each covariate and a component modeling the joint effect of covariates with a squared exponential covariance function similar to kotilainen et al 2018a for the covariates x all the models included ship speed and one of the following describing the size of the ice cusp volume v area a thickness h or leverage l i e maximum distance from the hull in addition to the 10 fold cross validation we studied each covariate s correlation with the peak load to find out how the covariates alone affect the peak loads table 2 shows both of these scores correlations reveal that all the cusp size covariates had a positive correlation with the peak load higher peak loads with increasing cusp size whereas the ship speed had a negative correlation with the peak loads lower peak loads with increasing ship speed the cross validation scores show that the models with cusp volume and area are relatively similar in their predictive capabilities nevertheless the cusp volume v was chosen as the model s covariate for the following reasons 1 highest correlation with the peak loads 2 best out of sample predictive capability 10 fold cross validation and 3 when the ice density remains constant the cusp volume corresponds to its mass there is a physical interpretation of the force required to accelerate the cusp f m a and pushing it to underwater 3 3 model validation the models are used to estimate the model parameters and their uncertainties in covariate conditions x i where the peak loads were measured the models are then validated by utilizing posterior predictive checks in these checks we use monte carlo technique to the models to simulate cusp areas or peak loads in conditions x i to generate replicated datasets after this the replicated datasets are compared to the measured data using graphical comparisons the graphical comparisons are done by comparing the histograms from one replicated dataset and the measured dataset to visually check that there are no clear discrepancies with the simulated and measured data in order to check if the measured data could have been generated by the model we use yet another check in this check we simulate 1000 replicates in each covariate location where the data was measured the simulations in each covariate location are ordered and we compare corresponding measure to the simulations to find what the measurement s quantile would be compared to the simulations talts et al 2018 if the measurements can be considered to be generated from the hierarchical model these quantiles should be uniformly distributed that is they should have an equal probability of either being high low or anything between in each covariate location 4 results fig 6 displays the model results for the mean and total standard deviation of the cusp area together with the actual cusp area measurements which are represented by the circle area the cusp areas increase with increasing ice thickness and decrease with increasing ship speeds the uncertainty for the mean of the cusp area is lowest in covariate location where most of the data occurred as expected the posterior predictive tests for the cusp area model are shown in fig 7 the top histogram shows that there are no clear discrepancies between one replicated dataset and the measured cusp sizes the scatterplot shows the quantiles of each measured cusp area compared to the 1000 simulated cusp areas in that covariate location if the model is correct the quantiles are uniformly distributed in all conditions inspecting the scatter visually there are no covariate locations where there are too many either high or low quantiles in addition the heterogeneous distribution of colors in all conditions suggest that the variance is also calibrated quite well the bottom histogram shows the observed quantiles in 10 bins together with the expected value 24 2 in dark grey line and the 0 05 0 95 interval from the binomial distribution with n 242 and p 0 1 16 31 all the observed quantiles are within the expected interval and therefore the fit is good all these tests suggest that the measured cusp sizes could have been realizations from simulating the model and therefore the model fit is good fig 8 shows the posterior expectation and standard deviation of the weibull ice load model parameters with contours together with the measured loads to illustrate the type of loads predicted by the model the covariates were divided into a 40 40 grid in each grid cell 1000 series of 100 ice loads were simulated for each series median and maximum loads were recorded the predicted loads shown in the bottom row are medians of those recorded values the loads increase with increasing cusp volume and decreasing ship speed the model results for the maximum loads are further displayed in fig 9 in order to display some of the simulation uncertainty the figure shows the 25 75 quantile of the maximum predicted load as a grey area with the 50 quantile marked as a black line the predictions are more uncertain in conditions where less loads were measured the posterior predictive tests for the ice load model are shown in figs 10 and 11 the upper histogram in fig 10 display that the model could have produced the ice loads however there is quite a lot of variation of histograms of the measured and predicted loads as the number of loads is small in most bins the lower histogram shows that most of replicated maximum loads are simulated roughly on the interval 200 400 kn the measured maximum load 206 kn is at the low end of this interval but still consistent with the replications the quantiles in fig 11 show a good heterogeneous mix of colors in all conditions x i as desired the histogram shows that one of the quantile bins is outside binomial 0 05 0 95 interval but this is also expected as the bin has a 90 chance of being in that range if the model is correct all the checks indicate that the model fit is good as they reveal no clear discrepancies with the measured data 5 discussion studying only certain kind of ice response modes allows us to compare similar loads and study how different ice floe sizes and ship speeds affect the peak loads on the frame the uncertainty related to where the load peaks is reduced by introducing the peak load concept as the load is a peak load there are no ice loads from the approaching or disengaging stage which would correspond to lower censored loads compared to the maximum peak load including these censored loads would make the load distribution almost surely exponentially declining however with the censored loads excluded the load distribution would not necessarily be exponentially declining yet as the peak load is the maximum of the load s time series weibull distribution is reasonable as it is used on modeling the extreme value distributions the load measurement is also sensitive to the load length fig 1 suggests that there is a decreasing smooth load travelling across ship frames with the short load length and the contact spot located between the frames the combined measured load is much smaller than the smooth load would indicate this means that the measured peak load is uncertain in the sense that it could have peaked between the frames and thus a lower value than the true highest peak load was measured this phenomenon is studied in suominen et al 2017b the time window where the loads are compared assumes two things the first assumption is that ship speed does not change within that time window because the ship has a lot of inertia the distance traveled is short and there are no extremely thick ice this assumption is true to a high degree the second assumption is that the ice cusp does not move parallel to the ship s motion initially this assumption is okay as the movement of the ice sheet is negligible compared to the ship speed when these cusps broken by the ship are dragging against the hull friction causes the cusps to move along with the ship this causes the cusps to move slower from one frame to the next compared to the stationary cusps for this reason a wider time window was selected the case presented in figs 4 and 5 illustrates some measurement uncertainties first the area might not be fully measured as the footprint extends beyond the area that is seen in the photo these situations are relatively rare and the approximated area is not too far off as the area left out from the photo is quite a small one if this measurement needed improvement it could done by summing the footprint areas from two different photos second the measurement ignores the part of the cusp that could be underneath the ship fortunately the cusps are mostly shaped like wedges and thus the area under the ship is small third the cusp thickness is not constant throughout the entire cusp rather it can vary because some ice layers have broken from different areas of the cusp when the cusp formed this is remedied by taking the average of the two thicknesses where it could be two measurements fourth the force measurements occasionally display large negative forces for the frame 112 the measured negative loads could result from either the instrumentation set up and load determination method when a narrow load is acting between frames or the internal structural load carrying mechanism see suominen et al 2015 2017a here it is believed to be caused by external loading acting outside the measurement area as the internal structural interaction between the frames is intensified because the frame 112 is connected to both frames 112 5 and 111 5 with horizontal plates from the web of the frames at mid span the measured cusp areas increase with increasing ice thicknesses corresponding to the observations of lau et al 1999 and others and decreasing ship speed as noted by varsta 1983 and valanto 2001 in the simulation models by su 2011 and others the broken ice cusps are deleted after the initial breaking we cannot distinguish if the cusp is the same size when it originally broke from the intact ice field or if the ship had broken it again the measurements from kotilainen et al 2018b show that peak loads occur in many more ice response modes than just ice breaking by crack propagation alone this would lead to an underestimation of the number of loads since the highest loads seem to occur in other ice response modes than in crack propagation in addition to the fact that the loads seem to follow weibull distributions with varying distribution parameters and the number of loads probably affects the highest measured load the highest measured loads are different in simulations and full scale tests the original motivation for this paper was to study if the bigger cusps in lower speeds would cause the effect of higher loads in smaller speeds with low ice thicknesses seen in kotilainen et al 2018a however even with the same sized cusps the peak loads are higher with lower speeds this can be seen in fig 8 by looking at the measurements circles in high speed and low volume conditions there are many low loads and no high loads in contrast in low speed and low volume conditions there are more high loads and not as many low loads this is contradictory to varsta 1983 who predicts that the increasing hydrodynamic pressure should increase the loads in higher speeds one plausible explanation for these measurements could be the increased ice concentration leading to two effects first this would increase the ice resistance slowing down the ship second this would increase the probability of the cusp jamming between the hull and the ice field resulting in increased loads even though the original cusps could have broken again it is still possible to learn the cusp size distribution at the bow shoulder as the parallel part of the ship begins there it is reasonable to assume that they would not be broken further at the later contacts and thus would represent the final cusp area distribution when compared to the distribution of all cusp areas there are three differences first we are studying only cases that caused the peak load of over 20 kn on the middle bow shoulder frame leading us to neglect smaller rotating cusps that caused loads below the threshold second only cusps that are seen by the stereo camera are studied this omits very large cusps but these would not have been recorded anyway as they do not rotate but are rather pushed aside or crushed third we have also omitted cases where the threshold was exceeded but because multiple tiny floes on the frame it was not possible to tell which one of them caused the load see kotilainen et al 2018b for details it could be also possible that the cusp is too large that it would fit into the photo frame the measured peak loads could be predicted by ice thickness and ship speed but the cross validation reveals that the cusp area and volume are better covariates for predicting the peak loads of these the cusp volume area multiplied by thickness is a better predictor in addition the cusp areas could be predicted well based on the ice thickness and ship speed this suggests that in order to make more accurate predictions of peak loads from rotating cusps in different ice thickness and ship speed conditions the predictions should be done in steps first one should predict the cusp areas in different ice thicknesses and ship speeds second the predicted cusp areas should be multiplied with the ice thickness to obtain the cusp volumes finally the cusp volumes should be used together with the ship speed to predict the peak loads the model could be improved by considering a physical model this model would combine the forces required to rotate translate and submerge the cusp the rotational component should depend on the cusp s rotational moment and the angle that cusp rotates the rotational moment can be calculated if we assume that the rotational axis is parallel to the ship s hull and goes through the cusp s center of gravity the vertices needed to capture the 3d information of the cusp can be located above and under water at the points where the cusp area was determined with the ice thickness separating the z coordinates the assumption here would be that the cusps are of uniform thickness the rotational angle could be analyzed from the stereo camera photos by analyzing how much the cusp s surface recognized by the stereo camera program rotates between each photo the translational force of the cusp being pushed in the water would be very difficult to measure but potentially possible by tracking where the cusp s center of gravity moves in the photos the submerging component is again easier to measure because the stereo camera photos can be utilized to measure the z coordinate of the points when the measured ice cusp position is compared with the pure rotation case the submersion component can be measured determining the contact forces with the cusp and other ice pieces seems very difficult suggesting that these cases should be removed from the analysis in future studies other ice response modes could be studied with a similar method mounting a camera above the instrumented bow frames where the flare angle is lower would allow us to measure the forming cusp sizes and the corresponding loads of ice bending failure 6 conclusion the uncertainties regarding the load measurement were reduced by studying the adjacent frames and selecting events when the load peaked on the middle frame then we studied what happened to the ice on the frame when the load peaked from different ice response modes rotating cusps were selected because we could measure the cusp sizes in those cases we modeled how the distributions for the cusp areas and the corresponding peak loads changed in different conditions ice cusp area increases in higher thicknesses and smaller ship speeds whereas the peak load corresponding to the rotating cusp increases in higher cusp volumes and lower ship speeds posterior predictive checks indicate that both models are predicting the measured data well model could be improved by implementing a physical model and measuring the rotational translational and submerging components

22489,the flows around two tandem circular cylinders in the subcritical and supercritical flow regimes are studied through three dimensional numerical simulations different spacing ratios l d where l is the center to center distance between the two cylinders with d being the diameter of the cylinders from 2 0 to 5 0 is considered the instantaneous flow structures pressure distributions and hydrodynamic forces on two tandem cylinders are analyzed at subcritical r e 2 2 10 4 and supercritical r e 3 0 10 6 reynolds numbers the present numerical solutions demonstrated that at the two r e for l d 3 5 the shear layer from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the surface of the downstream cylinder and vortex street is only formed behind the downstream cylinder while the shear layer from the upstream cylinder rolls up alternately for l d 3 5 and vortex shedding occurs from both upstream and downstream cylinders compared with the flow characteristics at r e 2 2 10 4 for r e 3 0 10 6 the flow separation positions on the upstream cylinder move backward and the width of the wake behind the upstream cylinder becomes narrower which leads to forward movement of the reattachment position at the supercritical reynolds number the mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream cylinder are nearly independent of l d while the sharp increase of force coefficients of the downstream cylinder occurs for l d 3 5 comparing to the case at the subcritical reynolds number higher vortex shedding frequencies from the upstream and downstream cylinders are identified it is also revealed that the slope of the best fit line for φ the phase lag of the fluctuating lift force between two cylinders and l d increases at the supercritical reynolds number in addition for l d 2 5 the mean drag coefficients of the upstream cylinder decrease sharply for r e 1 0 10 5 while those of the downstream cylinder rise slightly with the growing r e moreover the fluctuating lift

floating structures have been widely adopted in the field of offshore oil and gas exploration and ocean renewable energy in the past few decades because of their favorable motion performance and large deck space recently with the development of deep draft multi column floater lee et al 2014 antony et al 2015 due to vortex shedding behind the columns in fluid the vortex induced motions vim become more significant for such platform large amplitude vim can not only impact the mooring and riser systems but also may cause collision between the floating structure and the nearby supporting vessels hence vim has become a critical issue during the design and optimization of multi column floating structures extensive studies on vim have been performed in model scale r e 10 5 r e u c d c υ where d c is the column diameter u c is the current velocity υ represents the kinematic viscosity of the water waals et al 2007 kim et al 2011 gonçalves et al 2012 antony et al 2015 chen and chen 2016 koop et al 2016 however the observed vim amplitudes of the multi column floating structures in field measurements are much less than those obtained from model test in towing tank see rijken and leverette 2009 and ma et al 2013 although a number of experimental studies on vim of multi column floating structures have been performed in model scale the factor causing the significant differences between model test and field measurements is still an open question for example the scale effect associated with r e on the vim is an enigma measuring and evaluating the vim at the full scale r e in the order of 10 5 to 10 7 continue to be challenging the fundamental mechanisms giving rise to vim in full scale are still not well understood in order to assess the vim in full scale and investigate the scale effects it is needed to understand the flow interferences between multiple columns at the high reynolds numbers i e r e 10 6 the columns with circular or square cross section are very common for multi column floating structures such as tension leg platform tlp and semi submersible platform semi gonçalves et al 2012 chen and chen 2016 wu et al 2014 further the tandem arrangement of two cylinders is the basic configuration for the array of multiple columns and involves most of the common flow features such as flow separation reattachment of shear layers and interacting vortex streets sumer 2006 therefore investigations on the flow around two circular cylinders in tandem arrangement at high reynolds numbers are necessary for better understanding the physics of the flow passing multi column floating structures in full scale in the earlier studies the flow interference between two cylinders in tandem arrangement was identified as wake interference by zdravkovich 1987 who classified the flow around two tandem cylinders into three different flow regimes based on the different spacing ratios l d 6 sumner et al 1999 employed flow visualization and particle image velocimetry piv to study the flow field around the two tandem cylinders for 1 0 l d 3 0 at 1200 r e 3800 three types of hydrodynamic behaviors were identified for different l d for l d 1 0 the cylinders behave like a single cylinder for l d 1 5 and 2 0 a recirculation zone can be formed behind each cylinder while its streamwise growth is constrained for l d 2 5 and 3 0 the independent recirculation zones similar to a single cylinder are formed lin et al 2002 adopted piv to investigate the instantaneous and averaged patterns of velocity and vorticity for the flow around two tandem cylinders at r e 1 0 10 4 it was found that the symmetrical and asymmetrical patterns occurred in the gap region for l d 2 0 while the kármán like vortices were formed in the gap region for l d 5 1 zhou and yiu 2006 investigated the wake structure and vortex dynamics at r e 7 10 3 using hot wire anemometry two different flow structures in the reattachment regime were identified the shear layer reattachment occurred at the rear surface of the downstream cylinder for 2 l d 3 while it occurred at the leading surface of the downstream cylinder for 3 l d 5 on the other hand the behaviors of the surface pressure coefficients drag and lift force coefficients and the strouhal number s t for the flow around the tandem cylinders have also been investigated okajima 1979 measured the drag coefficients and s t for 4 10 4 r e 6 3 10 5 in a low speed wind tunnel the critical spacing l d 3 8 was observed for r e 2 5 10 5 while the jump of drag coefficient disappeared for 2 5 10 5 r e 6 3 10 5 igarashi 1981 found that the fluctuating surface pressure drag coefficient and s t were sensitive to l d at 1 7 10 4 r e 5 2 10 4 and the sudden jump in drag coefficient and s t occurred for l d 3 5 arie et al 1983 measured the pressure fluctuations on the surfaces of two tandem cylinders and found that the fluctuating surface pressure on each cylinder increase sharply when the spacing ratio is greater than the critical spacing l d 3 8 at r e 1 57 10 5 ljungkrona et al 1991 found the critical spacing decreased from 3 5 to 2 5 as the turbulence intensity grew from 0 1 to 1 4 at r e 2 0 10 4 gu 1996 measured the mean pressure distributions on the tandem cylinders at r e 4 10 5 for l d 3 0 three different patterns of pressure distributions on the downstream cylinder were observed for l d 2 2 alam et al 2003 measured the fluctuating lift and drag forces acting on two circular cylinders in tandem arrangement at r e 6 5 10 4 they found that the fluctuating lift and drag forces acting on the downstream cylinder were very sensitive to the spacing ratios and the fluctuating fluid forces were correlated with the reattachment positions xu and zhou 2004 investigated the vortex shedding frequencies of the tandem cylinders using two hot wires placed behind each cylinder for a wide range of reynolds numbers 800 r e 4 2 10 4 and spacing ratios 1 l d 15 they found the critical spacing was l d 4 5 at r e 1 2 10 3 while it was l d 3 0 at r e 4 2 10 4 kitagawa and ohta 2008 adopted large eddy simulation les to investigate the flow around two circular cylinders in tandem arrangement for 2 l d 5 at r e 2 2 10 4 they concluded that at the critical spacing l d 3 25 the mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients of each cylinder jumped to higher values the phase lag between the fluctuating lift forces on the upstream and downstream cylinders was correlated to l d neuhart et al 2009 investigated the unsteady wake interference between two tandem cylinders at r e 1 66 10 5 using piv and studied the effect of boundary layer tripping along the downstream cylinder for different spacing ratios tsutsui 2012 examined the fluctuation of the fluid forces acting on the tandem cylinders for l d 1 2 at 3 8 10 4 r e 1 3 10 5 he found that the phase shift between the drag and lift coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders were 5 16 and 3 16 respectively and the curve of the lissajous figure of the upstream cylinder was different from that for a single cylinder weinmann et al 2014 applied a numerical model which combines the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and les to simulate the flow around the two tandem cylinders at r e 1 66 10 5 for l d 3 7 and the computed surface pressure distributions were compared with the experimental data gopalan and jaiman 2015 simulated the flow interference between tandem cylinders based the hybrid rans les methods with non linear eddy viscosity formulations at r e 1 66 10 5 for l d 1 4 3 0 and 3 7 the bistable wake between the cylinders and the drag inversion on the downstream cylinder was observed for l d 3 0 they also found that the bistable wake led to increase in the turbulent kinetic energy in the gap between the cylinders as mentioned above most of the numerical and experimental studies were focused on the flow structures and fluid forces on the two tandem cylinders in the subcritical flow regime however the r e in the most of practical applications in offshore engineering is usually in the order of 10 5 to 10 7 corresponding to the supercritical or transcritical flow regimes respectively the behaviors of flow across two tandem cylinders need to be thoroughly investigated in supercritical and transcritical flow regimes there are only several studies on the flow characteristic of a single cylinder in supercritical and transcritical flow regimes roshko 1961 schewe 1983 hinsberg 2015 schewe 1983 took the measurements of a single cylinder from subcritical up to transcritical reynolds numbers 2 3 10 4 r e 7 1 10 6 a drop of drag and lift forces and a jump of s t were observed at r e 3 5 10 5 due to the boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent flow hinsberg 2015 experimentally investigated the unsteady aerodynamic forces and surface pressure on a slightly rough circular cylinder at 1 5 10 4 r e 1 2 10 7 it was observed that the separation point of the boundary layer shifted to the rear of the cylinder in the supercritical and transcritical regimes in addition rodríguez et al 2015 investigated the wake topology and found that the wake width in the supercritical or transcritical regimes was narrower comparing to that in the subcritical regime for the two tandem cylinders the experimental study by okajima 1979 showed that the jump of the drag coefficient at the critical spacing l d 3 8 disappeared in the supercritical regime r e 6 3 10 5 and the drag coefficients and s t of both cylinders were slightly affected by the spacing ratio in short few of the previous studies attempted to provide systematic investigation on this flow around the two tandem cylinders in the supercritical and transcritical flow regimes the flow pattern pressure distributions mean and fluctuating drag and lift coefficients and s t for the two tandem cylinders at r e 10 6 have to be addressed in the present paper the characteristics of the flow passing two tandem circular cylinders at both subcritical and supercritical reynolds numbers are studied using the improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes for spacing ratios 2 l d 5 the numerical results have been compared with the experiments and other numerical solutions the flow structure pressure distributions reattachment position fluctuating fluid forces and s t obtained from the numerical computations for r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 are analyzed and discussed the effects of r e on the drag and lift forces on the cylinders are examined for 2 2 10 4 r e 5 5 10 6 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide a brief description of the numerical method in section 3 we compare the results for the flow structure pressure distributions and forces at the subcritical and supercritical reynolds numbers discuss their variation with respect to spacing ratios l d and study the effects of r e on the mean and fluctuating forces on the tandem cylinders finally concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 numerical models 2 1 iddes model the original detached eddy simulation des based on s a turbulence model was developed by spalart et al 1997 for simulation of the flows with massive flow separations the rans and les formulations was combined in the des where the rans is adopted for the near wall region and les is adopted in the flow separation and wake regions depending on the grid resolution in order to eliminate the possibility of modeled stress depletion or grid induced separation in original des the delayed des ddes was proposed by spalart et al 2006 iddes which combine ddes and wall modeling les wmles was proposed by shur et al 2008 in the formulation of iddes the ddes length scale is implemented to eliminate the modeled stress depletion in the original des approach while wmles is applied to achieve more accurate prediction of the mean velocity in boundary layer in the present study the iddes based on s a model is adopted the key idea of iddes based on s a model is to modify the length scale of the dissipation term in the s a turbulence formulation spalart and allmaras 1994 as given by spalart et al 1997 the s a turbulence formulation is written as 1 d d t v ρ υ d v s ρ υ u d s 1 δ υ s μ ρ υ υ d s v c b 2 ρ υ υ d v v g υ γ υ s υ d v where v is the volume of a cell s is the face area vector ρ is the fluid density υ is the modified diffusivity t is the time μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient δ υ is 2 3 c b 2 is 0 622 the first and the second items on the right side of 1 are the diffusion terms g υ γ υ and s υ are the production term the dissipation term and the source term of the eddy viscosity respectively the dissipation term γ υ should satisfy 2 γ υ ρ c w 1 f w c b 1 k 2 f t 2 υ d 2 where c w 1 is a balance function f t 2 is the model function f w is intermediate variable d is the length scale c b 1 is 0 1335 and k is 0 41 in the original des formulations d is computed by 3 d min d c d e s δ where d is the distance to the closest wall boundary δ max δ x δ y δ z is the maximum of the grid spacing with δ x δ y and δ z being the local streamwise wall normal and lateral cell sizes respectively c d e s is 0 65 since there are some obvious anisotropic grids i e δ x δ z δ y in the grid division close to the wall the des length scale is adopted in a turbulence model i e d d throughout the boundary layer while in the separated region or the regions away from the wall the sub grid scale sgs model i e d c d e s δ is adopted instead of a turbulence model whereas d c d e s δ can be activated in the inner of boundary layer when either fine wall parallel grid is used or boundary layer thickens this will reduce the eddy viscosity and cause the modeled stress depletion in boundary layer on the other hand if des is used for wall modeled les wmles the simulations can cause the log layer mismatch which may result in an under estimation of the skin friction nikitin et al 2000 to resolve these issues iddes model is proposed by defining d as 4 d f d 1 f e d 1 f d ψ c d e s δ 1 with 5 δ 1 min max 0 15 d 0 15 δ δ min δ 6 f d max 1 f d t f b 7 f d t 1 tanh c d t r d t 3 8 r d t υ k 2 d 2 max i j u i x j 2 1 2 10 10 where δ min denotes the minimum distance between the local grid center and the adjacent grid center ψ is low reynolds number correction υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient f b is an empirical blending function c d t is 8 0 and c d e s is 0 65 f e is the transform function if the simulation includes an inflow turbulence content of r d t 1 d will reduce to l w m l e s which is defined by 9 l

details can be found in shur et al 2008 2 2 numerical method numerical simulations are performed using a cfd code cd adapco 2016 larsen 2013 based on finite volume method fvm a second order implicit scheme is applied for the temporal discretization for spatial discretization a second order upwind scheme is adopted simple algorithm is employed to treat the pressure and velocity coupling the cfl number is less than 0 2 in the flow regions of the gap between the cylinders and the near wake of the downstream cylinder in the cases of supercritical regime the turbulence viscosity is set to 5 times the molecular viscosity which implies the fully turbulence approach to the transition in the boundary layers on the cylinders 2 3 grid system and boundary conditions fig 1 presents the sketch of the computational domain with 30 d l 16 d 2 d here d 1 25 m and the boundary conditions the origin of the coordinate system is placed at the center of the upstream cylinder denoted as cylinder 1 the x axis y axis and z axis are along the streamwise direction transverse direction and the spanwise direction respectively the inlet boundary is extended to 10 d from the upstream cylinder the distance between outlet boundary and the downstream cylinder cylinder 2 is 20 d the width of computational domain is l y 16 d and the blockage ratio is d l y 6 25 the blockage ratio in the simulation is within the range of the values reported in the literature alam et al 2003 igarashi 1981 ljungkrona et al 1991 the spanwise size of the computational domain is set to l z 2 0 d in the study by weinmann et al 2014 the effect of spanwise domain size was examined for l z 12 d it is confirmed that l z provide rather small effects on the numerical results in the numerical simulations it should be ensured that the spanwise domain size is enough to capture all the relevant flow structures when the symmetry conditions are applied in the spanwise direction lehmkuhl et al 2014 rodríguez et al 2015 in the study on a single cylinder by lehmkuhl et al 2014 it was found that l z 0 5 π d was enough to capture the largest scales of the flow rodríguez et al 2015 reported that the spanwise size of l z 1 0 d can accommodate all flow structures around a single cylinder at supercritical reynolds numbers by evaluating two point correlations at different points in order to check if the spanwise size l z 2 0 d is large enough to accommodate all the flow structures for the present case with two cylinders the two point correlations in both the gap and wake regions are evaluated the two point correlation of the fluctuating variable r φ φ φ x y z t φ x y z δ z t φ 2 φ φ φ where the overbar denotes an averaging over time are shown in fig 2 as shown the correlation coefficients for all the three velocity streamwise transverse and spanwise velocities fluctuations drop to zero for l z 1 0 d hence a spanwise length of l z 2 0 d is adopted for the present study as shown in fig 1 the inlet boundary condition is set to be a uniform flow u x u 0 0 016 m s u 0 3 92 m s and a pressure based condition is used at the outlet symmetry conditions are applied in the spanwise direction no slip conditions are specified on the surfaces of two cylinders slip conditions are prescribed at the two lateral boundaries the details of grid refinement are shown in fig 3 based on the guideline for des like simulation by spalart 2001 the grids are refined in euler region er focus region fr and departure region dr in the fr which includes the gap between the cylinders and the near wake of the downstream cylinder the grids are isotropic with a size of 0 025 d the number of cells in the spanwise direction is 80 in the er and dr the grid sizes are 0 2 d and 0 4 d respectively the stretched hexahedral grids are used in the boundary layer and at least 40 prism layers are used to ensure y 1 the non dimensional wall normal distance y for r e 3 0 10 6 is plotted in fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 convergence study grid convergence study has been performed for the flow around two tandem circular cylinders at r e 3 0 10 6 with three different sets of grids for the case with l d 3 0 details of the grids the mean drag coefficients c d 1 c d 2 and fluctuating lift coefficients c l 1 and c l 2 are listed in table 1 the fluctuating lift coefficient is evaluated by taking the root mean square of the lift coefficient time traces as can be seen a base grid and a fine grid yield insignificant changes of these force coefficients the difference in terms of mean drag coefficients of the upstream cylinder c d 1 between the base grid and the fine grid is less than 1 as illustrated in fig 5 good consistency is also found between the surface pressure distributions on the cylinders using the base grid and the fine grid thus the base grid should be able to capture the flow behavior in addition the computations with different time step sizes using base grid have been carried out to verify the time step size convergence as shown in fig 6 the results with using δ t u 0 d 0 005 and δ t u 0 d 0 0025 have a good consistency which confirms that the convergence of results with increasing temporal resolutions is acceptable to minimize the computing cost the base grid with δ t u 0 d 0 005 is adopted in the present simulations the time histories are analyzed based on a time span of about 30 shedding cycles to ensure converged statistics 3 2 validation of computations in order to validate the present numerical model for computing the flow around cylinders at high reynolds numbers the unsteady force coefficients and pressure distributions on a single circular cylinder are computed the results have been compared with the experimental data roshko 1961 james et al 1980 achenbach and heinecke 1981 schewe 1983 hinsberg 2015 and the other numerical results travin et al 1999 ong et al 2009 moussaed et al 2014 table 2 shows the mean drag coefficient c d fluctuating lift coefficient c l and strouhal number s t at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 in table 2 s t f d u 0 where f is the frequency of the lift fluctuation as can be seen the present results at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 are within the range of the measurements consistent with the other numerical solutions using des travin et al 1999 and a hybrid approach blending rans and variational multiscale les model moussaed et al 2014 at r e 3 0 10 6 c d is 0 45 and c l is 0 05 which are much less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 while s t is higher at r e 3 0 10 6 the contours of instantaneous spanwise vorticity at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 are illustrated in fig 7 as shown the separation position moves from the front to the back of the cylinder the wake width d w d is estimated by using d w d c d c p b as suggested by roshko 1961 c p b is the base pressure coefficient i e the mean pressure coefficient at θ 180 the wake width d w d at r e 3 0 10 6 is 0 82 which is close to that reported by roshko 1961 it is also noticed that the wake width in the supercritical regime is smaller than that at r e 2 2 10 4 d w d 1 in addition fig 8 a shows the comparison of mean pressure coefficient c p of the single cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 with the experiments where the transition to turbulence in the boundary layer occurs at r e 3 0 10 6 it is assumed that the flow in the boundary layers is turbulence and the transition is completed before separation as reported in travin et al 1999 the results of iddes fall between the experimental data by james et al 1980 and those by roshko 1961 the predicted separation point θ 110 agrees well with the experimental data and the numerical solutions by travin et al 1999 fig 8 b presents the comparison of c l with the experimental data for 2 10 3 r e 3 10 6 the variation trend of c l with respect to r e is consistent with the experiments schewe 1983 norberg 2003 the numerical simulations of flow across two tandem cylinders in the subcritical flow regime are also validated by the published experimental data zdravkovich 1977 igarashi 1981 arie et al 1983 ljungkrona et al 1991 fig 9 shows the comparison of pressure distributions on the two cylinders in the case of l d 3 with experimental data as can be seen the pressure distributions on the upstream cylinder at r e 2 2 10 4 generally agree well with these experimental data in the subcritical flow regime as illustrated in fig 9 b the present results on the downstream cylinder are in accord with the experimental data by ljungkrona et al 1991 while they are slightly larger than the results of igarashi 1981 and arie et al 1983 when 50 θ 80 the difference can be attributed to the different r e between the present simulations and experiments by igarashi 1981 r e 3 5 10 5 and arie et al 1983 r e 1 6 10 5 fig 10 shows the comparison of mean drag coefficients of the two cylinders with published experimental and numerical data in the subcritical flow regime as can be seen the present mean drag coefficients for different l d are consistent with the experimental data and the les results by kitagawa and ohta 2008 based on these comparisons the present numerical model is confirmed to be able to simulate the flow across two tandem cylinders in both subcritical and supercritical flow regimes 3 3 instantaneous flow around two cylinders in this study flow structure is analyzed to explore the flow characteristic around two tandem circular cylinders in the subcritical and supercritical regimes fig 11 shows the instantaneous contours of the normalized spanwise vorticity ω z d u 0 in the mid span plane z d 1 0 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 with different spacing ratios l d as shown in fig 11 a e at r e 2 2 10 4 the shear layer separated from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the downstream cylinder and the vortex shedding forms only in the wake behind the downstream cylinder for l d 2 5 in addition the shear layer reattachment leads to the formation of small vortices near the front of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 11 c for l d 3 0 the flow patterns of shear layer reattachment and vortex formation coexist in the gap region which can be called bistable flow igarashi 1981 however as l d increases the kármán like vortex shedding occurs from the upstream cylinder as well as the downstream cylinder and these vortices shed from the upstream cylinder impinge on the downstream cylinder for l d 3 5 fig 11 f j illustrate the spanwise vorticity at r e 3 0 10 6 by comparing the flow characteristics it is found that the variation of the flow patterns as a function of l d at r e 3 0 10 6 are similar to those at r e 2 2 10 4 as shown in fig 11 h the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder also occurs for l d 3 5 however the separation positions of shear layer move from the front to the back of the upstream cylinder and the width of wake of the upstream cylinder becomes narrower at r e 3 0 10 6 for all the l d this behavior is time independent and similar to that for a single cylinder in the supercritical regime roshko 1961 sumer 2006 at r e 3 0 10 6 the reattachment positions for l d 3 0 move upstream due to the narrower width of the wake see fig 11 f h the variation of the reattachment position will be further investigated in section 3 5 in addition as shown in fig 11 j the length of vortex formation behind the upstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 is larger than that at r e 2 2 10 4 with l d 4 0 fig 12 shows the instantaneous contours of normalized vorticity magnitude on the x z plane y 0 for different l d at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 as shown at the two r e the high vorticity magnitude is found in the regions of shear layer reattachment vortex shedding formation and the wake behind the downstream cylinder as illustrated in fig 12 a b f and g for l d 2 5 the vorticity magnitude at the front and wake of the downstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 is lower than that at r e 2 2 10 4 for l d 4 0 the larger vorticity magnitude between the two cylinders can be observed in the region of 0 5 x d 2 at r e 2 2 10 4 while this region is shifted to 1 x d 2 5 at r e 3 0 10 6 see fig 11 e and j in order to understand the three dimensional vortical structures instantaneous vortical structures represented by the iso surface of a q criterion hunt et al 1988 sohankar 2014 are illustrated in fig 13 which presents the detailed instantaneous iso surface of q 1 5 u 0 2 d 2 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 the kelvin helmholtz type vortical structures are observed at the two reynolds numbers further it should be noted that the boundary layer instability occurs at the separation position for the upstream cylinder at r e 2 2 10 4 see fig 13 a and a delay of the onset of the boundary layer instability takes place at r e 3 0 10 6 see fig 13 b the separation points on the cylinders can be obtained by computing the skin friction coefficients of the cylinders the separation points on the upstream cylinders can be identified in fig 14 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 as shown the separation occurs at θ 89 when r e 2 2 10 4 while it moves to θ 109 when r e 3 0 10 6 in the supercritical regime the backward move of the separation point on the upstream cylinder is similar to that found on a single cylinder in the simulations it is also observed hat the separation points on the cylinders hardly changes with the physical time in order to further understand the differences in the flow physics between r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the wake turbulence and turbulence intensity are examined the wake turbulence can be quantified by the turbulence viscosity ratio μ t μ where μ t is the turbulence viscosity in fig 15 as shown in fig 15 a at r e 2 2 10 4 a high level of turbulence viscosity appears in the wake region of the upstream cylinder compared to that of the downstream cylinder in addition at r e 2 2 10 4 the level of turbulence viscosity in the region of vortex formation is higher than that in the shear layer on the upstream cylinder in contrast at r e 3 0 10 6 the highest turbulence viscosity mainly concentrate in the shear layer on the upstream cylinder rather than in the region of vortex formation the high level of turbulence viscosity in the shear layer can allow for a slow growth of shear layer instability it is also noted that the level of turbulence viscosity in the wake at r e 3 0 10 6 is much higher than that at r e 2 2 10 4 the distribution of turbulence intensity i x u r m s u u r m s and u denote the rms value and mean value of the streamwise velocity respectively along the centerline y d 0 for l d 4 0 is shown in fig 16 as shown in fig 16 a compared to r e 2 2 10 4 at r e 3 0 10 6 the peak to peak value of turbulence intensity is less and the positions of the peaks are delayed the distance between the position of negative peak in the distribution of turbulence intensity and the center of upstream cylinder denotes the length of vortex formation it can be observed that the length of vortex formation behind the upstream cylinder is enlarged at r e 3 0 10 6 which is consistent with the observation in the plot of vorticity field as illustrated in fig 11 however for the downstream cylinder it is obeserved that the length of vortex formation is shortened at r e 3 0 10 6 see fig 16 b this suggests that the effect of the impingement of the vortex shed from the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder in the supercritical regime can be distinct from that in the subcritical regime the distributions of time averaged streamwise velocity u u 0 along the centreline y d 0 are plotted in fig 17 u is the streamwise velocity as shown in fig 17 a at r e 2 2 10 4 the length of the recirculation bubble behind the upstream cylinder is about 1 1 i e x d 1 1 at u u 0 0 which agrees with the result of a single cylinder by travin et al 1999 however at r e 3 0 10 6 the recirculation zone behind the upstream cylinder is larger than that at r e 2 2 10 4 this can be correlated with the turbulence separation and narrow wake behind the upstream cylinder since the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder impinge on the downstream cylinder at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 the recirculation zones behind the downstream cylinder are close at the two reynolds numbers as shown in fig 17 b however the time averaged streamwise velocities in the region of x d 5 0 at r e 3 0 10 6 are larger than those at r e 2 2 10 4 fig 18 illustrates the power spectral density psd of transverse velocity v fluctuations in the gap region between the cylinders and wake region behind the downstream cylinder for l d 4 0 two numerical probes are placed at x d 2 y d 0 5 and x d 6 y d 0 5 respectively in the two plots a pronounced peak of psd of v is observed for gap region and wake region at r e 2 2 10 4 the dominant frequencies in gap region and wake region are almost the same this dominant frequency f d u 0 0 2 is close to the vortex shedding frequency of a single cylinder in the subcritical regime however at r e 3 0 10 6 the dominant frequency rises up to f d u 0 0 29 this is because that the interaction of shear layers is intensified at the supercritical reynolds number due to the decrease of the width between shear layers and hence the periodic vortices shed in higher frequency in addition the f 5 3 law is plotted in fig 18 as can be seen the resolved turbulence scale is located in the inertial subrange the figure also shows that the spectra in gap region have a similar inertial subrange as those in wake region 3 4 pressure distribution the time averaged and fluctuating pressure distributions on the surfaces of cylinders for different l d are presented in figs 19 and 20 respectively c p 1 c p 1 p 1 p 0 0 5 ρ u o 2 p 1 is the time averaged pressure on the upstream cylinder and c p 2 c p 2 p 2 p 0 0 5 ρ u o 2 p 2 is the time averaged pressure on the downstream cylinder are the mean pressure coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively the experimental data igarashi 1981 ljungkrona et al 1991 and the other numerical solutions kitagawa and ohta 2008 in subcritical flow regime are also presented for comparison as shown in fig 19 a c and e the present results of c p 1 at r e 2 2 10 4 agree well with these experimental data and the other numerical results at 2 10 4 r e 3 5 10 4 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the time averaged pressure distributions of upstream cylinder are almost unchanged with spacing ratios for l d 3 0 this is due to the similar flow patterns involving the reattachment of the shear layers for l d 3 0 see fig 11 a b c f g and h as shown in fig 19 e at r e 2 2 10 4 c p 1 in the range of θ 100 decreases rapidly with the increase of θ for l d 4 0 which is different from the case for l d 3 0 the reason is that the larger vorticity magnitude is generated near the rear of the upstream cylinder for l d 4 0 seen fig 12 e as can be seen at r e 2 2 10 4 the minimum of c p 1 appears at θ 67 and the separation point is in the neighborhood of θ 90 however at r e 3 0 10 6 the different pressure distributions are formed with a minimum of c p 1 at θ 78 followed by a turbulence separation at θ 110 as illustrated in fig 19 e the minimum of c p 1 at r e 3 0 10 6 is lower while the base pressure is larger comparing to that at r e 2 2 10 4 as shown in fig 19 b and d the distributions of c p 2 are almost independent of l d for l d 3 0 at the two r e this can be explained by the similar flow patterns for l d 3 0 where the shear layer from the upstream cylinder reattaches to the downstream cylinder the reattachment position is reflected as a peak in c p 2 at 40 θ 80 at r e 3 0 10 6 the reattachment position moves toward lower θ due to the narrowing wake behind the upstream cylinder see fig 11 f h compared with that at r e 2 2 10 4 further the peak of c p 2 and the base pressure coefficient at r e 3 0 10 6 are larger than those at r e 2 2 10 4 for l d 4 0 as illustrated in fig 19 f the distributions of c p 2 at both r e are somewhat similar in shape to that of c p 1 at r e 2 2 10 4 c p 2 are always negative which is distinct from that for the upstream cylinder c p 1 this is because the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder strongly impinge on the surface of the downstream cylinder nevertheless it is observed that the values of c p 2 in 0 θ 40 are positive at r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 it indicates that the impact of vortices impingement on the pressure distributions of the downstream cylinder is reduced at r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 fig 20 a c and e show the fluctuating pressure coefficients of the upstream cylinder for l d 2 5 3 0 and 4 0 c p 1 c p 1 p 1 p 0 0 5 ρ u o 2 p 1 is the fluctuating pressure on the upstream cylinder and c p 2 c p 2 p 2 p 0 0 5 ρ u o 2 p 2 is the fluctuating pressure on the downstream cylinder are the root mean square values of pressure coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively the present results at r e 2 2 10 4 agree with the experimental data ljungkrona et al 1991 and the les results by kitagawa and ohta 2008 the values of c p 1 at r e 3 0 10 6 are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 because the boundary layer on the upstream cylinder is turbulence at r e 3 0 10 6 in the study on a single cylinder at high reynolds numbers by schewe 1983 and hinsberg 2015 the fluctuating lift forces at r e 2 5 10 6 were also less than those at the subcritical reynolds numbers r e 1 10 5 due to the turbulence separation in the supercritical and transcritical flow regimes r e 2 5 10 6 as shown the peaks in c p 1 move to θ 110 at r e 3 0 10 6 the fluctuating pressure coefficients of the downstream cylinder are illustrated in the fig 20 b d and f as shown at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the fluctuating pressure coefficients of the downstream cylinder are relatively larger compared with those of the upstream cylinder two peaks appear in the fluctuating pressure distributions on the downstream cylinder the first peak in 40 θ 80 is due to the reattachment of the shear layer from the upstream cylinder the second peak in 90 θ 120 is at the separation position on the rear surface of the downstream cylinder it should be noted that the separation on the downstream cylinder always occurs at 100 θ 110 and are almost independent of r e it is also found that the values of c p 2 at r e 3 0 10 6 are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 3 5 reattachment position for l d 3 0 the shear layer from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the surface of the downstream cylinder the reattachment positions θ r denoted as the θ at the peak of c p 2 are illustrated in fig 21 as shown at r e 2 2 10 4 the present results agree with the les results by kitagawa and ohta 2008 while somewhat larger than the experimental data by alam et al 2003 this overestimation of θ r may be attributed to the difference in r e ljungkrona et al 1991 investigated the effects of r e on the pressure coefficients for l d 2 5 their results indicated that the reattachment position θ r decreased as r e increased from 2 0 10 4 to 6 0 10 4 the different r e may lead to the discrepancy between the present results r e 2 2 10 4 and the experimental data r e 6 5 10 4 by alam et al 2003 nevertheless the present results show similar trend as the experiments in the subcritical regime for l d 2 0 the reattachment position of the shear layer is θ r 64 as l d increases θ r slightly drops to 62 for l d 2 5 beyond this spacing θ r rises and the reattachment position moves backward alam et al 2003 examined the effect of the change of reattachment position on the fluid forces of the downstream cylinder their results indicate that the fluctuating fluid forces increase when the reattachment position moves forward it should be noted that at r e 3 0 10 6 the values of θ r are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 due to the narrower width of wake behind the upstream cylinder in addition at r e 3 0 10 6 θ r gradually reduces as l d rises 3 6 fluid forces and strouhal number fig 22 presents the time histories of the drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l for r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 for different l d as shown in fig 22 a and b for l d 2 0 the fluctuations of c d and c l on the upstream cylinder are weaker than that on downstream cylinder at both r e the fluctuation of c l for the upstream cylinder is caused by the movement of the shear layers while that for downstream cylinder is attributed to the vortex shedding however the fluctuation magnitude of c l of the downstream cylinder is much larger than that of the upstream cylinder at r e 2 2 10 4 it can be attributed to the fact that the vortex shedding only occurs behind the downstream cylinder for l d 2 0 similar phenomenon can be observed for r e 3 0 10 6 but the fluctuations of c d and c l are weaker than those at r e 2 2 10 4 in the study on a single cylinder by schewe 1983 the fluctuating drag and lift coefficients in the supercritical regimes were also less than those in the subcritical regime as shown in fig 22 d for l d 3 0 the fluctuations of c l on the downstream cylinder are weaker in comparison with those for l d 2 0 for l d 3 0 bistable flow pattern occurs and can impact the vortex shedding behind the downstream cylinder see also fig 11 as shown in fig 22 e and f for l d 4 0 the fluctuations of c d and c l for the upstream and downstream cylinders are stronger than those for l d 3 0 because the vortices are formed behind both cylinders it is also observed that the fluctuation magnitudes per vortex shedding period for both c d and c l are quite different the non stationary fluctuations of c d on the downstream cylinder is more remarkable the non stationary fluctuations may be attributed the fact the strength of vortices shed from upstream cylinder and the impingement positions on the downstream cylinder are varying with respect to time the similar phenomenon was found in the study on the tandem cylinders by kitagawa and ohta 2008 sohankar 2014 gopalan and jaiman 2015 fig 23 a shows the variation of the mean drag coefficients c d 1 of the upstream cylinder with l d for r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the experimental data and numerical solutions by les in the subcritical flow regime are also included in the figure for comparison as shown the present results agree with experimental data at r e 2 2 10 4 c d 1 gradually drops with the increase of l d for l d 3 5 in addition the value of c d 1 jumps to around 1 25 for l d 3 5 for l d 5 0 the value of c d 1 is around 1 2 at r e 2 2 10 4 and agrees with that for a single cylinder in the subcritical regime by schewe 1983 the critical spacing l d 3 5 is consistent with that observed in experiments igarashi 1981 ljungkrona et al 1991 alam et al 2003 compared with the solution at r e 2 2 10 4 c d 1 at r e 3 0 10 6 is relatively smaller in addition at r e 3 0 10 6 no critical spacing can be observed and c d 1 changes little with l d for l d 5 0 as shown in fig 23 b the mean drag coefficients of the downstream cylinder c d 2 at r e 2 2 10 4 increases sharply around l d 3 5 as those of the upstream cylinder c d 1 however c d 2 are always less than c d 1 at r e 2 2 10 4 it is observed that at r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 3 5 c d 2 increases gradually with l d while for l d 3 5 the c d 2 increases abruptly and approaches to 0 5 this behavior is similar to that at r e 2 2 10 4 although the jump is relatively smaller at r e 3 0 10 6 with l d 3 5 different from that at r e 2 2 10 4 c d 2 are close to c d 1 the fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream cylinder c l 1 and the downstream cylinder c l 2 are presented in fig 23 c and d respectively the present results of c l 1 and c l 2 for l d 3 5 agree with the experimental data by arie et al 1983 except those for l d 3 5 being slightly larger than the experimental results as can be seen the increase of r e leads to the decreases of c l 1 and c l 2 for l d 3 5 the discrepancy in the fluctuating lift coefficients between the present computations and the experiments may be due to different r e in general the variation tendency of the predicted fluctuating lift coefficients with l d is consistent with the experiments and the les simulations by kitagawa and ohta 2008 as can be seen for l d 3 5 the values of c l 1 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 are similar the c l 1 increases suddenly at r e 2 2 10 4 for l d 3 5 while it is almost invariant at r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 5 0 the value of c l 1 is around 0 02 at r e 3 0 10 6 which is close to the result for a single cylinder in the supercritical regime schewe 1983 in addition as shown in fig 23 d although the values of c l 2 are much lower at r e 3 0 10 6 the variation tendencey of c l 2 at r e 3 0 10 6 is similar to that at r e 2 2 10 4 fig 24 a and b illustrate the power spectral density psd of the lift coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders for l d 4 0 as shown the dominant frequencies in the psd for the upstream and downstream cylinders are almost the same at r e 2 2 10 4 the vortex shedding frequencies of the two cylinders are about 0 183 which are in good agreement with the les predictions by kitagawa and ohta 2008 at r e 3 0 10 6 the vortex shedding frequencies of the upstream and downstream cylinders are 0 28 and are larger than those at r e 2 2 10 4 this is due to the narrower width of wake caused by backward movement of the separation point see also fig 11 moreover as shown the peak amplitude at r e 3 0 10 6 is smaller than that at r e 2 2 10 4 which indicates that the vortex strength is relatively weaker at r e 3 0 10 6 fig 25 shows the variation of s t of the downstream cylinder with respect to l d at r e 2 2 10 4 the present results of s t are in good agreement with the experimental data ljungkrona et al 1991 igarashi 1981 at r e 2 2 10 4 the s t shows a stepwise increase around l d 3 5 the similar behavior can be observed at r e 3 0 10 6 it is found that s t values for l d 3 5 with r e 3 0 10 6 are close to that at r e 2 2 10 4 due to the effect of the reattachment of shear layers while for l d 3 5 the s t values at r e 3 0 10 6 are much larger than those at r e 2 2 10 4 we remark that for a single cylinder relatively larger s t can be identified in the supercritical regime schewe 1983 3 7 phase lag of the fluctuating lift force between two cylinders for l d 3 5 the vortex shedding occurs behind both cylinders and the phase of the vortex shedding can affect the fluctuating lift force alam et al 2003 in this section the phase lag of fluctuating lift force between two cylinders corresponding to the phase lag of the vortex shedding has been examined for r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 fig 26 shows the phase lag of fluctuating lift force between the two cylinders for different l d the phase lag denoted by φ is obtained from the cross correlation between the fluctuating lift forces of the upstream and the downstream cylinders the relationship between φ and l d in the subcritical regime r e 6 5 10 4 can be written as alam et al 2003 11 φ r a d 0 508 π l d 0 85 π as shown in fig 26 the present results for r e 2 2 10 4 are almost proportional to l d and follow 11 however it is found that the slope of the best fit line for φ and l d at r e 3 0 10 6 is much larger than that for r e 2 2 10 4 which suggests that φ is more sensitive to l d at r e 3 0 10 6 in addition the mean convection velocity of the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder u c can be obtained based on these values of φ as discussed by kitagawa and ohta 2008 the u c is evaluated by 12 u c 2 π s t l d φ fig 27 shows the variation of u c with respect to l d at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 as can be seen the present results of u c at r e 2 2 10 4 agree with those of kitagawa and ohta 2008 the values of u c for different l d at r e 2 2 10 4 are between 0 56 and 0 66 corresponding to 56 66 of the freestream velocity however at r e 3 0 10 6 the values of u c are in the range of 70 80 of the freestream velocity it means that the convection velocities of the vortices shed from the upstream cylinders are higher at the supercritical reynolds number than those at the subcritical reynolds number it is also found that the values of u c at both r e increase slightly as l d grows 3 8 effect of r e on the forces figs 28 and 29 illustrate the mean drag c d and fluctuating lift c l coefficients of the two cylinders at different reynolds numbers for l d 2 5 and l d 4 0 the experimental results of the single cylinder achenbach 1971 schewe 1983 norberg 2003 are also plotted in these graphs for comparison the comparisons show that the present results agree well with the experimental data as can be seen from fig 28 a for l d 2 5 the variation trend of c d with r e for the upstream cylinder is similar to that for a single cylinder however the c d of the downstream cylinder gradually grows with the increasing r e the difference between the c d for the upstream and downstream cylinders at the supercritical reynolds numbers r e 1 0 10 6 is smaller than that at the subcritical reynolds numbers i e r e 1 0 10 5 this can be attributed to the different reattachment positions at subcritical and supercritical reynolds numbers see fig 21 as illustrated in fig 28 b the c l on the upstream cylinder are almost nil with l d 2 5 for 2 2 10 4 r e 5 5 10 6 it is because the shear layer separated from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the downstream cylinder for l d 2 5 hence vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder is not formed however the value of c l for the downstream cylinder approaches to 0 5 at r e 2 2 10 4 and it gradually drops as r e rises this behavior is similar to that for the case of a single cylinder in addition as illustrated in fig 29 a and b for l d 4 0 c d and c l of the upstream cylinder are similar to those of a single cylinder the decrease of c l for the upstream cylinder is observed for 6 0 10 4 r e 6 0 10 5 however the variation trend of c d with r e for downstream cylinder is rather different from that for upstream cylinder or a single cylinder for r e 1 0 10 5 the values of c d for downstream cylinder are much less than those of upstream cylinder and the single cylinder as shown in fig 29 b the values of c l for the downstream cylinder are always larger than those for the upstream cylinder the reason may be that the impingements of vortices shed from the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder see fig 11 intensify the fluctuations of force on the downstream cylinder in addition it shows that for r e 1 0 10 6 the c l of both cylinders changes little with respect to r e 4 conclusions in the present paper the characteristics of the flow around two tandem cylinders in the subcritical and supercritical flow regimes have been studied by direct numerical investigation the flow structures separation and reattachment positions pressure distributions and fluid forces with different l d are analyzed and discussed in order to validate the present numerical model for computing the flow around the cylinders at high reynolds numbers the hydrodynamic forces on the single cylinder in both subcritical and supercritical regimes are also computed and analyzed the results show that the present computations have a satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data the main conclusions can be summarized as follow 1 at r e 3 0 10 6 the two point correlation coefficients for streamwise transverse and spanwise velocity fluctuations drop to around zero when the spanwise size of the cylinder approaches to 1 0 d it suggests that the spanwise size should be above 1 0 d for accurate simulation of the flow around two tandem cylinders in the supercritical flow regime 2 by examining the instantaneous flow around the two tandem cylinders it is found that at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the shear layer from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the surface of the downstream cylinder for l d 3 5 while the vortex shedding occurs behind both cylinders for l d 3 5 compared with the case at r e 2 2 10 4 since the transition is completed before separation the separation position on the upstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 moves backward and the width of wake becomes narrower for l d 4 0 at r e 3 0 10 6 the length of vortex formation for the upstream cylinder is enlarged while it is shortened for the downstream cylinder compared to those at r e 2 2 10 4 3 comparing to the case at r e 2 2 10 4 at r e 3 0 10 6 the base pressures on the cylinders are larger while the fluctuating pressure on the cylinders are relatively lower for l d 4 0 the mean pressure coefficients of the downstream c p 2 are always negative at r e 2 2 10 4 however it is found that the c p 2 in 0 θ 40 are positive at r e 3 0 10 6 it indicates that at r e 3 0 10 6 the impact of vortices impingement on the pressure distributions of the downstream cylinder reduces in addition the reattachment angles at r e 3 0 10 6 are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 due to the narrower width of the shear layers from the upstream cylinder 4 the mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 c d 1 and c l 1 almost do not change with l d at r e 3 0 10 6 which is different from the jump of the force coefficients around the critical spacing at r e 2 2 10 4 however c d 2 and c l 2 at r e 3 0 10 6 increase abruptly for l d 3 5 although the amplitude of jump is not significant in addition s t of the downstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 is higher than that at r e 2 2 10 4 with l d 3 5 these suggest that the scale effects associated with r e are important for understanding and predicting the flow characteristics on the multi column floating structures in full scale 5 the phase lag of the fluctuating lift force between the two cylinders φ has an almost linear relationship with l d at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 however at r e 3 0 10 6 the slope of the best fit line for φ and l d is relatively larger than that at r e 2 2 10 4 which suggests that φ can be more sensitive to l d furthermore based on the φ the convection velocity of the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder u c at both r e are computed it is found that at r e 3 0 10 6 the values of u c are 70 80 of the freestream velocity which are higher than those at r e 2 2 10 4 it also shows that the u c rises slightly with the increase of l d 6 for 2 2 10 4 r e 5 5 10 6 the variations of mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients with respect to r e for the tandem cylinders are different from those for a single cylinder for l d 2 5 as r e increases the mean drag coefficients of the upstream cylinder drop sharply at the critical reynolds number but those of the downstream cylinder grow gradually the fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream cylinder are in general independent of r e different from the results for l d 2 5 for l d 4 0 the mean drag coefficients of the downstream cylinder decrease slightly as r e increases and the fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders drop with the growth of r e moreover it is also observed that the fluctuating lift coefficients of the downstream cylinders are much larger than those of the upstream cylinder

22489,the flows around two tandem circular cylinders in the subcritical and supercritical flow regimes are studied through three dimensional numerical simulations different spacing ratios l d where l is the center to center distance between the two cylinders with d being the diameter of the cylinders from 2 0 to 5 0 is considered the instantaneous flow structures pressure distributions and hydrodynamic forces on two tandem cylinders are analyzed at subcritical r e 2 2 10 4 and supercritical r e 3 0 10 6 reynolds numbers the present numerical solutions demonstrated that at the two r e for l d 3 5 the shear layer from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the surface of the downstream cylinder and vortex street is only formed behind the downstream cylinder while the shear layer from the upstream cylinder rolls up alternately for l d 3 5 and vortex shedding occurs from both upstream and downstream cylinders compared with the flow characteristics at r e 2 2 10 4 for r e 3 0 10 6 the flow separation positions on the upstream cylinder move backward and the width of the wake behind the upstream cylinder becomes narrower which leads to forward movement of the reattachment position at the supercritical reynolds number the mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream cylinder are nearly independent of l d while the sharp increase of force coefficients of the downstream cylinder occurs for l d 3 5 comparing to the case at the subcritical reynolds number higher vortex shedding frequencies from the upstream and downstream cylinders are identified it is also revealed that the slope of the best fit line for φ the phase lag of the fluctuating lift force between two cylinders and l d increases at the supercritical reynolds number in addition for l d 2 5 the mean drag coefficients of the upstream cylinder decrease sharply for r e 1 0 10 5 while those of the downstream cylinder rise slightly with the growing r e moreover the fluctuating lift

floating structures have been widely adopted in the field of offshore oil and gas exploration and ocean renewable energy in the past few decades because of their favorable motion performance and large deck space recently with the development of deep draft multi column floater lee et al 2014 antony et al 2015 due to vortex shedding behind the columns in fluid the vortex induced motions vim become more significant for such platform large amplitude vim can not only impact the mooring and riser systems but also may cause collision between the floating structure and the nearby supporting vessels hence vim has become a critical issue during the design and optimization of multi column floating structures extensive studies on vim have been performed in model scale r e 10 5 r e u c d c υ where d c is the column diameter u c is the current velocity υ represents the kinematic viscosity of the water waals et al 2007 kim et al 2011 gonçalves et al 2012 antony et al 2015 chen and chen 2016 koop et al 2016 however the observed vim amplitudes of the multi column floating structures in field measurements are much less than those obtained from model test in towing tank see rijken and leverette 2009 and ma et al 2013 although a number of experimental studies on vim of multi column floating structures have been performed in model scale the factor causing the significant differences between model test and field measurements is still an open question for example the scale effect associated with r e on the vim is an enigma measuring and evaluating the vim at the full scale r e in the order of 10 5 to 10 7 continue to be challenging the fundamental mechanisms giving rise to vim in full scale are still not well understood in order to assess the vim in full scale and investigate the scale effects it is needed to understand the flow interferences between multiple columns at the high reynolds numbers i e r e 10 6 the columns with circular or square cross section are very common for multi column floating structures such as tension leg platform tlp and semi submersible platform semi gonçalves et al 2012 chen and chen 2016 wu et al 2014 further the tandem arrangement of two cylinders is the basic configuration for the array of multiple columns and involves most of the common flow features such as flow separation reattachment of shear layers and interacting vortex streets sumer 2006 therefore investigations on the flow around two circular cylinders in tandem arrangement at high reynolds numbers are necessary for better understanding the physics of the flow passing multi column floating structures in full scale in the earlier studies the flow interference between two cylinders in tandem arrangement was identified as wake interference by zdravkovich 1987 who classified the flow around two tandem cylinders into three different flow regimes based on the different spacing ratios l d 6 sumner et al 1999 employed flow visualization and particle image velocimetry piv to study the flow field around the two tandem cylinders for 1 0 l d 3 0 at 1200 r e 3800 three types of hydrodynamic behaviors were identified for different l d for l d 1 0 the cylinders behave like a single cylinder for l d 1 5 and 2 0 a recirculation zone can be formed behind each cylinder while its streamwise growth is constrained for l d 2 5 and 3 0 the independent recirculation zones similar to a single cylinder are formed lin et al 2002 adopted piv to investigate the instantaneous and averaged patterns of velocity and vorticity for the flow around two tandem cylinders at r e 1 0 10 4 it was found that the symmetrical and asymmetrical patterns occurred in the gap region for l d 2 0 while the kármán like vortices were formed in the gap region for l d 5 1 zhou and yiu 2006 investigated the wake structure and vortex dynamics at r e 7 10 3 using hot wire anemometry two different flow structures in the reattachment regime were identified the shear layer reattachment occurred at the rear surface of the downstream cylinder for 2 l d 3 while it occurred at the leading surface of the downstream cylinder for 3 l d 5 on the other hand the behaviors of the surface pressure coefficients drag and lift force coefficients and the strouhal number s t for the flow around the tandem cylinders have also been investigated okajima 1979 measured the drag coefficients and s t for 4 10 4 r e 6 3 10 5 in a low speed wind tunnel the critical spacing l d 3 8 was observed for r e 2 5 10 5 while the jump of drag coefficient disappeared for 2 5 10 5 r e 6 3 10 5 igarashi 1981 found that the fluctuating surface pressure drag coefficient and s t were sensitive to l d at 1 7 10 4 r e 5 2 10 4 and the sudden jump in drag coefficient and s t occurred for l d 3 5 arie et al 1983 measured the pressure fluctuations on the surfaces of two tandem cylinders and found that the fluctuating surface pressure on each cylinder increase sharply when the spacing ratio is greater than the critical spacing l d 3 8 at r e 1 57 10 5 ljungkrona et al 1991 found the critical spacing decreased from 3 5 to 2 5 as the turbulence intensity grew from 0 1 to 1 4 at r e 2 0 10 4 gu 1996 measured the mean pressure distributions on the tandem cylinders at r e 4 10 5 for l d 3 0 three different patterns of pressure distributions on the downstream cylinder were observed for l d 2 2 alam et al 2003 measured the fluctuating lift and drag forces acting on two circular cylinders in tandem arrangement at r e 6 5 10 4 they found that the fluctuating lift and drag forces acting on the downstream cylinder were very sensitive to the spacing ratios and the fluctuating fluid forces were correlated with the reattachment positions xu and zhou 2004 investigated the vortex shedding frequencies of the tandem cylinders using two hot wires placed behind each cylinder for a wide range of reynolds numbers 800 r e 4 2 10 4 and spacing ratios 1 l d 15 they found the critical spacing was l d 4 5 at r e 1 2 10 3 while it was l d 3 0 at r e 4 2 10 4 kitagawa and ohta 2008 adopted large eddy simulation les to investigate the flow around two circular cylinders in tandem arrangement for 2 l d 5 at r e 2 2 10 4 they concluded that at the critical spacing l d 3 25 the mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients of each cylinder jumped to higher values the phase lag between the fluctuating lift forces on the upstream and downstream cylinders was correlated to l d neuhart et al 2009 investigated the unsteady wake interference between two tandem cylinders at r e 1 66 10 5 using piv and studied the effect of boundary layer tripping along the downstream cylinder for different spacing ratios tsutsui 2012 examined the fluctuation of the fluid forces acting on the tandem cylinders for l d 1 2 at 3 8 10 4 r e 1 3 10 5 he found that the phase shift between the drag and lift coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders were 5 16 and 3 16 respectively and the curve of the lissajous figure of the upstream cylinder was different from that for a single cylinder weinmann et al 2014 applied a numerical model which combines the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and les to simulate the flow around the two tandem cylinders at r e 1 66 10 5 for l d 3 7 and the computed surface pressure distributions were compared with the experimental data gopalan and jaiman 2015 simulated the flow interference between tandem cylinders based the hybrid rans les methods with non linear eddy viscosity formulations at r e 1 66 10 5 for l d 1 4 3 0 and 3 7 the bistable wake between the cylinders and the drag inversion on the downstream cylinder was observed for l d 3 0 they also found that the bistable wake led to increase in the turbulent kinetic energy in the gap between the cylinders as mentioned above most of the numerical and experimental studies were focused on the flow structures and fluid forces on the two tandem cylinders in the subcritical flow regime however the r e in the most of practical applications in offshore engineering is usually in the order of 10 5 to 10 7 corresponding to the supercritical or transcritical flow regimes respectively the behaviors of flow across two tandem cylinders need to be thoroughly investigated in supercritical and transcritical flow regimes there are only several studies on the flow characteristic of a single cylinder in supercritical and transcritical flow regimes roshko 1961 schewe 1983 hinsberg 2015 schewe 1983 took the measurements of a single cylinder from subcritical up to transcritical reynolds numbers 2 3 10 4 r e 7 1 10 6 a drop of drag and lift forces and a jump of s t were observed at r e 3 5 10 5 due to the boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent flow hinsberg 2015 experimentally investigated the unsteady aerodynamic forces and surface pressure on a slightly rough circular cylinder at 1 5 10 4 r e 1 2 10 7 it was observed that the separation point of the boundary layer shifted to the rear of the cylinder in the supercritical and transcritical regimes in addition rodríguez et al 2015 investigated the wake topology and found that the wake width in the supercritical or transcritical regimes was narrower comparing to that in the subcritical regime for the two tandem cylinders the experimental study by okajima 1979 showed that the jump of the drag coefficient at the critical spacing l d 3 8 disappeared in the supercritical regime r e 6 3 10 5 and the drag coefficients and s t of both cylinders were slightly affected by the spacing ratio in short few of the previous studies attempted to provide systematic investigation on this flow around the two tandem cylinders in the supercritical and transcritical flow regimes the flow pattern pressure distributions mean and fluctuating drag and lift coefficients and s t for the two tandem cylinders at r e 10 6 have to be addressed in the present paper the characteristics of the flow passing two tandem circular cylinders at both subcritical and supercritical reynolds numbers are studied using the improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes for spacing ratios 2 l d 5 the numerical results have been compared with the experiments and other numerical solutions the flow structure pressure distributions reattachment position fluctuating fluid forces and s t obtained from the numerical computations for r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 are analyzed and discussed the effects of r e on the drag and lift forces on the cylinders are examined for 2 2 10 4 r e 5 5 10 6 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide a brief description of the numerical method in section 3 we compare the results for the flow structure pressure distributions and forces at the subcritical and supercritical reynolds numbers discuss their variation with respect to spacing ratios l d and study the effects of r e on the mean and fluctuating forces on the tandem cylinders finally concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 numerical models 2 1 iddes model the original detached eddy simulation des based on s a turbulence model was developed by spalart et al 1997 for simulation of the flows with massive flow separations the rans and les formulations was combined in the des where the rans is adopted for the near wall region and les is adopted in the flow separation and wake regions depending on the grid resolution in order to eliminate the possibility of modeled stress depletion or grid induced separation in original des the delayed des ddes was proposed by spalart et al 2006 iddes which combine ddes and wall modeling les wmles was proposed by shur et al 2008 in the formulation of iddes the ddes length scale is implemented to eliminate the modeled stress depletion in the original des approach while wmles is applied to achieve more accurate prediction of the mean velocity in boundary layer in the present study the iddes based on s a model is adopted the key idea of iddes based on s a model is to modify the length scale of the dissipation term in the s a turbulence formulation spalart and allmaras 1994 as given by spalart et al 1997 the s a turbulence formulation is written as 1 d d t v ρ υ d v s ρ υ u d s 1 δ υ s μ ρ υ υ d s v c b 2 ρ υ υ d v v g υ γ υ s υ d v where v is the volume of a cell s is the face area vector ρ is the fluid density υ is the modified diffusivity t is the time μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient δ υ is 2 3 c b 2 is 0 622 the first and the second items on the right side of 1 are the diffusion terms g υ γ υ and s υ are the production term the dissipation term and the source term of the eddy viscosity respectively the dissipation term γ υ should satisfy 2 γ υ ρ c w 1 f w c b 1 k 2 f t 2 υ d 2 where c w 1 is a balance function f t 2 is the model function f w is intermediate variable d is the length scale c b 1 is 0 1335 and k is 0 41 in the original des formulations d is computed by 3 d min d c d e s δ where d is the distance to the closest wall boundary δ max δ x δ y δ z is the maximum of the grid spacing with δ x δ y and δ z being the local streamwise wall normal and lateral cell sizes respectively c d e s is 0 65 since there are some obvious anisotropic grids i e δ x δ z δ y in the grid division close to the wall the des length scale is adopted in a turbulence model i e d d throughout the boundary layer while in the separated region or the regions away from the wall the sub grid scale sgs model i e d c d e s δ is adopted instead of a turbulence model whereas d c d e s δ can be activated in the inner of boundary layer when either fine wall parallel grid is used or boundary layer thickens this will reduce the eddy viscosity and cause the modeled stress depletion in boundary layer on the other hand if des is used for wall modeled les wmles the simulations can cause the log layer mismatch which may result in an under estimation of the skin friction nikitin et al 2000 to resolve these issues iddes model is proposed by defining d as 4 d f d 1 f e d 1 f d ψ c d e s δ 1 with 5 δ 1 min max 0 15 d 0 15 δ δ min δ 6 f d max 1 f d t f b 7 f d t 1 tanh c d t r d t 3 8 r d t υ k 2 d 2 max i j u i x j 2 1 2 10 10 where δ min denotes the minimum distance between the local grid center and the adjacent grid center ψ is low reynolds number correction υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient f b is an empirical blending function c d t is 8 0 and c d e s is 0 65 f e is the transform function if the simulation includes an inflow turbulence content of r d t 1 d will reduce to l w m l e s which is defined by 9 l w m l e s f b 1 f e d 1 f b ψ c d e s δ 1 otherwise d will be the ddes length scales l d d e s which is defined by 10 l d d e s d f d max 0 d ψ c d e s δ 1 where f d is the delaying function more details can be found in shur et al 2008 2 2 numerical method numerical simulations are performed using a cfd code cd adapco 2016 larsen 2013 based on finite volume method fvm a second order implicit scheme is applied for the temporal discretization for spatial discretization a second order upwind scheme is adopted simple algorithm is employed to treat the pressure and velocity coupling the cfl number is less than 0 2 in the flow regions of the gap between the cylinders and the near wake of the downstream cylinder in the cases of supercritical regime the turbulence viscosity is set to 5 times the molecular viscosity which implies the fully turbulence approach to the transition in the boundary layers on the cylinders 2 3 grid system and boundary conditions fig 1 presents the sketch of the computational domain with 30 d l 16 d 2 d here d 1 25 m and the boundary conditions the origin of the coordinate system is placed at the center of the upstream cylinder denoted as cylinder 1 the x axis y axis and z axis are along the streamwise direction transverse direction and the spanwise direction respectively the inlet boundary is extended to 10 d from the upstream cylinder the distance between outlet boundary and the downstream cylinder cylinder 2 is 20 d the width of computational domain is l y 16 d and the blockage ratio is d l y 6 25 the blockage ratio in the simulation is within the range of the values reported in the literature alam et al 2003 igarashi 1981 ljungkrona et al 1991 the spanwise size of the computational domain is set to l z 2 0 d in the study by weinmann et al 2014 the effect of spanwise domain size was examined for l z 12 d it is confirmed that l z provide rather small effects on the numerical results in the numerical simulations it should be ensured that the spanwise domain size is enough to capture all the relevant flow structures when the symmetry conditions are applied in the spanwise direction lehmkuhl et al 2014 rodríguez et al 2015 in the study on a single cylinder by lehmkuhl et al 2014 it was found that l z 0 5 π d was enough to capture the largest scales of the flow rodríguez et al 2015 reported that the spanwise size of l z 1 0 d can accommodate all flow structures around a single cylinder at supercritical reynolds numbers by evaluating two point correlations at different points in order to check if the spanwise size l z 2 0 d is large enough to accommodate all the flow structures for the present case with two cylinders the two point correlations in both the gap and wake regions are evaluated the two point correlation of the fluctuating variable r φ φ φ x y z t φ x y z δ z t φ 2 φ φ φ where the overbar denotes an averaging over time are shown in fig 2 as shown the correlation coefficients for all the three velocity streamwise transverse and spanwise velocities fluctuations drop to zero for l z 1 0 d hence a spanwise length of l z 2 0 d is adopted for the present study as shown in fig 1 the inlet boundary condition is set to be a uniform flow u x u 0 0 016 m s u 0 3 92 m s and a pressure based condition is used at the outlet symmetry conditions are applied in the spanwise direction no slip conditions are specified on the surfaces of two cylinders slip conditions are prescribed at the two lateral boundaries the details of grid refinement are shown in fig 3 based on the guideline for des like simulation by spalart 2001 the grids are refined in euler region er focus region fr and departure region dr in the fr which includes the gap between the cylinders and the near wake of the downstream cylinder the grids are isotropic with a size of 0 025 d the number of cells in the spanwise direction is 80 in the er and dr the grid sizes are 0 2 d and 0 4 d respectively the stretched hexahedral grids are used in the boundary layer and at least 40 prism layers are used to ensure y 1 the non dimensional wall normal distance y for r e 3 0 10 6 is plotted in fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 convergence study grid convergence study has been performed for the flow around two tandem circular cylinders at r e 3 0 10 6 with three different sets of grids for the case with l d 3 0 details of the grids the mean drag coefficients c d 1 c d 2 and fluctuating lift coefficients c l 1 and c l 2 are listed in table 1 the fluctuating lift coefficient is evaluated by taking the root mean square of the lift coefficient time traces as can be seen a base grid and a fine grid yield insignificant changes of these force coefficients the difference in terms of mean drag coefficients of the upstream cylinder c d 1 between the base grid and the fine grid is less than 1 as illustrated in fig 5 good consistency is also found between the surface pressure distributions on the cylinders using the base grid and the fine grid thus the base grid should be able to capture the flow behavior in addition the computations with different time step sizes using base grid have been carried out to verify the time step size convergence as shown in fig 6 the results with using δ t u 0 d 0 005 and δ t u 0 d 0 0025 have a good consistency which confirms that the convergence of results with increasing temporal resolutions is acceptable to minimize the computing cost the base grid with δ t u 0 d 0 005 is adopted in the present simulations the time histories are analyzed based on a time span of about 30 shedding cycles to ensure converged statistics 3 2 validation of computations in order to validate the present numerical model for computing the flow around cylinders at high reynolds numbers the unsteady force coefficients and pressure distributions on a single circular cylinder are computed the results have been compared with the experimental data roshko 1961 james et al 1980 achenbach and heinecke 1981 schewe 1983 hinsberg 2015 and the other numerical results travin et al 1999 ong et al 2009 moussaed et al 2014 table 2 shows the mean drag coefficient c d fluctuating lift coefficient c l and strouhal number s t at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 in table 2 s t f d u 0 where f is the frequency of the lift fluctuation as can be seen the present results at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 are within the range of the measurements consistent with the other numerical solutions using des travin et al 1999 and a hybrid approach blending rans and variational multiscale les model moussaed et al 2014 at r e 3 0 10 6 c d is 0 45 and c l is 0 05 which are much less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 while s t is higher at r e 3 0 10 6 the contours of instantaneous spanwise vorticity at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 are illustrated in fig 7 as shown the separation position moves from the front to the back of the cylinder the wake width d w d is estimated by using d w d c d c p b as suggested by roshko 1961 c p b is the base pressure coefficient i e the mean pressure coefficient at θ 180 the wake width d w d at r e 3 0 10 6 is 0 82 which is close to that reported by roshko 1961 it is also noticed that the wake width in the supercritical regime is smaller than that at r e 2 2 10 4 d w d 1 in addition fig 8 a shows the comparison of mean pressure coefficient c p of the single cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 with the experiments where the transition to turbulence in the boundary layer occurs at r e 3 0 10 6 it is assumed that the flow in the boundary layers is turbulence and the transition is completed before separation as reported in travin et al 1999 the results of iddes fall between the experimental data by james et al 1980 and those by roshko 1961 the predicted separation point θ 110 agrees well with the experimental data and the numerical solutions by travin et al 1999 fig 8 b presents the comparison of c l with the experimental data for 2 10 3 r e 3 10 6 the variation trend of c l with respect to r e is consistent with the experiments schewe 1983 norberg 2003 the numerical simulations of flow across two tandem cylinders in the subcritical flow regime are also validated by the published experimental data zdravkovich 1977 igarashi 1981 arie et al 1983 ljungkrona et al 1991 fig 9 shows the comparison of pressure distributions on the two cylinders in the case of l d 3 with experimental data as can be seen the pressure distributions on the upstream cylinder at r e 2 2 10 4 generally agree well with these experimental data in the subcritical flow regime as illustrated in fig 9 b the present results on the downstream cylinder are in accord with the experimental data by ljungkrona et al 1991 while they are slightly larger than the results of igarashi 1981 and arie et al 1983 when 50 θ 80 the difference can be attributed to the different r e between the present simulations and experiments by igarashi 1981 r e 3 5 10 5 and arie et al 1983 r e 1 6 10 5 fig 10 shows the comparison of mean drag coefficients of the two cylinders with published experimental and numerical data in the subcritical flow regime as can be seen the present mean drag coefficients for different l d are consistent with the experimental data and the les results by kitagawa and ohta 2008 based on these comparisons the present numerical model is confirmed to be able to simulate the flow across two tandem cylinders in both subcritical and supercritical flow regimes 3 3 instantaneous flow around two cylinders in this study flow structure is analyzed to explore the flow characteristic around two tandem circular cylinders in the subcritical and supercritical regimes fig 11 shows the instantaneous contours of the normalized spanwise vorticity ω z d u 0 in the mid span plane z d 1 0 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 with different spacing ratios l d as shown in fig 11 a e at r e 2 2 10 4 the shear layer separated from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the downstream cylinder and the vortex shedding forms only in the wake behind the downstream cylinder for l d 2 5 in addition the shear layer reattachment leads to the formation of small vortices near the front of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 11 c for l d 3 0 the flow patterns of shear layer reattachment and vortex formation coexist in the gap region which can be called bistable flow igarashi 1981 however as l d increases the kármán like vortex shedding occurs from the upstream cylinder as well as the downstream cylinder and these vortices shed from the upstream cylinder impinge on the downstream cylinder for l d 3 5 fig 11 f j illustrate the spanwise vorticity at r e 3 0 10 6 by comparing the flow characteristics it is found that the variation of the flow patterns as a function of l d at r e 3 0 10 6 are similar to those at r e 2 2 10 4 as shown in fig 11 h the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder also occurs for l d 3 5 however the separation positions of shear layer move from the front to the back of the upstream cylinder and the width of wake of the upstream cylinder becomes narrower at r e 3 0 10 6 for all the l d this behavior is time independent and similar to that for a single cylinder in the supercritical regime roshko 1961 sumer 2006 at r e 3 0 10 6 the reattachment positions for l d 3 0 move upstream due to the narrower width of the wake see fig 11 f h the variation of the reattachment position will be further investigated in section 3 5 in addition as shown in fig 11 j the length of vortex formation behind the upstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 is larger than that at r e 2 2 10 4 with l d 4 0 fig 12 shows the instantaneous contours of normalized vorticity magnitude on the x z plane y 0 for different l d at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 as shown at the two r e the high vorticity magnitude is found in the regions of shear layer reattachment vortex shedding formation and the wake behind the downstream cylinder as illustrated in fig 12 a b f and g for l d 2 5 the vorticity magnitude at the front and wake of the downstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 is lower than that at r e 2 2 10 4 for l d 4 0 the larger vorticity magnitude between the two cylinders can be observed in the region of 0 5 x d 2 at r e 2 2 10 4 while this region is shifted to 1 x d 2 5 at r e 3 0 10 6 see fig 11 e and j in order to understand the three dimensional vortical structures instantaneous vortical structures represented by the iso surface of a q criterion hunt et al 1988 sohankar 2014 are illustrated in fig 13 which presents the detailed instantaneous iso surface of q 1 5 u 0 2 d 2 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 the kelvin helmholtz type vortical structures are observed at the two reynolds numbers further it should be noted that the boundary layer instability occurs at the separation position for the upstream cylinder at r e 2 2 10 4 see fig 13 a and a delay of the onset of the boundary layer instability takes place at r e 3 0 10 6 see fig 13 b the separation points on the cylinders can be obtained by computing the skin friction coefficients of the cylinders the separation points on the upstream cylinders can be identified in fig 14 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 as shown the separation occurs at θ 89 when r e 2 2 10 4 while it moves to θ 109 when r e 3 0 10 6 in the supercritical regime the backward move of the separation point on the upstream cylinder is similar to that found on a single cylinder in the simulations it is also observed hat the separation points on the cylinders hardly changes with the physical time in order to further understand the differences in the flow physics between r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the wake turbulence and turbulence intensity are examined the wake turbulence can be quantified by the turbulence viscosity ratio μ t μ where μ t is the turbulence viscosity in fig 15 as shown in fig 15 a at r e 2 2 10 4 a high level of turbulence viscosity appears in the wake region of the upstream cylinder compared to that of the downstream cylinder in addition at r e 2 2 10 4 the level of turbulence viscosity in the region of vortex formation is higher than that in the shear layer on the upstream cylinder in contrast at r e 3 0 10 6 the highest turbulence viscosity mainly concentrate in the shear layer on the upstream cylinder rather than in the region of vortex formation the high level of turbulence viscosity in the shear layer can allow for a slow growth of shear layer instability it is also noted that the level of turbulence viscosity in the wake at r e 3 0 10 6 is much higher than that at r e 2 2 10 4 the distribution of turbulence intensity i x u r m s u u r m s and u denote the rms value and mean value of the streamwise velocity respectively along the centerline y d 0 for l d 4 0 is shown in fig 16 as shown in fig 16 a compared to r e 2 2 10 4 at r e 3 0 10 6 the peak to peak value of turbulence intensity is less and the positions of the peaks are delayed the distance between the position of negative peak in the distribution of turbulence intensity and the center of upstream cylinder denotes the length of vortex formation it can be observed that the length of vortex formation behind the upstream cylinder is enlarged at r e 3 0 10 6 which is consistent with the observation in the plot of vorticity field as illustrated in fig 11 however for the downstream cylinder it is obeserved that the length of vortex formation is shortened at r e 3 0 10 6 see fig 16 b this suggests that the effect of the impingement of the vortex shed from the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder in the supercritical regime can be distinct from that in the subcritical regime the distributions of time averaged streamwise velocity u u 0 along the centreline y d 0 are plotted in fig 17 u is the streamwise velocity as shown in fig 17 a at r e 2 2 10 4 the length of the recirculation bubble behind the upstream cylinder is about 1 1 i e x d 1 1 at u u 0 0 which agrees with the result of a single cylinder by travin et al 1999 however at r e 3 0 10 6 the recirculation zone behind the upstream cylinder is larger than that at r e 2 2 10 4 this can be correlated with the turbulence separation and narrow wake behind the upstream cylinder since the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder impinge on the downstream cylinder at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 the recirculation zones behind the downstream cylinder are close at the two reynolds numbers as shown in fig 17 b however the time averaged streamwise velocities in the region of x d 5 0 at r e 3 0 10 6 are larger than those at r e 2 2 10 4 fig 18 illustrates the power spectral density psd of transverse velocity v fluctuations in the gap region between the cylinders and wake region behind the downstream cylinder for l d 4 0 two numerical probes are placed at x d 2 y d 0 5 and x d 6 y d 0 5 respectively in the two plots a pronounced peak of psd of v is observed for gap region and wake region at r e 2 2 10 4 the dominant frequencies in gap region and wake region are almost the same this dominant frequency f d u 0 0 2 is close to the vortex shedding frequency of a single cylinder in the subcritical regime however at r e 3 0 10 6 the dominant frequency rises up to f d u 0 0 29 this is because that the interaction of shear layers is intensified at the supercritical reynolds number due to the decrease of the width between shear layers and hence the periodic vortices shed in higher frequency in addition the f 5 3 law is plotted in fig 18 as can be seen the resolved turbulence scale is located in the inertial subrange the figure also shows that the spectra in gap region have a similar inertial subrange as those in wake region 3 4 pressure distribution the time averaged and fluctuating pressure distributions on the surfaces of cylinders for different l d are presented in figs 19 and 20 respectively c p 1 c p 1 p 1 p 0 0 5 ρ u o 2 p 1 is the time averaged pressure on the upstream cylinder and c p 2 c p 2 p 2 p 0 0 5 ρ u o 2 p 2 is the time averaged pressure on the downstream cylinder are the mean pressure coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively the experimental data igarashi 1981 ljungkrona et al 1991 and the other numerical solutions kitagawa and ohta 2008 in subcritical flow regime are also presented for comparison as shown in fig 19 a c and e the present results of c p 1 at r e 2 2 10 4 agree well with these experimental data and the other numerical results at 2 10 4 r e 3 5 10 4 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the time averaged pressure distributions of upstream cylinder are almost unchanged with spacing ratios for l d 3 0 this is due to the similar flow patterns involving the reattachment of the shear layers for l d 3 0 see fig 11 a b c f g and h as shown in fig 19 e at r e 2 2 10 4 c p 1 in the range of θ 100 decreases rapidly with the increase of θ for l d 4 0 which is different from the case for l d 3 0 the reason is that the larger vorticity magnitude is generated near the rear of the upstream cylinder for l d 4 0 seen fig 12 e as can be seen at r e 2 2 10 4 the minimum of c p 1 appears at θ 67 and the separation point is in the neighborhood of θ 90 however at r e 3 0 10 6 the different pressure distributions are formed with a minimum of c p 1 at θ 78 followed by a turbulence separation at θ 110 as illustrated in fig 19 e the minimum of c p 1 at r e 3 0 10 6 is lower while the base pressure is larger comparing to that at r e 2 2 10 4 as shown in fig 19 b and d the distributions of c p 2 are almost independent of l d for l d 3 0 at the two r e this can be explained by the similar flow patterns for l d 3 0 where the shear layer from the upstream cylinder reattaches to the downstream cylinder the reattachment position is reflected as a peak in c p 2 at 40 θ 80 at r e 3 0 10 6 the reattachment position moves toward lower θ due to the narrowing wake behind the upstream cylinder see fig 11 f h compared with that at r e 2 2 10 4 further the peak of c p 2 and the base pressure coefficient at r e 3 0 10 6 are larger than those at r e 2 2 10 4 for l d 4 0 as illustrated in fig 19 f the distributions of c p 2 at both r e are somewhat similar in shape to that of c p 1 at r e 2 2 10 4 c p 2 are always negative which is distinct from that for the upstream cylinder c p 1 this is because the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder strongly impinge on the surface of the downstream cylinder nevertheless it is observed that the values of c p 2 in 0 θ 40 are positive at r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 it indicates that the impact of vortices impingement on the pressure distributions of the downstream cylinder is reduced at r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 4 0 fig 20 a c and e show the fluctuating pressure coefficients of the upstream cylinder for l d 2 5 3 0 and 4 0 c p 1 c p 1 p 1 p 0 0 5 ρ u o 2 p 1 is the fluctuating pressure on the upstream cylinder and c p 2 c p 2 p 2 p 0 0 5 ρ u o 2 p 2 is the fluctuating pressure on the downstream cylinder are the root mean square values of pressure coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively the present results at r e 2 2 10 4 agree with the experimental data ljungkrona et al 1991 and the les results by kitagawa and ohta 2008 the values of c p 1 at r e 3 0 10 6 are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 because the boundary layer on the upstream cylinder is turbulence at r e 3 0 10 6 in the study on a single cylinder at high reynolds numbers by schewe 1983 and hinsberg 2015 the fluctuating lift forces at r e 2 5 10 6 were also less than those at the subcritical reynolds numbers r e 1 10 5 due to the turbulence separation in the supercritical and transcritical flow regimes r e 2 5 10 6 as shown the peaks in c p 1 move to θ 110 at r e 3 0 10 6 the fluctuating pressure coefficients of the downstream cylinder are illustrated in the fig 20 b d and f as shown at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the fluctuating pressure coefficients of the downstream cylinder are relatively larger compared with those of the upstream cylinder two peaks appear in the fluctuating pressure distributions on the downstream cylinder the first peak in 40 θ 80 is due to the reattachment of the shear layer from the upstream cylinder the second peak in 90 θ 120 is at the separation position on the rear surface of the downstream cylinder it should be noted that the separation on the downstream cylinder always occurs at 100 θ 110 and are almost independent of r e it is also found that the values of c p 2 at r e 3 0 10 6 are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 3 5 reattachment position for l d 3 0 the shear layer from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the surface of the downstream cylinder the reattachment positions θ r denoted as the θ at the peak of c p 2 are illustrated in fig 21 as shown at r e 2 2 10 4 the present results agree with the les results by kitagawa and ohta 2008 while somewhat larger than the experimental data by alam et al 2003 this overestimation of θ r may be attributed to the difference in r e ljungkrona et al 1991 investigated the effects of r e on the pressure coefficients for l d 2 5 their results indicated that the reattachment position θ r decreased as r e increased from 2 0 10 4 to 6 0 10 4 the different r e may lead to the discrepancy between the present results r e 2 2 10 4 and the experimental data r e 6 5 10 4 by alam et al 2003 nevertheless the present results show similar trend as the experiments in the subcritical regime for l d 2 0 the reattachment position of the shear layer is θ r 64 as l d increases θ r slightly drops to 62 for l d 2 5 beyond this spacing θ r rises and the reattachment position moves backward alam et al 2003 examined the effect of the change of reattachment position on the fluid forces of the downstream cylinder their results indicate that the fluctuating fluid forces increase when the reattachment position moves forward it should be noted that at r e 3 0 10 6 the values of θ r are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 due to the narrower width of wake behind the upstream cylinder in addition at r e 3 0 10 6 θ r gradually reduces as l d rises 3 6 fluid forces and strouhal number fig 22 presents the time histories of the drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l for r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 for different l d as shown in fig 22 a and b for l d 2 0 the fluctuations of c d and c l on the upstream cylinder are weaker than that on downstream cylinder at both r e the fluctuation of c l for the upstream cylinder is caused by the movement of the shear layers while that for downstream cylinder is attributed to the vortex shedding however the fluctuation magnitude of c l of the downstream cylinder is much larger than that of the upstream cylinder at r e 2 2 10 4 it can be attributed to the fact that the vortex shedding only occurs behind the downstream cylinder for l d 2 0 similar phenomenon can be observed for r e 3 0 10 6 but the fluctuations of c d and c l are weaker than those at r e 2 2 10 4 in the study on a single cylinder by schewe 1983 the fluctuating drag and lift coefficients in the supercritical regimes were also less than those in the subcritical regime as shown in fig 22 d for l d 3 0 the fluctuations of c l on the downstream cylinder are weaker in comparison with those for l d 2 0 for l d 3 0 bistable flow pattern occurs and can impact the vortex shedding behind the downstream cylinder see also fig 11 as shown in fig 22 e and f for l d 4 0 the fluctuations of c d and c l for the upstream and downstream cylinders are stronger than those for l d 3 0 because the vortices are formed behind both cylinders it is also observed that the fluctuation magnitudes per vortex shedding period for both c d and c l are quite different the non stationary fluctuations of c d on the downstream cylinder is more remarkable the non stationary fluctuations may be attributed the fact the strength of vortices shed from upstream cylinder and the impingement positions on the downstream cylinder are varying with respect to time the similar phenomenon was found in the study on the tandem cylinders by kitagawa and ohta 2008 sohankar 2014 gopalan and jaiman 2015 fig 23 a shows the variation of the mean drag coefficients c d 1 of the upstream cylinder with l d for r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the experimental data and numerical solutions by les in the subcritical flow regime are also included in the figure for comparison as shown the present results agree with experimental data at r e 2 2 10 4 c d 1 gradually drops with the increase of l d for l d 3 5 in addition the value of c d 1 jumps to around 1 25 for l d 3 5 for l d 5 0 the value of c d 1 is around 1 2 at r e 2 2 10 4 and agrees with that for a single cylinder in the subcritical regime by schewe 1983 the critical spacing l d 3 5 is consistent with that observed in experiments igarashi 1981 ljungkrona et al 1991 alam et al 2003 compared with the solution at r e 2 2 10 4 c d 1 at r e 3 0 10 6 is relatively smaller in addition at r e 3 0 10 6 no critical spacing can be observed and c d 1 changes little with l d for l d 5 0 as shown in fig 23 b the mean drag coefficients of the downstream cylinder c d 2 at r e 2 2 10 4 increases sharply around l d 3 5 as those of the upstream cylinder c d 1 however c d 2 are always less than c d 1 at r e 2 2 10 4 it is observed that at r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 3 5 c d 2 increases gradually with l d while for l d 3 5 the c d 2 increases abruptly and approaches to 0 5 this behavior is similar to that at r e 2 2 10 4 although the jump is relatively smaller at r e 3 0 10 6 with l d 3 5 different from that at r e 2 2 10 4 c d 2 are close to c d 1 the fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream cylinder c l 1 and the downstream cylinder c l 2 are presented in fig 23 c and d respectively the present results of c l 1 and c l 2 for l d 3 5 agree with the experimental data by arie et al 1983 except those for l d 3 5 being slightly larger than the experimental results as can be seen the increase of r e leads to the decreases of c l 1 and c l 2 for l d 3 5 the discrepancy in the fluctuating lift coefficients between the present computations and the experiments may be due to different r e in general the variation tendency of the predicted fluctuating lift coefficients with l d is consistent with the experiments and the les simulations by kitagawa and ohta 2008 as can be seen for l d 3 5 the values of c l 1 at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 are similar the c l 1 increases suddenly at r e 2 2 10 4 for l d 3 5 while it is almost invariant at r e 3 0 10 6 for l d 5 0 the value of c l 1 is around 0 02 at r e 3 0 10 6 which is close to the result for a single cylinder in the supercritical regime schewe 1983 in addition as shown in fig 23 d although the values of c l 2 are much lower at r e 3 0 10 6 the variation tendencey of c l 2 at r e 3 0 10 6 is similar to that at r e 2 2 10 4 fig 24 a and b illustrate the power spectral density psd of the lift coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders for l d 4 0 as shown the dominant frequencies in the psd for the upstream and downstream cylinders are almost the same at r e 2 2 10 4 the vortex shedding frequencies of the two cylinders are about 0 183 which are in good agreement with the les predictions by kitagawa and ohta 2008 at r e 3 0 10 6 the vortex shedding frequencies of the upstream and downstream cylinders are 0 28 and are larger than those at r e 2 2 10 4 this is due to the narrower width of wake caused by backward movement of the separation point see also fig 11 moreover as shown the peak amplitude at r e 3 0 10 6 is smaller than that at r e 2 2 10 4 which indicates that the vortex strength is relatively weaker at r e 3 0 10 6 fig 25 shows the variation of s t of the downstream cylinder with respect to l d at r e 2 2 10 4 the present results of s t are in good agreement with the experimental data ljungkrona et al 1991 igarashi 1981 at r e 2 2 10 4 the s t shows a stepwise increase around l d 3 5 the similar behavior can be observed at r e 3 0 10 6 it is found that s t values for l d 3 5 with r e 3 0 10 6 are close to that at r e 2 2 10 4 due to the effect of the reattachment of shear layers while for l d 3 5 the s t values at r e 3 0 10 6 are much larger than those at r e 2 2 10 4 we remark that for a single cylinder relatively larger s t can be identified in the supercritical regime schewe 1983 3 7 phase lag of the fluctuating lift force between two cylinders for l d 3 5 the vortex shedding occurs behind both cylinders and the phase of the vortex shedding can affect the fluctuating lift force alam et al 2003 in this section the phase lag of fluctuating lift force between two cylinders corresponding to the phase lag of the vortex shedding has been examined for r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 fig 26 shows the phase lag of fluctuating lift force between the two cylinders for different l d the phase lag denoted by φ is obtained from the cross correlation between the fluctuating lift forces of the upstream and the downstream cylinders the relationship between φ and l d in the subcritical regime r e 6 5 10 4 can be written as alam et al 2003 11 φ r a d 0 508 π l d 0 85 π as shown in fig 26 the present results for r e 2 2 10 4 are almost proportional to l d and follow 11 however it is found that the slope of the best fit line for φ and l d at r e 3 0 10 6 is much larger than that for r e 2 2 10 4 which suggests that φ is more sensitive to l d at r e 3 0 10 6 in addition the mean convection velocity of the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder u c can be obtained based on these values of φ as discussed by kitagawa and ohta 2008 the u c is evaluated by 12 u c 2 π s t l d φ fig 27 shows the variation of u c with respect to l d at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 as can be seen the present results of u c at r e 2 2 10 4 agree with those of kitagawa and ohta 2008 the values of u c for different l d at r e 2 2 10 4 are between 0 56 and 0 66 corresponding to 56 66 of the freestream velocity however at r e 3 0 10 6 the values of u c are in the range of 70 80 of the freestream velocity it means that the convection velocities of the vortices shed from the upstream cylinders are higher at the supercritical reynolds number than those at the subcritical reynolds number it is also found that the values of u c at both r e increase slightly as l d grows 3 8 effect of r e on the forces figs 28 and 29 illustrate the mean drag c d and fluctuating lift c l coefficients of the two cylinders at different reynolds numbers for l d 2 5 and l d 4 0 the experimental results of the single cylinder achenbach 1971 schewe 1983 norberg 2003 are also plotted in these graphs for comparison the comparisons show that the present results agree well with the experimental data as can be seen from fig 28 a for l d 2 5 the variation trend of c d with r e for the upstream cylinder is similar to that for a single cylinder however the c d of the downstream cylinder gradually grows with the increasing r e the difference between the c d for the upstream and downstream cylinders at the supercritical reynolds numbers r e 1 0 10 6 is smaller than that at the subcritical reynolds numbers i e r e 1 0 10 5 this can be attributed to the different reattachment positions at subcritical and supercritical reynolds numbers see fig 21 as illustrated in fig 28 b the c l on the upstream cylinder are almost nil with l d 2 5 for 2 2 10 4 r e 5 5 10 6 it is because the shear layer separated from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the downstream cylinder for l d 2 5 hence vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder is not formed however the value of c l for the downstream cylinder approaches to 0 5 at r e 2 2 10 4 and it gradually drops as r e rises this behavior is similar to that for the case of a single cylinder in addition as illustrated in fig 29 a and b for l d 4 0 c d and c l of the upstream cylinder are similar to those of a single cylinder the decrease of c l for the upstream cylinder is observed for 6 0 10 4 r e 6 0 10 5 however the variation trend of c d with r e for downstream cylinder is rather different from that for upstream cylinder or a single cylinder for r e 1 0 10 5 the values of c d for downstream cylinder are much less than those of upstream cylinder and the single cylinder as shown in fig 29 b the values of c l for the downstream cylinder are always larger than those for the upstream cylinder the reason may be that the impingements of vortices shed from the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder see fig 11 intensify the fluctuations of force on the downstream cylinder in addition it shows that for r e 1 0 10 6 the c l of both cylinders changes little with respect to r e 4 conclusions in the present paper the characteristics of the flow around two tandem cylinders in the subcritical and supercritical flow regimes have been studied by direct numerical investigation the flow structures separation and reattachment positions pressure distributions and fluid forces with different l d are analyzed and discussed in order to validate the present numerical model for computing the flow around the cylinders at high reynolds numbers the hydrodynamic forces on the single cylinder in both subcritical and supercritical regimes are also computed and analyzed the results show that the present computations have a satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data the main conclusions can be summarized as follow 1 at r e 3 0 10 6 the two point correlation coefficients for streamwise transverse and spanwise velocity fluctuations drop to around zero when the spanwise size of the cylinder approaches to 1 0 d it suggests that the spanwise size should be above 1 0 d for accurate simulation of the flow around two tandem cylinders in the supercritical flow regime 2 by examining the instantaneous flow around the two tandem cylinders it is found that at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 the shear layer from the upstream cylinder reattaches on the surface of the downstream cylinder for l d 3 5 while the vortex shedding occurs behind both cylinders for l d 3 5 compared with the case at r e 2 2 10 4 since the transition is completed before separation the separation position on the upstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 moves backward and the width of wake becomes narrower for l d 4 0 at r e 3 0 10 6 the length of vortex formation for the upstream cylinder is enlarged while it is shortened for the downstream cylinder compared to those at r e 2 2 10 4 3 comparing to the case at r e 2 2 10 4 at r e 3 0 10 6 the base pressures on the cylinders are larger while the fluctuating pressure on the cylinders are relatively lower for l d 4 0 the mean pressure coefficients of the downstream c p 2 are always negative at r e 2 2 10 4 however it is found that the c p 2 in 0 θ 40 are positive at r e 3 0 10 6 it indicates that at r e 3 0 10 6 the impact of vortices impingement on the pressure distributions of the downstream cylinder reduces in addition the reattachment angles at r e 3 0 10 6 are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 due to the narrower width of the shear layers from the upstream cylinder 4 the mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 are less than those at r e 2 2 10 4 c d 1 and c l 1 almost do not change with l d at r e 3 0 10 6 which is different from the jump of the force coefficients around the critical spacing at r e 2 2 10 4 however c d 2 and c l 2 at r e 3 0 10 6 increase abruptly for l d 3 5 although the amplitude of jump is not significant in addition s t of the downstream cylinder at r e 3 0 10 6 is higher than that at r e 2 2 10 4 with l d 3 5 these suggest that the scale effects associated with r e are important for understanding and predicting the flow characteristics on the multi column floating structures in full scale 5 the phase lag of the fluctuating lift force between the two cylinders φ has an almost linear relationship with l d at r e 2 2 10 4 and r e 3 0 10 6 however at r e 3 0 10 6 the slope of the best fit line for φ and l d is relatively larger than that at r e 2 2 10 4 which suggests that φ can be more sensitive to l d furthermore based on the φ the convection velocity of the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder u c at both r e are computed it is found that at r e 3 0 10 6 the values of u c are 70 80 of the freestream velocity which are higher than those at r e 2 2 10 4 it also shows that the u c rises slightly with the increase of l d 6 for 2 2 10 4 r e 5 5 10 6 the variations of mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients with respect to r e for the tandem cylinders are different from those for a single cylinder for l d 2 5 as r e increases the mean drag coefficients of the upstream cylinder drop sharply at the critical reynolds number but those of the downstream cylinder grow gradually the fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream cylinder are in general independent of r e different from the results for l d 2 5 for l d 4 0 the mean drag coefficients of the downstream cylinder decrease slightly as r e increases and the fluctuating lift coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders drop with the growth of r e moreover it is also observed that the fluctuating lift coefficients of the downstream cylinders are much larger than those of the upstream cylinder
