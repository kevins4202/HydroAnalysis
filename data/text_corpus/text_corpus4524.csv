22620,the objective of this paper is to investigate the multiphase flow during water entry of spheres with different surface wettability for low froude numbers in the experiment a synchronous trigger system based on a high speed digital camera is established to obtain the impact images for both qualitative and quantitative analysis firstly the influence of surface wettability and impact velocity on the hydrodynamics and kinematics of splash and cavity is investigated the results show that the impact of the hydrophilic case creates a smaller splash and there are obvious differences in both the contact line position and the splash collapse rate due to the surface wettability in addition the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres experience different cavity regimes as the impact velocity increases for deep seal cavity cases two water jetting in opposite directions are formed at the point where cavity pinches off and boost the cavities collapse after pinch off the lower cavity around the hydrophilic sphere is more stable and the cavity ripples are not obvious compared to the hydrophobic one secondly the effect of surface wettability on the trajectory velocity and acceleration of the sphere as well as the hydrodynamic force it experiences is further investigated results show that the force coefficient in the no cavity forming case is dramatically high in the cavity forming cases the hydrophobic sphere undergoes higher force coefficients the difference in force coefficients is due to the combined effects of the surface wettability and impact velocity keywords water entry surface wettability multiphase flow cavity hydrodynamic force 1 introduction the water entry refers to an unsteady and complex multiphase process where a solid object passes through the free surface from air region into water region with three phase solid liquid and gas interaction seddon and moatamedi 2006 marston et al 2012 ding et al 2015 bergmann et al 2009 duclaux et al 2007 after initial impact a splash and an air cavity may be formed behind the object depending on the initial condition and surface treatment the splash and cavity dynamics decisively affects the forces acting on the object thereby influencing the subsequent motion and trajectory abraham et al 2014 wang et al 2018a hao et al 2018a b wu et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2017a the phenomenon of water entry is ubiquitous and has been investigated over 100 years because of its wide applications to industry natural science bionics and naval technology kubota and mochizuki 2015 cross 2016 epps and techet 2007 bush and hu 2006 truscott et al 2012a especially for the naval application the air to sea projectile has gained the attention due to its remarkable performance to defend against frogloks torpedoes or mines which requires the projectile to operate in a natural supercavity in order to achieve global stability and a significant reduction of hydrodynamic drag may 1975 lee et al 2013 jiang et al 2018 erfanian et al 2015 li et al 2018 thus the great interests for effective design of projectiles are leading to investigate the cavity dynamics and hydrodynamic characteristics during water entry water entry process is an interesting and challenging issue associated with the complex hydrodynamic phenomena such as turbulence phase change and compressibility thoroddsen et al 2004 wang et al 2017b 2018b wu et al 2018b to improve the understanding of these problems numerous experimental studies have been conducted by many researchers the effect factors on generation and development of the splash and cavity during water entry were firstly investigated by worthington and cole 1897 based on high speed imaging techniques they capture the earliest splash cavity images using single spark photography as the improving of imaging technique advances digital high speed cameras are widely applied for recording water entry hydrodynamics may and woodhull 1950 conducted many experiments of water entry projectiles for naval applications the air cavity formation created by high speed impact were obtained and it was found that the drag coefficient is a function of both the reynolds and froude numbers gilbarg and anderson 1948 concluded that the atmospheric pressure is an influencing factor on the impact problem and the surface closure which has significant effect on the cavity development is inversely proportional to the atmospheric pressure recently aristoff et al 2008 aristoff and bush 2009 presented the results of the normal impact of hydrophobic spheres on a water surface using a combined experimental and theoretical method they found that both the surface tension and fluid viscosity have significant effect on cavity development at low bond number wei and hu 2014a 2015 investigated the three dimensional effect on water entry of horizontal cylinders the effect of length to diameter ratio cylinder water density ratio and impact velocity were discussed quantitatively in their work meanwhile experiment on a sphere was also performed for comparison furthermore extensive experiments on water entry of spheres were performed by truscott and techet 2009a b techet and truscott 2011 their results indicated that spin leads to asymmetric splash cavity and curved trajectory but appears to have minimal effect on cavity pinch off and collapse in addition the forces acting on the spheres are a function of reynolds number and spin parameter the effect of other factors of the spheres on water entry behavior as well as the crown sealing and buckling instability were also analyzed in their other works truscott et al 2014 marston et al 2016 based on the prior extensive investigations the influence factors on cavity dynamics during water entry can be classified into two categories namely the external factors and the physical attributes as the material and coating techniques develops the surface wettability which is one of the most important physical attributes has generally gained great attention and interest of investigating its effect on cavity dynamics during water entry in early experimental studies worthington 1908 and may 1951 found that it is easier for the impact of a sphere with dirty surface to generate larger air cavity than the sphere with clean and smooth surface whereas the surface treatment is not rigorous and the concepts about wettability are not clear at that time duez et al 2007 discovered that the critical velocity is a function of the static contact angle of the impacting body using the experimental and theoretical methods they demonstrated that an air cavity is created during the impact only above the critical velocity and this theory is used for discussion in present study truscott and techet 2012b investigated the unsteady forces on impact spheres with varying surface treatments using piv techniques and theoretical methods the results showed that the dynamics of non cavity forming hydrophilic spheres and cavity forming hydrophobic spheres are unsteady for different reasons and the force coefficients are much larger in non cavity forming cases than that in cavity forming cases although the research of water entry has significantly increased in the past decades little attention is paid to the splash characteristics which has significant interaction with the subsurface cavity moreover the influence of surface wettability on splash and cavity dynamics as well as the hydrodynamic characteristics during water entry of objects are still not well understood hence additional and further studies are necessary the purpose of the paper is to 1 investigate the splash and cavity characteristics especially their interaction during water entry of the spheres with different surface wettability and 2 investigate effect of surface wettability on the relationship between cavity formation and hydrodynamic force acting on the sphere by analyzing its descent trajectory velocity and acceleration 2 experimental setup and description the experiment was performed at atmospheric pressure with the room temperature at 23 c the schematic illustration of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 1 a steel sphere diameter d 0 25 mm is held by an electromagnet at a height h r above the quiescent water surface in a tank the cubic tank has dimensions of 0 8 m 0 8 m 1 0 m for each side and depth which is made by acrylic plates with the thickness of 15 mm to reinforce the tank aluminum alloy profiles are fixed on each edge and the bottom a rubber mat with the thickness of 10 mm is paved at the inner bottom of the tank in order to avoid the damage due to spheres impacting the spheres used in the experiment are made of steel with the density ratio ρ ρ s ρ 7 86 where ρ s is the density of the steel sphere and ρ 998 kg m3 is the pure water density the physical characteristics and parameters of the spheres are shown in table 1 every aspect of the spheres is identical but their surface wettability is different due to different surface treatment for hydrophilic sphere the surface is cleaned using ethanol then kept in a closed dust free vessel before used for hydrophobic sphere the surface is cleaned in the same way and then coated twice with a spray coating of sy supercoat shfc3150 after 8 hours drying of the first coating the sphere is coated again and stayed for 3 days in the dust free vessel the thickness of the coating is slight enough within 100 μm so the effect on the diameter and density of the steel sphere can be safely ignored the surface roughness for the spheres are measured using a dr300 surface profilometer the root mean square r m s of each roughness are shown in table 1 with measurement error of 0 01 μm this static contact angle is measured using the sessile drop method by a xg camc3 contact angle meter specifically five random places on each sphere are chosen to hold the distilled water drops which provides the average static contact angle θ c 70 5 and θ c 150 5 for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres respectively the cartesian coordinate is established in fig 1 and the position where the bottom of the sphere right touches the free surface is considered as the origin z 0 m x 0 m with the vertical down as the positive direction of z axis and the touching moment is taken as the initial impact moment t 0 ms in the experiment 10 different release heights basing on the center of the sphere above the quiescent water in tank are considered the range of release height is 2 5 cm h r 295 cm by adjusting the vertical position of slide clamp as shown in fig 1 with fixed x and y a system of trigger is also employed for synchronous releasing the sphere and image capture the program is run on a computer which can control the switch of electromagnet when the electromagnet is switched off the steel sphere falls freely meanwhile the high speed digital video camera phantom v7 3 begins to record images the impact sequences are recorded at 2000 fps with the resolution of 352 1128 pixels the trajectory of the sphere is determined with subpixel accuracy through a cross correlation and gaussian peak fitting method which is similar with the method proposed by truscott and techet 2009a in other word the trajectory of sphere is obtained from the position of the sphere center relative to the origin during the water entry the dominated effect factors on measurement error for vertical z direction position are the image resolution and video acquisition rate to extract the position as accurately as possible the average value of five times measurements for every image is used and the error estimate is 0 5 pixels corresponding to an uncertainty of 3 38 10 4 m the fifth order polynomial curve fit to the vertical position is chosen with a correlation coefficient of r 2 0 99 the velocity and acceleration are considered by taking the first and second derivatives of the position the errors are estimated to be within 5 in velocity acceleration and force the initial impact velocity extracted from the image sequences are in good agreement with the ideal value u 0 2 g h r corresponding to a range 0 70 0 05 m s u 0 7 60 0 05 m s in the same way the velocity of the splash crown is obtained from the position of splash tip which is extracted from the image sequence the error for the position of the splash crown is estimated within 5 the quality of high speed video is affected crucially by the lighting in the experiment back lighting lateral lighting and front lighting are adopted for the back lighting two 1000 w hydrargyrum medium arc iodide hmi lamps are aligned vertically and placed directly behind the impact zone outside of the tank which are projected light directly towards the camera a diffuser is placed between the back lighting and the impact zone to provide a uniform and white backdrop to obtain more clearly splash and cavity two 500 w led lamps are used as the lateral lighting positioned at each side of the tank and another two 500 w led lamps are used as the front lighting placed symmetrically around the camera both the lateral and front lighting are focused towards the impact region it is noted that the tank and the water surface should be kept clean and the sphere is salvaged cleaned and dried every time after water entry the qualitative behavior of water entry can be discussed for the dimensionless parameters capillary number ca μu 0 σ reynolds number re ρu 0 d 0 μ weber number we ρu 0 2 r 0 σ and froude number f r u 0 g d 0 which is presented in table 2 the properties of water are dynamic viscosity μ 0 001003 pa s and surface tension σ 0 072 n m repeated experiments are operated and results are consistent for each design condition to better understand the effect of surface wettability on the cavity formation created by the impact of sphere the parameters for each experimental case are plotted in fig 2 as well as the theoretical cavity predictions from duez et al 2007 in the theory the critical impact velocity u for air cavity is a function of static contact angle θ c of the impacting body in present study the impact velocity u 0 is discussed by the dimensionless parameter of capillary number ca and the solid line in fig 2 represents the critical values for the capillary number ca based on the theory air cavity can be only formed when ca ca shown as the light gray region in fig 2 this critical capillary number has a constant value ca 0 1 for all the hydrophilic cases θ c 90 however the ca for the hydrophobic cases θ c 90 is not stable but decreasing nonlinearly with increased θ c especially the value of ca drops approximately to 0 when θ c 160 indicating that cavity can be formed for the case at any impact velocity in addition the experimental results from duez et al 2007 truscott and techet 2009b and truscott et al 2012b are illustrated in fig 2 which provides strong support for the theory as for present study the hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases at 10 different capillary numbers are shown as circle symbols in fig 2 it is found that the impact of sphere can create a cavity although the capillary number is slightly below the critical value this water entry cavity can be considered as in a transition state from non cavity forming to cavity forming state and this transition region is marked dark gray in fig 2 the similar phenomenon is also found in the work of truscott and techet 2009b considered presumably due to the effect of roughness which is needed further investigation the typical cases are chosen and discussed later 3 results and discussion the water entry of sphere generally creates a splash above the free surface and a subsurface cavity apart from the geometric and initial motion parameters of the sphere the surface static contact angle plays an important role in dominating the splash characteristics and cavity dynamics the water entry process can be considered in five stages may 1975 namely the moment of impact the flow forming stage the open cavity and splash growth stage the closed cavity and pinch off stage and the collapsing cavity stage to reveal the effect of surface wettability on the splash evolution cavity dynamics and hydrodynamic characteristics of the spheres the experimental results of water entry spheres with different surface wettability are discussed according to these five distinct stages and details are explained in the following contents 3 1 effect of surface wettability on the splash evolution fig 3 a and b present the side view image sequences of the splash behavior during water entry of the hydrophilic θ c 70 and hydrophobic θ c 150 spheres at same impact velocity u 0 4 25 m s ca 0 0593 fr 8 6 respectively the first frame for each case is captured at 2 0 ms after the moment of impact t 0 ms taking the time interval between successive frames as δt 2 0 ms firstly for the qualitative analysis the difference in splash evolution for these two cases at low fr is obvious specifically for the hydrophilic sphere the part of water occupied by the sphere is ejected at the point of contact after the moment of impact forming a weak initial jetting this jetting could not grow horizontally to evolve into the splash crown but a weak splash which just moves upward along the surface of the hydrophilic sphere in the form of a liquid film during the flow forming stage indicated by the red arrows in fig 3 a 1 2 eventually this weak splash closes up at the apex of the sphere shortly after the sphere is fully submerged as shown in fig 3 a 3 which results in no air cavity generated and only few bubbles attached to the top of the sphere as shown in fig 3 a 4 for the case of hydrophobic sphere the capillary number in this case is above the critical value ca 0 00372 the initial jetting is much stronger and extends in both height and diameter to form a splash crown in the flow forming stage as shown in fig 3 b 1 2 this splash crown opens to the atmosphere and continues to grow up reaching a maximum diameter approximately 2d 0 then the splash crown shrinks inward and experiences the splash dome over and early surface seal marston et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 b 4 6 after the subsurface cavity deep seal two distinct water jetting in opposite directions upper and lower are formed at the point of pinch off the upward impinged jetting brings the separated cavity to the free surface causing an inverted rising of the splash dome and eventually ejects throughout the free surface as shown in fig 3 b 7 8 in order to extend the study on splash characteristics at varied impact velocities three typical cases of hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres with the impact velocity of u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s corresponding to ca 0 0593 0 0753 and 0 0872 are chosen for quantitative discussion fig 4 a presents the definition of triple line contact point and the effect of the static contact angle on splash behavior there is a complex interaction between water air and the solid sphere during water entry which creates a triple line contact point referring to the position of flow separation for the three phases do quang and amberg 2009 in general a splash forms for the hydrophobic case light gray half above the critical capillary number while the water remains attached for the hydrophilic case dark gray half below the capillary number truscott et al 2014 the history position of the contact line h c d 0 relative to the bottom of the sphere in the flow forming stage 0 ms t 6 ms is made dimensionless using the sphere diameter d 0 as shown in fig 4 b the solid symbols henceforth denote the hydrophilic cases while the hollow symbols indicate the hydrophobic cases the moving speed of the contact line which depends on both the surface wettability and impact velocity can be obtained by curvature of the history line in the initial stage 0 ms t 0 5 ms the contact lines move upwards for all cases and the history positions of the contact line for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases at same impact velocity are almost overlapped while the ascending speed of the contact line in the case of u 0 5 40 m s is higher than that of u 0 4 25 m s and in the case of u 0 6 25 m s the ascending speed is lowest which shows the effect of the impact velocity dominates in this stage this phenomenon indicates that as the impact velocity approaches the critical velocity duez et al 2007 splash becomes larger and obvious with more volume and faster entrainment of air flow which restrains the contact line from moving upwards when t 0 5 ms the difference in the contact line behavior becomes obvious under the surface wettability influence it can be observed that the triple line contact point stops approximately at h c d 0 0 35 for all the hydrophobic cases of θ c 150 with a big splash crown and air cavity formed as for hydrophilic sphere of θ c 70 the splash crown and air cavity are relatively weaker and the contact line stops at a higher relative position than that of hydrophobic sphere with an approximate value of h c d 0 0 49 for the cases at u 0 5 40 m s and 6 25 m s however for the hydrophilic case at u 0 4 25 m s the contact line ascends generally and closes up at the apex of the sphere at once the sphere is fully submerged without splash and air cavity t 6 ms as mentioned above it should be noted that for the cavity forming case the contact line keeps the contact position until cavity pinch off then the contact point starts to move upwards as the lower cavity breaks up eventually sheds and closes up at apex of the sphere which is not shown here the definition of the crown size extracted from the experimental images is shown in fig 5 a and b and the tendency of the crown size during both the growth and collapse stages of splash for different surface wettability spheres are listed in fig 5 c and d basing on fig 5 a and b the crown size is described by d sc and h sc where d sc is taken the minimum crown diameter at the top region marston et al 2016 and the h sc is the vertical height from the position of the crown top diameter to the free surface basing on fig 5 c and d the results are transferred into dimensionless format by dividing the sphere diameter d 0 and the case of u 0 4 25 θ c 70 is not considered here because of no splash crown in general the maximum diameter and height of the splash crown increases with the impact velocity for all cases under the same impact velocity the impact of hydrophobic sphere generates a much larger splash both in diameter and height also taking more time to form the splash dome over moreover the differences in the top diameter and height of the crown are slight for all cases until t 4 5 ms then the splash size in hydrophilic case grows more slowly when the splash crown approaches seal the data in fig 5 c indicate that the collapse rate of crown diameter is almost linear with the value of u c dd sc 2 dt 1 73 3 02 and 3 01 m s for the hydrophobic cases at u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s respectively meanwhile the collapse rates are u c 1 13 and 2 01 m s for the hydrophilic cases at u 0 5 40 and 6 25 m s respectively as for the crown height the growth rates for both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases at the same impact velocity are pretty close in the flow forming stage while the nonlinear collapse rate generally increases first and then decreases for all cases it can also be observed that higher impact velocity leads to a larger growth and collapse rate these results of the splash growth and collapse support the view mentioned above that the impact of hydrophobic sphere with increasing velocity generates larger splash bringing not only more volume of air entrainment but also higher speed air flow through into the crown which leads to a greater differential pressure between the ambient pressure and the lower pressure inside the splash in addition the surface tension also plays an important role in the splash evolution marston et al 2016 thus with the combined effects of the differential pressure inside and outside of the crown as well as the surface tension and the kinetic energy of the splash curve the splash crown grows and collapses in different rate for varied case 3 2 effect of surface wettability on the cavity characteristics during water entry apart from the splash evolution characteristics the most obvious and special behavior of water entry affected by surface wettability is the cavity dynamics figs 6 8 and 9 shows the experimental image sequence of cavity behavior from the side view when the hydrophilic θ c 70 and hydrophobic θ c 150 spheres entry water in the impact velocity of u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s respectively for the case of spheres at u 0 4 25 m s ca 0 0593 fr 8 6 we 3130 2 the hydrophilic sphere sinks and completely immerses in water with few tiny bubbles attached to the top of the sphere as shown in fig 6 a in this regime the capillary number corresponding to the impact velocity is less than the critical value of ca 0 1 and no air cavity forms meanwhile the impact of hydrophilic sphere creates a substantial air cavity and a splash crown when the capillary number is much larger than the critical value ca 0 00372 the cavity wall is smooth until the splash crown closure occurs then a water jetting falls back into the cavity and influences cavity wall to be rough as shown in fig 6 b 6 no more air can flow into the cavity after the splash crown seal nevertheless the cavity continues to stretch and expand during the sphere following the expansion of the cavity wall is illustrated in fig 7 and it can be seen that the expansion stage and shrink stage ma et al 2014 of the air cavity wall can exist at the same time following of the descending hydrophobic sphere there are two main reasons for this phenomenon one reason is that as the depth of the sphere with cavity increasing the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water increases meanwhile the sphere also decelerates generally to give less kinetic energy to the displaced water which shortens the course of cavity expansion the other reason is that the bottom part of the cavity which is closely attached to the sphere can still keep expansion for a quite short time after the sphere passes by under the effect of these two aspects the growth of the cavity far away from the sphere starts to be suppressed stopped then shrank to form the pinch off at a depth approximately two fifths between the surface and the sphere as shown in fig 6 b 8 this impact regime is known as deep seal after which the air cavity is split upward and downward into two parts in both the upper and lower cavities a rayleigh taylor instability develops at the point of pinch off and two distinct water jetting in opposite directions penetrate the cavities respectively as shown in fig 6 b 9 furthermore ripples in the attached lower cavity are also observed after cavity pinch off these cavity ripples are likely an acoustic phenomenon and related to the resonant volume oscillations of the cavity which can produce a re entrant water jetting mentioned above to form the initial pressure perturbation as the sphere descends the ripples increase along with cavity collapse in tail region as shown in fig 6b 10 eventually the lower cavity begins to break up into bubbles which rise to the free surface and the sphere is totally wet by water meanwhile the upper cavity also collapses rapidly and almost pulled inside out by the high speed water jetting as the impact velocity increases ca 0 0753 fr 10 9 we 5053 4 the cavity forms get changed shown in fig 8 the impact of hydrophilic creates a subsurface air cavity and a weak splash as the capillary number is in the transition state which is sensitive to the effect of roughness and mentioned in section 2 the cavity starts to collapse into tiny bubbles outside in near the surface after descending about 4 sphere diameters as shown in fig 8 a 4 and generally forms a neck like air cavity to connect the surface and the lower cavity attached to the sphere as shown in fig 8 a 5 eventually the air cavity first pinches at a depth of approximate half sphere diameter as shown in fig 8 b 6 this impact regime is characterized its near surface collapse and could be referred to as transition state seal between no cavity and the surface seal impact regime for the hydrophobic case the impact is still in the deep seal regime forming a substantial air cavity following the sphere however the depth of pinch off is greater and the cavity curve approaches to close near the free surface as shown in fig 8 b 8 but it still reascends to connect to the surface under the effect of hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 8 b 10 which means the sphere is already moving beyond the deep seal regime into surface seal regime furthermore it can be observed that the volume of air entrainment in the cavity of the hydrophilic sphere is much less than that of the hydrophobic sphere and the cavity in hydrophilic case after pinch off is more stable than that in hydrophobic case as ripples and oscillations are not obvious further increases the impact velocity to u 0 6 25 m s ca 0 0872 fr 12 6 we 6769 5 the cavity dynamics are shown in fig 9 here both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres generate a cavity closure event just under the free surface as shown in fig 9 a 6 fig 9 b 7 which occurs before the deep seal and this regime is named surface seal after the surface seal the attached cavity still expands as the sphere descents without air entering in which causes cavity tending to pinch off under the effect of hydrostatic pressure meanwhile a rayleigh taylor instability develops on the position of surface seal resulting a re entrant water jet into the cavity aristoff and bush 2009 as expected the volume of air entrainment in the cavity of the hydrophilic sphere is still much less than that of the hydrophobic sphere and the time of surface seal for hydrophilic sphere is earlier besides the cavity may experience multiple pinch offs and cavity ripples before the sinking sphere is totally wet 3 3 effect of surface wettability on sphere trajectory and hydrodynamic characteristics the experimental images show great differences on the sphere trajectory under the effect of the wettability figs 10 and 11 illustrate the vertical descent trajectory velocity and acceleration versus time for hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres at the impact velocity u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s respectively the method for extracting the data from images has been mentioned above in the experimental setup section apart from the dimensionless sphere trajectory z s d 0 where z s is the position of the center of the descending sphere the moments for cavity seal are also plotted on fig 10 basing on the cartesian coordinates established in fig 1 the origin of z 0 m x 0 m is the position where sphere bottom contacts the free surface and the corresponding moment is the impact moment t 0 ms in general when t 30 ms it is difficult to distinguish between the trajectories of the hydrophilic spheres and that of the hydrophobic spheres for the cases at same impact velocity as the sphere descents the difference in the subsequent trajectory appears gradually although the steel sphere has much great density the data shows the surface wettability is the dominant effect on sphere trajectory for cases at low impact velocity u 0 4 25 m s specifically the hydrophilic sphere in non cavity forming case is totally submerged in water and the drag is larger than the hydrophobic sphere in cavity forming case thus the hydrophilic sphere descends relatively slower may 1951 duclaux et al 2007 aristoff et al 2008 truscott et al 2012b however as the impact velocity increases air cavities are formed for all the cases and the trajectory of the hydrophilic sphere is slightly lower than that of the hydrophobic one which means the hydrophilic sphere has smaller drag and descends faster in cavity forming case the descent velocity dz s dt and acceleration d2 z s dt 2 tendency of sphere in the z direction versus time are shown in fig 11 and results are made dimensionless using a constant speed u con 6 25 m s and gravity respectively in general both the velocities and accelerations decrease with time for all cases as for velocity tendency as shown in fig 11 a it can be observed that the hydrophilic sphere without air cavity loses speed more rapidly than the hydrophobic one with cavity at low impact velocities u 0 4 25 m s which indicates a higher drag when sphere is fully wet however as the impact velocity increases to u 0 5 40 and 6 25 m s cavity can form for all cases and the hydrophilic sphere keeps speed better than the hydrophobic one this is because the hydrophobic sphere receives a greater upward force buoyancy and the added mass forces than the hydrophilic sphere due to larger volume of air entrainment which results in more obvious downward deceleration as for acceleration tendency as shown in fig 11 b the effect of surface wettability is also significant the acceleration can equivalently reflect the impact loading during water entry of the sphere it has been shown in van nuffel et al 2014 and chen et al 2019 that the pulse width of the peak impact loading is much smaller than the time interval of 0 5 ms of the experimental data extraction in present study therefore it is difficult to obtain an accurate peak impact loading that using the fifth order polynomial curve to fit the original data however the interaction between the cavity evolution and hydrodynamic characteristics of the sphere under water is the focus in present study ignoring the peak impact loading firstly it can be observed that the acceleration in the hydrophilic case without cavity is much larger than that of the hydrophobic case with cavity under the same impact velocity of u 0 4 25 m s secondly the accelerations in the cavity forming cases increases dramatically with the increasing impact velocity furthermore compared to the hydrophilic results the accelerations in the hydrophobic cases at u 0 5 40 m s and 6 25 m s have larger value at the initial impacting stage but decrease more rapidly as the sphere descending eventually the acceleration in the hydrophobic case is even slightly less than that in hydrophilic case with cavity formed under the same impact velocity all the phenomena can be explained by the forces acting on the spheres under the effect of surface wettability and impact velocity by using above acceleration d2 z s dt 2 data the forces acting on the descent sphere are discussed the net force on the sphere in the z direction is 3 1 m z s t m g p n ˆ k ˆ d s n ˆ t k ˆ d s π d 0 σ cos φ where m 1 6 πd 0 3 ρ s is the sphere mass g is gravity acceleration n ˆ is the unit normal vector directed out of the sphere k ˆ is the unit vectors along positive z direction t is the viscous stress tensor and φ is the angle that the cavity makes with respect to the vertical at the triple line contact point f σ πd 0 σcos φ is the surface tension force which can be neglected as it is less than 1 of the gravitational force πd 0 σcos φ 1 6 πd 0 3 ρ s g 6σcos φ d 0 2 ρ s g 10 3 based on eq 3 1 the total hydrodynamic force f which reflects the synthetical interaction of the sphere with the surrounding fluids truscott et al 2012b is considered to be balanced by gravitational and inertia forces of the impact sphere 3 2 m g m z s t p n ˆ k ˆ d s n ˆ t k ˆ d s π d 0 σ cos φ f t this force f is also considered as the sum of added mass force f a buoyancy force f b drag force f d and surface tension force f σ mansoor et al 2017 which is helpful to analyze the influence of each force on the sphere and can be written as another form 3 3 f t f a t f b t f d t f σ to better discuss the relationship between the time varying force f t and velocity dz s dt the total hydrodynamic force coefficient is calculated as follow mansoor et al 2017 3 4 c f t f t 1 2 ρ z s t 2 π 1 4 d 0 2 8 m g z s t ρ z s t 2 π d 0 2 in fig 12 the tendency of the hydrodynamic force coefficients versus time is shown for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres under u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s in general the force coefficients increase with time for all cases but the increasing rate are different it should be noted that the force coefficient for the hydrophilic case of u 0 4 25 m s is much higher than others and increases steeply with time eventually reaching the maxima at an approximate value of c f 0 8 which indicates that the drag is quite high when sphere is fully wet in addition the c f values are all less than 0 41 for other cases which is nearly half of the fully wet sphere it can be also observed that the hydrophobic sphere receives higher force coefficients than the hydrophilic one at same impact velocity with air cavity which indicates that the hydrophilic cases have better performance of drag reduction than the hydrophobic cases when spheres impact with air cavity furthermore the results show the force coefficients for the cases at u 0 5 40 m s are higher than that for the cases at u 0 6 25 m s in conclusion the force coefficient is unsteady and complex during the sphere entering water here a qualitative analysis is carried based on the explanation for the acceleration mentioned above and eqs 3 1 3 3 the difference in force coefficients is resulted from the combined effects of the surface wettability and impact velocity for no cavity cases the viscous stress of water plays an important role in the force coefficient evolution for cavity cases higher descent velocity of the sphere results in greater drag force f d which is beneficial to model deceleration when the impact velocity is constant the hydrophobic sphere receives greater added mass force f a and total buoyancy force f b than the hydrophilic sphere due to more volume of air entrainment v c meanwhile the decreasing descent velocity leads to lower drag force f d the force coefficients are determined by the sum of the forces which depend on the descent velocity and cavity formation in different stages of sphere water entry process to better investigate the force acting on the sphere with more flow information experimental study by using piv techniques are recommended in the future work 4 conclusions and future work in this study the multiphase flow characteristics during water entry of spheres with different surface wettability for low froude numbers was investigated experimentally a synchronous trigger system based on a high speed digital camera was established to obtain the impact images for both qualitative and quantitative analysis the steel spheres used in the experiments have a same diameter of 25 mm and the density ratio of sphere to water ρ 7 86 by applying different surface treatment there are hydrophilic sphere with the static contact angle θ c 70 5 and hydrophobic sphere with θ c 150 5 respectively both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres were released from 10 different heights and typical impact velocity u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s are chosen for discussion the main findings include 1 the surface wettability has significant effect on splash evolution in the case of low impact velocity the contact line closes up at the apex of the hydrophilic sphere shortly after it is fully submerged and no splash crown is formed as the impact velocity increases the hydrophilic case generates a weaker splash crown than the hydrophobic one both in diameter and height direction and the contact line stops at a higher relative position of the sphere meanwhile the collapse rates of splash crown for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases are increased with the increasing impact velocity but the crown collapse in hydrophilic case occurs earlier furthermore the splash evolution interacts with the subsurface cavity dynamics no more air can flow into the cavity after the splash crown seal and the splash dome experiences an inverted rising due to the upper cavity ascending to the free surface and collapsing upward rapidly after cavity pinch off 2 the most obvious and special behavior of water entry affected by surface wettability is the cavity characteristics for the hydrophilic sphere it successively experiences the no cavity shallow seal impact cavity and surface seal impact cavity regimes as the impact velocity increases meanwhile the deep seal impact cavity and surface seal impact cavity regimes are occurred successively for hydrophobic case for the hydrophobic cases the expansion stage and shrink stage of the air cavity wall can exist at the same time following the movement of the descending sphere due to the effects of the water hydrostatic pressure and kinetic energy of the sphere eventually leading to pinch off the water jetting is developed at the point of pinch off in opposite directions and boosts the cavities collapse moreover the volume of air entrainment in the hydrophilic case is much less than that in the hydrophobic case and the lower cavity attached to the hydrophilic sphere after pinch off is more stable as the ripples and oscillations are not obvious 3 trajectory descent velocity and acceleration were obtained by processing the experimental images and the total hydrodynamic force coefficient is quantitatively discussed the results show the hydrophilic case with no cavity formed has dramatically high force coefficients however as the impact velocity increases the force coefficients of the hydrophilic cases with air cavity are less than that in the hydrophobic cases the difference in force coefficients is resulted from the combined effects of the surface wettability and impact velocity for the hydrophobic sphere undergoing greater total buoyancy force and added mass force than the hydrophilic sphere due to more volume of air entrainment while the decreasing descent velocity leads to lower drag force these conclusions can be regarded as the base of a mechanism study for water entry problems of complex ocean equipment such as launching of torpedoes and air to sea projectiles water entry of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs ship slamming and the deployment of oceanographic measuring devices as water entry is a challenging and serious issue further investigation is still necessary the authors will modify the theoretical formula of critical capillary number by analyzing the surface roughness and other possible influencing factors in future work as well as use piv techniques to quantitatively analyze the cavity dynamics and each component of the total hydrodynamic force with more flow information besides extended study on other initial conditions of water entry could be conducted by considering different structural material such as polymer which are the potential engineering materials wei and hu 2014b as well as the temperature of sphere and fluid the rotation and different geometrical projectiles additional theoretical and numerical studies are also needed to complete the experimental findings and improve the

22620,the objective of this paper is to investigate the multiphase flow during water entry of spheres with different surface wettability for low froude numbers in the experiment a synchronous trigger system based on a high speed digital camera is established to obtain the impact images for both qualitative and quantitative analysis firstly the influence of surface wettability and impact velocity on the hydrodynamics and kinematics of splash and cavity is investigated the results show that the impact of the hydrophilic case creates a smaller splash and there are obvious differences in both the contact line position and the splash collapse rate due to the surface wettability in addition the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres experience different cavity regimes as the impact velocity increases for deep seal cavity cases two water jetting in opposite directions are formed at the point where cavity pinches off and boost the cavities collapse after pinch off the lower cavity around the hydrophilic sphere is more stable and the cavity ripples are not obvious compared to the hydrophobic one secondly the effect of surface wettability on the trajectory velocity and acceleration of the sphere as well as the hydrodynamic force it experiences is further investigated results show that the force coefficient in the no cavity forming case is dramatically high in the cavity forming cases the hydrophobic sphere undergoes higher force coefficients the difference in force coefficients is due to the combined effects of the surface wettability and impact velocity keywords water entry surface wettability multiphase flow cavity hydrodynamic force 1 introduction the water entry refers to an unsteady and complex multiphase process where a solid object passes through the free surface from air region into water region with three phase solid liquid and gas interaction seddon and moatamedi 2006 marston et al 2012 ding et al 2015 bergmann et al 2009 duclaux et al 2007 after initial impact a splash and an air cavity may be formed behind the object depending on the initial condition and surface treatment the splash and cavity dynamics decisively affects the forces acting on the object thereby influencing the subsequent motion and trajectory abraham et al 2014 wang et al 2018a hao et al 2018a b wu et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2017a the phenomenon of water entry is ubiquitous and has been investigated over 100 years because of its wide applications to industry natural science bionics and naval technology kubota and mochizuki 2015 cross 2016 epps and techet 2007 bush and hu 2006 truscott et al 2012a especially for the naval application the air to sea projectile has gained the attention due to its remarkable performance to defend against frogloks torpedoes or mines which requires the projectile to operate in a natural supercavity in order to achieve global stability and a significant reduction of hydrodynamic drag may 1975 lee et al 2013 jiang et al 2018 erfanian et al 2015 li et al 2018 thus the great interests for effective design of projectiles are leading to investigate the cavity dynamics and hydrodynamic characteristics during water entry water entry process is an interesting and challenging issue associated with the complex hydrodynamic phenomena such as turbulence phase change and compressibility thoroddsen et al 2004 wang et al 2017b 2018b wu et al 2018b to improve the understanding of these problems numerous experimental studies have been conducted by many researchers the effect factors on generation and development of the splash and cavity during water entry were firstly investigated by worthington and cole 1897 based on high speed imaging techniques they capture the earliest splash cavity images using single spark photography as the improving of imaging technique advances digital high speed cameras are widely applied for recording water entry hydrodynamics may and woodhull 1950 conducted many experiments of water entry projectiles for naval applications the air cavity formation created by high speed impact were obtained and it was found that the drag coefficient is a function of both the reynolds and froude numbers gilbarg and anderson 1948 concluded that the atmospheric pressure is an influencing factor on the impact problem and the surface closure which has significant effect on the cavity development is inversely proportional to the atmospheric pressure recently aristoff et al 2008 aristoff and bush 2009 presented the results of the normal impact of hydrophobic spheres on a water surface using a combined experimental and theoretical method they found that both the surface tension and fluid viscosity have significant effect on cavity development at low bond number wei and hu 2014a 2015 investigated the three dimensional effect on water entry of horizontal cylinders the effect of length to diameter ratio cylinder water density ratio and impact velocity were discussed quantitatively in their work meanwhile experiment on a sphere was also performed for comparison furthermore extensive experiments on water entry of spheres were performed by truscott and techet 2009a b techet and truscott 2011 their results indicated that spin leads to asymmetric splash cavity and curved trajectory but appears to have minimal effect on cavity pinch off and collapse in addition the forces acting on the spheres are a function of reynolds number and spin parameter the effect of other factors of the spheres on water entry behavior as well as the crown sealing and buckling instability were also analyzed in their other works truscott et al 2014 marston et al 2016 based on the prior extensive investigations the influence factors on cavity dynamics during water entry can be classified into two categories namely the external factors and the physical attributes as the material and coating techniques develops the surface wettability which is one of the most important physical attributes has generally gained great attention and interest of investigating its effect on cavity dynamics during water entry in early experimental studies worthington 1908 and may 1951 found that it is easier for the impact of a sphere with dirty surface to generate larger air cavity than the sphere with clean and smooth surface whereas the surface treatment is not rigorous and the concepts about wettability are not clear at that time duez et al 2007 discovered that the critical velocity is a function of the static contact angle of the impacting body using the experimental and theoretical methods they demonstrated that an air cavity is created during the impact only above the critical velocity and this theory is used for discussion in present study truscott and techet 2012b investigated the unsteady forces on impact spheres with varying surface treatments using piv techniques and theoretical methods the results showed that the dynamics of non cavity forming hydrophilic spheres and cavity forming hydrophobic spheres are unsteady for different reasons and the force coefficients are much larger in non cavity forming cases than that in cavity forming cases although the research of water entry has significantly increased in the past decades little attention is paid to the splash characteristics which has significant interaction with the subsurface cavity moreover the influence of surface wettability on splash and cavity dynamics as well as the hydrodynamic characteristics during water entry of objects are still not well understood hence additional and further studies are necessary the purpose of the paper is to 1 investigate the splash and cavity characteristics especially their interaction during water entry of the spheres with different surface wettability and 2 investigate effect of surface wettability on the relationship between cavity formation and hydrodynamic force acting on the sphere by analyzing its descent trajectory velocity and acceleration 2 experimental setup and description the experiment was performed at atmospheric pressure with the room temperature at 23 c the schematic illustration of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 1 a steel sphere diameter d 0 25 mm is held by an electromagnet at a height h r above the quiescent water surface in a tank the cubic tank has dimensions of 0 8 m 0 8 m 1 0 m for each side and depth which is made by acrylic plates with the thickness of 15 mm to reinforce the tank aluminum alloy profiles are fixed on each edge and the bottom a rubber mat with the thickness of 10 mm is paved at the inner bottom of the tank in order to avoid the damage due to spheres impacting the spheres used in the experiment are made of steel with the density ratio ρ ρ s ρ 7 86 where ρ s is the density of the steel sphere and ρ 998 kg m3 is the pure water density the physical characteristics and parameters of the spheres are shown in table 1 every aspect of the spheres is identical but their surface wettability is different due to different surface treatment for hydrophilic sphere the surface is cleaned using ethanol then kept in a closed dust free vessel before used for hydrophobic sphere the surface is cleaned in the same way and then coated twice with a spray coating of sy supercoat shfc3150 after 8 hours drying of the first coating the sphere is coated again and stayed for 3 days in the dust free vessel the thickness of the coating is slight enough within 100 μm so the effect on the diameter and density of the steel sphere can be safely ignored the surface roughness for the spheres are measured using a dr300 surface profilometer the root mean square r m s of each roughness are shown in table 1 with measurement error of 0 01 μm this static contact angle is measured using the sessile drop method by a xg camc3 contact angle meter specifically five random places on each sphere are chosen to hold the distilled water drops which provides the average static contact angle θ c 70 5 and θ c 150 5 for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres respectively the cartesian coordinate is established in fig 1 and the position where the bottom of the sphere right touches the free surface is considered as the origin z 0 m x 0 m with the vertical down as the positive direction of z axis and the touching moment is taken as the initial impact moment t 0 ms in the experiment 10 different release heights basing on the center of the sphere above the quiescent water in tank are considered the range of release height is 2 5 cm h r 295 cm by adjusting the vertical position of slide clamp as shown in fig 1 with fixed x and y a system of trigger is also employed for synchronous releasing the sphere and image capture the program is run on a computer which can control the switch of electromagnet when the electromagnet is switched off the steel sphere falls freely meanwhile the high speed digital video camera phantom v7 3 begins to record images the impact sequences are recorded at 2000 fps with the resolution of 352 1128 pixels the trajectory of the sphere is determined with subpixel accuracy through a cross correlation and gaussian peak fitting method which is similar with the method proposed by truscott and techet 2009a in other word the trajectory of sphere is obtained from the position of the sphere center relative to the origin during the water entry the dominated effect factors on measurement error for vertical z direction position are the image resolution and video acquisition rate to extract the position as accurately as possible the average value of five times measurements for every image is used and the error estimate is 0 5 pixels corresponding to an uncertainty of 3 38 10 4 m the fifth order polynomial curve fit to the vertical position is chosen with a correlation coefficient of r 2 0 99 the velocity and acceleration are considered by taking the first and second derivatives of the position the errors are estimated to be within 5 in velocity acceleration and force the initial impact velocity extracted from the image sequences are in good agreement with the ideal value u 0 2 g h r corresponding to a range 0 70 0 05 m s u 0 7 60 0 05 m s in the same way the velocity of the splash crown is obtained from the position of splash tip which is extracted from the image sequence the error for the position of the splash crown is estimated within 5 the quality of high speed video is affected crucially by the lighting in the experiment back lighting lateral lighting and front lighting are adopted for the back lighting two 1000 w hydrargyrum medium arc iodide hmi lamps are aligned vertically and placed directly behind the impact zone outside of the tank which are projected light directly towards the camera a diffuser is placed between the back lighting and the impact zone to provide a uniform and white backdrop to obtain more clearly splash and cavity two 500 w led lamps are used as the lateral lighting positioned at each side of the tank and another two 500 w led lamps are used as the front lighting placed symmetrically around the camera both the lateral and front lighting are focused towards the impact region it is noted that the tank and the water surface should be kept clean and the sphere is salvaged cleaned and dried every time after water entry the qualitative behavior of water entry can be discussed for the dimensionless parameters capillary number ca μu 0 σ reynolds number re ρu 0 d 0 μ weber number we ρu 0 2 r 0 σ and froude number f r u 0 g d 0 which is presented in table 2 the properties of water are dynamic viscosity μ 0 001003 pa s and surface tension σ 0 072 n m repeated experiments are operated and results are consistent for each design condition to better understand the effect of surface wettability on the cavity formation created by the impact of sphere the parameters for each experimental case are plotted in fig 2 as well as the theoretical cavity predictions from duez et al 2007 in the theory the critical impact velocity u for air cavity is a function of static contact angle θ c of the impacting body in present study the impact velocity u 0 is discussed by the dimensionless parameter of capillary number ca and the solid line in fig 2 represents the critical values for the capillary number ca based on the theory air cavity can be only formed when ca ca shown as the light gray region in fig 2 this critical capillary number has a constant value ca 0 1 for all the hydrophilic cases θ c 90 however the ca for the hydrophobic cases θ c 90 is not stable but decreasing nonlinearly with increased θ c especially the value of ca drops approximately to 0 when θ c 160 indicating that cavity can be formed for the case at any impact velocity in addition the experimental results from duez et al 2007 truscott and techet 2009b and truscott et al 2012b are illustrated in fig 2 which provides strong support for the theory as for present study the hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases at 10 different capillary numbers are shown as circle symbols in fig 2 it is found that the impact of sphere can create a cavity although the capillary number is slightly below the critical value this water entry cavity can be considered as in a transition state from non cavity forming to cavity forming state and this transition region is marked dark gray in fig 2 the similar phenomenon is also found in the work of truscott and techet 2009b considered presumably due to the effect of roughness which is needed further investigation the typical cases are chosen and discussed later 3 results and discussion the water entry of sphere generally creates a splash above the free surface and a subsurface cavity apart from the geometric and initial motion parameters of the sphere the surface static contact angle plays an important role in dominating the splash characteristics and cavity dynamics the water entry process can be considered in five stages may 1975 namely the moment of impact the flow forming stage the open cavity and splash growth stage the closed cavity and pinch off stage and the collapsing cavity stage to reveal the effect of surface wettability on the splash evolution cavity dynamics and hydrodynamic characteristics of the spheres the experimental results of water entry spheres with different surface wettability are discussed according to these five distinct stages and details are explained in the following contents 3 1 effect of surface wettability on the splash evolution fig 3 a and b present the side view image sequences of the splash behavior during water entry of the hydrophilic θ c 70 and hydrophobic θ c 150 spheres at same impact velocity u 0 4 25 m s ca 0 0593 fr 8 6 respectively the first frame for each case is captured at 2 0 ms after the moment of impact t 0 ms taking the time interval between successive frames as δt 2 0 ms firstly for the qualitative analysis the difference in splash evolution for these two cases at low fr is obvious specifically for the hydrophilic sphere the part of water occupied by the sphere is ejected at the point of contact after the moment of impact forming a weak initial jetting this jetting could not grow horizontally to evolve into the splash crown but a weak splash which just moves upward along the surface of the hydrophilic sphere in the form of a liquid film during the flow forming stage indicated by the red arrows in fig 3 a 1 2 eventually this weak splash closes up at the apex of the sphere shortly after the sphere is fully submerged as shown in fig 3 a 3 which results in no air cavity generated and only few bubbles attached to the top of the sphere as shown in fig 3 a 4 for the case of hydrophobic sphere the capillary number in this case is above the critical value ca 0 00372 the initial jetting is much stronger and extends in both height and diameter to form a splash crown in the flow forming stage as shown in fig 3 b 1 2 this splash crown opens to the atmosphere and continues to grow up reaching a maximum diameter approximately 2d 0 then the splash crown shrinks inward and experiences the splash dome over and early surface seal marston et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 b 4 6 after the subsurface cavity deep seal two distinct water jetting in opposite directions upper and lower are formed at the point of pinch off the upward impinged jetting brings the separated cavity to the free surface causing an inverted rising of the splash dome and eventually ejects throughout the free surface as shown in fig 3 b 7 8 in order to extend the study on splash characteristics at varied impact velocities three typical cases of hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres with the impact velocity of u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s corresponding to ca 0 0593 0 0753 and 0 0872 are chosen for quantitative discussion fig 4 a presents the definition of triple line contact point and the effect of the static contact angle on splash behavior there is a complex interaction between water air and the solid sphere during water entry which creates a triple line contact point referring to the position of flow separation for the three phases do quang and amberg 2009 in general a splash forms for the hydrophobic case light gray half above the critical capillary number while the water remains attached for the hydrophilic case dark gray half below the capillary number truscott et al 2014 the history position of the contact line h c d 0 relative to the bottom of the sphere in the flow forming stage 0 ms t 6 ms is made dimensionless using the sphere diameter d 0 as shown in fig 4 b the solid symbols henceforth denote the hydrophilic cases while the hollow symbols indicate the hydrophobic cases the moving speed of the contact line which depends on both the surface wettability and impact velocity can be obtained by curvature of the history line in the initial stage 0 ms t 0 5 ms the contact lines move upwards for all cases and the history positions of the contact line for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases at same impact velocity are almost overlapped while the ascending speed of the contact line in the case of u 0 5 40 m s is higher than that of u 0 4 25 m s and in the case of u 0 6 25 m s the ascending speed is lowest which shows the effect of the impact velocity dominates in this stage this phenomenon indicates that as the impact velocity approaches the critical velocity duez et al 2007 splash becomes larger and obvious with more volume and faster entrainment of air flow which restrains the contact line from moving upwards when t 0 5 ms the difference in the contact line behavior becomes obvious under the surface wettability influence it can be observed that the triple line contact point stops approximately at h c d 0 0 35 for all the hydrophobic cases of θ c 150 with a big splash crown and air cavity formed as for hydrophilic sphere of θ c 70 the splash crown and air cavity are relatively weaker and the contact line stops at a higher relative position than that of hydrophobic sphere with an approximate value of h c d 0 0 49 for the cases at u 0 5 40 m s and 6 25 m s however for the hydrophilic case at u 0 4 25 m s the contact line ascends generally and closes up at the apex of the sphere at once the sphere is fully submerged without splash and air cavity t 6 ms as mentioned above it should be noted that for the cavity forming case the contact line keeps the contact position until cavity pinch off then the contact point starts to move upwards as the lower cavity breaks up eventually sheds and closes up at apex of the sphere which is not shown here the definition of the crown size extracted from the experimental images is shown in fig 5 a and b and the tendency of the crown size during both the growth and collapse stages of splash for different surface wettability spheres are listed in fig 5 c and d basing on fig 5 a and b the crown size is described by d sc and h sc where d sc is taken the minimum crown diameter at the top region marston et al 2016 and the h sc is the vertical height from the position of the crown top diameter to the free surface basing on fig 5 c and d the results are transferred into dimensionless format by dividing the sphere diameter d 0 and the case of u 0 4 25 θ c 70 is not considered here because of no splash crown in general the maximum diameter and height of the splash crown increases with the impact velocity for all cases under the same impact velocity the impact of hydrophobic sphere generates a much larger splash both in diameter and height also taking more time to form the splash dome over moreover the differences in the top diameter and height of the crown are slight for all cases until t 4 5 ms then the splash size in hydrophilic case grows more slowly when the splash crown approaches seal the data in fig 5 c indicate that the collapse rate of crown diameter is almost linear with the value of u c dd sc 2 dt 1 73 3 02 and 3 01 m s for the hydrophobic cases at u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s respectively meanwhile the collapse rates are u c 1 13 and 2 01 m s for the hydrophilic cases at u 0 5 40 and 6 25 m s respectively as for the crown height the growth rates for both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases at the same impact velocity are pretty close in the flow forming stage while the nonlinear collapse rate generally increases first and then decreases for all cases it can also be observed that higher impact velocity leads to a larger growth and collapse rate these results of the splash growth and collapse support the view mentioned above that the impact of hydrophobic sphere with increasing velocity generates larger splash bringing not only more volume of air entrainment but also higher speed air flow through into the crown which leads to a greater differential pressure between the ambient pressure and the lower pressure inside the splash in addition the surface tension also plays an important role in the splash evolution marston et al 2016 thus with the combined effects of the differential pressure inside and outside of the crown as well as the surface tension and the kinetic energy of the splash curve the splash crown grows and collapses in different rate for varied case 3 2 effect of surface wettability on the cavity characteristics during water entry apart from the splash evolution characteristics the most obvious and special behavior of water entry affected by surface wettability is the cavity dynamics figs 6 8 and 9 shows the experimental image sequence of cavity behavior from the side view when the hydrophilic θ c 70 and hydrophobic θ c 150 spheres entry water in the impact velocity of u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s respectively for the case of spheres at u 0 4 25 m s ca 0 0593 fr 8 6 we 3130 2 the hydrophilic sphere sinks and completely immerses in water with few tiny bubbles attached to the top of the sphere as shown in fig 6 a in this regime the capillary number corresponding to the impact velocity is less than the critical value of ca 0 1 and no air cavity forms meanwhile the impact of hydrophilic sphere creates a substantial air cavity and a splash crown when the capillary number is much larger than the critical value ca 0 00372 the cavity wall is smooth until the splash crown closure occurs then a water jetting falls back into the cavity and influences cavity wall to be rough as shown in fig 6 b 6 no more air can flow into the cavity after the splash crown seal nevertheless the cavity continues to stretch and expand during the sphere following the expansion of the cavity wall is illustrated in fig 7 and it can be seen that the expansion stage and shrink stage ma et al 2014 of the air cavity wall can exist at the same time following of the descending hydrophobic sphere there are two main reasons for this phenomenon one reason is that as the depth of the sphere with cavity increasing the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water increases meanwhile the sphere also decelerates generally to give less kinetic energy to the displaced water which shortens the course of cavity expansion the other reason is that the bottom part of the cavity which is closely attached to the sphere can still keep expansion for a quite short time after the sphere passes by under the effect of these two aspects the growth of the cavity far away from the sphere starts to be suppressed stopped then shrank to form the pinch off at a depth approximately two fifths between the surface and the sphere as shown in fig 6 b 8 this impact regime is known as deep seal after which the air cavity is split upward and downward into two parts in both the upper and lower cavities a rayleigh taylor instability develops at the point of pinch off and two distinct water jetting in opposite directions penetrate the cavities respectively as shown in fig 6 b 9 furthermore ripples in the attached lower cavity are also observed after cavity pinch off these cavity ripples are likely an acoustic phenomenon and related to the resonant volume oscillations of the cavity which can produce a re entrant water jetting mentioned above to form the initial pressure perturbation as the sphere descends the ripples increase along with cavity collapse in tail region as shown in fig 6b 10 eventually the lower cavity begins to break up into bubbles which rise to the free surface and the sphere is totally wet by water meanwhile the upper cavity also collapses rapidly and almost pulled inside out by the high speed water jetting as the impact velocity increases ca 0 0753 fr 10 9 we 5053 4 the cavity forms get changed shown in fig 8 the impact of hydrophilic creates a subsurface air cavity and a weak splash as the capillary number is in the transition state which is sensitive to the effect of roughness and mentioned in section 2 the cavity starts to collapse into tiny bubbles outside in near the surface after descending about 4 sphere diameters as shown in fig 8 a 4 and generally forms a neck like air cavity to connect the surface and the lower cavity attached to the sphere as shown in fig 8 a 5 eventually the air cavity first pinches at a depth of approximate half sphere diameter as shown in fig 8 b 6 this impact regime is characterized its near surface collapse and could be referred to as transition state seal between no cavity and the surface seal impact regime for the hydrophobic case the impact is still in the deep seal regime forming a substantial air cavity following the sphere however the depth of pinch off is greater and the cavity curve approaches to close near the free surface as shown in fig 8 b 8 but it still reascends to connect to the surface under the effect of hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 8 b 10 which means the sphere is already moving beyond the deep seal regime into surface seal regime furthermore it can be observed that the volume of air entrainment in the cavity of the hydrophilic sphere is much less than that of the hydrophobic sphere and the cavity in hydrophilic case after pinch off is more stable than that in hydrophobic case as ripples and oscillations are not obvious further increases the impact velocity to u 0 6 25 m s ca 0 0872 fr 12 6 we 6769 5 the cavity dynamics are shown in fig 9 here both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres generate a cavity closure event just under the free surface as shown in fig 9 a 6 fig 9 b 7 which occurs before the deep seal and this regime is named surface seal after the surface seal the attached cavity still expands as the sphere descents without air entering in which causes cavity tending to pinch off under the effect of hydrostatic pressure meanwhile a rayleigh taylor instability develops on the position of surface seal resulting a re entrant water jet into the cavity aristoff and bush 2009 as expected the volume of air entrainment in the cavity of the hydrophilic sphere is still much less than that of the hydrophobic sphere and the time of surface seal for hydrophilic sphere is earlier besides the cavity may experience multiple pinch offs and cavity ripples before the sinking sphere is totally wet 3 3 effect of surface wettability on sphere trajectory and hydrodynamic characteristics the experimental images show great differences on the sphere trajectory under the effect of the wettability figs 10 and 11 illustrate the vertical descent trajectory velocity and acceleration versus time for hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres at the impact velocity u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s respectively the method for extracting the data from images has been mentioned above in the experimental setup section apart from the dimensionless sphere trajectory z s d 0 where z s is the position of the center of the descending sphere the moments for cavity seal are also plotted on fig 10 basing on the cartesian coordinates established in fig 1 the origin of z 0 m x 0 m is the position where sphere bottom contacts the free surface and the corresponding moment is the impact moment t 0 ms in general when t 30 ms it is difficult to distinguish between the trajectories of the hydrophilic spheres and that of the hydrophobic spheres for the cases at same impact velocity as the sphere descents the difference in the subsequent trajectory appears gradually although the steel sphere has much great density the data shows the surface wettability is the dominant effect on sphere trajectory for cases at low impact velocity u 0 4 25 m s specifically the hydrophilic sphere in non cavity forming case is totally submerged in water and the drag is larger than the hydrophobic sphere in cavity forming case thus the hydrophilic sphere descends relatively slower may 1951 duclaux et al 2007 aristoff et al 2008 truscott et al 2012b however as the impact velocity increases air cavities are formed for all the cases and the trajectory of the hydrophilic sphere is slightly lower than that of the hydrophobic one which means the hydrophilic sphere has smaller drag and descends faster in cavity forming case the descent velocity dz s dt and acceleration d2 z s dt 2 tendency of sphere in the z direction versus time are shown in fig 11 and results are made dimensionless using a constant speed u con 6 25 m s and gravity respectively in general both the velocities and accelerations decrease with time for all cases as for velocity tendency as shown in fig 11 a it can be observed that the hydrophilic sphere without air cavity loses speed more rapidly than the hydrophobic one with cavity at low impact velocities u 0 4 25 m s which indicates a higher drag when sphere is fully wet however as the impact velocity increases to u 0 5 40 and 6 25 m s cavity can form for all cases and the hydrophilic sphere keeps speed better than the hydrophobic one this is because the hydrophobic sphere receives a greater upward force buoyancy and the added mass forces than the hydrophilic sphere due to larger volume of air entrainment which results in more obvious downward deceleration as for acceleration tendency as shown in fig 11 b the effect of surface wettability is also significant the acceleration can equivalently reflect the impact loading during water entry of the sphere it has been shown in van nuffel et al 2014 and chen et al 2019 that the pulse width of the peak impact loading is much smaller than the time interval of 0 5 ms of the experimental data extraction in present study therefore it is difficult to obtain an accurate peak impact loading that using the fifth order polynomial curve to fit the original data however the interaction between the cavity evolution and hydrodynamic characteristics of the sphere under water is the focus in present study ignoring the peak impact loading firstly it can be observed that the acceleration in the hydrophilic case without cavity is much larger than that of the hydrophobic case with cavity under the same impact velocity of u 0 4 25 m s secondly the accelerations in the cavity forming cases increases dramatically with the increasing impact velocity furthermore compared to the hydrophilic results the accelerations in the hydrophobic cases at u 0 5 40 m s and 6 25 m s have larger value at the initial impacting stage but decrease more rapidly as the sphere descending eventually the acceleration in the hydrophobic case is even slightly less than that in hydrophilic case with cavity formed under the same impact velocity all the phenomena can be explained by the forces acting on the spheres under the effect of surface wettability and impact velocity by using above acceleration d2 z s dt 2 data the forces acting on the descent sphere are discussed the net force on the sphere in the z direction is 3 1 m z s t m g p n ˆ k ˆ d s n ˆ t k ˆ d s π d 0 σ cos φ where m 1 6 πd 0 3 ρ s is the sphere mass g is gravity acceleration n ˆ is the unit normal vector directed out of the sphere k ˆ is the unit vectors along positive z direction t is the viscous stress tensor and φ is the angle that the cavity makes with respect to the vertical at the triple line contact point f σ πd 0 σcos φ is the surface tension force which can be neglected as it is less than 1 of the gravitational force πd 0 σcos φ 1 6 πd 0 3 ρ s g 6σcos φ d 0 2 ρ s g 10 3 based on eq 3 1 the total hydrodynamic force f which reflects the synthetical interaction of the sphere with the surrounding fluids truscott et al 2012b is considered to be balanced by gravitational and inertia forces of the impact sphere 3 2 m g m z s t p n ˆ k ˆ d s n ˆ t k ˆ d s π d 0 σ cos φ f t this force f is also considered as the sum of added mass force f a buoyancy force f b drag force f d and surface tension force f σ mansoor et al 2017 which is helpful to analyze the influence of each force on the sphere and can be written as another form 3 3 f t f a t f b t f d t f σ to better discuss the relationship between the time varying force f t and velocity dz s dt the total hydrodynamic force coefficient is calculated as follow mansoor et al 2017 3 4 c f t f t 1 2 ρ z s t 2 π 1 4 d 0 2 8 m g z s t ρ z s t 2 π d 0 2 in fig 12 the tendency of the hydrodynamic force coefficients versus time is shown for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres under u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s in general the force coefficients increase with time for all cases but the increasing rate are different it should be noted that the force coefficient for the hydrophilic case of u 0 4 25 m s is much higher than others and increases steeply with time eventually reaching the maxima at an approximate value of c f 0 8 which indicates that the drag is quite high when sphere is fully wet in addition the c f values are all less than 0 41 for other cases which is nearly half of the fully wet sphere it can be also observed that the hydrophobic sphere receives higher force coefficients than the hydrophilic one at same impact velocity with air cavity which indicates that the hydrophilic cases have better performance of drag reduction than the hydrophobic cases when spheres impact with air cavity furthermore the results show the force coefficients for the cases at u 0 5 40 m s are higher than that for the cases at u 0 6 25 m s in conclusion the force coefficient is unsteady and complex during the sphere entering water here a qualitative analysis is carried based on the explanation for the acceleration mentioned above and eqs 3 1 3 3 the difference in force coefficients is resulted from the combined effects of the surface wettability and impact velocity for no cavity cases the viscous stress of water plays an important role in the force coefficient evolution for cavity cases higher descent velocity of the sphere results in greater drag force f d which is beneficial to model deceleration when the impact velocity is constant the hydrophobic sphere receives greater added mass force f a and total buoyancy force f b than the hydrophilic sphere due to more volume of air entrainment v c meanwhile the decreasing descent velocity leads to lower drag force f d the force coefficients are determined by the sum of the forces which depend on the descent velocity and cavity formation in different stages of sphere water entry process to better investigate the force acting on the sphere with more flow information experimental study by using piv techniques are recommended in the future work 4 conclusions and future work in this study the multiphase flow characteristics during water entry of spheres with different surface wettability for low froude numbers was investigated experimentally a synchronous trigger system based on a high speed digital camera was established to obtain the impact images for both qualitative and quantitative analysis the steel spheres used in the experiments have a same diameter of 25 mm and the density ratio of sphere to water ρ 7 86 by applying different surface treatment there are hydrophilic sphere with the static contact angle θ c 70 5 and hydrophobic sphere with θ c 150 5 respectively both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres were released from 10 different heights and typical impact velocity u 0 4 25 5 40 and 6 25 m s are chosen for discussion the main findings include 1 the surface wettability has significant effect on splash evolution in the case of low impact velocity the contact line closes up at the apex of the hydrophilic sphere shortly after it is fully submerged and no splash crown is formed as the impact velocity increases the hydrophilic case generates a weaker splash crown than the hydrophobic one both in diameter and height direction and the contact line stops at a higher relative position of the sphere meanwhile the collapse rates of splash crown for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases are increased with the increasing impact velocity but the crown collapse in hydrophilic case occurs earlier furthermore the splash evolution interacts with the subsurface cavity dynamics no more air can flow into the cavity after the splash crown seal and the splash dome experiences an inverted rising due to the upper cavity ascending to the free surface and collapsing upward rapidly after cavity pinch off 2 the most obvious and special behavior of water entry affected by surface wettability is the cavity characteristics for the hydrophilic sphere it successively experiences the no cavity shallow seal impact cavity and surface seal impact cavity regimes as the impact velocity increases meanwhile the deep seal impact cavity and surface seal impact cavity regimes are occurred successively for hydrophobic case for the hydrophobic cases the expansion stage and shrink stage of the air cavity wall can exist at the same time following the movement of the descending sphere due to the effects of the water hydrostatic pressure and kinetic energy of the sphere eventually leading to pinch off the water jetting is developed at the point of pinch off in opposite directions and boosts the cavities collapse moreover the volume of air entrainment in the hydrophilic case is much less than that in the hydrophobic case and the lower cavity attached to the hydrophilic sphere after pinch off is more stable as the ripples and oscillations are not obvious 3 trajectory descent velocity and acceleration were obtained by processing the experimental images and the total hydrodynamic force coefficient is quantitatively discussed the results show the hydrophilic case with no cavity formed has dramatically high force coefficients however as the impact velocity increases the force coefficients of the hydrophilic cases with air cavity are less than that in the hydrophobic cases the difference in force coefficients is resulted from the combined effects of the surface wettability and impact velocity for the hydrophobic sphere undergoing greater total buoyancy force and added mass force than the hydrophilic sphere due to more volume of air entrainment while the decreasing descent velocity leads to lower drag force these conclusions can be regarded as the base of a mechanism study for water entry problems of complex ocean equipment such as launching of torpedoes and air to sea projectiles water entry of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs ship slamming and the deployment of oceanographic measuring devices as water entry is a challenging and serious issue further investigation is still necessary the authors will modify the theoretical formula of critical capillary number by analyzing the surface roughness and other possible influencing factors in future work as well as use piv techniques to quantitatively analyze the cavity dynamics and each component of the total hydrodynamic force with more flow information besides extended study on other initial conditions of water entry could be conducted by considering different structural material such as polymer which are the potential engineering materials wei and hu 2014b as well as the temperature of sphere and fluid the rotation and different geometrical projectiles additional theoretical and numerical studies are also needed to complete the experimental findings and improve the understanding of water entry cavity dynamics and hydrodynamic characteristics acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge support by the national science foundation of china grant nos 91752105

22621,morison s equation is used for formulating forces and moments due to waves acting on circular cylinders of varying cross sections and truncated forms first the usual case of bottom mounted constant diameter circular piles extending from seabed to free surface is revisited and then forces and moments for the truncated form are formulated further linearly and parabolically varying diameter cases are considered for both bottom mounted and truncated cylinders the formulations are derived using linear wave theory however by adopting a heuristic nonlinear approach integrals are evaluated from pile bottom to wave crest instead of still water level corresponding linear formulations are obtained as special cases by simply setting the non dimensional nonlinearity parameters to zero thus for each cylinder configuration two different force and moment formulas are presented by integrating to actual free surface and to still water level all the results are arranged in forms which are practically easy to use finally analytical expressions for determining maximum total force and moment values are given and sample calculations are presented for all configuration types keywords morison s equation circular cylinders of varying cross section bottom mounted cylinders truncated cylinders 1 introduction morison johnson o brien and schaaf 1950 introduced a simple concept for estimating wave forces on piles the approach has two basic assumptions the total wave force is expressed as a superposition of drag and inertia forces while scattering of waves in presence of pile is completely neglected in accord with the froude krylov hypothesis the proposed equation then has become known briefly as the morison equation the final total force is usually formulated by using the horizontal component of wave orbital velocity as given by linear theory nevertheless the application is by no means limited to linear theory skjelbreia et al 1960 employed the fifth order stokes wave theory while dean 1974 gave calculations using dean s stream function theory 1965 in this work linear wave theory is used for the horizontal velocity but as a heuristic attempt to include nonlinear effects upper limits of integrals are set to the actual free surface or wave crest this point is obviously not in line with linear wave theory which is formulated for infinitesimal amplitudes and all surface variables are evaluated at the unperturbed or still water level however such empirical extension has its justification in the arguments that linear theory yields quite similar results to stokes fifth order theory even when used beyond its usual limits to predict the velocities above the still water level sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 p 299 finally sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 emphasize that while morison s equation itself is heuristic in essence it is quite satisfactory in the drag and inertia dominated regimes and it is unlikely that an entirely new equation will replace it in this work basically two new features are considered for expanding the practical application area of morison s equation one of these concerns the geometry of piles besides the usual circular cylinders of constant diameter circular cylinders of linearly and parabolically changing diameters are considered piles of varying diameters and truncated forms are becoming important especially for offshore wind turbines floating or installed in relatively shallow depths hummel and jenkens 2015 brito et al 2015 ross and siew 2015 also considered are cylinders not extending to the seabed which are relevant for floating type platforms another new feature of the present work concerns the wave kinematics applicable range of linear wave theory is stretched beyond the still water level by taking the upper limit of integrals to the wave crest results corresponding to the standard application of taking the upper limit of integration as the still water level are readily obtained by setting the nonlinearity parameters to zero all the expressions derived are expressed in terms of non dimensional parameters which once computed may be easily used for obtaining the desired results in closing a simple approach of computing wave heights for a given water depth over a range of wave periods is described and sample computations involving all configurations are presented for inter comparisons as well as providing numerical reference values 2 morison s equation the equation known briefly as morison s equation was proposed by morison et al 1950 as a practical means of calculating wave forces on vertical circular piles the equation is composed of two parts which deal respectively with drag and inertia forces and given as morison et al 1950 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 chakrabarti 2001 1 d f 1 2 ρ c d u u d a p ρ c m d u d t d where d f is the total infinitesimal force acting on the infinitesimal height d z of the pile ρ the fluid density u the horizontal flow velocity d a p d d z the infinitesimal projected frontal area d π 4 d 2 d z the infinitesimal displaced volume of the circular structure c d and c m are the dimensionless constant coefficients of drag and inertia mass respectively the main issue with morison s equation is the determination of the constants c d and c m since comparisons with experimental data and field measurements show considerable scatter depending in principle on keulegan carpenter number k u t d where t is the flow period and d the diameter an in depth study of the subject can be found in gudmestad and moe 1996 the standard way of formulating the total force due to waves proceeds as follows u is taken from linear theory d u d t the total acceleration is replaced by local acceleration u t as a part of linearization finally the equation is integrated from the pile bottom say z h to the still water level z 0 here the same procedure is followed except that whenever proclaimed the pile diameter is treated as a function of the vertical coordinate z also the upper limit of the integration is set to the wave amplitude z a h 2 and the linearization is carried out after the general result is obtained neglect of wave diffraction or wave scattering in the vicinity of pile necessarily requires relative smallness of pile in comparison to waves a rule of thumb states that the ratio of pile diameter to incident wavelength should be less than 1 20 spm 1984 p 7 103 for a justified use of morison s equation see for instance kurian et al 2013 for comparisons between morison s equation and diffraction theory 3 bottom mounted and truncated circular cylinders of constant diameter in line with the standard application of morison s equation 1 the horizontal velocity is taken from linear theory as 2 u x t g k h 2 ω ch k z h ch k h cos k x ω t where g is the gravitational acceleration k 2 π l the wave number l the wavelength h the water depth h the wave height ω the cyclic wave frequency linear theory dispersion relationship ω 2 g k tanh k h is used to determine the wave number for a given cyclic frequency for shorter notation the hyperbolic cosine function cosh k h and the hyperbolic sine function sinh k h are denoted by ch k h and sh k h respectively the total horizontal acceleration is d u d t u t u u x w u z however following the usual linearization process d u d t u t hence 3 d u d t g k h 2 ch k z h ch k h sin k x ω t isaacson 1979 concluded that the above approximation would overestimate the acceleration but be acceptable for practical applications using the expressions given for velocity u and acceleration d u d t and writing in general d a p d z d z for the frontal area element and d π 4 d 2 z d z for the volume element in 1 and integrating over the pile height gives for the in line x 0 force for a bottom

the still water level z 0 the above expression of total force is obviously a straightforward adaption of morison s equation to the case of vertically varying pile diameter d z since the change in diameter is gradual it is expected that the original formulation equation 1 would still hold good in producing realistic results obviously the true validation can only be done by measurement which is beyond the scope of the present theoretical work the total moment about the bottom z h is calculated from 5 m 1 2 ρ g c d d 0 h 2 2 k h 8 sh 2 k h cos ω t cos ω t h a 1 z h d z d 0 1 ch 2 k z h d z ρ

cylinders of constant diameter fig 1 shows on the right a truncated circular cylinder with constant diameter d 0 and penetration depth d the integrals are now evaluated from d to a and the moment arm

truncated circular cylinders of linearly varying diameter piles with linearly varying diameters as shown in fig 2 are considered now in the formulations the pile diameter at the bottom needs not be greater than the pile diameter at the still water level but for applications this is normally the case therefore the figures are drawn accordingly 4 1 bottom mounted circular cylinders of linearly varying diameter the linear variation of the pile diameter for bottom mounted cylinders is formulated as d z d 0 1 r h z h where r h d h d 0 1 with d 0 denoting the diameter at the still water level and d h the diameter at the seabed as shown in fig 2 on the left setting d z as described now in the general force and moment formulations and performing the integrals from z h to the wave crest z a h

2 r h 1 3 r h μ h 2 μ h ch μ h 1 r h 2 6 r h 2 μ h 2 μ h since the cylinders are bottom mounted the dimensional moment values are calculated as m d h f d 0 m d etc by using h note that when the diameter at the bottom d h is equal to the diameter at the still water level d 0 that is when the cylinder diameter is constant r h d h d 0 1 0 vanishes the above formulations reduce to the constant diameter case given in 3 1 a fine detail concerning only nonlinear formulations must be pointed out since the linear variation of diameter continues above the still water level the diameter becomes somewhat smaller hence integrals for nonlinear cases give slightly lower force and moment values a similar situation applies to the parabolically varying cases but there the pile diameter reaches the lowest value at the still water level and then above this level begins gradually increasing hence in this case produces somewhat higher force and moment values although a separate integration would be possible for above the still water level such an approach would have complicated the already complex equations exceedingly therefore considering that the error introduced to nonlinear computations are relatively smaller this problem is ignored of course such concerns do not apply to the linear formulations at all 4 2 truncated circular cylinders of linearly varying diameter the linear variation of the pile diameter for truncated cylinders is formulated as d z d 0 1 r d z d where r d d d d 0 1 with d 0 denoting the diameter at the still water level and d d the diameter at the bottom of the truncated cylinder as shown in fig 2 on the right setting d z as described now in the general force and moment formulations and performing integrals from z d to the wave crest z a h 2 give for the non

cylinder diameter is constant r d d d d 0 1 0 vanishes the above formulations reduce to the constant diameter case given in 3 2 further if ξ d h 1 then ε d ε h and μ d μ h the above expressions become identical with those given for bottom mounted cylinders in 3 1 indeed equations 31 34 comprise all the formulas derived till now 7 30 and 35 38 as special cases therefore they can be used to compute

is essential for computing the wave forces and moments acting on a pile a very simple but realistic approach based on a given water depth of a region and a range of periods is suggested first a general nonlinearity parameter ϵ valid for arbitrary relative depths is recalled beji 1995 58 ϵ g h c p 2 where g is the gravitational acceleration h the wave height and c p the linear theory phase celerity c p g k tanh k h 1 2 this nonlinearity parameter embodies both the shallow water parameter ϵ s h h when c p 2 g h and deep water parameter ϵ d k h when c p 2 g k as special cases therefore it has the advantage of applicability over the entire relative water depths moreover setting ϵ to the constant value 0 88 results in miche s wave breaking criterion miche 1951 for a given water depth it is possible to proceed by selecting a wide range of possible incident wave periods and setting ϵ to a meaningful constant value to calculate corresponding wave heights according to the general nonlinearity parameter given in 58 use of the breaking criterion constant 0 88 would result in extremely large wave heights therefore a simple design criterion for the north sea set by dnv det norske veritas back in 1974 is referred to accordingly for deep water waves a 100 ft 30 5 m wave height with a period of 15 s was adopted as a 100 year wave or 100 year return interval wave sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 p 293 the steepness of this particular wave can be computed from ϵ d k h with deep water wave number k ω 2 g 0 01788 rad m corresponding to t 15 s period hence ϵ d 0 55 thus here wave heights are determined from the general nonlinearity parameter as h ϵ c p 2 g by setting ϵ 0 55 and computing c p according to a given water depth and period fig 4 depicts the period versus wave height curves for different water depths ranging from h 10 m to h deep water wave height curves for finite water depths show initially a steep increase with increasing period but then assume a horizontal character for larger periods as it asymptotically approaches to the shallow water wave height limit according to ϵ s h h 0 55 so that h 0 55 h on the other hand deep water case exhibits a completely different character and wave heights increase unboundedly with increasing period this is in accord with unbounded increase of wavelength with increasing period more specifically for deep water waves ϵ d k h and l 0 g t 2 2 π therefore h ϵ d g t 2 4 π 2 hence the wave height is proportional to the square of wave period for ϵ 0 55 and t 15 s the wave height is h 0 136 t 2 30 5 m as initially selected it must be emphasized that for nonlinear waves as for the sample case of ϵ 0 55 the linear acceleration field given by equation 3 does not apply strictly its use for highly nonlinear waves should be viewed as a part of heuristic approach employed here for nonlinear computations 8 sample calculations of wave forces and moments sample calculations of wave forces and moments are now presented for the wave height versus period range corresponding to the water depth h 10 m in fig 4 the pile diameter for constant cross section case is taken as d 0 d h 3 5 m for the cases of linearly and parabolically varying piles the diameters at the surface and bottom are determined such that the submerged volumes are equal to the constant diameter case in order to determine diameters a definite ratio of the bottom to surface diameter must be selected this ratio is set to d h d 0 d d d 0 1 5 for both bottom mounted and truncated cylinders of linearly and parabolically varying diameters for all the calculations c d 0 7 and c m 1 6 are used as typical representative values gudmestad and moe 1996 spm 1984 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 the drag and inertia coefficients are by no means fixed hence the selected values should only be viewed as acceptable choices finally maximum force and moment values are determined according to equations 56 and 57 8 1 bottom mounted cylinders setting r h d h d 0 1 0 5 for bottom mounted piles and equating the submerged volumes give for the surface and bottom diameters rounded off d 0 2 8 m d h 4 2 m and d 0 3 0 m d h 4 5 m respectively for linearly and parabolically varying piles the submerged volume for all the cases is approximately 96 2 m 3 fig 5 shows maximum force curves within t 1 15 s period range according to linear and nonlinear computations for the constant parabolically varying and linearly varying diameter cases the upper three curves are nonlinear and lower three curves are linear computations for the nonlinear computations the maximum force values corresponding to the linearly varying pile diameter case are the lowest among all but this must be observed with care giving allowance for further reduction in pile diameter above the still water level as pointed out at the end of 4 1 in some detail nevertheless for nonlinear computations it may be safely stated that constant diameter case is subjected to highest wave loads compared to any other within the entire wave period range linear calculations on the other hand indicate clearly that linearly and parabolically varying diameter cases are virtually the same and only slightly lower than the constant diameter case overall the nonlinear force values are approximately 30 40 greater than their linear counterparts over the range of periods but this ratio is quite realistic when compared with 80 greater value reported for cnoidal theory sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 p 456 however once more it must be emphasized that the nonlinear computations are hybrid in the sense that linear theory formulation for the horizontal velocity is used while the vertical integration for each force component is carried out to the wave amplitude value above the still water level hence the results should be viewed with caution fig 6 shows the corresponding moment values about the bottom of the pile or the mud line for bottom mounted piles the general trend of the curves is quite similar to the force curves but the differences with the constant diameter case are accentuated it is recalled that the piles are all bottom mounted at d h 10 m water depth and that the underwater submerged volume of each pile is the same as the constant diameter case 8 2 truncated cylinders the force and moment computations presented for bottom mounted cylinders are now repeated for truncated cylinders with d h 2 5 m and r d d d d 0 1 0 5 again the submerged volume for all the cases is approximately 48 1 m 3 half the bottom mounted case so that the surface and bottom diameters are again d 0 2 8 m d h 4 2 m and d 0 3 0 m d h 4 5 m respectively for linearly and parabolically varying piles fig 7 may be viewed as the counterpart of fig 5 for truncated cylinders the overall characteristics of the curves in figs 5 and 7 are quite similar the only difference being in the scale or the range of forces forces acting on truncated cylinders are approximately 40 lower than those of bottom mounted cylinders since orbital motions diminish exponentially with depth this reduction in force is less than the truncation depth of 50 bottom moment variations of truncated cylinders given in fig 8 is likewise the counterpart of fig 6 and the two figures differ basically in scale 9 concluding remarks wave forces and moments acting on circular cylinders of varying cross sections and truncated forms are formulated by employing the morison equation and related assumptions all the formulations are obtained by using linear wave theory however besides the usual linear results heuristic nonlinear formulations are presented by carrying out the vertical integration to the actual free surface these nonlinear formulations may be viewed as providing an upper limit for the force an moment values analytical expressions are also given for determining the maximum force and moment values sample calculations of forces and moments are presented for all the geometrical configurations linearly and parabolically varying diameter cases give relatively lower force and moment values compared to constant diameter case force and moment differences between different cases are accentuated for nonlinear computations this is quite expected because orbital motions diminish with increasing depth and when the diameter is comparatively smaller near the surface the loads are smaller as well although subject to the general design considerations the ratio of the bottom to surface diameter may be taken 1 5 as a reasonable value as used

22621,morison s equation is used for formulating forces and moments due to waves acting on circular cylinders of varying cross sections and truncated forms first the usual case of bottom mounted constant diameter circular piles extending from seabed to free surface is revisited and then forces and moments for the truncated form are formulated further linearly and parabolically varying diameter cases are considered for both bottom mounted and truncated cylinders the formulations are derived using linear wave theory however by adopting a heuristic nonlinear approach integrals are evaluated from pile bottom to wave crest instead of still water level corresponding linear formulations are obtained as special cases by simply setting the non dimensional nonlinearity parameters to zero thus for each cylinder configuration two different force and moment formulas are presented by integrating to actual free surface and to still water level all the results are arranged in forms which are practically easy to use finally analytical expressions for determining maximum total force and moment values are given and sample calculations are presented for all configuration types keywords morison s equation circular cylinders of varying cross section bottom mounted cylinders truncated cylinders 1 introduction morison johnson o brien and schaaf 1950 introduced a simple concept for estimating wave forces on piles the approach has two basic assumptions the total wave force is expressed as a superposition of drag and inertia forces while scattering of waves in presence of pile is completely neglected in accord with the froude krylov hypothesis the proposed equation then has become known briefly as the morison equation the final total force is usually formulated by using the horizontal component of wave orbital velocity as given by linear theory nevertheless the application is by no means limited to linear theory skjelbreia et al 1960 employed the fifth order stokes wave theory while dean 1974 gave calculations using dean s stream function theory 1965 in this work linear wave theory is used for the horizontal velocity but as a heuristic attempt to include nonlinear effects upper limits of integrals are set to the actual free surface or wave crest this point is obviously not in line with linear wave theory which is formulated for infinitesimal amplitudes and all surface variables are evaluated at the unperturbed or still water level however such empirical extension has its justification in the arguments that linear theory yields quite similar results to stokes fifth order theory even when used beyond its usual limits to predict the velocities above the still water level sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 p 299 finally sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 emphasize that while morison s equation itself is heuristic in essence it is quite satisfactory in the drag and inertia dominated regimes and it is unlikely that an entirely new equation will replace it in this work basically two new features are considered for expanding the practical application area of morison s equation one of these concerns the geometry of piles besides the usual circular cylinders of constant diameter circular cylinders of linearly and parabolically changing diameters are considered piles of varying diameters and truncated forms are becoming important especially for offshore wind turbines floating or installed in relatively shallow depths hummel and jenkens 2015 brito et al 2015 ross and siew 2015 also considered are cylinders not extending to the seabed which are relevant for floating type platforms another new feature of the present work concerns the wave kinematics applicable range of linear wave theory is stretched beyond the still water level by taking the upper limit of integrals to the wave crest results corresponding to the standard application of taking the upper limit of integration as the still water level are readily obtained by setting the nonlinearity parameters to zero all the expressions derived are expressed in terms of non dimensional parameters which once computed may be easily used for obtaining the desired results in closing a simple approach of computing wave heights for a given water depth over a range of wave periods is described and sample computations involving all configurations are presented for inter comparisons as well as providing numerical reference values 2 morison s equation the equation known briefly as morison s equation was proposed by morison et al 1950 as a practical means of calculating wave forces on vertical circular piles the equation is composed of two parts which deal respectively with drag and inertia forces and given as morison et al 1950 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 chakrabarti 2001 1 d f 1 2 ρ c d u u d a p ρ c m d u d t d where d f is the total infinitesimal force acting on the infinitesimal height d z of the pile ρ the fluid density u the horizontal flow velocity d a p d d z the infinitesimal projected frontal area d π 4 d 2 d z the infinitesimal displaced volume of the circular structure c d and c m are the dimensionless constant coefficients of drag and inertia mass respectively the main issue with morison s equation is the determination of the constants c d and c m since comparisons with experimental data and field measurements show considerable scatter depending in principle on keulegan carpenter number k u t d where t is the flow period and d the diameter an in depth study of the subject can be found in gudmestad and moe 1996 the standard way of formulating the total force due to waves proceeds as follows u is taken from linear theory d u d t the total acceleration is replaced by local acceleration u t as a part of linearization finally the equation is integrated from the pile bottom say z h to the still water level z 0 here the same procedure is followed except that whenever proclaimed the pile diameter is treated as a function of the vertical coordinate z also the upper limit of the integration is set to the wave amplitude z a h 2 and the linearization is carried out after the general result is obtained neglect of wave diffraction or wave scattering in the vicinity of pile necessarily requires relative smallness of pile in comparison to waves a rule of thumb states that the ratio of pile diameter to incident wavelength should be less than 1 20 spm 1984 p 7 103 for a justified use of morison s equation see for instance kurian et al 2013 for comparisons between morison s equation and diffraction theory 3 bottom mounted and truncated circular cylinders of constant diameter in line with the standard application of morison s equation 1 the horizontal velocity is taken from linear theory as 2 u x t g k h 2 ω ch k z h ch k h cos k x ω t where g is the gravitational acceleration k 2 π l the wave number l the wavelength h the water depth h the wave height ω the cyclic wave frequency linear theory dispersion relationship ω 2 g k tanh k h is used to determine the wave number for a given cyclic frequency for shorter notation the hyperbolic cosine function cosh k h and the hyperbolic sine function sinh k h are denoted by ch k h and sh k h respectively the total horizontal acceleration is d u d t u t u u x w u z however following the usual linearization process d u d t u t hence 3 d u d t g k h 2 ch k z h ch k h sin k x ω t isaacson 1979 concluded that the above approximation would overestimate the acceleration but be acceptable for practical applications using the expressions given for velocity u and acceleration d u d t and writing in general d a p d z d z for the frontal area element and d π 4 d 2 z d z for the volume element in 1 and integrating over the pile height gives for the in line x 0 force for a bottom

the still water level z 0 the above expression of total force is obviously a straightforward adaption of morison s equation to the case of vertically varying pile diameter d z since the change in diameter is gradual it is expected that the original formulation equation 1 would still hold good in producing realistic results obviously the true validation can only be done by measurement which is

truncated circular cylinders of linearly varying diameter piles with linearly varying diameters as shown in fig 2 are considered now in the formulations the pile diameter at the bottom needs not be greater than the pile diameter at the still water level but for applications this is normally the case therefore the figures are drawn accordingly 4 1 bottom mounted circular cylinders of linearly varying diameter the linear variation of the pile diameter for bottom mounted cylinders is formulated as d z d 0 1 r h z h where r h d h d 0 1 with d 0 denoting the diameter at the still water level and d h the diameter at the seabed as shown in fig 2 on the left setting d z as described now in the general force and moment formulations and performing the integrals from z h to the wave crest z a h

2 r h 1 3 r h μ h 2 μ h ch μ h 1 r h 2 6 r h 2 μ h 2 μ h since the cylinders are bottom mounted the dimensional moment values are calculated as m d h f d 0 m d etc by using h note that when the diameter at the bottom d h is equal to the diameter at the still water level d 0 that is when the cylinder diameter is constant r h d h d 0 1 0 vanishes the above formulations reduce to the constant diameter case given in 3 1 a fine detail concerning only nonlinear formulations must be pointed out since the linear variation of diameter continues above the still water level the diameter becomes somewhat smaller hence integrals for nonlinear cases give slightly lower force and moment values a similar situation applies to the parabolically varying cases but there the pile diameter reaches the lowest value at the still water level and then above this level begins gradually increasing hence in this case produces somewhat higher force and moment values although a separate integration would be possible for above the still water level such an approach would have complicated the already complex equations exceedingly therefore considering that the error introduced to nonlinear computations are relatively smaller this problem is ignored of course such concerns do not apply to the linear formulations at all 4 2 truncated circular cylinders of linearly varying diameter the linear variation of the pile diameter for truncated cylinders is formulated as d z d 0 1 r d z d where r d d d d 0 1 with d 0 denoting the diameter at the still water level and d d the diameter at the bottom of the truncated cylinder as shown in fig 2 on the right setting d z as described now in the general force and moment formulations and performing integrals from z d to the wave crest z a h 2 give for the non

the wave forces and moments for any previous case desired by setting the parameters appropriately 5 bottom mounted and truncated circular cylinders of parabolically varying diameter piles with parabolically varying diameters as shown in fig 3 are considered now once again in the formulations the pile diameter at the bottom need not be greater than the pile diameter at the still water level but for applications this is normally the case therefore the figures are drawn accordingly 5 1 bottom mounted circular cylinders of parabolically varying diameter the parabolic variation of the pile diameter for bottom mounted cylinders is formulated as d z d 0 1 r h z h 2 where r h d h d 0 1 with d 0 denoting the diameter at the still water level and d h the diameter at the seabed as shown in

is essential for computing the wave forces and moments acting on a pile a very simple but realistic approach based on a given water depth of a region and a range of periods is suggested first a general nonlinearity parameter ϵ valid for arbitrary relative depths is recalled beji 1995 58 ϵ g h c p 2 where g is the gravitational acceleration h the wave height and c p the linear theory phase celerity c p g k tanh k h 1 2 this nonlinearity parameter embodies both the shallow water parameter ϵ s h h when c p 2 g h and deep water parameter ϵ d k h when c p 2 g k as special cases therefore it has the advantage of applicability over the entire relative water depths moreover setting ϵ to the constant value 0 88 results in miche s wave breaking criterion miche 1951 for a given water depth it is possible to proceed by selecting a wide range of possible incident wave periods and setting ϵ to a meaningful constant value to calculate corresponding wave heights according to the general nonlinearity parameter given in 58 use of the breaking criterion constant 0 88 would result in extremely large wave heights therefore a simple design criterion for the north sea set by dnv det norske veritas back in 1974 is referred to accordingly for deep water waves a 100 ft 30 5 m wave height with a period of 15 s was adopted as a 100 year wave or 100 year return interval wave sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 p 293 the steepness of this particular wave can be computed from ϵ d k h with deep water wave number k ω 2 g 0 01788 rad m corresponding to t 15 s period hence ϵ d 0 55 thus here wave heights are determined from the general nonlinearity parameter as h ϵ c p 2 g by setting ϵ 0 55 and computing c p according to a given water depth and period fig 4 depicts the period versus wave height curves for different water depths ranging from h 10 m to h deep water wave height curves for finite water depths show initially a steep increase with increasing period but then assume a horizontal character for larger periods as it asymptotically approaches to the shallow water wave height limit according to ϵ s h h 0 55 so that h 0 55 h on the other hand deep water case exhibits a completely different character and wave heights increase unboundedly with increasing period this is in accord with unbounded increase of wavelength with increasing period more specifically for deep water waves ϵ d k h and l 0 g t 2 2 π therefore h ϵ d g t 2 4 π 2 hence the wave height is proportional to the square of wave period for ϵ 0 55 and t 15 s the wave height is h 0 136 t 2 30 5 m as initially selected it must be emphasized that for nonlinear waves as for the sample case of ϵ 0 55 the linear acceleration field given by equation 3 does not apply strictly its use for highly nonlinear waves should be viewed as a part of heuristic approach employed here for nonlinear computations 8 sample calculations of wave forces and moments sample calculations of wave forces and moments are now presented for the wave height versus period range corresponding to the water depth h 10 m in fig 4 the pile diameter for constant cross section case is taken as d 0 d h 3 5 m for the cases of linearly and parabolically varying piles the diameters at the surface and bottom are determined such that the submerged volumes are equal to the constant diameter case in order to determine diameters a definite ratio of the bottom to surface diameter must be selected this ratio is set to d h d 0 d d d 0 1 5 for both bottom mounted and truncated cylinders of linearly and parabolically varying diameters for all the calculations c d 0 7 and c m 1 6 are used as typical representative values gudmestad and moe 1996 spm 1984 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 the drag and inertia coefficients are by no means fixed hence the selected values should only be viewed as acceptable choices finally maximum force and moment values are determined according to equations 56 and 57 8 1 bottom mounted cylinders setting r h d h d 0 1 0 5 for bottom mounted piles and equating the submerged volumes give for the surface and bottom diameters rounded off d 0 2 8 m d h 4 2 m and d 0 3 0 m d h 4 5 m respectively for linearly and parabolically varying piles the submerged volume for all the cases is approximately 96 2 m 3 fig 5 shows maximum force curves within t 1 15 s period range according to linear and nonlinear computations for the constant parabolically varying and linearly varying diameter cases the upper three curves are nonlinear and lower three curves are linear computations for the nonlinear computations the maximum force values corresponding to the linearly varying pile diameter case are the lowest among all but this must be observed with care giving allowance for further reduction in pile diameter above the still water level as pointed out at the end of 4 1 in some detail nevertheless for nonlinear computations it may be safely stated that constant diameter case is subjected to highest wave loads compared to any other within the entire wave period range linear calculations on the other hand indicate clearly that linearly and parabolically varying diameter cases are virtually the same and only slightly lower than the constant diameter case overall the nonlinear force values are approximately 30 40 greater than their linear counterparts over the range of periods but this ratio is quite realistic when compared with 80 greater value reported for cnoidal theory sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 p 456 however once more it must be emphasized that the nonlinear computations are hybrid in the sense that linear theory formulation for the horizontal velocity is used while the vertical integration for each force component is carried out to the wave amplitude value above the still water level hence the results should be viewed with caution fig 6 shows the corresponding moment values about the bottom of the pile or the mud line for bottom mounted piles the general trend of the curves is quite similar to the force curves but the differences with the constant diameter case are accentuated it is recalled that the piles are all bottom mounted at d h 10 m water depth and that the underwater submerged volume of each pile is the same as the constant diameter case 8 2 truncated cylinders the force and moment computations presented for bottom mounted cylinders are now repeated for truncated cylinders with d h 2 5 m and r d d d d 0 1 0 5 again the submerged volume for all the cases is approximately 48 1 m 3 half the bottom mounted case so that the surface and bottom diameters are again d 0 2 8 m d h 4 2 m and d 0 3 0 m d h 4 5 m respectively for linearly and parabolically varying piles fig 7 may be viewed as the counterpart of fig 5 for truncated cylinders the overall characteristics of the curves in figs 5 and 7 are quite similar the only difference being in the scale or the range of forces forces acting on truncated cylinders are approximately 40 lower than those of bottom mounted cylinders since orbital motions diminish exponentially with depth this reduction in force is less than the truncation depth of 50 bottom moment variations of truncated cylinders given in fig 8 is likewise the counterpart of fig 6 and the two figures differ basically in scale 9 concluding remarks wave forces and moments acting on circular cylinders of varying cross sections and truncated forms are formulated by employing the morison equation and related assumptions all the formulations are obtained by using linear wave theory however besides the usual linear results heuristic nonlinear formulations are presented by carrying out the vertical integration to the actual free surface these nonlinear formulations may be viewed as providing an upper limit for the force an moment values analytical expressions are also given for determining the maximum force and moment values sample calculations of forces and moments are presented for all the geometrical configurations linearly and parabolically varying diameter cases give relatively lower force and moment values compared to constant diameter case force and moment differences between different cases are accentuated for nonlinear computations this is quite expected because orbital motions diminish with increasing depth and when the diameter is comparatively smaller near the surface the loads are smaller as well although subject to the general design considerations the ratio of the bottom to surface diameter may be taken 1 5 as a reasonable value as used

22622,an analytical model is presented to evaluate the buckling pressure of pipes subjected to external internal pressures at firstly a set of stability equations was solved mathematically and the elastic buckling solution was established by introducing the inner plastic section and the middle non linear elastic section the analytical approach was then extended to the critical pressure evaluation of the thick pipes in non elastic buckling and the effect of the initial ovality on the critical pressure is considered details of the analytical formulations and the required parameters are defined the results are presented to show that the initial ovality has a significant influence on the bifurcation pressure and however its effect becomes trivial as the pipes become thicker compared to the plastic hinge approach the proposed solution represents a lower critical pressure which indicates that the pipes would collapse before the formation of the plastic hinges furthermore some factors that affect the pressure capacity of the pipes are discussed the results from the proposed analytical solution are compared with those of other solutions and experiments keywords single wall pipe elastic buckling layers elastic plastic collapse eigenvalue 1 introduction pipelines play an important role in gathering and transporting oil and natural gas from subsea wells to offshore or coastal storage facilities collapse of the pipes would lead to the critical damage of the pipelines and the issue has been widely reported in literature during the past decades the classical solution for the elastic buckling of the circular rings under external pressure was given by timoshenko and gere 1961 and the solution was extended to infinitely long cylindrical shells by accepting the plane strain assumption the solution was also extended to the critical pressure estimation of the pipes in initial yielding as well as the elastic plastic collapse of the non uniform cylindrical shells with corrosion under external pressure hoo fatt 1999 motivated by the applications of the pipelines in offshore structures a large amount of experimental tests have been conducted using hyperbaric chamber to investigate the buckling pressure of the pipes with different diameter to thickness ratios and different initial geometric imperfections khalilpasha and albermani 2013 gong et al 2012 karampour and

pressure prediction of the thick walled pipelines based on the finite element analyses the main results of the experimental observations and the effects of the imperfections were summarized in kyriakides and corona 2007 when the pipes become thicker the classical solution for thin shells will overestimate the critical pressures due to the effect of the transverse shear which results in the non linearly distributions of the hoop and radial stresses through the thickness of the pipes in the past few decades there are considerable analytical models developed to describe the collapse behavior of the thick pipes and shells these approaches to capture the main buckling features of the thick pipes and shells under pressures include 1 shell theories that account the effect of the shear deformation simitses 1996 fu and waas 1995 simitses and anastasiadis 1992 shen 2001 anastasiadis and simitses 1993 simitses et al 1993 in this approach the displacement through the thickness of

past few decades the elastic buckling of the pipes was widely investigated analytically however the main failure mode for thick pipes in industry applications is in elastic plastic buckling there is no analytical formula with sufficient accuracy for the critical pressure prediction of the pipes in elastic plastic collapse in this paper an analytical approach for the pressure capacity calculation of the pipes was developed by solving directly the novozhilov 1953 differential stability equations for 2d plane strain deformation and adopting the boundary conditions suggested by ji and waas 2014 the elastic buckling solution was established in closed form the solution was then extended to the elastic plastic collapse of the thick pipes by introducing the inner plastic layer and the middle non linear elastic layer to capture the non elastic buckling behavior the present analysis was compared with other 2d solutions and some factors that affect the buckling pressure of the pipes were discussed finally the analytical results were compared with the corresponding experimental results 2 analytical formulation 2 1 the elastic buckling of the pipes under external and internal pressures

the buckling to the post buckling behavior the non linear terms should be taken into account and the governing equations for the buckling configuration can be obtained by setting the second variation of the total potential energy to be zero hashemian and mohareb 2014 at the onset of the buckling however the non linear terms are small compared to the linear ones substituting 2 1 into 2 2 and

external pressure in the case only if the stress at inner surface of the pipe does not exceed the proportional limit of the material 2 2 the non elastic buckling when the pipe is thick one the buckling pressure will be smaller than the value estimated by 2 40 since the interaction between the plasticity and the stability in the pre buckling state the maximum stress appears at the inner radius of the pipe and the yielding of the material may occur it is thus the elastic plastic mixed buckling since eq 2 40 is available only up to the proportional limit of the material consider a

parameter a 1 or a 2 should be taken as a 1 a or a 2 a the parameter a 2 is evaluated from the stresses of the outer elastic layer for simplicity which will result in a slight overestimation of the

several elastic solutions as shown in fig 4 where the elastic modulus and the poison ratio of the pipe are e 57 gpa μ 0 3 respectively eq 2 40 is used to evaluate the smallest eigenvalue n 2 of the critical pressure in this case these solutions for comparison are from the thin shell theory timoshenko and gere 1961 kardomateas 2000 papadakis 2008 and ji and waas 2014 the abaqus results from ji and waas 2014 are also plotted in the classical thin shell theory the radial displacement is considered as the uniform through the thickness and the hoop displacement varies linearly the effect of transverse shear is neglected as the thickness of the pipe increases the thin shell theory overestimates the critical pressures significantly kardomateas 2000 proposed an improved elastic solution that included the effect of the normal strains and stresses the evaluated critical pressures were further reduced compared to his earlier work kardomateas 1993 and the solution represents the lowest critical pressures in fig 4 papadakis 2008 developed a 2d solution in which two cases with the shear strains rotations and with the rotations only were considered the first solution with effect of the shear strains rotations was found to agree with that from kardomateas 2000 while the second solution with effect of rotations only was in agreement with that by kardomateas 1993 the results from the second solution by papadakis 2008 are plotted in fig 4 the results by present approach for elastic buckling are between those from kardomateas 2000 and papadakis 2008 ji and waas 2014 formulated the 2d elasticity solution for thick rings treated as the plane strain continuum they suggested that the work conjugate relation in fe formulation of the commercial software such as abaqus is violated and results in the over prediction of the critical pressures when the body is in compression the work conjugate violation can be eliminated by adopting the jaumann rate of cauchy stress from bažant 1971 in fe formulation which induces the deviation of the predicted critical pressures from that of the abaqus as the thickness of the pipe increases as shown in fig 4 the results from ji and waas 2014 are always higher than those of the present approach 3 2 the non elastic buckling behavior for the thick pipes the yielding mechanism will affect significantly the buckling behavior in this section the effect of yielding of the material in pipe buckling is considered and the smallest critical pressures n 2 are evaluated from eq 2 54 the reference case of q 0 e 210 gpa μ 0 3 σ 0 235 mpa and σ p 180 mpa is considered fig 5 shows the critical pressures as a function of the ratio r r for reference case where the initial ovalities are δ 0 0 δ 0 0 1 and δ 0 0 5 respectively it is evident that the bifurcation pressure is sensitive to the initial ovality and however the effect of the initial ovality becomes trivial as the ratio r r increases the yielding mechanism in buckling of the thick pipes leads that the critical pressures are much lower than that estimated from the full elastic buckling solution represented by eq 2 40 for the initial yielding buckling of the pipes timoshenko and gere 1961 suggested that the pipe yields when the sum of the hoop and bending stresses is up to the yield stress σ 0 and the collapse pressure was given by 3 1a p 1 2 p o p e ψ p o p e ψ 2 4 p o p e 1 2 in which 3 1b p e e 4 1 μ 2 t r 0 3 3 1c p o σ 0 t r 0 3 1d ψ 1 6 δ 0 r 0 t where r 0 represents the mean radius of the pipe t is the wall thickness the up limit of the ratio r 0 t to stop using 3 1a is 3 1e r 0 t t h e 4 1 μ 2 σ 0 1 2 the comparison of the two models is plotted in fig 6 for δ 0 0 5 the up limit of the ratio r r estimated by 3 1e for reference case is r r 1 066 it is seen that the results from the present approach are always higher than that by timoshenko and gere 1961 in the range up to the limit ratio the pressure bifurcation can be observed from the results of the present approach which indicates that the stress at the inner surface of the pipe reaches the proportional limit of the material differ from eq 3 1a in present approach the initial ovality has a significant influence on the bifurcation pressure and however no affection for the full linear elastic buckling as shown in fig 5 the other factor that affects the buckling behavior of the pipes is the formation of the plastic hinge for the pipe with initial ovality the external pressure will result in the bending moment and the hoop stress the initial yielding and then the full plastic sections through the thickness plastic hinges may occur at ϕ 0 90 180 and 270 the limit critical pressure of the plastic hinge approach can be expressed as the smaller one of the elastic buckling and full plastic collapse values the elastic buckling pressure and the pressure of plastic collapse are estimated by 3 2a p e e 4 1 μ 2 t r 0 3 3 2b p 0 t r 0 σ 0 the pressure bifurcation is then determined by taking p e p 0 in this approach the plastic sections are local thickness through zones instead of an inner concentric tubular plastic section used in present approach the critical pressures estimated from two models for reference case are compared to each other in fig 7 in which only the results corresponding to δ 0 0 and s 1 are plotted for explicit it is seen that the critical pressures predicted by the plastic hinge approach are always higher than that from the present approach it indicates that the thick pipes may collapse before the formation of the plastic hinges through the thickness when the effect of the initial ovality is considered the critical pressures evaluated from the present approach will be further reduced as shown in fig 5 however the pressure reduction due to the initial ovality is not considered in plastic hinge approach finally the evaluation of the elastic plastic collapse of the pipes with initial ovality in present approach is based on the circular cross section and the initial ovality is treated as the first mode perturbing deformation it is available only in the case of the initial ovality δ 0 1 the limited value of the δ 0 is suggested as δ 0 0 6 3 3 comparison with experiments the collapse of the circular single wall pipes has been widely investigated in the past years a large amount of experimental tests have been conducted using hyperbaric chamber to investigate the buckling pressures with different diameter to thickness ratios and different initial geometric imperfections a series of experiments kyriakides and corona 2007 yeh and kyriakids 1986 of the pipelines with nominal diameter to thickness ratios in the range of 18 42 were carried out the main mechanical parameters of the specimens are shown in table 1 where the constitute relation of the materials was given in the fit three parameter ramberg osgood expression 3 3 ε σ e 1 3 7 σ σ 0 n 1 in the lack of the original experiment data the stress at the intersection of the fit power law relation 3 3 and a line through the origin with a slope of 0 98e is used as σ p in the calculation the proportional limits for specimens are listed in table 1 the experimental results from kyriakides and corona 2007 and yeh and kyriakids 1986 corresponding to the specimens listed in table 1 are shown in table 2 the proposed analytical results n 2 evaluated by 2 54 are also listed for comparison it is seen that except for no 7 the critical pressures evaluated by present approach are in good agreement with experimental results the error sources for no 7 may be from the imperfections such as the residual stress in specimen the results show that the present approach may predict the critical pressures well for the pipes under pressures 4 conclusion in this paper an analytical solution based on the elasticity for the pressure capacity calculation of the pipes under external and internal pressures was developed the differential stability equations were solved mathematically and the formula for improved prediction of the critical pressure was derived in closed form the present solution was compared to the other elastic solutions and showed the better accuracy than the classical solution by introducing the inner plastic layer and middle non linear elastic layer to capture the non elastic buckling behavior the analytical approach was extended to the critical pressure prediction of the thick pipes with imperfections the results showed that the initial ovality of the pipes presented a significant influence on the bifurcation pressure and however the effect due to the initial ovality weakened as the pipes become thicker compared to the plastic hinge approach the results from the present approach represented lower critical pressures which indicated that the onset of the collapse of the thick pipes would be in the present proposed mode i e the inner plastic layer together with the middle non linear elastic layer and outer linear elastic layer the analytical results were also compared with that of experiments one advantage of the approach is that the model is simple but describes the experiments well acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key research and

22622,an analytical model is presented to evaluate the buckling pressure of pipes subjected to external internal pressures at firstly a set of stability equations was solved mathematically and the elastic buckling solution was established by introducing the inner plastic section and the middle non linear elastic section the analytical approach was then extended to the critical pressure evaluation of the thick pipes in non elastic buckling and the effect of the initial ovality on the critical pressure is considered details of the analytical formulations and the required parameters are defined the results are presented to show that the initial ovality has a significant influence on the bifurcation pressure and however its effect becomes trivial as the pipes become thicker compared to the plastic hinge approach the proposed solution represents a lower critical pressure which indicates that the pipes would collapse before the formation of the plastic hinges furthermore some factors that affect the pressure capacity of the pipes are discussed the results from the proposed analytical solution are compared with those of other solutions and experiments keywords single wall pipe elastic buckling layers elastic plastic collapse eigenvalue 1 introduction pipelines play an important role in gathering and transporting oil and natural gas from subsea wells to offshore or coastal storage facilities collapse of the pipes would lead to the critical damage of the pipelines and the issue has been widely reported in literature during the past decades the classical solution for the elastic buckling of the circular rings under external pressure was given by timoshenko and gere 1961 and the solution was extended to infinitely long cylindrical shells by accepting the plane strain assumption the solution was also extended to the critical pressure estimation of the pipes in initial yielding as well as the elastic plastic collapse of the non uniform cylindrical shells with corrosion under external pressure hoo fatt 1999 motivated by the applications of the pipelines in offshore structures a large amount of experimental tests have been conducted using hyperbaric chamber to investigate the buckling pressure of the pipes with different diameter to thickness ratios and different initial geometric imperfections khalilpasha and albermani 2013 gong et al 2012 karampour and albermani 2014 yeh and kyriakids 1986 meanwhile many analytical and numerical studies have been conducted to investigate the buckling behavior of thin cylindrical pipes of different materials with various geometric parameters golzana and showkati 2008 tian et al 1999 xue and hoo fatt 2002 2005 fowler and langner 1991 he et al 2014 proposed a simple formula for the elastic plastic collapse pressure prediction of the thick walled pipelines based on the finite element analyses the main results of the experimental observations and the effects of the imperfections were summarized in kyriakides and corona 2007 when the pipes become thicker the classical solution for thin shells will overestimate the critical pressures due to the effect of the transverse shear which results in the non linearly distributions of the hoop and radial stresses through the thickness of the pipes in the past few decades there are considerable analytical models developed to describe the collapse behavior of the thick pipes and shells these approaches to capture the main buckling features of the thick pipes and shells under pressures include 1 shell theories that account the effect of the shear deformation simitses 1996 fu and waas 1995 simitses and anastasiadis 1992 shen 2001 anastasiadis and simitses 1993 simitses et al 1993 in this approach the displacement through the thickness of the pipes was assumed to be linear or in the high order functions of the thickness 2 the refined shell theory by solving analytically the ordinary differential equations to obtain the deformations in

1993 2000 kardomateas and chung 1994 2001 kardomateas and simitses 2005 this approach falls into an eigen boundary value problem to find the solution together with the boundary conditions during the past few decades the elastic buckling of the pipes was widely investigated analytically however the main failure mode for thick pipes in industry applications is in elastic plastic buckling there is no analytical formula with sufficient accuracy for the critical pressure prediction of the pipes in elastic plastic collapse in this paper an analytical approach for the pressure capacity calculation of the pipes was developed by solving directly the novozhilov 1953 differential stability equations for 2d plane strain deformation and adopting the boundary conditions suggested by ji and waas 2014 the elastic buckling solution was established in closed form the solution was then extended to the elastic plastic collapse of the thick pipes by introducing the inner plastic layer and the middle non linear elastic layer to capture the non elastic buckling behavior the present analysis was compared with other 2d solutions and some factors that affect the buckling pressure of the pipes were discussed finally the analytical results were compared with the corresponding experimental results 2 analytical formulation 2 1 the elastic buckling of the pipes under external and internal pressures

critical pressure of the pipe in elastic buckling can be found by evaluating the lowest eigenvalue corresponding to n 2 using the previous argument on the magnitude of q in comparison with e the terms associated with q e in 2 38 can be dropped without much loss in accuracy and the critical pressure of the pipe reduces to 2 40 p β 1 β 4 e β 2 β 4 q equation 2 40 represents the critical value of the external pressure in the case only if the stress at inner surface of the pipe does not exceed the proportional limit of the material 2 2 the non elastic buckling when the pipe is thick one the buckling pressure will be smaller than the value estimated by 2 40 since the interaction between the plasticity and the stability in the pre buckling state the maximum stress appears at the inner radius of the pipe and the yielding of the material may occur it is thus the elastic plastic mixed buckling since eq 2 40 is available only up to the proportional limit of the material consider a thick pipe with the inner radius r and the outer radius r subjected to external pressure p and internal pressure q r 1 and r 2 define the radii of the yielding and the non linear elastic zones as shown in fig 2 shadow areas two dimensionless parameters are defined as 2 41a a 1 r r 1 2 41b a 2 r r 2 the cross section of the pipe is divided by r 1 and r 2 into three ring zones i e the outer linear elastic layer r 1 ρ r the middle non linear elastic layer r 2 ρ r 1 and the inner plastic layer r ρ r 2 the pipe is thus considered as three concentric tubular layers bonded together at the onset of the buckling if the uniform pressure at the interface ρ r 2 is represented by q 2 the plastic collapse pressure n 2 for inner plastic layer reads leone et al 2005 2 42 q 2 q r 2 r r 2 1 1 4 r 2 r r 2 σ 0 a a 2 5 a a 2 4 a 2 σ 0 where σ 0 is the yielding stress of the material if p 1 is the uniform pressure at the interface ρ r 1 for the outer linear elastic layer with external pressure p and internal pressure p 1 2 40 is rewritten as 2 43 p β 1 1 β 4 1 e β 2 1 β 4 1 p 1 where 2 44 β 1 1 β 1 a a 1 β 2 1 β 2 a a 1 β 4 1 β 4 a a 1 in the middle layer the equivalent stresses at ρ r 2 and ρ r 1 are the yielding stress σ 0 and the proportional limit σ p of the material respectively at ρ r 2 of the middle layer the hill condition is written as 2 45a σ x 2 σ x σ ϕ σ ϕ 2 s 2 σ 0 2 where σ x is the axial stress in the middle layer the parameter s is the ratio of the yield stresses in the hoop and longitudinal directions which represents the anisotropy of the yield stresses produced in the manufacturing process assuming that the ratio of the proportional limits in the hoop and longitudinal directions is the same as that of the yield stresses at ρ r 1 of the middle layer the hill condition is 2 45b σ x 2 σ x σ ϕ σ ϕ 2 s 2 σ p 2 the estimation of the external pressure p 1 of the middle non linear elastic layer is a complicate task however the non linear elastic behavior may approximately be simplified as the linear one with elastic modulus e 1 as shown in fig 3 in this manner the relations of the linear elasticity can be employed for this layer the axial stress σ x of the middle layer is then given by 2 46 σ x μ σ ρ σ ϕ the analytical calculation shows that the middle layer is a thin one compared to the thickness of the pipe for this reason the estimation of the pressure p 1 may be further simplified as follow if the effect of the radial stress σ ρ in 2 46 is neglected then the hoop stresses from 2 45 in the middle layer at interfaces are 2 47a σ ϕ ρ r 2 k σ

manner the pressure p 1 of the middle layer is slightly underestimated in order to evaluate the parameters a 1 and a 2 considered the stresses of the elastic layer for buckling configuration expressed in 2 7 at the onset of the buckling the stresses due to the perturbing displacements are small terms in magnitude compared to the pre buckling stresses and the plastic zone is considered to be the same as that in the pre buckling state when 2 43 2 49 are used to evaluate the parameters a 1 and a 2 one needs to solve a 2 dimensional system of the high order coupled equations since the middle layer is a thin one the parameter a 1 and a 2 are determined as follow at first the hill condition for the root explicit is written as 2 50 σ x 00 2 σ x 00 σ ϕ 00 σ ϕ 00 2 s 2 σ 0 2 where 2 51a σ ρ 00

parameter a 2 is obtained then the pressure q 2 in 2 51 and 2 52a is replaced by p 1 and the following equation is employed to obtain the root explicit 2 53 σ x 00 2 σ x 00 σ ϕ 00 σ ϕ 00 2 s 2 σ p 2 the parameter a 1 and a 2 denote the ratios of the outer inner radii of the outer and middle layers if the value of the root a 1 or a 2 each or both is outside the range of 1 a 1 a or 1 a 2 a then the parameter a 1 or a 2 should be taken as a 1 a or a 2 a the parameter a 2 is evaluated from the stresses of the outer elastic layer for simplicity which will result in a slight overestimation of the plastic section however this overestimation in critical pressure can be partially compensated from the underestimation of the pressure in middle layer with inserting of 2 49 into 2 43 the critical pressure of the pipe in elastic plastic mixed buckling becomes 2 54 p β 1 1 β 4 1 e β 2 1 β 4 1 k 2 a 2 σ 0 σ p a 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 q 2 once the parameters a 1 and a 2 are obtained the critical pressure of the pipe can be evaluated by 2 54 2 3 effect of the imperfections on the elastic plastic buckling the imperfections are always present in practices the initial ovality is the main imperfection that influences the collapse pressure of the pipes kyriakides and corona 2007 which is defined as 2 55 δ 0 d max d min d max d min where d max and d min represent the maximum and minimum diameters of the pipe and the initial ovality δ 0 is a small but finite quantity at the outer surface of the pipe ρ r assuming that the initial ovality of the pipe can be expressed in the form as 2 56 u ρ δ 0 r cos 2 ϕ when the value of the δ 0 is small enough the deformation 2 56 can be referred as the first buckling mode perturbing displacements n 2 that are expressed in the form of 2 25 and by inspection given by 2 57a u ρ a ρ 3 b ρ c ρ d ρ 3 cos 2 ϕ 2 57b u ϕ a ρ 3 1 2 μ b 2 1 μ ρ c ρ 3 2 μ 2 μ d ρ 3 sin 2 ϕ where the constants a b c and d are determined from the distribution of the forces and displacements at the boundaries similar to 2 1 and 2 7 the total displacements and stresses of the outer elastic layer are expressed as 2 58a u ρ u ρ 00 δ 0 u ρ 2 58b u ϕ u ϕ 00 δ 0 u ϕ 2 59a σ ρ σ ρ

as 2 61a τ ρ ϕ σ ρ 0 at ρ r and the equilibrium condition 2 61b r 0 r σ ϕ d ρ p r δ 0 q 0 r 0 δ 0 where r 0 defines the radius of the yielding zone when the initial ovality δ 0 is considered and q 0 represents the uniform pressure at ρ r 0 note that the displacement boundary condition at ρ r is expressed as 2 61c δ 0 u ρ ρ r u ρ substituting 2 57 2 59 into 2 61 to solve the constants a b c d and the small terms are dropped the perturbing stresses due to the initial ovality are obtained at a a 2 62a σ ρ a 2 1 3 2 1 μ 2 a 4 a 2 2 e cos 2 ϕ 2 62b σ φ a 2 1 2 a 2 1 1 μ 2 a 4 a 2 2 e cos 2 φ 2 62c τ ρ ϕ a 2 1 3 4 1 μ 2 a 4 a 2 2 e sin 2 ϕ since δ 0 is a small but finite quantity when the pipe with the initial ovality buckles in elastic plastic mode the parameter a 1 and a 2 evaluated by 2 50 and 2 53 will be underestimated consider the maximum size of the layers i e ϕ 0 eqs 2 50 2 53 are rewritten as for a 2 the root a a 2 2 63 σ x 00 δ 0 σ x 2 σ x 00 δ 0 σ x σ ϕ 00 δ 0 σ ϕ σ ϕ 00 δ 0 σ ϕ

initial ovality δ 0 in determination of the parameter a 1 and a 2 for the pipe in elastic plastic buckling the critical pressure is then evaluated by 2 54 the other imperfection that affects the collapse behavior of the pipe is the initial eccentricity that is defined as 2 65 ω 0 t max t min t max t min where t max and t min are the maximum and minimum thickness measured from the two ends of the pipe compared to the initial ovailty the influence of the initial eccentricity on the critical pressure of the pipe is minor kyriakides and corona 2007 the equivalent ratio d t e for simplicity is used in present approach to estimate the effect of the initial eccentricity as follow 2 66 d t e d t 1 1 4 ω 0 1 in this manner the reduction of the evaluated critical pressure by using 2 66 is less than 1 for ω 0 5 which is in the same order as that mentioned in kyriakides and corona 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with other elastic solutions the present approach is compared with several elastic solutions as shown in fig 4 where the elastic modulus and the poison ratio of the pipe are e 57 gpa μ 0 3 respectively eq 2 40 is used to evaluate the smallest eigenvalue n 2 of the critical pressure in this case these solutions for comparison are from the thin shell theory timoshenko and gere 1961 kardomateas 2000 papadakis 2008 and ji and waas 2014 the abaqus results from ji and waas 2014 are also plotted in the classical thin shell theory the radial displacement is considered as the uniform through the thickness and the hoop displacement varies linearly the effect of transverse shear is neglected as the thickness of the pipe increases the thin shell theory overestimates the critical pressures significantly kardomateas 2000 proposed an improved elastic solution that included the effect of the normal strains and stresses the evaluated critical pressures were further reduced compared to his earlier work kardomateas 1993 and the solution represents the lowest critical pressures in fig 4 papadakis 2008 developed a 2d solution in which two cases with the shear strains rotations and with the rotations only were considered the first solution with effect of the shear strains rotations was found to agree with that from kardomateas 2000 while the second solution with effect of rotations only was in agreement with that by kardomateas 1993 the results from the second solution by papadakis 2008 are plotted in fig 4 the results by present approach for elastic buckling are between those from kardomateas 2000 and papadakis 2008 ji and waas 2014 formulated the 2d elasticity solution for thick rings treated as the plane strain continuum they suggested that the work conjugate relation in fe formulation of the commercial software such as abaqus is violated and results in the over prediction of the critical pressures when the body is in compression the work conjugate violation can be eliminated by adopting the jaumann rate of cauchy stress from bažant 1971 in fe formulation which induces the deviation of the predicted critical pressures from that of the abaqus as the thickness of the pipe increases as shown in fig 4 the results from ji and waas 2014 are always higher than those of the present approach 3 2 the non elastic buckling behavior for the thick pipes the yielding mechanism will affect significantly the buckling behavior in this section the effect of yielding of the material in pipe buckling is considered and the smallest critical pressures n 2 are evaluated from eq 2 54 the reference case of q 0 e 210 gpa μ 0 3 σ 0 235 mpa and σ p 180 mpa is considered fig 5 shows the critical pressures as a function of the ratio r r for reference case where the initial ovalities are δ 0 0 δ 0 0 1 and δ 0 0 5 respectively it is evident that the bifurcation pressure is sensitive to the initial ovality and however the effect of the initial ovality becomes trivial as the ratio r r increases the yielding mechanism in buckling of the thick pipes leads that the critical pressures are much lower than that estimated from the full elastic buckling solution represented by eq 2 40 for the initial yielding buckling of the pipes timoshenko and gere 1961 suggested that the pipe yields when the sum of the hoop and bending stresses is up to the yield stress σ 0 and the collapse pressure was given by 3 1a p 1 2 p o p e ψ p o p e ψ 2 4 p o p e 1 2 in which 3 1b p e e 4 1 μ 2 t r 0 3 3 1c p o σ 0 t r 0 3 1d ψ 1 6 δ 0 r 0 t where r 0 represents the mean radius of the pipe t is the wall thickness the up limit of the ratio r 0 t to stop using 3 1a is 3 1e r 0 t t h e 4 1 μ 2 σ 0 1 2 the comparison of the two models is plotted in fig 6 for δ 0 0 5 the up limit of the ratio r r estimated by 3 1e for reference case is r r 1 066 it is seen that the results from the present approach are always higher than that by timoshenko and gere 1961 in the range up to the limit ratio the pressure bifurcation can be observed from the results of the present approach which indicates that the stress at the inner surface of the pipe reaches the proportional limit of the material differ from eq 3 1a in present approach the initial ovality has a significant influence on the bifurcation pressure and however no affection for the full linear elastic buckling as shown in fig 5 the other factor that affects the buckling behavior of the pipes is the formation of the plastic hinge for the pipe with initial ovality the external pressure will result in the bending moment and the hoop stress the initial yielding and then the full plastic sections through the thickness plastic hinges may occur at ϕ 0 90 180 and 270 the limit critical pressure of the plastic hinge approach can be expressed as the smaller one of the elastic buckling and full plastic collapse values the elastic buckling pressure and the pressure of plastic collapse are estimated by 3 2a p e e 4 1 μ 2 t r 0 3 3 2b p 0 t r 0 σ 0 the pressure bifurcation is then determined by taking p e p 0 in this approach the plastic sections are local thickness through zones instead of an inner concentric tubular plastic section used in present approach the critical pressures estimated from two models for reference case are compared to each other in fig 7 in which only the results corresponding to δ 0 0 and s 1 are plotted for explicit it is seen that the critical pressures predicted by the plastic hinge approach are always higher than that from the present approach it indicates that the thick pipes may collapse before the formation of the plastic hinges through the thickness when the effect of the initial ovality is considered the critical pressures evaluated from the present approach will be further reduced as shown in fig 5 however the pressure reduction due to the initial ovality is not considered in plastic hinge approach finally the evaluation of the elastic plastic collapse of the pipes with initial ovality in present approach is based on the circular cross section and the initial ovality is treated as the first mode perturbing deformation it is available only in the case of the initial ovality δ 0 1 the limited value of the δ 0 is suggested as δ 0 0 6 3 3 comparison with experiments the collapse of the circular single wall pipes has been widely investigated in the past years a large amount of experimental tests have been conducted using hyperbaric chamber to investigate the buckling pressures with different diameter to thickness ratios and different initial geometric imperfections a series of experiments kyriakides and corona 2007 yeh and kyriakids 1986 of the pipelines with nominal diameter to thickness ratios in the range of 18 42 were carried out the main mechanical parameters of the specimens are shown in table 1 where the constitute relation of the materials was given in the fit three parameter ramberg osgood expression 3 3 ε σ e 1 3 7 σ σ 0 n 1 in the lack of the original experiment data the stress at the intersection of the fit power law relation 3 3 and a line through the origin with a slope of 0 98e is used as σ p in the calculation the proportional limits for specimens are listed in table 1 the experimental results from kyriakides and corona 2007 and yeh and kyriakids 1986 corresponding to the specimens listed in table 1 are shown in table 2 the proposed analytical results n 2 evaluated by 2 54 are also listed for comparison it is seen that except for no 7 the critical pressures evaluated by present approach are in good agreement with experimental results the error sources for no 7 may be from the imperfections such as the residual stress in specimen the results show that the present approach may predict the critical pressures well for the pipes under pressures 4 conclusion in this paper an analytical solution based on the elasticity for the pressure capacity calculation of the pipes under external and internal pressures was developed the differential stability equations were solved mathematically and the formula for improved prediction of the critical pressure was derived in closed form the present solution was compared to the other elastic solutions and showed the better accuracy than the classical solution by introducing the inner plastic layer and middle non linear elastic layer to capture the non elastic buckling behavior the analytical approach was extended to the critical pressure prediction of the thick pipes with imperfections the results showed that the initial ovality of the pipes presented a significant influence on the bifurcation pressure and however the effect due to the initial ovality weakened as the pipes become thicker compared to the plastic hinge approach the results from the present approach represented lower critical pressures which indicated that the onset of the collapse of the thick pipes would be in the present proposed mode i e the inner plastic layer together with the middle non linear elastic layer and outer linear elastic layer the analytical results were also compared with that of experiments one advantage of the approach is that the model is simple but describes the experiments well acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key research and

22623,in this study some numerical solutions for the hydroelastic problems of bodies are studied by means of rankine source method firstly rankine source method is generalised to the elastic modes the difference method is used to obtain the source strength in order to eliminate the errors in solving process a damping correction factor is applied secondly the numerical predictions of the nonlinear hydroelastic responses of a 13000 teu container ship are presented in the hydrodynamic part the nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force and nonlinear incident wave force caused by instantaneous wetted surface as well as slamming force are considered in the structure part the finite element method is used to solve vertical and horizontal oscillation modes finally the hydroelastic method is extended to the oblique waves by adopting an autopilot model to consider the rudder force moment variation of the different load components with wave direction is studied the present numerical results show acceptable agreement with previous experimental results keywords hydroelastic responses rankine source method nonlinear difference error damping correction factor 1 introduction the increasing of ship dimensions and lightweight construction lead to a relatively flexible structure under the action of ocean waves the coupling of the elastic responses and rigid body with the hydrodynamic forces hydrostatic and inertia would produce extreme loads which can not be detected by traditional load predication method das and cheung 2012 thus an increasing number of ultra large floating structures such as multi hull ships container ships and some vlfs jiao et al 2016 2018 tang et al 2016 chen 2017 senjanovic et al 2009 kara 2015 cheng et al 2016 ji et al 2015 jiao et al 2016a b require hydroelastic analysis to account properly for the interaction between the fluid and structure in the past studies the velocity potential in hydroelastic analysis was solved by means of two dimensional 2 d strip theory or 3 d frequency domain green function method jiao et al 2016a b however the sailing speed of a ship in hydroelastic analysis is an important factor but does not receive the special attention so the validities of the conventional approaches can be questioned as these methods calculate the velocity potential by assuming high encounter frequency and low forward speed alternatively rankine source method which was first presented in dawson 1977 and gadd 1976 has been widely applied to hydrodynamics problems nowadays the rankine source is simple to evaluate and the distribution of the panels over the free surface provides a great deal of flexibility for different kinds of the free surface boundary conditions these aspects drive many researchers to apply it to improvement of hydroelastic model kara and vassalos 2007 presented the fluid structure interaction of the cantilever plate by using of the time domain hydroelastic formulation in three dimensions the convergence test for hydroelastic part of solution for both deeply immersed and close to free surface cantilever plate was presented kim et al 2013 applied a partitioned method for analysis of fluid structure interaction problems of a 6500 teu container ship and a 10 000 teu container ship the fluid domain surrounding a flexible body is solved using a b spline rankine source method and the structural domain is handled with a three dimensional finite element method zhang and zou 2015 carried out the numerical simulation of the radiation and the diffraction of a ship with a forward speed using a time domain rankine source method unlike their original method the work applied a collection of quadric panels instead of the plane quadrilateral panels to discretize the fluid domain boundary such modification is to enhance the geometrical continuity between panels and subsequently increase the numerical accuracy in addition the real wave condition where vessels sail is oblique waves so study of the hydroelastic method in oblique waves is more valuable in the field of naval architecture the main problem of study of ship load responses in oblique waves confront with is numerical divergence of ship horizontal motion actually the ships navigating in real wave conditions maintain the track by adjusting the rudder continuously however most studies focus on the methods that does not consider the manipulation effects such as digital filter technique fukasawa 1990 and artificial restoring force namely by adding the artificial spring model to restrain the divergence of ship sway and yaw motions these approaches ignored the effect of ship maneuverability which cannot reflect the actual navigation situation therefore investigation of the coupling relationship between ship maneuverability and ship motion has more significance in practice however the mechanics characteristic of rudder and hull in the process of steering is very complex hin et al 1997 dietec 1991 for many years some groups and scholars in the world have been devoting to this field abs developed a time domain prediction program for ship motion and wave loads and the autopilot model effect was taken into account lin and yue 1990 a pid proportional integral and derivative method was used to control the rudder to make sure the heading direction of ships can be maintained although a great deal of research and exploration have been done to solved the numerical divergence problem of horizontal motion equations in oblique waves while there are still no efficient flexible and perfect methods competent for nonlinear hydroelastic responses up to now in this paper the objectives are to further investigate the fundamental mechanisms involved in high speed vessel responses related hydroelastic problems in regular oblique waves a 3 d nonlinear time domain hydroelastic method based on rankine source theory is proposed the difference method is used to solve the second order differential equations to obtain the source strength different from the previous examples of the hydroelastic analysis special attention is paid to the difference error and a damping correction factor is presented to eliminate the errors in solving process by adopting the pid autopilot model the numerical divergence phenomenon of horizontal motion in oblique waves is eliminated the load responses of a 13000 teu container ship under different wave directions are analyzed compared with existing linear theory and experimental data it is confirmed that the present method can be used to calculate the hydroelastic responses in satisfactory precision 2 model description 2 1 basic formulations in this article the ship is assumed flexible body and traveling in waves a ship fixed right handed coordinate system o xyz fixed to a ship in steady motion is introduced the horizontal x y plane is coincident with the still water surface with its origin placed on the center of the ship and the z axis is positive upward a ship is translating at the constant forward speed u with respect to a space fixed reference frame x y z in order to predict the ship hydroelastic responses the fluid is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and the flow is irrotational total potential ψ is decomposed into a perturbation flow ϕ t and a basis flow φ d φ d that is the main component of the order of o 1 may be expressed as φ d u x φ the perturbation flow ϕ t may be written as follows 1 ϕ t ϕ i t ϕ t where δ r denotes the incident potential that is known φ t denotes the disturbed potential which is further expressed as 2 ϕ t r 1 m ϕ r t ϕ d t where for a elastic hull r 1 2 6 is 6 degrees of freedom rigid motions r 7 8 m is the elastic modes by using some linearization processes the radiation potential δ δ r η 6 x r u r η

velocity vector u r and θ r are the r th natural oscillation modes of displacement and rotation it is worth mentioning that for a floating flexible body not only its rigid body motion and wetted surface area but also its structural deformation has to be as well solved obviously the dynamics of flexible structure including its body movement and the dynamics of the fluid around it are a coupled entirety this is the essence of the theory of hydroelasticity 2 2 numerical damping beach except for the radiation condition rankine source method can satisfy other definite conditions well fortunately in depth study of the numerical damping beach provides a feasible solution to the radiation condition problem the numerical damping beach was first proposed in israeli and orszag 1981 the function is to absorb the disturbance waves and prevent waves from reflecting back which is just like the damping beach in a towing tank in this section a numerical damping beach approach which was employed by nakos 1990 and kring 1994 was used to prevent the reflected wave from the end of truncated fluid domain considering the cooling terms of damping beach the free surface condition can be modified as follows 5 ζ t φ z 2 ν r ζ ν r 2 g φ φ t g ζ where ν r is the damping beach coefficient that was obtained by proposed by the damping beach length c l and cooling strength c s israeli and orszag 1981 6 ν r 3 c s c l 3 r r 0 2 r 0 r c l r 0 ν r 0 r r 0 where r is the radial distance from the wave making source according to huang 1998 c l λ λ is the wavelength as identified in huang 1998 for the low forward speed even zero speed ships the damping beach needs to be installed at all sides of the outer portion of the free surface as disturbed waves propagate slowly towards all directions however this study focuses on high speed problems since the disturbed waves propagate out very fast the implementation of numerical damping beach is not necessary behind the hull 2 3 source sink distribution method 2 3 1 distributed source integral equation the φ p t that satisfies the definite conditions above can be obtained by the source sink distribution method the φ p t can be expressed as the source distribution on the wetted surface 7 n φ p t s σ q t n g p q d s q where s is the integration surfaces of the domain boundary σ q t is the unknown source strength distributed over the surfaces g p q is the green function that satisfies the laplace equation 8 g p q 1 r 1 x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 where g p q denotes the rankine source p x y z and q ξ η ζ are field and source points respectively for the problem in this article the solution needs to be constructed by using the constant strength source distribution over the integration surface s f and s b with the help of the linear free surface condition s f and the body surface condition s 0 we would obtain kara et al 2007 9 s σ q t n p g p q d s q 1 g t u x 2 φ p t p s f n r p r t m r p r t ϕ i n p s 0 2 3 2 panel

surface which can be expressed as 10 s k 1 n δ s k the eq 9 about σ k q is translated into a group of second order differential equations of the number of n 11 a σ b σ d σ e it is worth noting that the coefficient matrix a of eq 11 is irreversible so the runge kutta method or the hamming method is not suitable for solving the second order differential equations the difference method was adopted in this paper the difference schemes are presented in table 1 by adopting the second order or fourth order difference scheme the second order differential equation 11 are transformed into the first order linear equations that can be solved by the gaussian elimination or gmres dai 2003 after the source strength σ q t are determined φ p t can be solved by substituting it into eq 7 2 4 solution of difference error 2 4 1 error analysis the calculation of a 5 m radius sphere was undertaken based on the above theory the sketch of spherical surface and free surface panel mesh is shown in fig 1 the origin of coordinates is located at the center of the sphere and the direction of positive x coordinate axis is opposite to wave propagation direction the coordinate values of the selected spherical surface panel and free surface panel are as follows 5 0 0 m and 20 0 0 m the velocity potential m2 s is predicted and shown as figs 2 3 where f n denotes froude number h denotes wave height β denotes the heading angle it is observed that although the velocity potential makes a periodicity sine or cosine change with the time the convergence property is not very good when the differential method is used to solve two differential equations the subtraction of the two similar numbers will cause serious loss of effective figures besides if the absolute value of the divisor is far less than that of the dividend the rounding error may also be caused when the time interval is short the difference of σ t 1 and σ t between two adjacent time steps on the same panel is pretty small thus a certain error will be produced in the calculation process as for the problems that need to be solved in time domain by the step by step approach small interference factors sometimes can cause error accumulation and even lead to computation failure in this paper this interference is found in the numerical solution which is shown in figs 2 3 some scholars such as li 2009 pointed out that the order of infinitesimal quantity of the correction equation may be increased by improving the precision of difference scheme thus it s necessary to construct a convergence and stable difference scheme that satisfies the partial differential boundary equation to reduce and even eliminate the influence of rounding error on results 2 4 2 solution procedure and method in order to avoid the situation that the absolute value of the divisor is far less than the absolute value of the dividend the damping correction factor e α t which was employed by li 2009 in rigid theory is applied to reduce the influence of the rounding error the authors extend it to elastic modes and combine it with hydroelasticity theory suppose 12 ψ j p t φ j p t e α t s σ j q t g p q d s q e α t s σ j q t g p q d s we have 13 ψ t φ t e α t α φ e α t 14 2 ψ t 2 2 φ t 2 e α t 2 α φ t e α t α 2 φ e α t and then multiplying e α t on both sides of the body surface condition free surface condition and numerical damping

g ψ z 0 obviously eqs 18 20 are regarded as new the body surface condition free surface condition and numerical damping beach condition to solve the velocity potential so there is a relationship between the distribution source strength obtained by this method and real distribution source strength 21 σ j q t σ j q t e α t to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method the velocity potential and motion responses of the sphere are recalculated and shown in figs 4 5 it can be seen that good results of velocity potential is obtained by means of the damping correction factor with the successful demonstration of the prediction of velocity potential it is reasonable to expect the feasibility of applying the method to the hydroelastic problems 2 4 3 selection of the damping correction factor the purpose of this part is to determine the calculation damping coefficient α based on the numerical results of the sphere the calculation parameters are listed in table 2 in this computation case when α 4 α 10 the calculation would not be conducted moreover if the number of grids is small the calculation damping coefficient α needs to be relatively small in this article the calculation grid number of the sphere is 144 and the calculation damping coefficient α could be 4 8 the calculation grid number of the container ship is 1843 and α could be 8 10 from the numerical results when α 4 or α 10 the velocity potential will usually converge the larger the value of α is the faster the convergence rate will be however it is observed from the form of e α t that if t is too large the calculation will not be conducted therefore under the premise of calculation convergence the calculation damping coefficient α should select possible small value 3 hydroelasticity theory in regular oblique waves combined with 3 d wetted surface mesh of flexible hull the velocity potential of flow field is solved by the rankine source method the followed is the solution of every fluid force according to the 3 d hydroelasticity theory the r th order component of generalised hydrodynamic forces of ships can be expressed as 22 z r t s t n u r p d s r 1 2 m where p is pressure n is the

simulated numerically in time domain owing to lack of rubber force the steady state solutions cannot be obtained even in the case of regular waves the solutions of horizontal motions are drifting in process of time steps which would affect other modes of motions badly in this section the pid autopilot model is applied to solve the divergence problem of ship motion equation in oblique waves since the sway and bow motion do not have restoring force this study only considers the influence of rudder force on sway and bow motion based on the numerical model of pid autopilot the rudder force moment relating to horizontal motions sway and yaw can be expressed as follows 35 f 2 r k δ f 6 r k x r δ where in order to avoid oscillation k is a proportional coefficient that may be determined according to load and environmental requirements δ denotes the effective attack angle of rudder which consists of the rudder angle the hull motion parameters and the horizontal velocity caused by the incident wave the effective attack angle can be defined as follows 36 δ δ r η 6 x r u r η 6 z r u r η 4 1 u r η 2 where x r y r z r is the position coordinates of the rudder coordinates δ r is the rudder angle that is expressed as follows 37 δ r k 1 η 6 k 2 η 6 k 3 η 2 u k 3 0 t η 6 d t where k 1 k 3 is the proportional coefficient which can be adjusted to adapt to the load and environmental requirements η

effective flow velocity behind the rudder which can be calculated by the formula as 38 u r 1 2u where u is ship sailing speed substituting eqs 36 37 into eq 35 the rudder force moment in the form of the matrix can be written 39 w x t r 1 m p r t w r x m x t r 1 m p r t m r x v x t r 1 m p r t v r x the damping coefficient b rudder restoring force coefficient c rudder and coefficient of the

slamming theory is used to predict slamming load 43 f f x t d d t m x t d d t z r x t ρ g s x t where m x t denotes the instantaneous added mass s x t denotes instantaneous sinking area z r x t denotes vertical relative ship motion to the incident wave since the hydroelasticity theory needs to take into consideration the ship elastic deformations the vertical relative ship velocity to the incident wave should be written as follows 44 d d t z r x t r 1 m w r x p r t ζ where ζ is the wave vertical velocity and then the slamming load of each mode was integrated on instantaneous wetted surface s t the r th slamming force considering the oscillation modes can be expressed as 45 f s l a m min g r t s t f f t w r d s 3 6 hydroelastic time domain motion equation and modal analysis

the container ship in ballast condition the bar elements and shell elements are respectively used to simulate the plate structures and stiffener structures the total number of elements is 366820 including 160842 bar elements and 205978 shell elements besides the shell elements include 183309 quadrilateral elements and 22669 triangular elements by using fortran the additional water mass of each station is determined and simulated on wetted surface mesh by launching mass point method table 3 lists the main particulars of the ship figs 7 9 present the first three orders of vertical horizontal and torsional oscillation wet modes 4 numerical results and discussions 4 1 verification of the present numerical method for the present numerical method to be reliable the vbm and hbm responses of the container ship are obtained and compared with the experimental measurements exp chen and jiao 2017 30 60 90 and 135 are selected for the comparison of the results the nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force and nonlinear incident wave force caused by instantaneous wetted surface as well as slamming force are considered as shown in figs 10 11 the nonlinear hydroelastic results show better agreement with the test data than the linear ones in particular at high frequency response position the hogging and sagging values obtained by the linear numerical method are almost equal the linear method cannot show high frequency oscillation characteristics induced by slamming force which would underestimates hydroelastic responses as for the vbm the slamming phenomenon may seriously affect nonlinear characteristics of ship load responses which is found in the high frequency load components the high frequency load components at β 30 are largest and the ones at β 60 take second place and the ones at β 135 take third place and the lowest high frequency responses occur in beam seas besides the hbm are also accorded with this law but only slight slamming effect can be found in hbm in the beam sea conditions the calculation results from linear method and nonlinear method have only minor differences this can be explained by a fact that the hull high frequency oscillation characteristics in beam seas are not as strong as those in other wave directions 4 2 effect of the nonlinearity after proving that the method proposed in this article is reliable the main contribution of the different nonlinear factors is analyzed in this section the two kinds of nonlinear calculation models are built ncm1 only nonlinear restoring force and nonlinear incident wave force caused by instantaneous wetted surface are considered ncm2 only slamming force is considered since slamming phenomenon only has significant impact on vbm the influence of nonlinear factors on vbm is studied in this section fig 12 illustrates that the differences between linear results and nonlinear results at the four wave direction conditions are obvious for the wave direction of 90 the difference between the peak values obtained by using the linear theory and the nonlinear theory is slight however it can be seen that high frequency load effects are clearly presented in the time histories of the nonlinear results under other wave directions which is shown in fig 12 a b and d in these cases the measured sagging moments are larger than the hogging ones the difference between hogging and sagging at β 30 is largest and the one at β 45 takes the second place and the one at β 135 takes the third place and the lowest difference is found in beam seas this is also true for the two nonlinear calculation models it is worth mentioning that the differences between nonlinear results from different calculation models and linear results are not quite similar compared with linear results high frequency load characteristics from ncm2 are more remarkable the total amplitudes of load responses from ncm1 are larger the primary reason is that slamming force which is a kind of transient impact force mainly influences the high frequency characteristics of load responses especially for the first order of mode obviously the high frequency components of the predicted results vibrate with certain frequencies if slamming effects are considered the nonlinearity of instantaneous wetted surface mainly influences the rigid motion amplitudes whereas has little influence on the elastic modes furthermore as for beam sea and quartering sea conditions such as the wave directions of 90 and 135 the slamming effect is not strong and the nonlinearity of restoring force is dominant so the linear results agree well with the results from ncm1 however as for head quarter waves such as 30 and 45 strong slamming effect appears and high frequency nonlinearity induced by slamming force is dominant so the results form linear method and ncm2 have a great difference 4 3 analysis of speed effects in order to identify the effect of forward speed fig 13 shows the motion responses of both rigid body and elastic modes for the different forward speeds it can be seen that the growth of forward speed may increase motion responses which includes not only amplitudes of rigid motions but also high frequency characteristics of elastic modes this is primarily because that despite the same wave condition different forward speeds result in different encounter frequencies as well as different resonance frequencies so the oscillation effects would be different with the increasing of forward speed the encounter frequency increases and is closer to the natural frequency thus the nonlinearity of high frequency motion responses would be more obvious therefore to match actual situation numerical model should take the speed effects into account 4 4 analysis of load components under different heading angles since the high frequency loads are the main reason causing fatigue and ultimate strength failure the study of the different load components variation with wave direction will help designers to understand the mechanical properties of ships ratios of load components to total loads against heading angle for corresponding different stations are displayed in fig 14 station 0 starts from the after perpendicular as the results in the figures indicate for all the stations the ratio of low frequency loads reaches the maximum value and the ratio of high frequency loads reaches the minimum value at β 90 besides it is shown that the ratio of low frequency loads reaches the minimum value and the ratio of high frequency loads reaches the maximum value at mid ship for all the heading angle conditions as for the vbm amidships the ratio of high frequency load component in head waves is the greatest and the ones in head quarter waves and quartering sea take second place and third place respectively the figures of hbm in fig 15 trend very similar to those described above the ratios of high frequency load component to total vbm and hbm in head waves are 58 73 and 51 95 respectively the ratio of high frequency load component in beam seas is the lowest which is 17 17 and 12 19 because the nonlinear high frequency slamming loads are not pronounced while the ratio of low frequency load component in beam seas is the greatest moreover the ratio of high frequency load component of vbm is larger than that of hbm while the high frequency load component of hbm shows a larger result compared to vbm in quartering sea in addition the container ship has a significant flare at its bow taking the vbm as an example for the wave direction of 0 the ratio of high frequency load component at the bow 40 09 is stronger than at the stern part 30 25 of the hull because of severe slamming loads therefore enough attention must be given to the influence of high frequency oscillation responses on strength of ships in head waves and head quarter waves 5 conclusions and recommendations the 3 d rankine source method is generalised to the elastic modes and a nonlinear time domain hydroelastic method considering the rudder force is proposed from the analysis of this work a framework of nonlinear hydroelastic numerical methods in regular oblique waves is established 1 as for the difference method for source strength a damping correction factor is proposed to eliminate the errors the results indicated that the velocity potential obtained by this method is stable and convergent and the calculation damping coefficient α should select possible small value 2 this study eliminates the numerical divergence of ship horizontal motion in time domain by adopting pid autopilot model and the hydroelastic responses in oblique waves are predicted from the comparison with segmented model experimental results of a 13000 teu container ship it is confirmed that the method presented in this paper is reliable and accurate 3 in beam sea and quartering sea the nonlinearity of restoring force is dominant the high frequency load component is more sensitive to wave direction and ship high frequency oscillation must be taken into consideration in head waves and head quarter waves because of slamming force 4 it is worth noting that the numerical model in this paper is aimed at vertical and horizontal hydroelastic responses in oblique seas and torsion is not included in this study which will be one of the important research directions in the future

22623,in this study some numerical solutions for the hydroelastic problems of bodies are studied by means of rankine source method firstly rankine source method is generalised to the elastic modes the

to the oblique waves by adopting an autopilot model to consider the rudder force moment variation of the different load components with wave direction is studied the present numerical results show acceptable agreement with previous experimental results keywords hydroelastic responses rankine source method nonlinear difference error damping correction factor 1 introduction the increasing of ship dimensions and lightweight construction lead to a relatively flexible structure under the action of ocean waves the coupling of the elastic responses and rigid body with the hydrodynamic forces hydrostatic and inertia would produce extreme loads which can not be detected by traditional load predication method das and cheung 2012 thus an increasing number of ultra large floating structures such as multi hull ships container ships and some vlfs jiao et al 2016 2018 tang et al 2016 chen 2017 senjanovic et al 2009 kara 2015 cheng et al 2016 ji et al 2015 jiao et al 2016a b require hydroelastic analysis to account properly for the interaction between the fluid and structure in the past studies the velocity potential in hydroelastic analysis was solved by means of two dimensional 2 d strip theory or 3 d frequency domain green function method jiao et al 2016a b however the sailing speed of a ship in hydroelastic analysis is an important factor but does not receive the special attention so the validities of the conventional approaches can be questioned as these methods calculate the velocity potential by assuming high encounter frequency and low forward speed alternatively rankine source method which was first presented in dawson 1977 and gadd 1976 has been widely applied to hydrodynamics problems nowadays the rankine source is simple to evaluate and the distribution of the panels over the free surface provides a great deal of flexibility for different kinds of the free surface boundary conditions these aspects drive many researchers to apply it to improvement of hydroelastic model kara and vassalos 2007 presented the fluid structure interaction of the cantilever plate by using of the time domain hydroelastic formulation in three dimensions the convergence test for hydroelastic part of solution for both deeply immersed and close to free surface cantilever plate was presented kim et al 2013 applied a partitioned method for analysis of fluid structure interaction problems of a 6500 teu container ship and a 10 000 teu container ship the fluid domain surrounding a flexible body is solved using a b spline rankine source method and the structural domain is handled with a three dimensional finite element method zhang and zou 2015 carried out the numerical simulation of the radiation and the diffraction of a ship with a forward speed using a time domain rankine source method unlike their original method the work applied a collection of quadric panels instead of the plane quadrilateral panels to discretize the fluid domain boundary such modification is to enhance the geometrical continuity between panels and subsequently increase the numerical accuracy in addition the real wave condition where vessels sail is oblique waves so study of the hydroelastic method in oblique waves is more valuable in the field of naval architecture the main problem of study of ship load responses in oblique waves confront with is numerical divergence of ship horizontal motion actually the ships navigating in real wave conditions maintain the track by adjusting the rudder continuously however most studies focus on the methods that does not consider the manipulation effects such as digital filter technique fukasawa 1990 and artificial restoring force namely by adding the artificial spring model to restrain the divergence of ship sway and yaw motions these approaches ignored the effect of ship maneuverability which cannot reflect the actual navigation situation therefore investigation of the coupling relationship between ship maneuverability and ship motion has more significance in practice however the mechanics characteristic of rudder and hull in the process of steering is very complex hin et al 1997 dietec 1991 for many years some groups and scholars in the world have been devoting to this field abs developed a time domain prediction program for ship motion and wave loads and the autopilot model effect was taken into account lin and yue 1990 a pid proportional integral and derivative method was used to control the rudder to make sure the heading direction of ships can be maintained although a great deal of research and exploration have been done to solved the numerical divergence problem of horizontal motion equations in oblique waves while there are still no efficient flexible and perfect methods competent for nonlinear hydroelastic responses up to now in this paper the objectives are to further investigate the fundamental mechanisms involved in high speed vessel responses related hydroelastic problems in regular oblique waves a 3 d nonlinear time domain hydroelastic method based on rankine source theory is proposed the difference method is used to solve the second order differential equations to obtain the source strength different from the previous examples of the hydroelastic analysis special attention is paid to the difference error and a damping correction factor is presented to eliminate the errors in solving process by adopting the pid autopilot model the numerical divergence phenomenon of horizontal motion in oblique waves is eliminated the load responses of a 13000 teu container ship under different wave directions are analyzed compared with existing linear theory and experimental data it is confirmed that the present method can be used to calculate the hydroelastic responses in satisfactory precision 2 model description 2 1 basic formulations in this article the ship is assumed flexible body and traveling in waves a ship fixed right handed coordinate system o xyz fixed to a ship in steady motion is introduced the horizontal x y plane is coincident with the still water surface with its origin placed on the center of the ship and the z axis is positive upward a ship is translating at the constant forward speed u with respect to a space fixed reference frame x y z in order to predict the ship hydroelastic responses the fluid is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and the flow is irrotational total potential ψ is decomposed into a perturbation flow ϕ t and a basis flow φ d φ d that is the main component of the order of o 1 may be expressed as φ d u x φ the perturbation flow ϕ t may be written as follows 1 ϕ t ϕ i t ϕ t where δ r denotes the incident potential that is known φ t denotes the disturbed potential which is further expressed as 2 ϕ t r 1 m ϕ r t ϕ d t where for a elastic hull r 1 2 6 is 6 degrees of freedom rigid motions r 7 8 m is the elastic modes by using some linearization processes the radiation potential δ δ r η 6 x r u r η

velocity vector u r and θ r are the r th natural oscillation modes of displacement and rotation it is worth mentioning that for a floating flexible body not only its rigid body motion and wetted surface area but also its structural deformation has to be as well solved obviously the dynamics of flexible structure including its body movement and the dynamics of the fluid around it are a coupled entirety this is the essence of the theory of hydroelasticity 2 2 numerical damping beach except for the radiation condition rankine source method can satisfy other definite conditions well fortunately in depth study of the numerical damping beach provides a feasible solution to the radiation condition problem the numerical damping beach was first proposed in israeli and orszag 1981 the function is to absorb the disturbance waves and prevent waves from reflecting back which is just like the damping beach in a towing tank in this section a numerical damping beach approach which was employed by nakos 1990 and kring 1994 was used to prevent the reflected wave from the end of truncated fluid domain considering the cooling terms of damping beach the free surface condition can be modified as follows 5 ζ t φ z 2 ν r ζ ν r 2 g φ φ t g ζ where ν r is the damping beach coefficient that was obtained by proposed by the damping beach length c l and cooling strength c s israeli and orszag 1981 6 ν r 3 c s c l 3 r r 0 2 r 0 r c l r 0 ν r 0 r r 0 where r is the radial distance from the wave making source according to huang 1998 c l λ λ is the wavelength as identified in huang 1998 for the low forward speed even zero speed ships the damping beach needs to be installed at all sides of the outer portion of the free surface as disturbed waves propagate slowly towards all directions however this study focuses on high speed problems since the disturbed waves propagate out very fast the implementation of numerical damping beach is not necessary behind the hull 2 3 source sink distribution method 2 3 1 distributed source integral equation the φ p t that satisfies the definite conditions above can be obtained by the source sink distribution method the φ p t can be expressed as the source distribution on the wetted surface 7 n φ p t s σ q t n g p q d s q where s is the integration surfaces of the domain boundary σ q t is the unknown source strength distributed over the surfaces g p q is the green function that satisfies the laplace equation 8 g p q 1 r 1 x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 where g p q denotes the rankine source p x y z and q ξ η ζ are field and source points respectively for the problem in this article the solution needs to be constructed by using the constant strength source distribution over the integration surface s f and s b with the help of the linear free surface condition s f and the body surface condition s 0 we would obtain kara et al 2007 9 s σ q t n p g p q d s q 1 g t u x 2 φ p t p s f n r p r t m r p r t ϕ i n p s 0 2 3 2 panel method the integral eq 9 is then solved by using the panel method from hess and smith 1964 the continuous surface s hull wetted surface and free surface is divided into n panels on the ship wetted surface which can be expressed as 10 s k 1 n δ s k the eq 9 about σ k q is translated into a group of second order differential equations of the number of n 11 a σ b σ d σ e it is worth noting that the coefficient matrix a of eq 11 is irreversible so the runge kutta method or the hamming method is not suitable for solving the second order differential equations the difference method was adopted in this paper the difference schemes are presented in table 1 by adopting the second order or fourth order difference scheme the second order differential equation 11 are transformed into the first order linear equations that can be solved by the gaussian elimination or gmres dai 2003 after the source strength σ q t are determined φ p t can be solved by substituting it into eq 7 2 4 solution of difference error 2 4 1 error analysis the calculation of a 5 m radius sphere was undertaken based on the above theory the sketch of spherical surface and free surface panel mesh is shown in fig 1 the origin of coordinates is located at the center of the sphere and the direction of positive x coordinate axis is opposite to wave propagation direction the coordinate values of the selected spherical surface panel and free surface panel are as follows 5 0 0 m and 20 0 0 m the velocity potential m2 s is predicted and shown as figs 2 3 where f n denotes froude number h denotes wave height β denotes the heading angle it is observed that although the velocity potential makes a periodicity sine or cosine change with the time the convergence property is not very good when the differential method is used to solve two differential equations the subtraction of the two similar numbers will cause serious loss of effective figures besides if the absolute value of the divisor is far less than that of the dividend the rounding error may also be caused when the time interval is short the difference of σ t 1 and σ t between two adjacent time steps on the same panel is pretty small thus a certain error will be produced in the calculation process as for the problems that need to be solved in time domain by the step by step approach small interference factors sometimes can cause error accumulation and even lead to computation failure in this paper this interference is found in the numerical solution which is shown in figs 2 3 some scholars such as li 2009 pointed out that the order of infinitesimal quantity of the correction equation may be increased by improving the precision of difference scheme thus it s necessary to construct a convergence and stable difference scheme that satisfies the partial differential boundary equation to reduce and even eliminate the influence of rounding error on results 2 4 2 solution procedure and method in order to avoid the situation that the absolute value of the divisor is far less than the absolute value of the dividend the damping correction factor e α t which was employed by li 2009 in rigid theory is applied to reduce the influence of the rounding error the authors extend it to elastic modes and combine it with hydroelasticity theory suppose 12 ψ j p t φ j p t e α t s σ j q t g p q d s q e α t s σ j q t g p q d s we have 13 ψ t φ t e α t α φ e α t 14 2 ψ t 2 2 φ t 2 e α t 2 α φ t e α t α 2 φ e α t and then multiplying e α t on both sides of the body surface condition free surface condition and numerical damping

between the distribution source strength obtained by this method and real distribution source strength 21 σ j q t σ j q t e α t to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method the velocity potential and motion responses of the sphere are recalculated and shown in figs 4 5 it can be seen that good results of velocity potential is obtained by means of the damping correction factor with the successful demonstration of the prediction of velocity potential it is reasonable to expect the feasibility of applying the method to the hydroelastic problems 2 4 3 selection of the damping correction factor the purpose of this part is to determine the calculation damping coefficient α based on the numerical results of the sphere the calculation parameters are listed in table 2 in this computation case when α 4 α 10 the calculation would not be conducted moreover if the number of grids is small the calculation damping coefficient α needs to be relatively small in this article the calculation grid number of the sphere is 144 and the calculation damping coefficient α could be 4 8 the calculation grid number of the container ship is 1843 and α could be 8 10 from the numerical results when α 4 or α 10 the velocity potential will usually converge the larger the value of α is the faster the convergence rate will be however it is observed from the form of e α t that if t is too large the calculation will not be conducted therefore under the premise of calculation convergence the calculation damping coefficient α should select possible small value 3 hydroelasticity theory in regular oblique waves combined with 3 d wetted surface mesh of flexible hull the velocity potential of flow field is solved by the rankine source method the followed is the solution of every fluid force according to the 3 d hydroelasticity theory the r th order component of generalised hydrodynamic forces of ships can be expressed as 22 z r t s t n u r p d s r 1 2 m where p is pressure n is the

simulated numerically in time domain owing to lack of rubber force the steady state solutions cannot be obtained even in the case of regular waves the solutions of horizontal motions are drifting in process of time steps which would affect other modes of motions badly in this section the pid autopilot model is applied to solve the divergence problem of ship motion equation in oblique waves since the sway and bow motion do not have restoring force this study only considers the influence of rudder force on sway and bow motion based on the numerical model of pid autopilot the rudder force moment relating to horizontal motions sway and yaw can be expressed as follows 35 f 2 r k δ f 6 r k x r δ where in order to avoid oscillation k is a proportional coefficient that may be determined according to load and environmental requirements δ denotes the effective attack angle of rudder which consists of the rudder angle the hull motion parameters and the horizontal velocity caused by the incident

denotes vertical relative ship motion to the incident wave since the hydroelasticity theory needs to take into consideration the ship elastic deformations the vertical relative ship velocity to the

including 160842 bar elements and 205978 shell elements besides the shell elements include 183309 quadrilateral elements and 22669 triangular elements by using fortran the additional water mass of each station is determined and simulated on wetted surface mesh by launching mass point method table 3 lists the main particulars of the ship figs 7 9 present the first three orders of vertical horizontal and torsional oscillation wet modes 4 numerical results and discussions 4 1 verification of the present numerical method for the present numerical method to be reliable the vbm and hbm responses of the container ship are obtained and compared with the experimental measurements exp chen and jiao 2017 30 60 90 and 135 are selected for the comparison of the results the nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force and nonlinear incident wave force caused by instantaneous wetted surface as well as slamming force are considered as shown in figs 10 11 the nonlinear hydroelastic results show better agreement with the test data than the linear ones in particular at high frequency response position the hogging and sagging values obtained by the linear numerical method are almost equal the linear method cannot show high frequency oscillation characteristics induced by slamming force which would underestimates hydroelastic responses as for the vbm the slamming phenomenon may seriously affect nonlinear characteristics of ship load responses which is found in the high frequency load components the high frequency load components at β 30 are largest and the ones at β 60 take second place and the ones at β 135 take third place and the lowest high frequency responses occur in beam seas besides the hbm are also accorded with this law but only slight slamming effect can be found in hbm in the beam sea conditions the calculation results from linear method and nonlinear method have only minor differences this can be explained by a fact that the hull high frequency oscillation characteristics in beam seas are not as strong as those in other wave directions 4 2 effect of the nonlinearity after proving that the method proposed in this article is reliable the main contribution of the different nonlinear factors is analyzed in this section the two kinds of nonlinear calculation models are built ncm1 only nonlinear restoring force and nonlinear incident wave force caused by instantaneous wetted surface are considered ncm2 only slamming force is considered since slamming phenomenon only has significant impact on vbm the influence of nonlinear factors on vbm is studied in this section fig 12 illustrates that the differences between linear results and nonlinear results at the four wave direction conditions are obvious for the wave direction of 90 the difference between the peak values obtained by using the linear theory and the nonlinear theory is slight however it can be seen that high frequency load effects are clearly presented in the time histories of the nonlinear results under other wave directions which is shown in fig 12 a b and d in these cases the measured sagging moments are larger than the hogging ones the difference between hogging and sagging at β 30 is largest and the one at β 45 takes the second place and the one at β 135 takes the third place and the lowest difference is found in beam seas this is also true for the two nonlinear calculation models it is worth mentioning that the differences between nonlinear results from different calculation models and linear results are not quite similar compared with linear results high frequency load characteristics from ncm2 are more remarkable the total amplitudes of load responses from ncm1 are larger the primary reason is that slamming force which is a kind of transient impact force mainly influences the high frequency characteristics of load responses especially for the first order of mode obviously the high frequency components of the predicted results vibrate with certain frequencies if slamming effects are considered the nonlinearity of instantaneous wetted surface mainly influences the rigid motion amplitudes whereas has little influence on the elastic modes furthermore as for beam sea and quartering sea conditions such as the wave directions of 90 and 135 the slamming effect is not strong and the nonlinearity of restoring force is dominant so the linear results agree well with the results from ncm1 however as for head quarter waves such as 30 and 45 strong slamming effect appears and high frequency nonlinearity induced by slamming force is dominant so the results form linear method and ncm2 have a great difference 4 3 analysis of speed effects in order to identify the effect of forward speed fig 13 shows the motion responses of both rigid body and elastic modes for the different forward speeds it can be seen that the growth of forward speed may increase motion responses which includes not only amplitudes of rigid motions but also high frequency characteristics of elastic modes this is primarily because that despite the same wave condition different forward speeds result in different encounter frequencies as well as different resonance frequencies so the oscillation effects would be different with the increasing of forward speed the encounter frequency increases and is closer to the natural frequency thus the nonlinearity of high frequency motion responses would be more obvious therefore to match actual situation numerical model should take the speed effects into account 4 4 analysis of load components under different heading angles since the high frequency loads are the main reason causing fatigue and ultimate strength failure the study of the different load components variation with wave direction will help designers to understand the mechanical properties of ships ratios of load components to total loads against heading angle for corresponding different stations are displayed in fig 14 station 0 starts from the after perpendicular as the results in the figures indicate for all the stations the ratio of low frequency loads reaches the maximum value and the ratio of high frequency loads reaches the minimum value at β 90 besides it is shown that the ratio of low frequency loads reaches the minimum value and the ratio of high frequency loads reaches the maximum value at mid ship for all the heading angle conditions as for the vbm amidships the ratio of high frequency load component in head waves is the greatest and the ones in head quarter waves and quartering sea take second place and third place respectively the figures of hbm in fig 15 trend very similar to those described above the ratios of high frequency load component to total vbm and hbm in head waves are 58 73 and 51 95 respectively the ratio of high frequency load component in beam seas is the lowest which is 17 17 and 12 19 because the nonlinear high frequency slamming loads are not pronounced while the ratio of low frequency load component in beam seas is the greatest moreover the ratio of high frequency load component of vbm is larger than that of hbm while the high frequency load component of hbm shows a larger result compared to vbm in quartering sea in addition the container ship has a significant flare at its bow taking the vbm as an example for the wave direction of 0 the ratio of high frequency load component at the bow 40 09 is stronger than at the stern part 30 25 of the hull because of severe slamming loads therefore enough attention must be given to the influence of high frequency oscillation responses on strength of ships in head waves and head quarter waves 5 conclusions and recommendations the 3 d rankine source method is generalised to the elastic modes and a nonlinear time domain hydroelastic method considering the rudder force is proposed from the analysis of this work a framework of nonlinear hydroelastic numerical methods in regular oblique waves is established 1 as for the difference method for source strength a damping correction factor is proposed to eliminate the errors the results indicated that the velocity potential obtained by this method is stable and convergent and the calculation damping coefficient α should select possible small value 2 this study eliminates the numerical divergence of ship horizontal motion in time domain by adopting pid autopilot model and the hydroelastic responses in oblique waves are predicted from the comparison with segmented model experimental results of a 13000 teu container ship it is confirmed that the method presented in this paper is reliable and accurate 3 in beam sea and quartering sea the nonlinearity of restoring force is dominant the high frequency load component is more sensitive to wave direction and ship high frequency oscillation must be taken into consideration in head waves and head quarter waves because of slamming force 4 it is worth noting that the numerical model in this paper is aimed at vertical and horizontal hydroelastic responses in oblique seas and torsion is not included in this study which will be one of the important research directions in the future

22624,for the motion prediction of a trimaran the hydrodynamic interference between main hull and outriggers is a significant factor and need to be taken into consideration the high speed slender body potential flow theory 2 5d method is a high efficient method to predict the seakeeping performance of ships in waves and has been validated for mono hull ships in this paper the 2 5d method has been applied to predict the vertical motion heave and pitch and added resistance of a trimaran in head sea waves in addition a trimaran model test was carried out to analyses the relationship between the travelling speed outrigger layout incident waves and heave pitch amplitude added resistance of a trimaran the experimental results are also compared with the numerical results in order to verify the 2 5d method in the application of trimaran motion and added resistance prediction the comparison results have shown that between fn 0 353 and 0 471 the 2 5d method can give out accurate prediction results of vertical motion and added resistance of a trimaran meanwhile the calculation efficiency is high enough which makes it applicable to massive computations keywords trimaran 2 5d method seakeeping added resistance model test 1 introduction trimarans being high performance ships have been widely applied in marine engineering in recent years as its unique configuration trimarans have better rolling stability and lower wave resistance in some froude numbers ranges also the passenger accelerations of trimarans are usually smaller than that of catamarans in head sea waves davis and holloway 2007 lavroff and davis 2015 the theoretical prediction and the model test study of high speed trimarans are the key technology of development and design of multi hull ships the theory used in predicting the seakeeping performance of trimarans mainly include linear strip theory high speed slender body theory based on the assumption of flow field around two dimensional hull and three dimensional free surface condition also known as the 2d t theory or 2 5d theory rankine source method three dimensional frequency domain and time domain green function method and cfd method where the viscous effect and nonlinear hydrodynamic factors can be taken into consideration in the aspects of the trimaran seakeeping performance as early as 2001 francescutto et al francescutto 2001 studied the numerical model for the roll motion of the trimaran the main hull and outriggers are wigley type and verified it by model tests however although the calculation process is simple it is not precise enough as the wave excitation force on outriggers has been neglected in the numerical model bingham et al 2001 calculated the wave loads and motions of a trimaran in regular waves using three dimensional pulsating source potential flow method three dimensional translating pulsating source potential flow method and the coupled hydroelastic theory respectively the results showed that the three dimensional translating pulsating source potential flow method is more suitable for calculating the trimaran seakeeping performance fang et al fang and chen 2005 also adopt three dimensional source distribution method to solve the hydrodynamic coefficients of a trimaran and optimized the outrigger layout of a trimaran in 2007 hebblewhite et al 2007 carried out the research on the seakeeping performance of a trimaran by adopting strip theory multi hull ship strip theory and model tests they studied the effects of travelling speed and outrigger layout on the amplitude of vertical motion of a trimaran after this engle et al engle and lin 2007 made it suitable for trimaran seakeeping calculation by improving two empirical half empirical methods the comparison with model test results shows that this method can meet the design requirements during 2001 2012 duan et al wei et al 2007 duan et al 2001 and ma et al ma 2005 ma et al 2012 extended the 2 5d theory and developed a method of predicting the motion of trimarans in regular waves they calculated the vertical motion of a trimaran with forward speed and the results were compared with the strip method and model test results they showed that satisfactory results can be obtained for predicting the swaying motion of a trimaran in regular waves however compared with viscous cfd calculation its efficiency and accuracy are not verified especially this method has not been verified for the motion calculation of trimaran under different outrigger layout to sum up the research on the trimaran seakeeping numerical prediction can be mainly divided into three categories 1 two dimensional method such as strip theory although these kinds of methods have a simple calculation process and higher calculation efficiency the calculation precision is usually lower and hard to account for the hydrodynamic interference between main hull and outriggers 2 three dimensional method such as three dimensional pulsating source potential flow method three dimensional rankine source method or even cfd method in which the viscous effects can be accounted for these kinds of methods have advantage in calculation precision but its calculation efficiency is usually low especially cfd method usually requires supercomputers to perform large scale calculations 3 2 5d method also named 2d t method the computational process of this method is relatively simple which leads to high computational efficiency meanwhile it can account for the hydrodynamic interference between main hull and outriggers thus satisfactory calculation results can be obtained in terms of the above in this paper the 2 5d method is introduced first and the calculating process of the 2 5d method in the application of high speed trimaran motion prediction is clarified in details second the trimaran seakeeping model test is introduced the experimental study was carried out for the trimaran sailing in regular waves with different forward speeds and different outrigger layouts the numerical prediction of a trimaran was carried out based on the 2 5d method according to the experimental conditions by comparing the numerical results with the experimental results the 2 5d method has been verified in the application of trimaran swaying motion and added resistance prediction 2 motion and added resistance prediction of high speed trimaran by applying 2 5d theory high speed slender body potential flow theory is also named two dimensional and a half potential flow theory 2d t theory or 2 5d theory this method considers the free surface condition with forward speed and retains the assumption of two dimensional flow field according to the geometry characteristics of slender body it was first used by faltinsen and zhao faltinsen and umeda 1991 for the theoretical prediction of ships seakeeping performance and has been widely applied during 1990s apparently compared with the traditional two dimensional stf method 2 5d method can not only calculate high speed vessels but also retain the two dimensional assumption to make the calculation process simpler although compared with three dimensional methods 2 5d method still has a gap in computational accuracy the computational efficiency is far superior to that of the three dimensional methods sun and faltinsen 2012 assume that a ship moves in a fixed direction at speed u in small amplitude regular waves in deep water as a result of the wave force action the ship will have six degrees of freedom of swaying motion it is assumed that the ship is subjected to the excitation of incident wave for a long time and then makes a simple harmonic oscillation motion with small amplitude now we apply the linear frequency domain potential flow theory to discuss the problem of the ship s force and oscillation according to the geometry characteristics of slender hull and the characteristics of wave making of high speed vessels by applying 2 5d theory we can obtain the definite problem of the unsteady flow potential around the hull φ j j 2 7 under ship following translational coordinate system o x y z as follow 1 2 φ j y 2 2 φ j z 2 0 i ω e u x 2 g z φ j 0 z 0 φ

transverse section boundary point to the inner side of the transverse section and satisfies n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 n 6 n 2 n 3 y n 3 z n 2 x n 3 x n 2 m j comes from the influence of steady and unsteady potential it involves the second order differential of steady wave making disturbance potential ignoring the steady wave making potential φ s in calm water m j j 2 6 can be represented as 2 m 2 m 3 m 4 0 m 5 n 3 m 6 n 2 the definite problem 1 assumes the unsteady wave making in front of the ship bow is zero meanwhile the three dimensional free surface condition with forward speed has been retained which reflects the propagation characteristics of ship unsteady wave making in the ship length direction at a higher speed since the flow field solution is two dimensional and the free surface condition is three dimensional it is called 2 5d method in order to solve this problem the following transformation equations are introduced 3 t x x 0 x u ψ j t y z φ j t y z e i ω e t x hence the definite problem of φ j has been transformed to the definite problem of ψ j t y z 4 2 ψ j x 2 2 ψ j z 2 0 2 ψ j t 2 g ψ j z 0 z 0 ψ j n i ω e n j u m j e i ω e t j 2 6 φ 0 n e i ω e t j 7 ψ j ψ j t 0

bow position the free surface condition satisfied by ψ j t y z corresponds to the time domain linear free surface condition satisfied by a two dimensional cylinder oscillating at zero forward speed when the flow field potential is solved step by step with time moves on the flow field solution of each section will be obtained step by step too duan et al duan and he 2001 proposed to solve ψ j t y z and spatial derivative inside the transverse section by constructing distributed source boundary integral equation with two dimensional time domain green function this enhances the efficiency and stability of the 2 5d method for solving hydrodynamic problems of high speed vessels by means of using green formula the distributed source boundary integral equation for solving flow field potential

equations 5 and 6 one can refer to reference duan 1995 it should be noted that when the above solution method is applied for the hydrodynamic prediction of the trimaran in waves the hull transverses section s b t x in boundary integral equations 5 and 6 will includes main hull section and its corresponding outriggers section at the same longitudinal position meanwhile the time integral about source strength σ q τ in these two equations reflects the influence of the disturbed flow field generated by upstream hull section s b τ on the disturbed flow field in current moment t as described above in this paper in solving the radiation and diffraction potential of the flow field three dimensional linear free surface conditions with forward speed are used hence the three dimensional effect of the free surface wave making is considered in the numerical solution process the velocity potential is solved from the bow section to the stern section step by step during this process the hydrodynamic interference effect from the ship sections in front of the concerned section at a certain longitudinal position is considered as shown in fig 1 we use s l i to represent the i t h section of the left outrigger use s r i to represent the i t h section of the left outrigger and use m i to represent the i t h section of the main hull when solving section for example s l 1 the hydrodynamic interference of sections m 1 m 2 m n in front of s l 1 in longitudinal direction on s l 1 are considered at the same time that is the time integral of the source strength in equation 6 considers the influence of the disturbed flow field generated by the hull transverse section upstream of a certain longitudinal position on the disturbed flow field at the current moment in this way the hydrodynamic interference effects between the main hull and outriggers in the same longitudinal position is well reflected the feasibility of this method to solve the trimaran motion prediction problem has been verified in wei s work wei and thesisharbin 2007 after obtaining the diffraction potential ψ j t y z the radiation and diffraction hydrodynamic load of ship hull can be derived by integrating the linear hydrodynamic pressure on the mean wetted hull surface according to the bernoulli s equation meanwhile considering hydrostatic and resorting force on the ship hull five degrees

matrix c is the hydrostatic restoring force matrix f i f d represents the column vector of wave exciting force when the roll motion of a trimaran is predicted in the oblique waves the viscous rolling damping moment from main hull outriggers and bilge keel has a significant effect on the motion at the rolling resonance and need to be considered in this paper the viscous rolling damping of hydrodynamic moment has been taken into account by the method introduced in reference ma et al 2012 after obtaining accurate trimaran motion prediction results the calculation of added resistance can be carried out in this paper the problem of trimaran added resistance calculation is only performed in the case of regular waves first according to the linear potential flow theory the velocity potential of the flow field around the trimaran can be expressed as 9 φ φ i φ b in the frequency domain analysis we have 10 φ i re φ i e i w t 11 φ b re φ b e i w t 12 φ i i g a ω 0 e k 0 z e i k 0 x cos β y sin β 13 φ b j 1 6 η j φ j φ d where φ i is the velocity potential of regular waves φ d is the diffraction potential φ j j 1 2 6 is the unit radiation potential the steady drift force on a ship in waves can be expressed as a first order potential 14 f m ρ 2 s b φ n φ φ φ n d s m the velocity potential can be divided into the incident potential φ i and the disturbance potential φ b it can be concluded that the added resistance of the ship sailing in waves can be expressed as five parts as follow 15 δ r f 3 1 f 5 1 f 3 2 f 5 2 f 3 16 f 3 1 re 1 2 ρ k 0 η 3 l d x s i ω 0 n 3 φ i d l

transverse section φ 3 φ 5 is the unit radiation potential of heave and pitch respectively φ d is the diffraction potential it should be noted that the position of the outriggers must be taken into consideration during the process of integrating this is because for a trimaran the computed transverse section may include outriggers as shown in fig 2 if the calculated transverse section is s j the integral is only performed on the main hull if the calculated transverse section is s i the integral is performed on both main hull and outriggers 3 introduction of trimaran seakeeping model test in order to validate the application of the 2 5d method in trimaran seakeeping prediction the model test of the seakeeping performance of a trimaran under different speed and outrigger layout is carried out in this paper the experiments were conducted at harbin engineering university towing tank which is 108 m in length 7 m in width and 3 5 m in depth there is a wave maker and wave dissipation bank at both ends of the tank the wave maker can generate regular waves with period of 0 4s 4s and maximum wave height of 0 4 m the maximum speed of the trailer over the tank is 6 5 m s a large motions recorder is equipped on the trailer which has the capability of measuring the motion of ship model with four degrees of freedom surge 0 4 m roll 50 pitch 15 heave 0 2 m and the test precision is 0 1 fig 3 shows the test model used in the experiment the scale ratio is 1 25 and the offset lines of the main hull and outriggers are shown in fig 4 the definition of longitudinal distance a and transverse distance p of outriggers are shown in fig 5 and main characteristics of the test model are provided in table 1 below in order to consider the influence of different outrigger layout on hydrodynamic disturbance 4 different outrigger layouts were designed in the test 2 different longitudinal layouts and 2 different transverse layouts the dimensionless transverse distance between the outrigger and the main hull center line is represented by p l for two different transverse layout p l 0 096 and 0 15 respectively the dimensionless longitudinal distance between the outrigger and the main hull stern is represented by a l for two different longitudinal layout p l 0 0 and 0 26 respectively where a l 0 0 represents the stern of the main hull and outriggers are flush for incident waves in order to investigate the application of 2 5d method in different sea state 10 different regular waves were selected in the experiment with the serial number from w1 to w10 and the wave height from 0 03 m to 0 1 m the detailed parameters of incident waves are shown in table 2 4 comparison and analysis of numerical results and model test results of trimaran motion and added resistance in order to facilitate data analysis the vertical swaying motions including heave and pitch motions are treated dimensionless in this paper here we note η 3 ζ a is the response amplitude operator of heave motion heave rao where η 3 is the heave amplitude and ζ a is the wave amplitude note η 5 k ζ a is the response amplitude operator of pitch motion pitch rao where η 5 is the pitch amplitude and k is the incident wave number k 2 π λ in terms of added resistance we use the following method to its dimensionless treatment 21 r a l r a ρ g a 2 b 2 where r a is the added resistance a is the regular wave height b is the beam at waterline of main hull 4 1 results of trimaran swaying motion prediction the comparisons of numerical and model test results are shown in the figures below figss 6 9 correspond to the comparison of heave and pitch rao curve of numerical and model test results under different speed to ensure the reliability of the experimental results the repeatability tests were carried out for some test conditions and the error bars have been marked in the figures below from figs 6 9 the prediction precision of the 2 5d method agrees well with the experimental results for conditions of any outrigger layout and any speed the average error root mean squared error of numerical results can be controlled within 7 88 compared with the experimental results however due to the reason of slamming and green water have been observed in the experiment it is difficult to give accurate results by using the 2 5d method which is based on linear theory in this paper nevertheless for any case the numerical results are still in good agreement with the experimental results in addition we can find from the data above the numerical prediction is consistent compared with the experimental results the numerical results based on the 2 5d method are usually larger than experimental results of heave motion and smaller than experimental results of pitch motion since different speed and outrigger layouts were designed in the model test therefor the influence of travelling speed and outrigger layout on seakeeping performance is discussed in this paper first for heave motion when outriggers are placed at the stern of the main hull i e a l 0 0 for fn 0 353 the heave rao will increase with the wavelength to ship length ratio for fn 0 471 the heave rao increases first and then decreases with the wavelength to ship length ratio in addition by comparing fig 6 a c and fig 7 a c we can find that for fn 0 471 and fn 0 353 condition the selection of outrigger transverse distance has little influence on the position of the peak value of heave motion in the case of outriggers placed at midship of the main hull i e a l 0 26 for both fn 0 353 and 0 471 conditions the heave rao increases first and then decreases with the wavelength to ship length ratio by comparing a and c in figs 6 and 7 for both fn 0 471 and fn 0 628 conditions the selection of outrigger transverse distance also has little influence on the position of the peak value of heave motion for pitch motion when outriggers are placed at the stern of the main hull i e a l 0 0 the variation of the pitch rao is similar to the heave rao i e for fn 0 353 the pitch rao will increase with the wavelength to ship length ratio and for fn 0 471 the pitch rao increases first and then decreases with the wavelength to ship length ratio for most conditions except for fig 6 b the wave length to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of pitch rao usually distribute between 1 2 and 1 6 in addition by comparing fig 8 b d and fig 9 b d we can also find that for fn 0 353 the selection of outrigger transverse distance has a little influence on the position of the peak value of pitch rao while for fn 0 471 condition the influence of the selection of outrigger transverse distance on the position of the peak value of pitch motion cannot be neglected in the case of outriggers placed at midship of the main hull i e a l 0 26 for both fn 0 353 and fn 0 471 conditions the selection of outrigger transverse distance has little influence on the position of the peak value of pitch rao in addition with the travelling speed increases the wave length to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of pitch rao also tends to increase in order to further validate the 2 5d method in motion prediction of the trimaran the results of heave and pitch rao obtained by 2 5d method and cfd method chen et al 2016 are also compared in this paper the detailed data of the model can be found in reference jia et al 2009 the compared results are nondimensionalized the dimensionless method is the same with the above and shown in fig 8 the experimental results are also included the main characteristics of the trimaran model are listed in table 3 below it can be revealed from fig 10 the results of trimaran heave and pitch rao predicted by the 2 5d method are in good agreement with the experimental and cfd prediction results in general the prediction error of the 2 5d method is within the acceptable range under any wave length to ship length ratio compared with the experimental results the average error is within 9 in terms of the calculation efficiency it only takes 15mins to obtain these sets of results for the 2 5d motion prediction program while for the cfd software it will takes more than 15 h according to number of cells time step etc to sum up the numerical prediction based on the 2 5d method is consistent with the experimental results and the numerical consistency is high the precision of motion prediction for high speed conditions fn 0 471 is higher than that of medium high speed conditions fn 0 353 except for some working conditions error caused by slamming and green water in the aspect of calculation efficiency for a fixed working condition fixed speed incident wave and outrigger layout the prediction of heave and pitch rao can be realized by a personal computer 4 intel r core tm i5 cpu 4 00 gb ram by means of using the 2 5d method and the calculation took 1min28s when using the cfd method to predict heave and pitch rao a high performance calculation device is needed and the time consuming is large about 12 h which makes it difficult to apply to massive computations due to the high efficiency of the 2 5d method it can be applied to the optimal design of high speed trimarans especially for the outrigger layout optimization wang et al 2018 4 2 results of trimaran added resistance prediction on the basis of obtaining accurate motion prediction of the trimaran the calculation of trimaran added resistance can be carried out the comparison of numerical and model test results is shown in the figures below figss 11 14 show the comparison between the numerical calculation and model test results of dimensionless added resistance of the trimaran it can be seen from the results that the calculation of added resistance is basically in good agreement with the test results the average error of each group of results is distributed around 5 15 although the numerical prediction results in some individual conditions are far from the test results the overall results show that the numerical prediction results can accurately reflect the variation tendency of added resistance curve it can be seen from figss 11 14 for any kind of outrigger layout the added resistance increases first and then decreases with respect to the wavelength to ship length ratio for the condition of fn 0 353 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of added resistance is generally concentrated in the range of λ l 1 05 1 15 for the condition of fn 0 471 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of added resistance is generally concentrated in the range of λ l 1 1 1 4 in addition for the condition of a l 0 0 and fn 0 471 the phenomenon of added resistance decreases slightly in the range of λ l 0 4 0 8 is found in both numerical prediction and the experimental results in terms of the effect of outrigger layout on added resistance it can be inferred by comparing four figures above for fn 0 353 both transverse and longitudinal distance of outriggers has little influence on the peak value of trimaran added resistance for fn 0 471 the effect of longitudinal distances of outriggers on trimaran added resistance is relatively obvious in general the numerical prediction results under most conditions are lower than the test results this may because of the phenomenon of slamming accompanied by green water which has been observed during the process of the experiment 5 concluding remarks in this paper the 2 5d method is applied to the motion prediction and added resistance calculation of the high speed trimaran sailing in head sea regular waves in order to verify the 2 5d method model tests were carried out and the numerical prediction results were compared with the experimental results it is revealed from the data comparison the error of 2 5d method root mean squared error can be controlled within 7 88 in motion prediction and around 5 15 in added resistance calculation compared with the experimental results this shows that the 2 5d trimaran motion prediction numerical method applied in this paper can predict the heave pitch motion and added resistance of a trimaran with the froude number between 0 353 and 0 471 accurately in addition a variety of working conditions i e different outrigger layouts and travelling speeds were changed in the experiment to verify the reliability of the 2 5d method in terms of the trimaran motion the following conclusions can be obtained by comparing the experimental results with the numerical results 1 for the condition of outriggers placed at the stern of the main hull when fn 0 353 the vertical motion of the trimaran will increase with the wavelength to ship length ratio when fn 0 471 the wider the outrigger layout the smaller the wave length to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of the heave motion and the larger the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of the pitch motion 2 for the condition of outriggers placed at the midship of the main hull the trimaran vertical motion will increase first and then decrease with the wavelength to ship length ratio the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of heave motion usually distribute between 0 9 and 1 1 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of pitch motion usually concentrated around 1 5 in terms of the added resistance the following conclusions can be obtained by comparing the experimental results with the numerical results 1 when λ 0 8 the added resistance will increase first and then decrease with the wavelength to ship length ratio for all outrigger layouts 2 for fn 0 353 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of added resistance usually concentrate around 1 05 for fn 0 471 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of added resistance usually concentrate around 1 25 3 the trimaran added resistance is less sensitive to the outrigger layout than to the travelling speed acknowledgement this work was funded by the national natural science foundation of china projects of

22624,for the motion prediction of a trimaran the hydrodynamic interference between main hull and outriggers is a significant factor and need to be taken into consideration the high speed slender body potential flow theory 2 5d method is a high efficient method to predict the seakeeping performance of ships in waves and has been validated for mono hull ships in this paper the 2 5d method has been applied to predict the vertical motion heave and pitch and added resistance of a trimaran in head sea waves in addition a trimaran model test was carried out to analyses the relationship between the travelling speed outrigger layout incident waves and heave pitch amplitude added resistance of a trimaran the experimental results are also compared with the numerical results in order to verify the 2 5d method in the application of trimaran motion and added resistance prediction the comparison results have shown that between fn 0 353 and 0 471 the 2 5d method can give out accurate prediction results of vertical motion and added resistance of a trimaran meanwhile the calculation efficiency is high enough which makes it applicable to massive computations keywords trimaran 2 5d method seakeeping added resistance model test 1 introduction trimarans being high performance ships have been widely applied in marine engineering in recent years as its unique configuration trimarans have better rolling stability and lower wave resistance in some froude numbers ranges also the passenger accelerations of trimarans are usually smaller than that of catamarans in head sea waves davis and holloway 2007 lavroff and davis 2015 the theoretical prediction and the model test study of high speed trimarans are the key technology of development and design of multi hull ships the theory used in predicting the seakeeping performance of trimarans mainly include linear strip theory high speed slender body theory based on the assumption of flow field around two dimensional hull and three dimensional free surface condition also known as the 2d t theory or 2 5d theory rankine source method three dimensional frequency domain and time domain green function method and cfd method where the viscous effect and nonlinear hydrodynamic factors can be taken into consideration in the aspects of the trimaran seakeeping performance as early as 2001 francescutto et al francescutto 2001 studied the numerical model for the roll motion of the trimaran the main hull and outriggers are wigley type and verified it by model tests however although the calculation process is simple it is not precise enough as the wave excitation force on outriggers has been neglected in the numerical model bingham et al 2001 calculated the wave loads and motions of a trimaran in regular waves using three dimensional pulsating source potential flow method three dimensional translating pulsating source potential flow method and the coupled hydroelastic theory respectively the results showed that the three dimensional translating pulsating source potential flow method is more suitable for calculating the trimaran seakeeping performance fang et al fang and chen 2005 also adopt three dimensional source distribution method to solve the hydrodynamic coefficients of a trimaran and optimized the outrigger layout of a trimaran in 2007 hebblewhite et al 2007 carried out the research on the seakeeping performance of a trimaran by adopting strip theory multi hull ship strip theory and model tests they studied the effects of travelling speed and outrigger layout on the amplitude of vertical motion of a trimaran after this engle et al engle and lin 2007 made it suitable for trimaran seakeeping calculation by improving two empirical half empirical methods the comparison with model test results shows that this method can meet the design requirements during 2001 2012 duan et al wei et al 2007 duan et al 2001 and ma et al ma 2005 ma et al 2012 extended the 2 5d theory and developed a method of predicting the motion of trimarans in regular waves they calculated the vertical motion of a trimaran with forward speed and the results were compared with the strip method and model test results they showed that satisfactory results can be obtained for predicting the swaying motion of a trimaran in regular waves however compared with viscous cfd calculation its efficiency and accuracy are not verified especially this method has not been verified for the motion calculation of trimaran under different outrigger layout to sum up the research on the trimaran seakeeping numerical prediction can be mainly divided into three categories 1 two dimensional method such as strip theory although these kinds of methods have a simple calculation process and higher calculation efficiency the calculation precision is usually lower and hard to account for the hydrodynamic interference between main hull and outriggers 2 three dimensional method such as three dimensional pulsating source potential flow method three dimensional rankine source method or even cfd method in which the viscous effects can be accounted for these kinds of methods have advantage in calculation precision but its calculation efficiency is usually low especially cfd method usually requires supercomputers to perform large scale calculations 3 2 5d method also named 2d t method the computational process of this method is relatively simple which leads to high computational efficiency meanwhile it can account for the hydrodynamic interference between main hull and outriggers thus satisfactory calculation results can be obtained in terms of the above in this paper the 2 5d method is introduced first and the calculating process of the 2 5d method in the application of high speed trimaran motion prediction is clarified in details second the trimaran seakeeping model test is introduced the experimental study was carried out for the trimaran sailing in regular waves with different forward speeds and different outrigger layouts the numerical prediction of a trimaran was carried out based on the 2 5d method according to the experimental conditions by comparing the numerical results with the experimental results the 2 5d method has been verified in the application of trimaran swaying motion and added resistance prediction 2 motion and added resistance prediction of high speed trimaran by applying 2 5d theory high speed slender body potential flow theory is also named two dimensional and a half potential flow theory 2d t theory or 2 5d theory this method considers the free surface condition with forward speed and retains the assumption of two dimensional flow field according to the geometry characteristics of slender body it was first used by faltinsen and zhao faltinsen and umeda 1991 for the theoretical prediction of ships seakeeping performance and has been widely applied during 1990s apparently compared with the traditional two dimensional stf method 2 5d method can not only calculate high speed vessels but also retain the two dimensional assumption to make the calculation process simpler although compared with three dimensional methods 2 5d method still has a gap in computational accuracy the computational efficiency is far superior to that of the three dimensional methods sun and faltinsen 2012 assume that a ship moves in a fixed direction at speed u in small amplitude regular waves in deep water as a result of the wave force action the ship will have six degrees of freedom of swaying motion it is assumed that the ship is subjected to the excitation of incident wave for a long time and then makes a simple harmonic oscillation motion with small amplitude now we apply the linear frequency domain potential flow theory to discuss the problem of the ship s force and oscillation according to the geometry characteristics of slender hull and the characteristics of wave making of high speed vessels by applying 2 5d theory we can obtain the definite problem of the unsteady flow potential around the hull φ j j 2 7 under ship following translational coordinate system o x y z as follow 1 2 φ j y 2 2 φ j z 2 0 i ω e u x 2 g z φ j 0 z 0 φ

transverse section boundary point to the inner side of the transverse section and satisfies n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 n 6 n 2 n 3 y n 3 z n 2 x n 3 x n 2 m j comes from the influence of steady and unsteady potential it involves the second order differential of steady wave making disturbance potential ignoring the steady wave making potential φ s in calm water m j j 2 6 can be represented as 2 m 2 m 3 m 4 0 m 5 n 3 m 6 n 2 the definite problem 1 assumes the unsteady wave making in front of the ship bow is zero meanwhile the three dimensional free surface condition with forward speed has been retained which reflects the propagation characteristics of ship unsteady wave making in the ship length direction at a higher speed since the flow field solution is two dimensional and the free surface condition is three dimensional it is called 2 5d method in order to solve this problem the following transformation equations are introduced 3 t x x 0 x u ψ j t y z φ j t y z e i ω e t x hence the definite problem of φ j has been transformed to the definite problem of ψ j t y z 4 2 ψ j x 2 2 ψ j z 2 0 2 ψ j t 2 g ψ j z 0 z 0 ψ j n i ω e n j u m j e i ω e t j 2 6 φ 0 n e i ω e t j 7 ψ j ψ j t 0 t 0 the definite problem 4 can be understood as two dimensional time domain body surface nonlinear problem the initial condition of the flow field corresponds to the boundary condition of the vessel s bow position the free surface condition satisfied by ψ j t y z corresponds to the time domain linear free surface condition satisfied by a two dimensional cylinder oscillating at zero forward speed when the flow field potential is solved step by step with time moves on the flow field solution of each section will be obtained step by step too duan et al duan and he 2001 proposed to solve ψ j t y z and spatial derivative inside the transverse section by constructing distributed source boundary integral equation with two dimensional time domain green function this enhances the efficiency and stability of the 2 5d method for solving hydrodynamic problems of high speed vessels by means of using green formula the distributed source boundary integral equation for solving flow field potential ψ j t y z can be established 5 2 π ψ j p t s b t d s q 0 t σ q t ln r p q r p q d τ s b τ σ q τ g d s q 1 g 0 t σ g n y a τ 2 d τ a b where g is the memory term of two dimensional time domain green

mirror point of the source point on the mean calm water surface σ q t and σ q τ are the strength of the source distributed on sections at the current time moment and previous time moment respectively a and b represent the transverse coordinates of the cross section at the intersections of the water lines is the difference between two corresponding terms using body surface condition satisfied by ψ

where n m is the number of sources on main hull and n s is the number of sources on each outrigger σ j m and σ j m represent the source strength of the i t h element at moment t and τ respectively σ a m and σ b m represent the source strength of the element at the junction of body surface and free surface at moment τ after solving the boundary integral equation 6 numerically and obtaining source strength σ p t the flow field velocity potential ψ j t y z including hull transverse sections s b t in current moment can be derived by equation 5 in terms of the derivation and numerical solution of equations 5 and 6 one can refer to reference duan 1995 it should be noted that when the above solution method is applied for the hydrodynamic prediction of the trimaran in waves the hull transverses section s b t x in boundary integral equations 5 and 6 will includes main hull section and its corresponding outriggers section at the same longitudinal position meanwhile the time integral about source strength σ q τ in these two equations reflects the influence of the disturbed flow field generated by upstream hull section s b τ on the disturbed flow field in current moment t as described above in this paper in solving the radiation and diffraction potential of the flow field three dimensional linear free surface conditions with forward speed are used hence the three dimensional effect of the free surface wave making is considered in the numerical solution process the velocity potential is solved from the bow section to the stern section step by step during this process the hydrodynamic interference effect from the ship sections in front of the concerned section at a certain longitudinal position is considered as shown in fig 1 we use s l i to represent the i t h section of the left outrigger use s r i to represent the i t h section of the left outrigger and use m i to represent the i t h section of the main hull when solving section for example s l 1 the hydrodynamic interference of sections m 1 m 2 m n in front of s l 1 in longitudinal direction on s l 1 are considered at the same time that is the time integral of the source strength in equation 6 considers the influence of the disturbed flow field generated by the hull transverse section upstream of a certain longitudinal position on the disturbed flow field at the current moment in this way the hydrodynamic interference effects between the main hull and outriggers in the same longitudinal position is well reflected the feasibility of this method to solve the trimaran motion prediction problem has been verified in wei s work wei and thesisharbin 2007 after obtaining the diffraction potential ψ j t y z the radiation and diffraction hydrodynamic load of ship hull can be derived by integrating the linear hydrodynamic pressure on the mean wetted hull surface according to the bernoulli s equation meanwhile considering hydrostatic and resorting force on the ship hull five degrees

matrix c is the hydrostatic restoring force matrix f i f d represents the column vector of wave exciting force when the roll motion of a trimaran is predicted in the oblique waves the viscous rolling damping moment from main hull outriggers and bilge keel has a significant effect on the motion at the rolling resonance and need to be considered in this paper the viscous rolling damping of hydrodynamic moment has been taken into account by the method introduced in reference ma et al 2012 after obtaining accurate trimaran motion prediction results the calculation of added resistance can be carried out in this paper the problem of trimaran added resistance calculation is only performed in the case of regular waves first according to the linear potential flow theory the velocity potential of the flow field around the trimaran can be expressed as 9 φ φ i φ b in the frequency domain analysis we have 10 φ i re φ i e i w t 11 φ b re φ b e i w t 12 φ i i g a ω 0 e k 0 z e i k 0 x

can be concluded that the added resistance of the ship sailing in waves can be expressed as five parts as follow 15 δ r f 3 1 f 5 1 f 3 2 f 5 2 f 3 16 f 3 1 re 1 2 ρ k 0 η 3 l d x s i ω 0 n 3 φ i d l

transverse section φ 3 φ 5 is the unit radiation potential of heave and pitch respectively φ d is the diffraction potential it should be noted that the position of the outriggers must be taken into consideration during the process of integrating this is because for a trimaran the computed transverse section may include outriggers as shown in fig 2 if the calculated transverse section is s j the integral is only performed on the main hull if the calculated transverse section is s i the integral is performed on both main hull and outriggers 3 introduction of trimaran seakeeping model test in order to validate the application of the 2 5d method in trimaran seakeeping prediction the model test of the seakeeping performance of a trimaran under different speed and outrigger layout is carried out in this paper the experiments were conducted at harbin engineering university towing tank which is 108 m in length 7 m in width and 3 5 m in depth there is a wave maker and wave dissipation bank at both ends of the tank the wave maker can generate regular waves with period of 0 4s 4s and maximum wave height of 0 4 m the maximum speed of the trailer over the tank is 6 5 m s a large motions recorder is equipped on the trailer which has the capability of measuring the motion of ship model with four degrees of freedom surge 0 4 m roll 50 pitch 15 heave 0 2 m and the test precision is 0 1 fig 3 shows the test model used in the experiment the scale ratio is 1 25 and the offset lines of the main hull and outriggers are shown in fig 4 the definition of longitudinal distance a and transverse distance p of outriggers are shown in fig 5 and main characteristics of the test model are provided in table 1 below in order to consider the influence of different outrigger layout on hydrodynamic disturbance 4 different outrigger layouts were designed in the test 2 different longitudinal layouts and 2 different transverse layouts the dimensionless transverse distance between the outrigger and the main hull center line is represented by p l for two different transverse layout p l 0 096 and 0 15 respectively the dimensionless longitudinal distance between the outrigger and the main hull stern is represented by a l for two different longitudinal layout p l 0 0 and 0 26 respectively where a l 0 0 represents the stern of the main hull and outriggers are flush for incident waves in order to investigate the application of 2 5d method in different sea state 10 different regular waves were selected in the experiment with the serial number from w1 to w10 and the wave height from 0 03 m to 0 1 m the detailed parameters of incident waves are shown in table 2 4 comparison and analysis of numerical results and model test results of trimaran motion and added resistance in order to facilitate data analysis the vertical swaying motions including heave and pitch motions are treated dimensionless in this paper here we note η 3 ζ a is the response amplitude operator of heave motion heave rao where η 3 is the heave amplitude and ζ a is the wave amplitude note η 5 k ζ a is the response amplitude operator of pitch motion pitch rao where η 5 is the pitch amplitude and k is the incident wave number k 2 π λ in terms of added resistance we use the following method to its dimensionless treatment 21 r a l r a ρ g a 2 b 2 where r a is the added resistance a is the regular wave height b is the beam at waterline of main hull 4 1 results of trimaran swaying motion prediction the comparisons of numerical and model test results are shown in the figures below figss 6 9 correspond to the comparison of heave and pitch rao curve of numerical and model test results under different speed to ensure the reliability of the experimental results the repeatability tests were carried out for some test conditions and the error bars have been marked in the figures below from figs 6 9 the prediction precision of the 2 5d method agrees well with the experimental results for conditions of any outrigger layout and any speed the average error root mean squared error of numerical results can be controlled within 7 88 compared with the experimental results however due to the reason of slamming and green water have been observed in the experiment it is difficult to give accurate results by using the 2 5d method which is based on linear theory in this paper nevertheless for any case the numerical results are still in good agreement with the experimental results in addition we can find from the data above the numerical prediction is consistent compared with the experimental results the numerical results based on the 2 5d method are usually larger than experimental results of heave motion and smaller than experimental results of pitch motion since different speed and outrigger layouts were designed in the model test therefor the influence of travelling speed and outrigger layout on seakeeping performance is discussed in this paper first for heave motion when outriggers are placed at the stern of the main hull i e a l 0 0 for fn 0 353 the heave rao will increase with the wavelength to ship length ratio for fn 0 471 the heave rao increases first and then decreases with the wavelength to ship length ratio in addition by comparing fig 6 a c and fig 7 a c we can find that for fn 0 471 and fn 0 353 condition the selection of outrigger transverse distance has little influence on the position of the peak value of heave motion in the case of outriggers placed at midship of the main hull i e a l 0 26 for both fn 0 353 and 0 471 conditions the heave rao increases first and then decreases with the wavelength to ship length ratio by comparing a and c in figs 6 and 7 for both fn 0 471 and fn 0 628 conditions the selection of outrigger transverse distance also has little influence on the position of the peak value of heave motion for pitch motion when outriggers are placed at the stern of the main hull i e a l 0 0 the variation of the pitch rao is similar to the heave rao i e for fn 0 353 the pitch rao will increase with the wavelength to ship length ratio and for fn 0 471 the pitch rao increases first and then decreases with the wavelength to ship length ratio for most conditions except for fig 6 b the wave length to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of pitch rao usually distribute between 1 2 and 1 6 in addition by comparing fig 8 b d and fig 9 b d we can also find that for fn 0 353 the selection of outrigger transverse distance has a little influence on the position of the peak value of pitch rao while for fn 0 471 condition the influence of the selection of outrigger transverse distance on the position of the peak value of pitch motion cannot be neglected in the case of outriggers placed at midship of the main hull i e a l 0 26 for both fn 0 353 and fn 0 471 conditions the selection of outrigger transverse distance has little influence on the position of the peak value of pitch rao in addition with the travelling speed increases the wave length to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of pitch rao also tends to increase in order to further validate the 2 5d method in motion prediction of the trimaran the results of heave and pitch rao obtained by 2 5d method and cfd method chen et al 2016 are also compared in this paper the detailed data of the model can be found in reference jia et al 2009 the compared results are nondimensionalized the dimensionless method is the same with the above and shown in fig 8 the experimental results are also included the main characteristics of the trimaran model are listed in table 3 below it can be revealed from fig 10 the results of trimaran heave and pitch rao predicted by the 2 5d method are in good agreement with the experimental and cfd prediction results in general the prediction error of the 2 5d method is within the acceptable range under any wave length to ship length ratio compared with the experimental results the average error is within 9 in terms of the calculation efficiency it only takes 15mins to obtain these sets of results for the 2 5d motion prediction program while for the cfd software it will takes more than 15 h according to number of cells time step etc to sum up the numerical prediction based on the 2 5d method is consistent with the experimental results and the numerical consistency is high the precision of motion prediction for high speed conditions fn 0 471 is higher than that of medium high speed conditions fn 0 353 except for some working conditions error caused by slamming and green water in the aspect of calculation efficiency for a fixed working condition fixed speed incident wave and outrigger layout the prediction of heave and pitch rao can be realized by a personal computer 4 intel r core tm i5 cpu 4 00 gb ram by means of using the 2 5d method and the calculation took 1min28s when using the cfd method to predict heave and pitch rao a high performance calculation device is needed and the time consuming is large about 12 h which makes it difficult to apply to massive computations due to the high efficiency of the 2 5d method it can be applied to the optimal design of high speed trimarans especially for the outrigger layout optimization wang et al 2018 4 2 results of trimaran added resistance prediction on the basis of obtaining accurate motion prediction of the trimaran the calculation of trimaran added resistance can be carried out the comparison of numerical and model test results is shown in the figures below figss 11 14 show the comparison between the numerical calculation and model test results of dimensionless added resistance of the trimaran it can be seen from the results that the calculation of added resistance is basically in good agreement with the test results the average error of each group of results is distributed around 5 15 although the numerical prediction results in some individual conditions are far from the test results the overall results show that the numerical prediction results can accurately reflect the variation tendency of added resistance curve it can be seen from figss 11 14 for any kind of outrigger layout the added resistance increases first and then decreases with respect to the wavelength to ship length ratio for the condition of fn 0 353 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of added resistance is generally concentrated in the range of λ l 1 05 1 15 for the condition of fn 0 471 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of added resistance is generally concentrated in the range of λ l 1 1 1 4 in addition for the condition of a l 0 0 and fn 0 471 the phenomenon of added resistance decreases slightly in the range of λ l 0 4 0 8 is found in both numerical prediction and the experimental results in terms of the effect of outrigger layout on added resistance it can be inferred by comparing four figures above for fn 0 353 both transverse and longitudinal distance of outriggers has little influence on the peak value of trimaran added resistance for fn 0 471 the effect of longitudinal distances of outriggers on trimaran added resistance is relatively obvious in general the numerical prediction results under most conditions are lower than the test results this may because of the phenomenon of slamming accompanied by green water which has been observed during the process of the experiment 5 concluding remarks in this paper the 2 5d method is applied to the motion prediction and added resistance calculation of the high speed trimaran sailing in head sea regular waves in order to verify the 2 5d method model tests were carried out and the numerical prediction results were compared with the experimental results it is revealed from the data comparison the error of 2 5d method root mean squared error can be controlled within 7 88 in motion prediction and around 5 15 in added resistance calculation compared with the experimental results this shows that the 2 5d trimaran motion prediction numerical method applied in this paper can predict the heave pitch motion and added resistance of a trimaran with the froude number between 0 353 and 0 471 accurately in addition a variety of working conditions i e different outrigger layouts and travelling speeds were changed in the experiment to verify the reliability of the 2 5d method in terms of the trimaran motion the following conclusions can be obtained by comparing the experimental results with the numerical results 1 for the condition of outriggers placed at the stern of the main hull when fn 0 353 the vertical motion of the trimaran will increase with the wavelength to ship length ratio when fn 0 471 the wider the outrigger layout the smaller the wave length to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of the heave motion and the larger the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of the pitch motion 2 for the condition of outriggers placed at the midship of the main hull the trimaran vertical motion will increase first and then decrease with the wavelength to ship length ratio the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of heave motion usually distribute between 0 9 and 1 1 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of pitch motion usually concentrated around 1 5 in terms of the added resistance the following conclusions can be obtained by comparing the experimental results with the numerical results 1 when λ 0 8 the added resistance will increase first and then decrease with the wavelength to ship length ratio for all outrigger layouts 2 for fn 0 353 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of added resistance usually concentrate around 1 05 for fn 0 471 the wavelength to ship length ratio corresponding to the peak value of added resistance usually concentrate around 1 25 3 the trimaran added resistance is less sensitive to the outrigger layout than to the travelling speed acknowledgement this work was funded by the national natural science foundation of china projects of
