18545,reed phragmites australis is dominant vegetation in alkaline wetlands that is harvested annually due to its economic value to reveal the effects of harvesting reeds on the emission of greenhouse gases ghg the annual soil physicochemical characteristics and flux of ghgs in a reed wetland without harvesting nhrw and with harvesting hrw were measured the results showed that after the harvesting of reeds the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn significantly decreased and soil temperature significantly increased the annual cumulative n2o emissions decreased from 0 73 0 20 kg ha 1 to 0 57 0 49 kg ha 1 with the harvesting of reeds the annual cumulative ch4 emissions also decreased from 561 88 18 61 kg ha 1 to 183 13 18 77 kg ha 1 with the harvesting of reeds however harvesting of reeds had only a limited influence on the annual cumulative co2 emissions a pearson correlation analysis revealed that the co2 and n2o emissions were more sensitive to temperature than the ch4 emissions both structural equation modeling sem analysis and slurry incubation confirmed that higher temperatures offset the reduction of co2 emissions after reed harvesting metagenomics showed that the abundance of functional genes involved in both ghg sink and source decreased with reed harvesting this study presents a comprehensive view of reed harvesting on ghg emissions in alkaline wetlands yielding new insight into the microbial response and offering a novel perspective on the potential impacts of wetland management graphical abstract image 1 keywords wetlands management metagenomics alkaline wetland greenhouse gases 1 introduction wetlands occupy only approximately 5 8 of the land area worldwide bridgham et al 2006 lal 2008 however they store approximately 20 30 of the earth s soil carbon c via plant fungal and bacterial metabolism mitsch et al 2013 the stored c then becomes decomposed into co2 and ch4 by soil respiration and methanogenesis li et al 2018 thus wetlands are also characterized by high rates of greenhouse gas ghg emissions especially in alkaline wetlands bridgham et al 2013 as the optimal ph of methanogenesis is greater than 7 bräuer et al 2006 alkaline wetlands that have reeds phragmites australis as the main vegetation mainly distribute from the nenjiang river basin of china to the caspian sea extending approximately 4000 km long from east to west and 800 km wide you et al 2000 nonetheless wetlands are considered one of the most vulnerable ecosystems because they are subjected to direct anthropogenic disturbances such as drainage and harvesting reeds are harvested annually in wetlands due to their economic value on the world market hence it is difficult to understand how ghg emissions respond to the harvesting of reeds in alkaline wetlands due to soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial processes are interconnected chandra et al 2016 ghg emissions and microbial processes have been investigated in forest grassland and field ecosystems in relation to the effects of harvesting ding et al 2007 lin et al 2011 the results suggest that after harvesting bare soil experiences a significant increase in temperature and a decline in moisture compared to soil with plant residues kulmala et al 2014 wilhelm et al 2017 these changes are also known to influence the microbial activity and ghg emissions in forests castro et al 2000 nazaries et al 2011 but the effects of harvesting on wetland ecosystems remain undescribed without harvesting plant residues in wetlands were decomposed by the soil microorganisms which contributed to the ghg emissions the generation of n2o is mainly attributed to microbial denitrification which is represented by the norb gene and the ammonia oxidation which was represented by the amoa gene whereas the microbial sink of n2o is limited to a single metabolic process that is catalyzed by the n2o reductase nosz hallin et al 2018 sims et al 2012 methanogens represented by the mcra gene are the ch4 microbial source that take part in the terminal step during anaerobic degradation of plant residues including hemicellulose cellulose chitin pectin lignin and aromatics however only 40 of the produced ch4 could escape into the atmosphere and the others is oxidized by methane oxidizing bacteria mob which was represented by the pmoa gene lyu et al 2018 ghg emissions from wetlands were affected by the activity of both microbial source and sink of ghgs however in alkaline wetlands it remains unclear that the influence of harvesting the plant residues on the microbial source and sink of ghg the zhalong wetland located in northeastern china is included on the ramsar list which describes wetlands of international importance the zhalong wetland is a typical inland alkaline wetland and reed is the dominant vegetation reed was harvested every year since the 1960s due to its economic value in the wetland considering the multiple impacts of the harvesting of reeds on ghg emissions we selected two study sites namely a site without harvesting nhrw and a site with harvesting hrw the ghg emissions and soil characteristics were analyzed at both sites and the microbial function was investigated using shotgun metagenomics hence the aims of this study were to 1 elucidate the effects of reed harvesting over a whole annual cycle covering freezing thawing growing and freezing periods 2 investigate the shift in the abundance of related genes in response to reed harvesting and 3 analyze how the harvesting of reeds affect the microbial sources and sinks of ghgs in wetland soils we hypothesized that after reeds are harvested from the wetland higher temperatures would offset the effects of ghg emissions by reducing the c and n input the differential responses of microbial ghg sources and sinks to reed harvesting may also influence the ghg emissions this study presents a comprehensive research on the harvesting of reeds on ghg emissions from alkaline wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted in the zhalong wetland 46 867 47 533 n 124 229 124 230 e which has a mid temperate climate in northeast china the wetland has a total area of approximately 2100 km2 a mean annual air temperature of 3 9 c and a mean precipitation of 420 mm gao et al 2018 zhalong wetland is a national nature reserve in which all production and living activities are prohibited except for the reeds were harvested to minimize the environmental difference between the two sites two adjacent study sites were selected and were named nhrw and hrw fig 1 reeds in hrw were harvested by natives in december every year since the 1960s 2 2 ghgs measurement the static closed chamber technique was applied to measure the ghg emissions rate zhu et al 2014 with three replicated chambers at the two sites reed wetland without harvesting nhrw and with harvesting hrw the static chamber contained an upper chamber 50 cm 50 cm 50 cm and a pedestal 50 cm 50 cm 20 cm one month before the gas sampling the pedestal was inserted into the soil for 20 cm and kept in the soil during the study during the experimental period the gutter of pedestal was filled with water to form a water seal each upper chamber contained a fan to mix the air and a temperature probe to measure the temperature during gas sampling gas sampling started on 5th july 2017 and ended on 11th july 2018 with an interval of six or nine days which covered growth period freezing period and freezing thawing period table 1 between 9th november 2017 and 30th march 2018 gas sampling was suspended

sample dna concentrations were determined by a nanodrop tm 8000 thermo usa the extracted dna was transported to the beijing genomic institute bgi at shenzhen china and sequencing was conducted on a hiseq2000 the four samples from nhrw and hrw in the zhalong wetland produced a total of 2 984 444 036 reads the raw dna sequence datasets for hrw 0 20 cm hrw 20 40 cm nhrw 0 20 cm and nhrw 20 40 cm were loaded into metagenomics rapid annotation mg rast with identifications of mgm4826963 3 mgm4826964 3 mgm4826967 and mgm4826968 3 respectively to guarantee the quality of the downstream analysis the raw sequences were quality filtered by trimmomatic v0 32 bolger et al 2014 the clean reads were assembled into contigs with soapdenovo2 luo et al 2012 and rabbit you et al 2013 open reading frames in the assembled contigs were predicted by metagenemark v2 10 default setting zhu et al 2010 the predicted orfs were then translated into protein sequences and clustered with cd hit li and godzik 2006

the databases with the highest similarity were selected and the corresponding protein functional annotations were finally obtained to reveal the effect of reed harvesting on the microbial ghg source and sink the marker genes in c and n cycling llorens mares et al 2015 were grouped heatmap plots were generated with r r development core team with the package pheatmap 2 6 statistical analysis pearson s correlation analysis of variance anova and multivariate analyses were conducted using the spss software package ibm uk ltd hampshire uk means and least significant differences at the 5 level were calculated by one way anova graphing was achieved with originpro 2016 software structural equation modeling sem analysis de vries et al 2018 was employed to identify the direct and indirect influence of soil physicochemical characteristics on the ghg emissions in hrw and nhrw before sem analysis the bivariate relationships between all variables with simple linear regressions were firstly checked to ensure the appropriateness of the linear models then priori models were constructed based on current knowledge about the ghg emissions the priori models were tested whether the data fit these models the non significant relationships were stepwise removed as in ref de vries et al 2018 the adequacy of the model by sem was determined by a goodness of fit index gfi when the gfi was greater than 0 9 the model was considered adequate the sem was performed by lisrel linear structural relations 8 80 a statistical software package 3 results 3 1 soil physicochemical characteristics the physicochemical characteristics of soil in the zhalong wetland changed throughout the year as shown in table 2 the ph was ranged between 8 15 and 8 26 and there was no significant difference in soil ph among the soil samples taken from nhrw and hrw the annual average no3 n and nh4 n concentration were significantly different p 0 05 between the two soil layers of nhrw and hrw but there was no significant difference between them in nhrw and hrw in the 0 20 cm layer tn and toc in the soil collected from nhrw were significantly higher than that in the soil collected from hrw p 0 05 but in the 20 40 cm soil the differences were not significant the results suggested that the harvesting of reeds mainly reduced c and n input in the topmost soil layer as shown in fig 2 the temperature at each soil depth in hrw was significantly higher than that in nhrw p 0 01 during study period 3 2 flux of ghg emissions to reveal the influence of harvesting reeds on the ghg emissions from the zhalong wetland the n2o co2 and ch4 emissions were measured during the whole year the annual average n2o flux of nhrw 33 60 9 16 μg m 2 h 1 was higher than that of hrw 18 91 9 18 μg m 2 h 1 but the difference was not significant p 0 22 fig 3 a hence the annual cumulative n2o emissions in nhrw 0 73 0 20 kg ha 1 was higher than that in hrw 0 57 0 49 kg ha 1 fig 4 a interestingly reed harvesting also altered the wetland from n2o source to n2o sink especially in the period from 15th november to 15th april the co2 emissions from the zhalong wetland were mainly concentrated in the period from 1st may to 1st september fig 4b the annual average co2 flux in nhrw and hrw was 246 47 33 31 mg m 2 h 1 and 241 17 23 95 mg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3b no significant difference was found for the average co2 flux between nhrw and hrw p 0 91 the results suggested that reed harvesting had little effect on co2 emissions ch4 emissions were significantly reduced by reed harvesting p 0 01 the annual average ch4 flux of nhrw and hrw was 7 89 1 35 mg m 2 h 1 and 2 35 0 55 mg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3c as shown in fig 4c the annual cumulative ch4 emissions in nhrw 561 88 18 61 kg ha 1 was 3 07 times higher than that in hrw 183 13 18 77 kg ha 1 the results suggested that reed harvesting had remarkable effects on the ch4 emissions 3 3 soil physicochemical drivers of ghg fluxes after reed harvesting the soil characteristics and ghg emissions significantly changed to reveal the effects of soil characteristics on ghg emissions sem analysis was conducted overall sem analysis explained the ghg emissions was mainly predicted by the soil characteristics including temperature nh4 n toc and no3 n concentration fig 7 but the tn concentration had little effect of ghg emissions among the ghg the co2 and n2o emissions was significantly directly influenced by temperature p 0 01 but the ch4 emissions was not influenced by temperature as the temperature was the most significant factor influenced co2 and n2o emissions in zhalong wetland fig 7 a pearson correlation analysis was then performed to reveal the relationship between soil temperature and ghg emissions table 3 as shown in table 3 n2o and co2 emissions was sensitive to temperature change in the zhalong wetland p 0 01 however the relationship between soil temperature and ch4 emissions was not as significantly as that of co2 and n2o which was also supported by the pearson correlation analysis table 3 3 4 functional genes involved in c cycling and n cycling the metagenome sequencing showed that reed harvesting significantly influenced a large amount of microbial functional genes for c decomposition fig 5 in the topsoil genes involved in the decomposition of pectin chitin and aromatic hydrocarbons increased in hrw indicating that reed harvesting promoted the degradation of recalcitrant c in the topsoil although the relative abundance of these genes was downregulated in the underlying soil the extent of the downregulation in the underlying soil was too small to offset the loss of organic carbon in the topsoil most genes related to soil c cycling in the nhrw were also distinct from those in the hrw fig 6 a the abundance of aerobic ch4 oxidation aerobic respiration fermentation and methanogenesis genes shifted significantly after reed harvesting while the co oxidation gene in nhrw had a lower abundance compared to that in hrw moreover the relative gene abundance in the 0 20 cm layer was always higher than that in the 20 40 cm layer in both nhrw and hrw which suggested the microorganisms in the 0 20 cm soil layer were more active than in 20 40 cm soil layer it was interesting to find that most genes involved in c fixation were also significantly decreased with reed harvesting c fixation by microbial inhabitants is considered a main co2 sink in wetlands mob is the only microbial ch4 sink which could be represented by the pmoa gene the pmoa gene was most abundant in the 20 40 cm soil layer indicating that anaerobic methane oxidation contributed significantly to the consumption of ch4 reed harvesting was also found to influence genes related to the n cycle fig 6b n2o is produced during ammonia oxidation and denitrification processes in contrast it is consumed only via microbial reduction catalyzed by n2o reductase nosz compared with nhrw genes involved ammonia oxidation amoa and denitrification norb processes in hrw were decreased nosz was also found to be reduced with reed harvesting these results suggested that reed harvesting decreased the activity of both microbial n2o sources and sinks 4 discussion the weak alkaline conditions favored the ammonia oxidation bai et al 2010 kyveryga et al 2004 denitrification šimek and cooper 2002 and methanogenesis bräuer et al 2006 which contributed to the emissions of n2o and ch4 in alkaline wetlands it has been demonstrated that soil temperature soil layers and soil ph significantly influenced n2o emissions bai et al 2010 2014 zhang et al 2013 however the influence of reeds harvesting on ghg emissions remains unknown in alkaline wetlands 4 1 reed harvesting transformed the zhalong wetland from n2o source to n2o sink in the present study no significant difference in n2o emissions were observed in the growth period between nhrw and hrw indicating that higher temperatures also offset the n2o reduction from reed harvesting denitrification and consequently n2o emissions are temperature sensitive zhang et al 2013 warming has been shown to increase n2o emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013 however there have been only a few studies on the influence of warming on n2o emissions and either no changes pearson et al 2015 ward et al 2013 or increased emissions chen et al 2017 voigt et al 2017 have been observed in the freezing period reed harvesting altered the wetland from an n2o source into an n2o sink the marker genes in n cycling llorens mares et al 2015 were extracted and the results allow us to form a conceptual model for further understanding the effect of reed harvesting on the n metabolic pathway in an alkaline wetland fig 6a first the n metabolic pathway was very sensitive to reed harvesting and reed residues could serve as a nutrient to stimulate microbial growth as demonstrated by n2o flux fig 3a second metagenomics data showed that microbial functional genes involved in n cycling processes were decreased after reed harvesting such as amoa for ammoxidation narg nirs k norb and nosz for denitrification napa nasa nirb d and nrfa for nitrate and nitrite reduction these results suggested that reed harvesting decreased the activity of both microbial n2o sources and sinks xu and co workers confirmed that a decrease in soil tn content could reduce the abundance of the functional genes involved in n cycling xu et al 2014 the relative abundance of nosz and norb genes decreased after reed harvesting fig 6a which was consistent with the trend of tn table 2 as known n2o in wetlands is mainly produced by denitrification processes kuypers et al 2018 the production of n2o is catalyzed by the norb gene encoded nor enzyme and its consumption is catalyzed by the nosz encoded nos enzyme during denitrification processes the relative abundance of nosz n2o absorbing was higher than that of norb n2o producing fig 6a previous studies lachmann et al 2010 have shown that nor enzymes were more active under acidic conditions and nos enzymes were more suitable for alkaline conditions the zhalong wetland had a higher ph table 2 and was therefore more suitable for absorbing n2o blum et al 2018 which was the reason for the lower n2o emissions gao et al 2019 gil et al 2017 lamb et al 2011 in the zhalong wetland reed harvesting in alkaline wetlands resulting in the decrease of c and n input and the functional genes explained the variability of n2o emissions 4 2 higher temperatures due to reed removal offset the reduction of co2 emissions after reed harvesting reed harvesting produced changes in the relative abundance of genes involved in the production and consumption of ghgs temperature is a key environmental factor that influences microbial activity solar radiation on the soil surface could increase soil temperature without shielding from plant residues zerva and mencuccini 2005 in zhalong wetland the soil temperature of each layer increased when no shading was offered by reed residues fig 2 the phenomenon was generally consistent with the observation that clearcutting the plant residues increased the forest soil temperature kulmala et al 2014 wilhelm et al 2017 in the present study the harvesting of reeds significantly reduced the c input table 2 but it had less of an impact on the co2 emissions fig 3b the sem analysis suggested temperature was the most important factor that influenced the co2 emissions and the standardized path coefficients between co2 and temperature was 0 72 which was significantly higher than that between co2 and toc concentration fig 7 indicating that higher temperatures due to reed removal may offset the reduction of co2 emissions pearson s correlation suggested that there was a significantly positive correlation between co2 emissions flux and the temperature in all soil layers p 0 01 table 3 to confirm the hypothesis that the increase in co2 emissions due to the rising temperature would offset the decrease in co2 emissions due to the reduction in c input a slurry experiment cui et al 2015 was performed to detect the potential co2 emission rates of nhrw and hrw at 15 c and 25 c the results showed that the potential co2 emission rates at 25 c was significantly higher than that at 15 c in nhrw and hrw respectively p 0 01 table 4 the potential co2 emission rates in nhrw at 15 c 117 45 9 73 nmol g 1 d 1 were not significantly different from that in hrw at 25 c 128 30 9 43 nmol g 1 d 1 which indicated that the potential co2 emission rates was sensitive to temperature and further supported the hypothesis previous studies have reported that the degradation rate of recalcitrant c could be significantly improved by increasing temperature comer warner et al 2018 monteux et al 2018 following the decrease of soil toc genes involved in respiration and fermentation were decreased in both sampled soil layers with reed harvesting thus co2 emissions would be expected to decrease but there was no significant difference in the co2 flux between nhrw and hrw fig 3b it was interesting to find that most genes involved in the c fixation were also significantly decreased with reed harvesting c fixation by microbial inhabitants is considered a main co2 sink in wetlands andersen et al 2013 our results indicated that both the source and sink of co2 were reduced due to reed harvesting as a consequence little effect was observed on co2 emissions 4 3 effect of reed harvesting on ch4 emissions in the zhalong wetland zhalong wetland is a typical alkaline wetland which is suitable for methanogens methanosarcina and methanosaeta use acetate as a substrate to produce ch4 and their proportion in the methanogens were 56 51 and 57 25 in nhrw while that in hrw were 56 93 and 60 15 fig 8 respectively aceticlastic methanogens are the main sources of ch4 in the zhalong wetland and the relative abundance of aceticlastic methanogens in the two soil layers of hrw was higher than that in the hrw this was consistent with the change of toc content in soil after reed harvesting the potential ch4 emission rates of nhrw and hrw at 25 c and 15 c suggested that the potential ch4 emission rates in nhrw were significantly higher than that in hrw table 5 the relative abundance of aceticlastic methanogens toc and potential ch4 emission rates were consistent with the variation of ch4 emission fluxes in nhrw and hrw due to the higher ch4 emission fluxes in the zhalong wetland fig 3c sufficient substrate was provided for the growth of mob so the relative abundance of mob was relatively higher fig 8 especially type i mob reed harvesting could decrease the relative abundance of type i mob in the alkaline wetland but it had little effect on the abundance of type ii mob studies maxfield et al 2008 mohanty et al 2006 nyerges and stein 2009 have shown that nitrogen input can stimulate the mass growth of type i mob and inhibit the growth of type ii mob methylocystis and methylosinus have two enzyme expression regulators that are dominant in type ii mob thus they could adapt to the different ch4 concentrations tchawa yimga et al 2003 therefore the decrease of n input caused by reed harvesting did not significantly affect the relative abundance of type ii mob in our study the higher tn content in nhrw table 2 stimulated the growth of type i mob and reed harvesting had little effect on the abundance of type ii mob ch4 emissions were maintained at a high level in the freezing period fig 4c suggested the psychrophilic methanogens existed in the zhalong wetland removal of botanic residues dramatically changed nutrient pools soil temperature and ghg emissions lin et al 2011 saggar et al 2007 wang et al 2012 which would further affect soil ch4 uptake warming increased by 1 0 3 0 c significantly decreased soil ch4 oxidization by 13 32 in some semiarid grasslands and forests blankinship et al 2010a dijkstra et al 2011 and in a grassland during the dry growing season blankinship et al 2010b methanogens are regarded as a microbial ch4 source in wetlands lyu et al 2018 accordingly genes involved in ch4 production were higher in nhrw than that in hrw due to the residual matter from reeds which increased soil toc table 2 the pmoa gene was most abundant in the 20 40 cm soil layer which contained little o2 wang et al 2015 indicating that anaerobic ch4 oxidation contributed significantly to the ch4 consumption this was consistent with the ch4 emission flux in nhrw and hrw 5 conclusion in conclusion harvesting of reeds in zhalong wetland significantly decreased toc and tn concentration in soil but increased soil temperature metagenomics showed that the abundance of functional genes involved in both ghg sink and source decreased with reed harvesting the reed harvesting reduced the cumulative ch4 emissions by 67 41 and reduced the cumulative n2o emissions from 0 73 0 20 kg ha 1 to 0 57 0 49 kg ha 1 which converted the zhalong wetland from n2o source into n2o sink however reed harvesting had little effect on co2 emissions as higher temperatures offset the reduction of co2 emissions after reed harvesting declaration of

18545,reed phragmites australis is dominant vegetation in alkaline wetlands that is harvested annually due to its economic value to reveal the effects of harvesting reeds on the emission of greenhouse gases ghg the annual soil physicochemical characteristics and flux of ghgs in a reed wetland without harvesting nhrw and with harvesting hrw were measured the results showed that after the harvesting of reeds the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn significantly decreased and soil temperature significantly increased the annual cumulative n2o emissions decreased from 0 73 0 20 kg ha 1 to 0 57 0 49 kg ha 1 with the harvesting of reeds the annual cumulative ch4 emissions also decreased from 561 88 18 61 kg ha 1 to 183 13 18 77 kg ha 1 with the harvesting of reeds however harvesting of reeds had only a limited influence on the annual cumulative co2 emissions a pearson correlation analysis revealed that the co2 and n2o emissions were more sensitive to temperature than the ch4 emissions both structural equation modeling sem analysis and slurry incubation confirmed that higher temperatures offset the reduction of co2 emissions after reed harvesting metagenomics showed that the abundance of functional genes involved in both ghg sink and source decreased with reed harvesting this study presents a comprehensive view of reed harvesting on ghg emissions in alkaline wetlands yielding new insight into the microbial response and offering a novel perspective on the potential impacts of wetland management graphical abstract image 1 keywords wetlands management metagenomics alkaline wetland greenhouse gases 1 introduction wetlands occupy only approximately 5 8 of the land area worldwide bridgham et al 2006 lal 2008 however they store approximately 20 30 of the earth s soil carbon c via plant fungal and bacterial metabolism mitsch et al 2013 the stored c then becomes decomposed into co2 and ch4 by soil respiration and methanogenesis li et al 2018 thus wetlands are also characterized by high rates of greenhouse gas ghg emissions especially in alkaline wetlands bridgham et al 2013 as the optimal ph of methanogenesis is greater than 7 bräuer et al 2006 alkaline wetlands that have reeds phragmites australis as the main vegetation mainly distribute from the nenjiang river basin of china to the caspian sea extending approximately 4000 km long from east to west and 800 km wide you et al 2000 nonetheless wetlands are considered one of the most vulnerable ecosystems because they are subjected to direct anthropogenic disturbances such as drainage and harvesting reeds are harvested annually in wetlands due to their economic value on the world market hence it is difficult to understand how ghg emissions respond to the harvesting of reeds in alkaline wetlands due to soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial processes are interconnected chandra et al 2016 ghg emissions and microbial processes have been investigated in forest grassland and field ecosystems in relation to the effects of harvesting ding et al 2007 lin et al 2011 the results suggest that after harvesting bare soil experiences a significant increase in temperature and a decline in moisture compared to soil with plant residues kulmala et al 2014 wilhelm et al 2017 these changes are also known to influence the microbial activity and ghg emissions in forests castro et al 2000 nazaries et al 2011 but the effects of harvesting on wetland ecosystems remain undescribed without harvesting plant residues in wetlands were decomposed by the soil microorganisms which contributed to the ghg emissions the generation of n2o is mainly attributed to microbial denitrification which is represented by the norb gene and the ammonia oxidation which was represented by the amoa gene whereas the microbial sink of n2o is limited to a single metabolic process that is catalyzed by the n2o reductase nosz hallin et al 2018 sims et al 2012 methanogens represented by the mcra gene are the ch4 microbial source that take part in the terminal step during anaerobic degradation of plant residues including hemicellulose cellulose chitin pectin lignin and aromatics however only 40 of the produced ch4 could escape into the atmosphere and the others is oxidized by methane oxidizing bacteria mob which was represented by the pmoa gene lyu et al 2018 ghg emissions from wetlands were affected by the activity of both microbial source and sink of ghgs however in alkaline wetlands it remains unclear that the influence of harvesting the plant residues on the microbial source and sink of ghg the zhalong wetland located in northeastern china is included on the ramsar list which describes wetlands of international importance the zhalong wetland is a typical inland alkaline wetland and reed is the dominant vegetation reed was harvested every year since the 1960s due to its economic value in the wetland considering the multiple impacts of the harvesting of reeds on ghg emissions we selected two study sites namely a site without harvesting nhrw and a site with harvesting hrw the ghg emissions and soil characteristics were analyzed at both sites and the microbial function was investigated using shotgun metagenomics hence the aims of this study were to 1 elucidate the effects of reed harvesting over a whole annual cycle covering freezing thawing growing and freezing periods 2 investigate the shift in the abundance of related genes in response to reed harvesting and 3 analyze how the harvesting of reeds affect the microbial sources and sinks of ghgs in wetland soils we hypothesized that after reeds are harvested from the wetland higher temperatures would offset the effects of ghg emissions by reducing the c and n input the differential responses of microbial ghg sources and sinks to reed harvesting may also influence the ghg emissions this study presents a comprehensive research on the harvesting of reeds on ghg emissions from alkaline wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted in the zhalong wetland 46 867 47 533 n 124 229 124 230 e which has a mid temperate climate in northeast china the wetland has a total area of approximately 2100 km2 a mean annual air temperature of 3 9 c and a mean precipitation of 420 mm gao et al 2018 zhalong wetland is a national nature reserve in which all production and living activities are prohibited except for the reeds were harvested to minimize the environmental difference between the two sites two adjacent study sites were selected and were named nhrw and hrw fig 1 reeds in hrw were harvested by natives in december every year since the 1960s 2 2 ghgs measurement the static closed chamber technique was applied to measure the ghg emissions rate zhu et al 2014 with three replicated chambers at the two sites reed wetland without harvesting nhrw and with harvesting hrw the static chamber contained an upper chamber 50 cm 50 cm 50 cm and a pedestal 50 cm 50 cm 20 cm one month before the gas sampling the pedestal was inserted into the soil for 20 cm and kept in the soil during the study during the experimental period the gutter of pedestal was filled with water to form a water seal each upper chamber contained a fan to mix the air and a temperature probe to measure the temperature during gas sampling gas sampling started on 5th july 2017 and ended on 11th july

sample dna concentrations were determined by a nanodrop tm 8000 thermo usa the extracted dna was transported to the beijing genomic institute bgi at shenzhen china and sequencing was conducted on a hiseq2000 the four samples from nhrw and hrw in the zhalong wetland produced a total of 2 984 444 036 reads the raw dna sequence datasets for hrw 0 20 cm hrw 20 40 cm nhrw 0 20 cm and nhrw 20 40 cm were loaded into metagenomics rapid annotation mg rast with identifications of mgm4826963 3 mgm4826964 3 mgm4826967 and mgm4826968 3 respectively to guarantee the quality of the downstream analysis the raw sequences were quality filtered by trimmomatic v0 32 bolger et al 2014 the clean reads were assembled into contigs with soapdenovo2 luo et al 2012 and rabbit you et al 2013 open reading frames in the assembled contigs were predicted by metagenemark v2 10 default setting zhu et al 2010 the predicted orfs were then translated into protein sequences and clustered with cd hit li and godzik 2006

the databases with the highest similarity were selected and the corresponding protein functional annotations were finally obtained to reveal the effect of reed harvesting on the microbial ghg source and sink the marker genes in c and n cycling llorens mares et al 2015 were grouped heatmap plots were generated with r r development core team with the package pheatmap 2 6 statistical analysis pearson s correlation analysis of variance anova and multivariate analyses were conducted using the spss software package ibm uk ltd hampshire uk means and least significant differences at the 5 level were calculated by one way anova graphing was achieved with originpro 2016 software structural equation modeling sem analysis de vries et al 2018 was employed to identify the direct and indirect influence of soil physicochemical characteristics on the ghg emissions in hrw and nhrw before sem analysis the bivariate relationships between all variables with simple linear regressions were firstly checked to ensure the appropriateness of the linear models then priori models were constructed based on current knowledge about the ghg emissions the priori models were tested whether the data fit these models the non significant relationships were stepwise removed as in ref de vries et al 2018 the adequacy of the model by sem was determined by a goodness of fit index gfi when the gfi was greater than 0 9 the model was considered adequate the sem was performed by lisrel linear structural relations 8 80 a statistical software package 3 results 3 1 soil physicochemical characteristics the physicochemical characteristics of soil in the zhalong wetland changed throughout the year as shown in table 2 the ph was ranged between 8 15 and 8 26 and there was no significant difference in soil ph among the soil samples taken from nhrw and hrw the annual average no3 n and nh4 n concentration were significantly different p 0 05 between the two soil layers of nhrw and hrw but there was no significant difference between them in nhrw and hrw in the 0 20 cm layer tn and toc in the soil collected from nhrw were significantly higher than that in the soil collected from hrw p 0 05 but in the 20 40 cm soil the differences were not significant the results suggested that the harvesting of reeds mainly reduced c and n input in the topmost soil layer as shown in fig 2 the temperature at each soil depth in hrw was significantly higher than that in nhrw p 0 01 during study period 3 2 flux of ghg emissions to reveal the influence of harvesting reeds on the ghg emissions from the zhalong wetland the n2o co2 and ch4 emissions were measured during the whole year the annual average n2o flux of nhrw 33 60 9 16 μg m 2 h 1 was higher than that of hrw 18 91 9 18 μg m 2 h 1 but the difference was not significant p 0 22 fig 3 a hence the annual cumulative n2o emissions in nhrw 0 73 0 20 kg ha 1 was higher than that in hrw 0 57 0 49 kg ha 1 fig 4 a interestingly reed harvesting also altered the wetland from n2o source to n2o sink especially in the period from 15th november to 15th april the co2 emissions from the zhalong wetland were mainly concentrated in the period from 1st may to 1st september fig 4b the annual average co2 flux in nhrw and hrw was 246 47 33 31 mg m 2 h 1 and 241 17 23 95 mg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3b no significant difference was found for the average co2 flux between nhrw and hrw p 0 91 the results suggested that reed harvesting had little effect on co2 emissions ch4 emissions were significantly reduced by reed harvesting p 0 01 the annual average ch4 flux of nhrw and hrw was 7 89 1 35 mg m 2 h 1 and 2 35 0 55 mg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3c as shown in fig 4c the annual cumulative ch4 emissions in nhrw 561 88 18 61 kg ha 1 was 3 07 times higher than that in hrw 183 13 18 77 kg ha 1 the results suggested that reed harvesting had remarkable effects on the ch4 emissions 3 3 soil physicochemical drivers of ghg fluxes after reed harvesting the soil characteristics and ghg emissions significantly changed to reveal the effects of soil characteristics on ghg emissions sem analysis was conducted overall sem analysis explained the ghg emissions was mainly predicted by the soil characteristics including temperature nh4 n toc and no3 n concentration fig 7 but the tn concentration had little effect of ghg emissions among the ghg the co2 and n2o emissions was significantly directly influenced by temperature p 0 01 but the ch4 emissions was not influenced by temperature as the temperature was the most significant factor influenced co2 and n2o emissions in zhalong wetland fig 7 a pearson correlation analysis was then performed to reveal the relationship between soil temperature and ghg emissions table 3 as shown in table 3 n2o and co2 emissions was sensitive to temperature change in the zhalong wetland p 0 01 however the relationship between soil temperature and ch4 emissions was not as significantly as that of co2 and n2o which was also supported by the pearson correlation analysis table 3 3 4 functional genes involved in c cycling and n cycling the metagenome sequencing showed that reed harvesting significantly influenced a large amount of microbial functional genes for c decomposition fig 5 in the topsoil genes involved in the decomposition of pectin chitin and aromatic hydrocarbons increased in hrw indicating that reed harvesting promoted the degradation of recalcitrant c in the topsoil although the relative abundance of these genes was downregulated in the underlying soil the extent of the downregulation in the underlying soil was too small to offset the loss of organic carbon in the topsoil most genes related to soil c cycling in the nhrw were also distinct from those in the hrw fig 6 a the abundance of aerobic ch4 oxidation aerobic respiration fermentation and methanogenesis genes shifted significantly after reed harvesting while the co oxidation gene in nhrw had a lower abundance compared to that in hrw moreover the relative gene abundance in the 0 20 cm layer was always higher than that in the 20 40 cm layer in both nhrw and hrw which suggested the microorganisms in the 0 20 cm soil layer were more active than in 20 40 cm soil layer it was interesting to find that most genes involved in c fixation were also significantly decreased with reed harvesting c fixation by microbial inhabitants is considered a main co2 sink in wetlands mob is the only microbial ch4 sink which could be represented by the pmoa gene the pmoa gene was most abundant in the 20 40 cm soil layer indicating that anaerobic methane oxidation contributed significantly to the consumption of ch4 reed harvesting was also found to influence genes related to the n cycle fig 6b n2o is produced during ammonia oxidation and denitrification processes in contrast it is consumed only via microbial reduction catalyzed by n2o reductase nosz compared with nhrw genes involved ammonia oxidation amoa and denitrification norb processes in hrw were decreased nosz was also found to be reduced with reed harvesting these results suggested that reed harvesting decreased the activity of both microbial n2o sources and sinks 4 discussion the weak alkaline conditions favored the ammonia oxidation bai et al 2010 kyveryga et al 2004 denitrification šimek and cooper 2002 and methanogenesis bräuer et al 2006 which contributed to the emissions of n2o and ch4 in alkaline wetlands it has been demonstrated that soil temperature soil layers and soil ph significantly influenced n2o emissions bai et al 2010 2014 zhang et al 2013 however the influence of reeds harvesting on ghg emissions remains unknown in alkaline wetlands 4 1 reed harvesting transformed the zhalong wetland from n2o source to n2o sink in the present study no significant difference in n2o emissions were observed in the growth period between nhrw and hrw indicating that higher temperatures also offset the n2o reduction from reed harvesting denitrification and consequently n2o emissions are temperature sensitive zhang et al 2013 warming has been shown to increase n2o emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013 however there have been only a few studies on the influence of warming on n2o emissions and either no changes pearson et al 2015 ward et al 2013 or increased emissions chen et al 2017 voigt et al 2017 have been observed in the freezing period reed harvesting altered the wetland from an n2o source into an n2o sink the marker genes in n cycling llorens mares et al 2015 were extracted and the results allow us to form a conceptual model for further understanding the effect of reed harvesting on the n metabolic pathway in an alkaline wetland fig 6a first the n metabolic pathway was very sensitive to reed harvesting and reed residues could serve as a nutrient to stimulate microbial growth as demonstrated by n2o flux fig 3a second metagenomics data showed that microbial functional genes involved in n cycling processes were decreased after reed harvesting such as amoa for ammoxidation narg nirs k norb and nosz for denitrification napa nasa nirb d and nrfa for nitrate and nitrite reduction these results suggested that reed harvesting decreased the activity of both microbial n2o sources and sinks xu and co workers confirmed that a decrease in soil tn content could reduce the abundance of the functional genes involved in n cycling xu et al 2014 the relative abundance of nosz and norb genes decreased after reed harvesting fig 6a which was consistent with the trend of tn table 2 as known n2o in wetlands is mainly produced by denitrification processes kuypers et al 2018 the production of n2o is catalyzed by the norb gene encoded nor enzyme and its consumption is catalyzed by the nosz encoded nos enzyme during denitrification processes the relative abundance of nosz n2o absorbing was higher than that of norb n2o producing fig 6a previous studies lachmann et al 2010 have shown that nor enzymes were more active under acidic conditions and nos enzymes were more suitable for alkaline conditions the zhalong wetland had a higher ph table 2 and was therefore more suitable for absorbing n2o blum et al 2018 which was the reason for the lower n2o emissions gao et al 2019 gil et al 2017 lamb et al 2011 in the zhalong wetland reed harvesting in alkaline wetlands resulting in the decrease of c and n input and the functional genes explained the variability of n2o emissions 4 2 higher temperatures due to reed removal offset the reduction of co2 emissions after reed harvesting reed harvesting produced changes in the relative abundance of genes involved in the production and consumption of ghgs temperature is a key environmental factor that influences microbial activity solar radiation on the soil surface could increase soil temperature without shielding from plant residues zerva and mencuccini 2005 in zhalong wetland the soil temperature of each layer increased when no shading was offered by reed residues fig 2 the phenomenon was generally consistent with the observation that clearcutting the plant residues increased the forest soil temperature kulmala et al 2014 wilhelm et al 2017 in the present study the harvesting of reeds significantly reduced the c input table 2 but it had less of an impact on the co2 emissions fig 3b the sem analysis suggested temperature was the most important factor that influenced the co2 emissions and the standardized path coefficients between co2 and temperature was 0 72 which was significantly higher than that between co2 and toc concentration fig 7 indicating that higher temperatures due to reed removal may offset the reduction of co2 emissions pearson s correlation suggested that there was a significantly positive correlation between co2 emissions flux and the temperature in all soil layers p 0 01 table 3 to confirm the hypothesis that the increase in co2 emissions due to the rising temperature would offset the decrease in co2 emissions due to the reduction in c input a slurry experiment cui et al 2015 was performed to detect the potential co2 emission rates of nhrw and hrw at 15 c and 25 c the results showed that the potential co2 emission rates at 25 c was significantly higher than that at 15 c in nhrw and hrw respectively p 0 01 table 4 the potential co2 emission rates in nhrw at 15 c 117 45 9 73 nmol g 1 d 1 were not significantly different from that in hrw at 25 c 128 30 9 43 nmol g 1 d 1 which indicated that the potential co2 emission rates was sensitive to temperature and further supported the hypothesis previous studies have reported that the degradation rate of recalcitrant c could be significantly improved by increasing temperature comer warner et al 2018 monteux et al 2018 following the decrease of soil toc genes involved in respiration and fermentation were decreased in both sampled soil layers with reed harvesting thus co2 emissions would be expected to decrease but there was no significant difference in the co2 flux between nhrw and hrw fig 3b it was interesting to find that most genes involved in the c fixation were also significantly decreased with reed harvesting c fixation by microbial inhabitants is considered a main co2 sink in wetlands andersen et al 2013 our results indicated that both the source and sink of co2 were reduced due to reed harvesting as a consequence little effect was observed on co2 emissions 4 3 effect of reed harvesting on ch4 emissions in the zhalong wetland zhalong wetland is a typical alkaline wetland which is suitable for methanogens methanosarcina and methanosaeta use acetate as a substrate to produce ch4 and their proportion in the methanogens were 56 51 and 57 25 in nhrw while that in hrw were 56 93 and 60 15 fig 8 respectively aceticlastic methanogens are the main sources of ch4 in the zhalong wetland and the relative abundance of aceticlastic methanogens in the two soil layers of hrw was higher than that in the hrw this was consistent with the change of toc content in soil after reed harvesting the potential ch4 emission rates of nhrw and hrw at 25 c and 15 c suggested that the potential ch4 emission rates in nhrw were significantly higher than that in hrw table 5 the relative abundance of aceticlastic methanogens toc and potential ch4 emission rates were consistent with the variation of ch4 emission fluxes in nhrw and hrw due to the higher ch4 emission fluxes in the zhalong wetland fig 3c sufficient substrate was provided for the growth of mob so the relative abundance of mob was relatively higher fig 8 especially type i mob reed harvesting could decrease the relative abundance of type i mob in the alkaline wetland but it had little effect on the abundance of type ii mob studies maxfield et al 2008 mohanty et al 2006 nyerges and stein 2009 have shown that nitrogen input can stimulate the mass growth of type i mob and inhibit the growth of type ii mob methylocystis and methylosinus have two enzyme expression regulators that are dominant in type ii mob thus they could adapt to the different ch4 concentrations tchawa yimga et al 2003 therefore the decrease of n input caused by reed harvesting did not significantly affect the relative abundance of type ii mob in our study the higher tn content in nhrw table 2 stimulated the growth of type i mob and reed harvesting had little effect on the abundance of type ii mob ch4 emissions were maintained at a high level in the freezing period fig 4c suggested the psychrophilic methanogens existed in the zhalong wetland removal of botanic residues dramatically changed nutrient pools soil temperature and ghg emissions lin et al 2011 saggar et al 2007 wang et al 2012 which would further affect soil ch4 uptake warming increased by 1 0 3 0 c significantly decreased soil ch4 oxidization by 13 32 in some semiarid grasslands and forests blankinship et al 2010a dijkstra et al 2011 and in a grassland during the dry growing season blankinship et al 2010b methanogens are regarded as a microbial ch4 source in wetlands lyu et al 2018 accordingly genes involved in ch4 production were higher in nhrw than that in hrw due to the residual matter from reeds which increased soil toc table 2 the pmoa gene was most abundant in the 20 40 cm soil layer which contained little o2 wang et al 2015 indicating that anaerobic ch4 oxidation contributed significantly to the ch4 consumption this was consistent with the ch4 emission flux in nhrw and hrw 5 conclusion in conclusion harvesting of reeds in zhalong wetland significantly decreased toc and tn concentration in soil but increased soil temperature metagenomics showed that the abundance of functional genes involved in both ghg sink and source decreased with reed harvesting the reed harvesting reduced the cumulative ch4 emissions by 67 41 and reduced the cumulative n2o emissions from 0 73 0 20 kg ha 1 to 0 57 0 49 kg ha 1 which converted the zhalong wetland from n2o source into n2o sink however reed harvesting had little effect on co2 emissions as higher temperatures offset the reduction of co2 emissions after reed harvesting declaration of

18546,understanding microbial community structure and function within the subsurface is critical to assessing overall quality and maintenance of groundwater however the factors that determine microbial community assembly structure and function in groundwater systems and their impact on water quality remains poorly understood in this study three shallow wells fw301 fw303 fw305 in a non contaminated shallow aquifer in the enigma oak ridge field research center oak ridge tn were sampled approximately 3 times a week over a period of three months to measure changes in groundwater geochemistry and microbial diversity it was expected that the sampled microbial diversity from two historic field wells fw301 fw303 would be relatively stable while diversity from a newer well fw305 would be less stable over time the wells displayed some degree of hydrochemical variability over time unique to each well with fw303 being overall the most stable well and fw301 being the most dynamic based upon dissolved oxygen conductivity and nitrate community analysis via ss rrna paired end sequencing and distribution based clustering revealed higher otu richness diversity and variability in groundwater communities of fw301 than the other two wells for diversity binned over all time points microbial community composition of a given well was on average 50 dissimilar to any other well at a given time days yet functional gene diversity as measured with geochip remained relatively constant similarities in community structure across wells were observed with respect to the presence of 20 shared bacterial groups in all samples in all wells although at varying levels over the tested time period similarity percentage simper analysis revealed that variability in fw301 was largely attributed to low abundance highly transient populations while variability in the most hydrochemically stable well fw303 was due to fluctuations in more highly abundant and frequently present taxa additionally the youngest well fw305 showed a dramatic shift in community composition towards the end of the sampling period that was not observed in the other wells suggesting possible succession events over time time series analysis using vector auto regressive models and granger causality showed unique relationships between richness and geochemistry over time in each well these results indicate temporally dynamic microbial communities over short time scales with day to day population shifts in local community structure influenced by available source community diversity and local

chapelle 2000 the microbiology and ecology of groundwater systems have only recently begun to be studied griebler and lueders 2009 interest in groundwater microorganisms and associated ecological

fields et al 2006 zinger et al 2012 references therein knowledge of the activity and composition of microorganisms in pristine groundwater environments have been far less studied sogin et al 2006 griebler and lueders 2009 caporaso et al 2010 zinger et al 2012 and understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics in groundwater environments is still in its early stages smith et al 2018 references therein he enigma oak ridge field research center eor frc established by the u s department of energy doe consists of several contaminated areas as well as a non contaminated background site multiple field wells in the background area access a shallow oligotrophic aquifer a clearer understanding of the natural variability in community structure in pristine aquifers is necessary to fully assess the impact of disturbances on aquifer environments the described study analyzed the spatial and temporal variability of microbial communities in a pristine aquifer at the eor frc and sought to answer the following questions 1 how similar are the hydrochemical parameters of three wells in an uncontaminated aquifer system located in close proximity to one another over time 2 how stable are the microbial communities within and across these wells over time 3 does potential functional capabilities of the microbial communities remain stable over time 4 what is the relationship between the groundwater geochemistry and microbial community composition over space and short time periods 2 materials and methods 2 1 site location the eor frc background site covers an area of approximately 1 63 km2 and is located in the tennessee west bear creek valley about 2 km away from any contaminated areas fig s1 the eor frc background site is heavily wooded the bear creek floodplain consists of perennial and ephemeral crosscutting streams which run through the area and feed into bear creek watson et al 2004 no known contaminants have been disposed at the background area of the eor frc throughout the history of doe operations the subsurface is comprised of underlying bedrock interbedded shale and limestones which weather into unconsolidated and lowly permeable clay rich saprolite watson et al 2004 the saprolitic layer in turn is overlain by approximately 0 5 3 m of organic and highly permeable clay rich soil solomon et al 1992 the water table underneath the chosen field wells is considered shallow lying approximately 6 6 m below the subsurface vertical flow of groundwater occurs in the upper porous layers however hydrological studies of the area show that preferential flow paths are created along fractures in the underlying rock tracer studies reveal that the flow paths are poorly connected in 3 dimensions solomon et al 1992 therefore while the three field wells chosen for this study tap into the same pristine aquifer it is concluded that the three wells lie along separate and unconnected flow paths within the same watershed 2 2 groundwater sampling the three field wells chosen were fw301 fw303 and fw305 and are considered shallow wells 17 m depth fig s1 installation of wells fw301 and fw303 was completed in december of 2000 and

performed to determine mean differences across weeks within each well and across wells constrained canonical correspondence analysis or cca and unconstrained detrended correspondence analysis or dca ordinations were carried out in r statistical package with vegan similarity percentage simper analysis using past statistical package hammer et al 2001 was used to determine specific otus contributing

granger causality in order to determine possible temporally lagged relationships between geochemistry and microbial diversity data was first imputed for every daily time point using the method of forsythe et al 1977 stationarity of detrended data was ensured via the augmented fuller dickey test adf test in r using the tseries package trapletti and hornik 2018 a starting lag time p of p 1 was used based on historic hydrologic data watson et al 2004 the lag time of p 1 represents a 2 day lag as the data points represent every other day sampling this starting lag time fell within the range of biologically relevant lag times based on calculated residence times for each well supplemental table 2 partial auto correlation plots of the residuals were used to assess the need and fit of the var models clarke and mirza 2006 to determine significant relationships granger causality was used in r using the aod package lesnoff and lancelot 2012 2 7 mechanisms underlying community assembly the relative roles of community assembly processes were quantified using a null model based framework proposed by stegen et al 2013 2015 the influence of selection was estimated based on nearest taxon index between communities βnti a turnover between two communities was considered to be governed by variable or homogeneous selection when the phylogenetic dissimilarity βmntd β mean nearest taxon distance was significantly higher βnti 2 or lower βnti 2 than null expectation fine and kembel 2011 webb et al 2008 stegen et al 2015 the turnovers with 2 βnti 2 are not differentiable from random patterns representing the influence of stochastic processes such as neutral dispersal drift etc stegen et al 2013 the relative role of a process in a well was measured as the percentage of temporal turnovers governed by this process stegen et al 2013 king et al 2017 the above null model analysis was performed on the rarefied data set 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical behavior is unique to each well and is unstable over observed time period although the three field wells chosen for this study were in close proximity to each other had the same underlying geology and tapped into the same uncontaminated aquifer all three wells showed differences in hydrochemical parameters to varying degrees each well differed significantly from each other p 0 01 in several hydrochemical measurements fig 1 additionally fw301 differed significantly from the other two wells in 7 of the 12 total hydrochemical parameters measured fig 1 figs s2a d fw301 showed the greatest degree of within well variability in measured geochemistry over time specifically for do conductivity and nitrate fig 1 table s1 fig s3 although fw303 had the highest levels of conductivity ph and nitrate it was also the most hydrochemically stable of the three wells overtime fig 1 additionally fw303 had the lowest measured concentrations of dissolved oxygen although temporary increases were observed during weeks 7 and 8 fig s3 fw305 a well that was cored 8 weeks prior to the start of this study was more hydrochemically stable than fw301 and behaved uniquely in that there was a steady increase in dissolved oxygen over time which coincided with greater ph instability towards the later weeks of the sampled time period fig s3 measured groundwater geochemistry over the three month time period was similar in all three wells for oxidation reduction potential as well as for organic acids acetate and propionate figs s2e g 3 2 microbial diversity and taxonomic composition is not similar across wells of close proximity in the same aquifer a total of 4091 groundwater otus were identified in all groundwater samples across all three wells over the tested time period of the total otus that passed quality filtering 1497 37 otus were classified as unidentifiable bacteria could not be identified at 80 confidence at the phylum level the total sampled groundwater diversity included 32 phyla 59 classes and 153 families diversity profiles based on hill s numbers also known as effective species numbers n eff showed that overall otu richness and unevenness was significantly higher for fw301 p value 0 001 fig 2 a these trends were unaffected by sampling depth as analysis using rarified samples show similar diversity profiles figs s7 and s8 in addition fw301 had a greater interquartile range at q 1 exponential shannon and q 2 inverse simpson compared to the other wells suggesting increased temporal variability in fw301 with respect to abundant and predominant otus fig 2a based on relative abundance charts all wells are largely dominated by proteobacteria with classes α β and γ proteobacteria having the highest representation fig s4 at higher taxonomic resolution each well is dominated by unique bacterial groups with the exception of comamonadaceae which is highly represented in all three wells fw303 is largely predominated by burkholderiales fig s4 and fw305 contains large representations of oxalobacteraceae and rhodobacteraceae in agreement with diversity measures fw301 is more highly diverse and does not have a clearly dominating family instead being intermittantly predominated by comamonadacea and various other proteobacteria over time fig s4 3 3 microbial community structure is unique over time across wells weekly mean richness varies significantly in fw301 f 10 10 2 856 p 0 057 but not in fw303 f 10 9 0 845 p 0 604 or fw305 f 10 9 1 004 p 0 502 indicating that rare and transient taxa contribute to much of the variability measured in fw301 but not in the other two wells fig 2 as q increases effects of rare otus are removed mean weekly diversity differs significantly in fw305 f 10 9 2 791 p 0 0689 for q 1 and f 10 9 3 589 p 0 0338 for q 2 but not for fw301 or fw303 this indicates weekly differences in community structure based on both abundant and dominant communities over time in fw305 but not in the other two wells these same results are obtained when performed on rarified samples standard mean errors sem of weekly mean diversity for all three indices measured are high for fw301 although anova s did not show significant difference across weeks as q increased high sem indicates high within week variability in fw301 only 20 bacterial taxa were observed in all groundwater samples across all 3 wells fig 3 table 1 as such these taxa can be considered as 20 shared bacterial groups in the system over the tested time period however 14 of these 20 taxa were observed at low relative abundances in each well 1 on most sampled dates table 1 fig 4 in other words only 6 of the shared groups comamonadaceae burkholderiales incertae sedis unclassified γ proteobacteria rhodocyclaceae oxalobacteraceae and sphingomonadaceae were moderately to highly abundant 1 and consistently present in at least half the samples in each well additionally 18 non shared groups were observed to be highly abundant 5 in at least one groundwater sample over the tested time period fig 3b at the phylum level each well experienced periodic blooms of firmicutes and deinococcus thermus however the dates and intensities of these blooms were unique in each well these results suggest that while only 6 taxa were observed to consistently predominate groundwater samples an additional 18 taxa transiently predominated over time in groundwater shifts in relative abundance of the 6 shared and consistently dominant bacterial groups combined with the transient presence of 18 additional taxa that are dominant on some days but lowly abundant in others across all wells contribute to a high degree of dissimilarity in bacterial groups in each well the wells are between 56 and 79 dissimilar to each other with regard to the otus present at any given time in any given well for otus 5 as measured via the sorensen index fig s5a and on average about 80 dissimilar with regard to the spatial and temporal shifts in the abundances of shared otus as measured by the bray curtis dissimilarity index fig s5b within each well a set of otus were identified as core otus if they were present in every sampled time point obtained for a given well the degree of transience was determined based on the percentage of all samples for which that otu was not observed missing absent from the dataset of that well each well had a unique set of core otus with fw301 having the greatest total number of core otus 106 and fw305 having the least 16 otus fig 5 a c 3 4 microbial community structure is highly variable within each well over time within well variability of otus present and the proportional representation in the respective community were observed to be very different from sampling event to sampling event and the degree of temporal variability within a single well was largely unexpected between sampling points the otus present in any given well differed on average between 41 and 74 fig s6 table s1 which contributed to significant differences in within well diversity in terms of richness in fw301 p value 0 05 and in the inverse simpson diversity measure in fw305 p value 0 034 from week to week fig 2b while the 20 shared bacterial groups represented a level of stability in the system temporal relative abundances of these taxa changed uniquely in each well fig 2a daily cumulative relative abundances of the 20 shared groups fluctuated over time ranging from 1 9 to 89 of the total daily measured groundwater diversity fig 3 however in fw303 the 20 groups maintained a cumulative relative abundance of 50 or greater in all samples therefore in fw303 shared groups made up over half of the community on all sampled time points indicating a level of structural stability not observed in the other two wells simper analysis was used to calculate the bray curtis dissimilarities between samples based on specific populations within each sample thus calculating the contributions of specific populations to the weekly changes in community structure in each well in fw301 otus mostly classified as β proteobacteria e g burkholderiales comamonadaceae rhodocyclaceae contributed significantly to the weekly differences fig s6 table s1 however fw301 was unique in that the cumulative abundance of contributing otus was typically less than 40 of the total measured abundance for any given date this data indicates that the majority of otus contributing to weekly dissimilarities in fw301 were moderately to rarely abundant on any given day with periodic blooms of different otus contributing largely to weekly dissimilarities in fw303 changes in relative abundances of the consistently present burkholderiales incertae sedis contributed highly to the weekly differences additionally unlike in fw301 the majority of otus with the most contributions to weekly dissimilarities were often highly abundant this indicates that the differences in this well were attributed to changes in the consistently abundant as opposed to the rarely transient populations fw305 had the highest proportion of comamonadaceae populations however a steady decline in relative abundances can be observed over time figs 3a and 4 s6 rhodocyclaceae and oxalobacteraceae also contributed significantly to changes in community structure over time in fw305 s6 an unconstrained ordination revealed patterns in fw305 not observed in the other two wells and distinct shifts in the bacterial taxa were observed that separated the sampled communities by time of sampling fig 6 a samples collected in july august were clustered followed by a sudden shift in the community in mid august communities sampled in the late august and september cluster distinctly apart from those of the earlier months the last two time points sampled in october are dramatically different in overall composition than any of the samples interestingly fw301 and fw303 were cored approximately 20 years ago while fw305 was cored 8 weeks prior to the start of this study the unconstrained analysis may reveal unique successional dynamics occurring as the surrounding subsurface environment was disturbed during the coring and the bacterial community responds to altered flow and or hydrochemical conditions 3 5 functional gene diversity displays less spatial and temporal dissimilarity based on ordination plots of functional gene arrays the functional gene diversity based on clusters of orthologous groups or cogs of the groundwater communities in the tested wells was more similar over time than the phylogenetic diversity fig 6 additionally the relative abundances of observed cogs were less variable over time as compared to the ssu rrna gene sequences fig 6 the functional potential within and across samples remained relatively constant throughout the three month study fig 7 and table 2 all three wells were enriched in cogs classified as metal homeostasis 27 stress 16 carbon cycling 16 and virulence 15 previous metagenomic comparisons between uncontaminated and contaminated groundwater have shown enrichment in different cogs of presumptive cation metal transporters hemme et al 2015 3 6 changes in diversity relate to hydrochemical fluctuations uniquely in each well canonical correlation analysis cca indicated potential hydrochemical drivers of community composition in each given well fig 8 according to the cca plots changes in fluoride conductivity sulfate and do are the greatest drivers for differences in community composition between the three background wells particularly fw301 and fw303 the results also suggested that acetate differentiated fw305 one limitation of correlation analysis is that it might not capture potential delays in response between changes in geochemistry and diversity within a well and vice versa additionally time series data are often inherently dependent and therefore do not meet the requirement of statistical independence pfaff 2008 to account for potential effect of time delayed responses as well as issues with dependent data vector autoregressive models var were used fig 9 table 3 to model the relationship between changes in richness and hydrochemistry including measured precipitation over time in each well for fw301 the results of the var models indicate that both dissolved oxygen and chloride are significantly affected by increases in richness in the case of dissolved oxygen increases in richness corresponded to decreases of do concentrations after 6 days p value 0 035 on the other hand increases in richness were modeled to precede increases in chloride with a delay of 2 days p value 0 022 for fw303 orp and conductivity had significant relationships with changes in richness increases in richness were modeled to occur 4 days after increases in conductivity p value 0 00195 interestingly while the cca plot showed that orp only had a minor influence in driving community composition in any well the var model indicated a strong bi directional granger causality between orp and richness following a 4 day time delay table 3 variables are considered to be cointegrated when long run equilibria are displayed masih and masih 1996 relationships in fw305 showed a high degree of cointegration data not shown such that traditional time series analysis using var models would have resulted in spurious results pfaff 2008 all modeled variables for fw305 were cointegrated with richness with the exception of the chloride and fluoride anions future work includes development and analyses with more appropriate models e g vector error correction models for the fw305 dataset 3 7 different ratios of deterministic and stochastic forces in sampled groundwater of the tested wells homogenous selection was the dominant calculated process with the majority of βnti comparisons being 2 suggesting strong biotic or abiotic pressures worked to select for closely related taxa from one day to the next table 4 based on the βnti analysis each well was also at least partially influenced by both deterministic and stochastic processes although each well was influenced by either process in different proportions fig 10 of all wells fw301 was the most affected by stochastic processes 35 which agrees with the high temporal variability observed in this well fw305 was primarily governed by strong selective pressures 93 homogeneous selection and was the well that was least influenced by undominated stochastic processes 7 this result supports the idea that this newly constructed well is undergoing deterministic selective pressures to shape microbial community composition 4 discussion groundwater systems and their indigenous microorganisms play a vital role in sustaining life both above and below the surface through major contributions to the water cycle goldscheider et al 2006 understanding the factors that affect microbial community structure and function is critical to meet present and future global demands of water maintenance and utilization however the connection between microbial diversity biogeohydrochemical processes and the flow of energy and resources between shallow subsurface ecotones is poorly understood in addition shallow subsurface ecotones include both groundwater and porous medium and therefore both aqueous and solid media are important and unique niches that impact resource allocation the current study focused on the variability of the aqueous phase of an uncontaminated oligotrophic aquifer despite having hydrological chemical and geological heterogeneity most groundwater systems are thought to be constant and predictable due to the nature of oligotrophic environments through similar transition zones griebler and lueders 2009 based upon these common sentiments temporal hydrological events have been hypothesized to impact changes particularly via redox shifts caused by hydraulic events over the time span of seasons vroblesky and chapelle 1994 haack et al 2004 zhou et al 2012 more recently temporal dynamics have also been attributed to environmental disturbances for example nutrient influxes e g hot spots and hot moments at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems mcclain et al 2003 or in the case of water systems the influx of additional water from the surrounding environment for example it has been shown that there can be direct transfer of nutrients and microbial populations within transitionally saturated and permanently saturated zones bougon et al 2011 yabusaki et al 2017 studies of the hyphoreic zone along the columbia river in washington usa have shown that seasonal changes in river height and overflow due to increased rainfall result in increased diversity of aquifer microbial communities lin et al 2012 however the opposite effect on diversity has also been documented rising groundwater levels due to seasonal effects on water table recharge were shown to accompany a drop in bacterial diversity attributed to dilution effects in spring and summer months in an alpine oligotrophic porous aquifer zhou et al 2012 the described study focused on the temporal dynamics of an uncontaminated groundwater system with limited hydraulic connectivity between sampling wells into groundwater housed within the same underlying geological formations both geochemistry and microbial communities were uniquely dynamic over space and time with varying degrees of fluctuation intensities and sparsely shared populations in fact few bacterial groups were shared by the 3 wells over the measured time span the results indicated a high degree of transience in groundwater bacterial taxa with the majority approximately 93 being transient over time in this study rainfall did not correlate to measured changes in diversity or hydrochemical fluctuations in the tested wells data not shown however it is worth noting that the study was conducted during the transition period between the drier summer months of july august and the fall months of september october all rain events below 2 cm except september 21 the high and low points for the background water table have historically been in the spring march april and late fall october respectively kim et al 2009 revil et al 2013 but the nature and duration of precipitation events has been changing i e climate change and further work is needed to better understand the temporal and spatial impacts of perturbation given that recharge in this aquifer occurs primarily via heavy rainfall events and vertical percolation of excess water to the saturation zone solomon et al 1992 which typically occurs during the wetter winter months the results indicate a high degree of variable biodiversity during the dry period future work is underway to better understand microbial community dynamics during the hydrological year for the uncontaminated and contaminated carbonate rock aquifers and the implications for ecosystem function temporal dynamics of microbial communities have been studied in other environments such as the human microbiome koenig et al 2011 plant flower shade et al 2013a surface soils wertz et al 2007 and other aquatic systems hofle et al 1999 shade et al 2007 a meta analysis surveying the temporal variability across various biomes shade et al 2013b demonstrated that areas with high physicochemical instability e g stream human palm varied considerably over time while more relatively stable environments e g soil varied less considerably suggesting that microbial communities might vary predictably across environments over time depending on physical and chemical gradients additionally environments likely undergoing succession e g infant gut flower surfaces display high levels of diversity and community composition shifts over time in the described study groundwater from a pristine aquifer previously believed to be hydrochemically stable displayed temporal changes of geochemistry e g orp do ph and conductivity to varying extents over short time scales days that were statistically significant fig 1 for fw301 the var models indicated that increases in species richness corresponded to subsequent decreases in do levels 6 days and increases in chloride 2 days a possible explanation could be altered population distributions are linked to microbial activity that impacts do consumption as well as anion cation balances between groundwater and sediments in addition fine scale changes micro environments in ph associated to microbial activity could also impact anion cation interactions with sediments for fw303 orp and conductivity were predicted to have bidirectional causal relationships with species richness similar to fw301 presumptive microbial activity could be linked to the population distributions and thereby impact orp and or balance of anion cations between groundwater and sediments further work is needed to delineate these relationships with actual bacterial activity for example bench scale packed bed reactors in which these field parameters can be controlled it is typically assumed that low levels of biodiversity may allow a conditionally consistent ecosystem to function efficiently while greater biodiversity would be needed in fluctuating environments humbert and dorigo 2005 spatiotemporal patterns in the distribution of bacterial communities have been observed along geochemical gradients such as those along acid mine drainage volant et al 2014 and hydrologically dynamic environments e g high groundwater surface water mixing such as hyphoreic zones of riverine systems stegen et al 2016 most of the work that has been done with pristine aquifers that are presumed to be more hydrodynamically stable suggests more constant microbial communities with low diversity mainly attributed to a more consistently oligotrophic environment griebler and lueders 2009 however with greater depth of spatial and temporal analyses our results indicate that a shallow groundwater system does experience hydrochemical and microbial taxa changes on short time frames although geochip analysis of functional diversity predicted a functionally stable community and this result could coincide with the notion of functional redundancy naeem and li 1997 in which high turnover of low abundance microbial groups could contribute significantly to maintenance of overall functions jousset et al 2017 moreover different hydrochemical parameters were shown to have significant relationships with changes in richness and diversity figs 8 and 9 table 3 but these relationships were different for each well in fact although homogenous selection was estimated to be the dominant ecological process for the three tested wells each well was predicted to have a unique ratio of deterministic and stochastic selection forces according βnti analyses future work is needed to track baseline system parameters over time in order to better understand perturbation impacts e g extreme weather and the impact on long term system functions in the most newly constructed well fw305 unique relationships observed suggest that this newly cored well may have been undergoing major shifts in community composition likely attributed to succession events following the coring event fig 4 the microbial variability in fw305 occurred among the most dominant community members the dca ordination also showed evidence of major compositional shifts over the three month sampling period in addition richness in fw305 was cointegrated with 10 of the 12 hydrochemical parameters measured by definition data that are co integrated must display granger causality in at least one direction pfaff 2008 in other words evidence of co integration between variables rules out granger non causality implying either unidirectional or bidirectional granger causality masih and masih 1996 since fw305 was only 8 weeks old prior to the start of sampling the co integration observed in this well likely describe the long term inter connected relationships between hydrology geology and microbial populations that became disrupted due to well construction further work is needed to track temporal variability of planktonic and sediment associated microbial communities in established and new wells including sediment surrogates king et al 2017 smith et al 2018 to better understand community dynamics impacted by coring interestingly the well with the highest overall hydrochemical and microbial variability fw301 also has a screen interval roughly 3x larger than fw303 and 2x larger than fw305 as such it is possible that the sampled formation water from fw301 originated from a greater range of depths of the vertical subsurface profile which could have resulted in greater mixing of different waters and higher measured variability in both sampled bacterial diversity and hydrochemical parameters the resulting greater sampling range may have resulted in the greater sampling of microorganisms originating from shallower depths of the soil profile variable infiltration of total dissolved solids from the surrounding weathered saprolite and or higher hydrochemical perturbations e g do organic differences in environmental parameters across depth that would lead to heterogeneous observations corroborate the idea that changes in hydrology and groundwater chemistry impact groundwater microbial communities flynn et al 2013 future work will focus on soil sampling across the transition zones and water sampling from wells with discrete depth intervals across longer time periods in order to further elucidate temporal relationships between hydrochemistry and bacterial diversity the existence and ubiquitous nature of rare microbial taxa in all types of environments has been well documented sogin et al 2006 bent and forney 2008 fuhrman 2009 pedrós alió 2012 and more recent analysis of temporal studies air water soil human have also documented the presence of rare taxa that occasionally bloom to dominant members of the community or remain at low abundance shade et al 2014 jousset et al 2017 the conditionally rare taxa crt were recently estimated to comprise up to 28 of community membership of a variety of different ecosystems represent a broad diversity of bacterial and archaeal lineages and explain large amounts of temporal community dissimilarities shade et al 2014 while the presence of periodically abundant groups were observed in all three wells fw301 had a much higher contribution of crt to the dominant taxa than the other two wells coinciding with higher overall diversity and hydrochemical instability over the sampled time period whether this is ecologically significant or a consequence of screen interval length is currently unknown however it may suggest an important role for rare taxa in the localized area of the aquifer in contrast sampled groundwater from a newer well fw305 showed higher temporal variability in the dominant taxa indicating selective pressures in this recently disturbed system given the unexpected extent of temporal variability in transient bacterial taxa for uncontaminated groundwater based upon commonly used pyrotag data the potential contribution of active and inactive cells is not known however the observed community dissimilarity for each well was constant over the tested time period and the composition of the diversity changed dependent upon the well in addition similar predominant bacterial groups proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes acidobacteria chloroflexi and nitrospirae were observed as in previous groundwater studies griebler and lueders 2009 stegen et al 2013 wegner et al 2019 moreover analysis of the same samples with the geochip demonstrated that functional gene diversity was more constant over the same time period it should be noted that geochip sensitivity microarray is different compared to direct sequence comparisons for the ssu rrna genes and future work should include functional gene diversity for selected processes of interest and or metagenomes in addition current work is underway to track general and specific microbial activity over time for groundwater systems to relate biodiversity and ecosystem function further investigations into the relationship between microbial diversity ephemeral populations transient hydrochemical flux and the contributions to overall microbial activity in groundwater systems are currently underway 5 conclusions freshwater resources are becoming jeopardized at alarming rates full assessment of uncontaminated groundwater composition both biotic and abiotic components over space and time are necessary to establish expected variability over both short and long term scales without such baselines observed changes to groundwater composition could be erroneously attributed to anthropogenic effects or other disturbance events this study showed for the first time that groundwater composition of an uncontaminated aquifer varies dynamically and uniquely over short time scales days and that each of the wells had a unique core bacterial community the different abundant and rare otus contributed to community dissimilarity respective to each well but homogenous selection was the dominant ecological force calculated for each well var models suggested that do cl orp and conductivity had granger causality with otu richness

18546,understanding microbial community structure and function within the subsurface is critical to assessing overall quality and maintenance of groundwater however the factors that determine microbial community assembly structure and function in groundwater systems and their impact on water quality remains poorly understood in this study three shallow wells fw301 fw303 fw305 in a non contaminated shallow aquifer in the enigma oak ridge field research center oak ridge tn were sampled approximately 3 times a week over a period of three months to measure changes in groundwater geochemistry and microbial diversity it was expected that the sampled microbial diversity from two historic field wells fw301 fw303 would be relatively stable while diversity from a newer well fw305 would be less stable over time the wells displayed some degree of hydrochemical variability over time unique to each well with fw303 being overall the most stable well and fw301 being the most dynamic based upon dissolved oxygen conductivity and nitrate community analysis via ss rrna paired end sequencing and distribution based clustering revealed higher otu richness diversity and variability in groundwater communities of fw301 than the other two wells for diversity binned over all time points microbial community composition of a given well was on average 50 dissimilar to any other well at a given time days yet functional gene diversity as measured with geochip remained relatively constant similarities in community structure across wells were observed with respect to the presence of 20 shared bacterial groups in all samples in all wells although at varying levels over the tested time period similarity percentage simper analysis revealed that variability in fw301 was largely attributed to low abundance highly transient populations while variability in the most hydrochemically stable well fw303 was due to fluctuations in more highly abundant and frequently present taxa additionally the youngest well fw305 showed a dramatic shift in community composition towards the end of the sampling period that was not observed in the other wells suggesting possible succession

introduction groundwater is an essential resource used by humans for drinking agriculture and industrial processes such as mining and energy production danielopol et al 2003 reilly et al 2008 currently global groundwater resources are being threatened by overuse depletion and contamination from a variety of sources including agricultural seepage i e nitrates and pesticides industrial processes pharmaceuticals personal care products landfill leaching and improperly managed wastewater treatment systems danielopol et al 2003 gerth and forstner 2004 sui et al 2015 additionally subsurface ecosystems are increasingly being disturbed via engineering efforts e g managed aquifer recharge systems lee and lee 2017 geothermal cooling van der gun et al 2016 often without a thorough investigation of the microbial ecological networks that may be perturbed understanding the role of microbial communities in uncontaminated pristine environments can help assessment of anthropological impacts on subsurface ecosystems and thus inform proper management of water resources while subsurface hydrology of groundwater aquifers has been well studied by hydrologists and hydrochemists chapelle 2000 the microbiology and ecology of groundwater systems have only recently begun to be studied griebler and lueders 2009 interest in groundwater microorganisms and associated ecological function has increased largely because of the emerging need to assess groundwater quality and fitness for human use for example determining possible vectors for disease or microbial potential to naturally attenuate contaminated water systems anderson and lovley 1997 chapelle 2000 langwaldt and puhakka 2000 fields et al 2006 other studies have uncovered the significant roles that microorganisms play in groundwater processes such as water geochemistry chapelle 2000 rates of mineral weathering in aquifers akob and küsel 2011 and the fate and transport of metals and organic compounds anderson and lovley 1997 fields et al 2006 hwang et al 2009 while much of the attention given to shallow aquifer systems has been on the effects of contamination and other disturbances fields et al 2006 zinger et al 2012 references therein knowledge of the activity and composition of microorganisms in pristine groundwater environments have been far less studied sogin et al 2006 griebler and lueders 2009 caporaso et al 2010 zinger et al 2012 and understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics in groundwater environments is still in its early stages smith et al 2018 references therein he enigma oak ridge field research center eor frc established by the u s department of energy doe consists of several contaminated areas as well as a non contaminated background site multiple field wells in the background area access a shallow oligotrophic aquifer a clearer understanding of the natural variability in community structure in pristine aquifers is necessary to fully assess the impact of disturbances on aquifer environments the described study analyzed the spatial and temporal variability of microbial communities in a pristine aquifer at the eor frc and sought to answer the following questions 1 how similar are the hydrochemical parameters of three wells in an uncontaminated aquifer system located in close proximity to one another over time 2 how stable are the microbial communities within and across these wells over time 3 does potential functional capabilities of the microbial communities remain stable over time 4 what is the relationship between the groundwater geochemistry and microbial community composition over space and short time periods 2 materials and methods 2 1 site location the eor frc background site covers an area of approximately 1 63 km2 and is located in the tennessee west bear creek valley about 2 km away from any contaminated areas fig s1 the eor frc background site is heavily wooded the bear creek floodplain consists of perennial and ephemeral crosscutting streams which run through the area and feed into bear creek watson et al 2004 no known contaminants have been disposed at the background area of the eor frc throughout the history of doe operations the subsurface is comprised of underlying bedrock interbedded shale and limestones which weather into unconsolidated and lowly permeable clay rich saprolite watson et al 2004 the saprolitic layer in turn is overlain by approximately 0 5 3 m of organic and highly permeable clay rich soil solomon et al 1992 the water table underneath the chosen field wells is considered shallow lying approximately 6 6 m below the subsurface vertical flow of groundwater occurs in the upper porous layers however hydrological studies of the area show that preferential flow paths are created along fractures in the underlying rock tracer studies reveal that the flow paths are poorly connected in 3 dimensions solomon et al 1992 therefore while the three field wells chosen for this study tap into the same pristine aquifer it is concluded that the three wells lie along separate and unconnected flow paths within the same watershed 2 2 groundwater sampling the three field wells chosen were fw301 fw303 and fw305 and are considered shallow wells 17 m depth fig s1 installation of wells fw301 and fw303 was completed in december of 2000 and september of 2001 respectively while fw305 was constructed on may 29 of 2013 supplementary table 4 provides detailed well characteristics filtered groundwater samples were collected approximately three times a week over approximately a three month period july 23 to october 8 2013 after 2 well volumes were purged from each well 4l of groundwater were filtered using a 10 μm filter to catch large

were substituted using a method similar to the ½ limit of detection rule used in environmental applications environmental protection agency 1996 singh and nocerino 2002 lactate was measured below

further filtered to remove rare otus rare otus were defined as otus that had a relative abundance of 10 6 across all groundwater samples haegeman et al 2013 the representative sequences were used to a

using r statistical package r core team 2017 richness and diversity using hill numbers as well as sorensen and bray curtis pair wise dissimilarities were determined in r with package vegan oksanen et al 2013 correlation analysis and linear regression models were used to identify relationships among the hydrochemical and microbial data using lme4 package bates 2010 analysis of variances anova was performed to determine mean differences across weeks within each well and across wells constrained canonical correspondence analysis or cca and unconstrained detrended correspondence analysis or dca ordinations were carried out in r statistical package with vegan similarity percentage simper analysis using past statistical package hammer et al 2001 was used to determine specific otus contributing

variation cv of the background was 0 8 and the signal intensity was 200 2 6 time series data analysis time series analyses were performed using vector autoregressive models var package pfaff 2007 and granger causality in order to determine possible temporally lagged relationships between geochemistry and microbial diversity data was first imputed for every daily time point using the method of forsythe et al 1977 stationarity of detrended data was ensured via the augmented fuller dickey test adf test in r using the tseries package trapletti and hornik 2018 a starting lag time p of p 1 was used based on historic hydrologic data watson et al 2004 the lag time of p 1 represents a 2 day lag as the data points represent every other day sampling this starting lag time fell within the range of biologically relevant lag times based on calculated residence times for each well supplemental table 2 partial auto correlation plots of the residuals were used to assess the need and fit of the var models clarke and mirza 2006 to determine significant relationships granger causality was used in r using the aod package lesnoff and lancelot 2012 2 7 mechanisms underlying community assembly the relative roles of community assembly processes were quantified using a null model based framework proposed by stegen et al 2013 2015 the influence of selection was estimated based on nearest taxon index between communities βnti a turnover between two communities was considered to be governed by variable or homogeneous selection when the phylogenetic dissimilarity βmntd β mean nearest taxon distance was significantly higher βnti 2 or lower βnti 2 than null expectation fine and kembel 2011 webb et al 2008 stegen et al 2015 the turnovers with 2 βnti 2 are not differentiable from random patterns representing the influence of stochastic processes such as neutral dispersal drift etc stegen et al 2013 the relative role of a process in a well was measured as the percentage of temporal turnovers governed by this process stegen et al 2013 king et al 2017 the above null model analysis was performed on the rarefied data set 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical behavior is unique to each well and is unstable over observed time period although the three field wells chosen for this study were in close proximity to each other had the same underlying geology and tapped into the same uncontaminated aquifer all three wells showed differences in hydrochemical parameters to varying degrees each well differed significantly from each other p 0 01 in several hydrochemical measurements fig 1 additionally fw301 differed significantly from the other two wells in 7 of the 12 total hydrochemical parameters measured fig 1 figs s2a d fw301 showed the greatest degree of within well variability in measured geochemistry over time specifically for do conductivity and nitrate fig 1 table s1 fig s3 although fw303 had the highest levels of conductivity ph and nitrate it was also the most hydrochemically stable of the three wells overtime fig 1 additionally fw303 had the lowest measured concentrations of dissolved oxygen although temporary increases were observed during weeks 7 and 8 fig s3 fw305 a well that was cored 8 weeks prior to the start of this study was more hydrochemically stable than fw301 and behaved uniquely in that there was a steady increase in dissolved oxygen over time which coincided with greater ph instability towards the later weeks of the sampled time period fig s3 measured groundwater geochemistry over the three month time period was similar in all three wells for oxidation reduction potential as well as for organic acids acetate and propionate figs s2e g 3 2 microbial diversity and taxonomic composition is not similar across wells of close proximity in the same aquifer a total of 4091 groundwater otus were identified in all groundwater samples across all three wells over the tested time period of the total otus that passed quality filtering 1497 37 otus were classified as unidentifiable bacteria could not be identified at 80 confidence at the phylum level the total sampled groundwater diversity included 32 phyla 59 classes and 153 families diversity profiles based on hill s numbers also known as effective species numbers n eff showed that overall otu richness and unevenness was significantly higher for fw301 p value 0 001 fig 2 a these trends were unaffected by sampling depth as analysis using rarified samples show similar diversity profiles figs s7 and s8 in addition fw301 had a greater interquartile range at q 1 exponential shannon and q 2 inverse simpson compared to the other wells suggesting increased temporal variability in fw301 with respect to abundant and predominant otus fig 2a based on relative abundance charts all wells are largely dominated by proteobacteria with classes α β and γ proteobacteria having the highest representation fig s4 at higher taxonomic resolution each well is dominated by unique bacterial groups with the exception of comamonadaceae which is highly represented in all three wells fw303 is largely predominated by burkholderiales fig s4 and fw305 contains large representations of oxalobacteraceae and rhodobacteraceae in agreement with diversity measures fw301 is more highly diverse and does not have a clearly dominating family instead being intermittantly predominated by comamonadacea and various other proteobacteria over time fig s4 3 3 microbial community structure is unique over time across wells weekly mean richness varies significantly in fw301 f 10 10 2 856 p 0 057 but not in fw303 f 10 9 0 845 p 0 604 or fw305 f 10 9 1 004 p 0 502 indicating that rare and transient taxa contribute to much of the variability measured in fw301 but not in the other two wells fig 2 as q increases effects of rare otus are removed mean weekly diversity differs significantly in fw305 f 10 9 2 791 p 0 0689 for q 1 and f 10 9 3 589 p 0 0338 for q 2 but not for fw301 or fw303 this indicates weekly differences in community structure based on both abundant and dominant communities over time in fw305 but not in the other two wells these same results are obtained when performed on rarified samples standard mean errors sem of weekly mean diversity for all three indices measured are high for fw301 although anova s did not show significant difference across weeks as q increased high sem indicates high within week variability in fw301 only 20 bacterial taxa were observed in all groundwater samples across all 3 wells fig 3 table 1 as such these taxa can be considered as 20 shared bacterial groups in the system over the tested time period however 14 of these 20 taxa were observed at low relative abundances in each well 1 on most sampled dates table 1 fig 4 in other words only 6 of the shared groups comamonadaceae burkholderiales incertae sedis unclassified γ proteobacteria rhodocyclaceae oxalobacteraceae and sphingomonadaceae were moderately to highly abundant 1 and consistently present in at least half the samples in each well additionally 18 non shared groups were observed to be highly abundant 5 in at least one groundwater sample over the tested time period fig 3b at the phylum level each well experienced periodic blooms of firmicutes and deinococcus thermus however the dates and intensities of these blooms were unique in each well these results suggest that while only 6 taxa were observed to consistently predominate groundwater samples an additional 18 taxa transiently predominated over time in groundwater shifts in relative abundance of the 6 shared and consistently dominant bacterial groups combined with the transient presence of 18 additional taxa that are dominant on some days but lowly abundant in others across all wells contribute to a high degree of dissimilarity in bacterial groups in each well the wells are between 56 and 79 dissimilar to each other with regard to the otus present at any given time in any given well for otus 5 as measured via the sorensen index fig s5a and on average about 80 dissimilar with regard to the spatial and temporal shifts in the abundances of shared otus as measured by the bray curtis dissimilarity index fig s5b within each well a set of otus were identified as core otus if they were present in every sampled time point obtained for a given well the degree of transience was determined based on the percentage of all samples for which that otu was not observed missing absent from the dataset of that well each well had a unique set of core otus with fw301 having the greatest total number of core otus 106 and fw305 having the least 16 otus fig 5 a c 3 4 microbial community structure is highly variable within each well over time within well variability of otus present and the proportional representation in the respective community were observed to be very different from sampling event to sampling event and the degree of temporal variability within a single well was largely unexpected between sampling points the otus present in any given well differed on average between 41 and 74 fig s6 table s1 which contributed to significant differences in within well diversity in terms of richness in fw301 p value 0 05 and in the inverse simpson diversity measure in fw305 p value 0 034 from week to week fig 2b while the 20 shared bacterial groups represented a level of stability in the system temporal relative abundances of these taxa changed uniquely in each well fig 2a daily cumulative relative abundances of the 20 shared groups fluctuated over time ranging from 1 9 to 89 of the total daily measured groundwater diversity fig 3 however in fw303 the 20 groups maintained a cumulative relative abundance of 50 or greater in all samples therefore in fw303 shared groups made up over half of the community on all sampled time points indicating a level of structural stability not observed in the other two wells simper analysis was used to calculate the bray curtis dissimilarities between samples based on specific populations within each sample thus calculating the contributions of specific populations to the weekly changes in community structure in each well in fw301 otus mostly classified as β proteobacteria e g burkholderiales comamonadaceae rhodocyclaceae contributed significantly to the weekly differences fig s6 table s1 however fw301 was unique in that the cumulative abundance of contributing otus was typically less than 40 of the total measured abundance for any given date this data indicates that the majority of otus contributing to weekly dissimilarities in fw301 were moderately to rarely abundant on any given day with periodic blooms of different otus contributing largely to weekly dissimilarities in fw303 changes in relative abundances of the consistently present burkholderiales incertae sedis contributed highly to the weekly differences additionally unlike in fw301 the majority of otus with the most contributions to weekly dissimilarities were often highly abundant this indicates that the differences in this well were attributed to changes in the consistently abundant as opposed to the rarely transient populations fw305 had the highest proportion of comamonadaceae populations however a steady decline in relative abundances can be observed over time figs 3a and 4 s6 rhodocyclaceae and oxalobacteraceae also contributed significantly to changes in community structure over time in fw305 s6 an unconstrained ordination revealed patterns in fw305 not observed in the other two wells and distinct shifts in the bacterial taxa were observed that separated the sampled communities by time of sampling fig 6 a samples collected in july august were clustered followed by a sudden shift in the community in mid august communities sampled in the late august and september cluster distinctly apart from those of the earlier months the last two time points sampled in october are dramatically different in overall composition than any of the samples interestingly fw301 and fw303 were cored approximately 20 years ago while fw305 was cored 8 weeks prior to the start of this study the unconstrained analysis may reveal unique successional dynamics occurring as the surrounding subsurface environment was disturbed during the coring and the bacterial community responds to altered flow and or hydrochemical conditions 3 5 functional gene diversity displays less spatial and temporal dissimilarity based on ordination plots of functional gene arrays the functional gene diversity based on clusters of orthologous groups or cogs of the groundwater communities in the tested wells was more similar over time than the phylogenetic diversity fig 6 additionally the relative abundances of observed cogs were less variable over time as compared to the ssu rrna gene sequences fig 6 the functional potential within and across samples remained relatively constant throughout the three month study fig 7 and table 2 all three wells were enriched in cogs classified as metal homeostasis 27 stress 16 carbon cycling 16 and virulence 15 previous metagenomic comparisons between uncontaminated and contaminated groundwater have shown enrichment in different cogs of presumptive cation metal transporters hemme et al 2015 3 6 changes in diversity relate to hydrochemical fluctuations uniquely in each well canonical correlation analysis cca indicated potential hydrochemical drivers of community composition in each given well fig 8 according to the cca plots changes in fluoride conductivity sulfate and do are the greatest drivers for differences in community composition between the three background wells particularly fw301 and fw303 the results also suggested that acetate differentiated fw305 one limitation of correlation analysis is that it might not capture potential delays in response between changes in geochemistry and diversity within a well and vice versa additionally time series data are often inherently dependent and therefore do not meet the requirement of statistical independence pfaff 2008 to account for potential effect of time delayed responses as well as issues with dependent data vector autoregressive models var were used fig 9 table 3 to model the relationship between changes in richness and hydrochemistry including measured precipitation over time in each well for fw301 the results of the var models indicate that both dissolved oxygen and chloride are significantly affected by increases in richness in the case of dissolved oxygen increases in richness corresponded to decreases of do concentrations after 6 days p value 0 035 on the other hand increases in richness were modeled to precede increases in chloride with a delay of 2 days p value 0 022 for fw303 orp and conductivity had significant relationships with changes in richness increases in richness were modeled to occur 4 days after increases in conductivity p value 0 00195 interestingly while the cca plot showed that orp only had a minor influence in driving community composition in any well the var model indicated a strong bi directional granger causality between orp and richness following a 4 day time delay table 3 variables are considered to be cointegrated when long run equilibria are displayed masih and masih 1996 relationships in fw305 showed a high degree of cointegration data not shown such that traditional time series analysis using var models would have resulted in spurious results pfaff 2008 all modeled variables for fw305 were cointegrated with richness with the exception of the chloride and fluoride anions future work includes development and analyses with more appropriate models e g vector error correction models for the fw305 dataset 3 7 different ratios of deterministic and stochastic forces in sampled groundwater of the tested wells homogenous selection was the dominant calculated process with the majority of βnti comparisons being 2 suggesting strong biotic or abiotic pressures worked to select for closely related taxa from one day to the next table 4 based on the βnti analysis each well was also at least partially influenced by both deterministic and stochastic processes although each well was influenced by either process in different proportions fig 10 of all wells fw301 was the most affected by stochastic processes 35 which agrees with the high temporal variability observed in this well fw305 was primarily governed by strong selective pressures 93 homogeneous selection and was the well that was least influenced by undominated stochastic processes 7 this result supports the idea that this newly constructed well is undergoing deterministic selective pressures to shape microbial community composition 4 discussion groundwater systems and their indigenous microorganisms play a vital role in sustaining life both above and below the surface through major contributions to the water cycle goldscheider et al 2006 understanding the factors that affect microbial community structure and function is critical to meet present and future global demands of water maintenance and utilization however the connection between microbial diversity biogeohydrochemical processes and the flow of energy and resources between shallow subsurface ecotones is poorly understood in addition shallow subsurface ecotones include both groundwater and porous medium and therefore both aqueous and solid media are important and unique niches that impact resource allocation the current study focused on the variability of the aqueous phase of an uncontaminated oligotrophic aquifer despite having hydrological chemical and geological heterogeneity most groundwater systems are thought to be constant and predictable due to the nature of oligotrophic environments through similar transition zones griebler and lueders 2009 based upon these common sentiments temporal hydrological events have been hypothesized to impact changes particularly via redox shifts caused by hydraulic events over the time span of seasons vroblesky and chapelle 1994 haack et al 2004 zhou et al 2012 more recently temporal dynamics have also been attributed to environmental disturbances for example nutrient influxes e g hot spots and hot moments at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems mcclain et al 2003 or in the case of water systems the influx of additional water from the surrounding environment for example it has been shown that there can be direct transfer of nutrients and microbial populations within transitionally saturated and permanently saturated zones bougon et al 2011 yabusaki et al 2017 studies of the hyphoreic zone along the columbia river in washington usa have shown that seasonal changes in river height and overflow due to increased rainfall result in increased diversity of aquifer microbial communities lin et al 2012 however the opposite effect on diversity has also been documented rising groundwater levels due to seasonal effects on water table recharge were shown to accompany a drop in bacterial diversity attributed to dilution effects in spring and summer months in an alpine oligotrophic porous aquifer zhou et al 2012 the described study focused on the temporal dynamics of an uncontaminated groundwater system with limited hydraulic connectivity between sampling wells into groundwater housed within the same underlying geological formations both geochemistry and microbial communities were uniquely dynamic over space and time with varying degrees of fluctuation intensities and sparsely shared populations in fact few bacterial groups were shared by the 3 wells over the measured time span the results indicated a high degree of transience in groundwater bacterial taxa with the majority approximately 93 being transient over time in this study rainfall did not correlate to measured changes in diversity or hydrochemical fluctuations in the tested wells data not shown however it is worth noting that the study was conducted during the transition period between the drier summer months of july august and the fall months of september october all rain events below 2 cm except september 21 the high and low points for the background water table have historically been in the spring march april and late fall october respectively kim et al 2009 revil et al 2013 but the nature and duration of precipitation events has been changing i e climate change and further work is needed to better understand the temporal and spatial impacts of perturbation given that recharge in this aquifer occurs primarily via heavy rainfall events and vertical percolation of excess water to the saturation zone solomon et al 1992 which typically occurs during the wetter winter months the results indicate a high degree of variable biodiversity during the dry period future work is underway to better understand microbial community dynamics during the hydrological year for the uncontaminated and contaminated carbonate rock aquifers and the implications for ecosystem function temporal dynamics of microbial communities have been studied in other environments such as the human microbiome koenig et al 2011 plant flower shade et al 2013a surface soils wertz et al 2007 and other aquatic systems hofle et al 1999 shade et al 2007 a meta analysis surveying the temporal variability across various biomes shade et al 2013b demonstrated that areas with high physicochemical instability e g stream human palm varied considerably over time while more relatively stable environments e g soil varied less considerably suggesting that microbial communities might vary predictably across environments over time depending on physical and chemical gradients additionally environments likely undergoing succession e g infant gut flower surfaces display high levels of diversity and community composition shifts over time in the described study groundwater from a pristine aquifer previously believed to be hydrochemically stable displayed temporal changes of geochemistry e g orp do ph and conductivity to varying extents over short time scales days that were statistically significant fig 1 for fw301 the var models indicated that increases in species richness corresponded to subsequent decreases in do levels 6 days and increases in chloride 2 days a possible explanation could be altered population distributions are linked to microbial activity that impacts do consumption as well as anion cation balances between groundwater and sediments in addition fine scale changes micro environments in ph associated to microbial activity could also impact anion cation interactions with sediments for fw303 orp and conductivity were predicted to have bidirectional causal relationships with species richness similar to fw301 presumptive microbial activity could be linked to the population distributions and thereby impact orp and or balance of anion cations between groundwater and sediments further work is needed to delineate these relationships with actual bacterial activity for example bench scale packed bed reactors in which these field parameters can be controlled it is typically assumed that low levels of biodiversity may allow a conditionally consistent ecosystem to function efficiently while greater biodiversity would be needed in fluctuating environments humbert and dorigo 2005 spatiotemporal patterns in the distribution of bacterial communities have been observed along geochemical gradients such as those along acid mine drainage volant et al 2014 and hydrologically dynamic environments e g high groundwater surface water mixing such as hyphoreic zones of riverine systems stegen et al 2016 most of the work that has been done with pristine aquifers that are presumed to be more hydrodynamically stable suggests more constant microbial communities with low diversity mainly attributed to a more consistently oligotrophic environment griebler and lueders 2009 however with greater depth of spatial and temporal analyses our results indicate that a shallow groundwater system does experience hydrochemical and microbial taxa changes on short time frames although geochip analysis of functional diversity predicted a functionally stable community and this result could coincide with the notion of functional redundancy naeem and li 1997 in which high turnover of low abundance microbial groups could contribute significantly to maintenance of overall functions jousset et al 2017 moreover different hydrochemical parameters were shown to have significant relationships with changes in richness and diversity figs 8 and 9 table 3 but these relationships were different for each well in fact although homogenous selection was estimated to be the dominant ecological process for the three tested wells each well was predicted to have a unique ratio of deterministic and stochastic selection forces according βnti analyses future work is needed to track baseline system parameters over time in order to better understand perturbation impacts e g extreme weather and the impact on long term system functions in the most newly constructed well fw305 unique relationships observed suggest that this newly cored well may have been undergoing major shifts in community composition likely attributed to succession events following the coring event fig 4 the microbial variability in fw305 occurred among the most dominant community members the dca ordination also showed evidence of major compositional shifts over the three month sampling period in addition richness in fw305 was cointegrated with 10 of the 12 hydrochemical parameters measured by definition data that are co integrated must display granger causality in at least one direction pfaff 2008 in other words evidence of co integration between variables rules out granger non causality implying either unidirectional or bidirectional granger causality masih and masih 1996 since fw305 was only 8 weeks old prior to the start of sampling the co integration observed in this well likely describe the long term inter connected relationships between hydrology geology and microbial populations that became disrupted due to well construction further work is needed to track temporal variability of planktonic and sediment associated microbial communities in established and new wells including sediment surrogates king et al 2017 smith et al 2018 to better understand community dynamics impacted by coring interestingly the well with the highest overall hydrochemical and microbial variability fw301 also has a screen interval roughly 3x larger than fw303 and 2x larger than fw305 as such it is possible that the sampled formation water from fw301 originated from a greater range of depths of the vertical subsurface profile which could have resulted in greater mixing of different waters and higher measured variability in both sampled bacterial diversity and hydrochemical parameters the resulting greater sampling range may have resulted in the greater sampling of microorganisms originating from shallower depths of the soil profile variable infiltration of total dissolved solids from the surrounding weathered saprolite and or higher hydrochemical perturbations e g do organic differences in environmental parameters across depth that would lead to heterogeneous observations corroborate the idea that changes in hydrology and groundwater chemistry impact groundwater microbial communities flynn et al 2013 future work will focus on soil sampling across the transition zones and water sampling from wells with discrete depth intervals across longer time periods in order to further elucidate temporal relationships between hydrochemistry and bacterial diversity the existence and ubiquitous nature of rare microbial taxa in all types of environments has been well documented sogin et al 2006 bent and forney 2008 fuhrman 2009 pedrós alió 2012 and more recent analysis of temporal studies air water soil human have also documented the presence of rare taxa that occasionally bloom to dominant members of the community or remain at low abundance shade et al 2014 jousset et al 2017 the conditionally rare taxa crt were recently estimated to comprise up to 28 of community membership of a variety of different ecosystems represent a broad diversity of bacterial and archaeal lineages and explain large amounts of temporal community dissimilarities shade et al 2014 while the presence of periodically abundant groups were observed in all three wells fw301 had a much higher contribution of crt to the dominant taxa than the other two wells coinciding with higher overall diversity and hydrochemical instability over the sampled time period whether this is ecologically significant or a consequence of screen interval length is currently unknown however it may suggest an important role for rare taxa in the localized area of the aquifer in contrast sampled groundwater from a newer well fw305 showed higher temporal variability in the dominant taxa indicating selective pressures in this recently disturbed system given the unexpected extent of temporal variability in transient bacterial taxa for uncontaminated groundwater based upon commonly used pyrotag data the potential contribution of active and inactive cells is not known however the observed community dissimilarity for each well was constant over the tested time period and the composition of the diversity changed dependent upon the well in addition similar predominant bacterial groups proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes acidobacteria chloroflexi and nitrospirae were observed as in previous groundwater studies griebler and lueders 2009 stegen et al 2013 wegner et al 2019 moreover analysis of the same samples with the geochip demonstrated that functional gene diversity was more constant over the same time period it should be noted that geochip sensitivity microarray is different compared to direct sequence comparisons for the ssu rrna genes and future work should include functional gene diversity for selected processes of interest and or metagenomes in addition current work is underway to track general and specific microbial activity over time for groundwater systems to relate biodiversity and ecosystem function further investigations into the relationship between microbial diversity ephemeral populations transient hydrochemical flux and the contributions to overall microbial activity in groundwater systems are currently underway 5 conclusions freshwater resources are becoming jeopardized at alarming rates full assessment of uncontaminated groundwater composition both biotic and abiotic components over space and time are necessary to establish expected variability over both short and long term scales without such baselines observed changes to groundwater composition could be erroneously attributed to anthropogenic effects or other disturbance events this study showed for the first time that groundwater composition of an uncontaminated aquifer varies dynamically and uniquely over short time scales days and that each of the wells had a unique core bacterial community the different abundant and rare otus contributed to community dissimilarity respective to each well but homogenous selection was the dominant ecological force calculated for each well var models suggested that do cl orp and conductivity had granger causality with otu richness

18547,equilibrium of three reactants oxygen proton and electron in oxygen reduction reaction at large current flux is necessary for highly efficient electro generation of h2o2 in this work we investigated reactants equilibrium and h2o2 electrochemical production in liquid gas solid three phase interfaces on rolling cathodes with high electroactive area electrocatalytic reaction accelerated the electrolyte intrusion into hydrophobic porous catalyst layer for higher electroactive surface area resulting in a 21 increase of h2o2 yield at 15 ma cm 2 air aerated cathode submerged in air o2 aeration solution was unable to produce h2o2 efficiently due to the lack of o2 in three phase interfaces tpis especially at current density 2 5 ma cm 2 for air breathing cathode stable tpis inside the active sites was created by addition of gas diffusion layer to increase h2o2 production from 11 2 to 172 11 mg l 1 h 1 at 15 ma cm 2 pressurized air flow application enhanced both oxygen supply and h2o2 departure transfer to obtain a high h2o2 production of 461 11 mg l 1 h 1 with ce of 89 2 at 35 ma cm 2 45 higher than passive gas transfer systems our findings provided a new insight of carbonaceous air cathode performance in producing h2o2 providing important information for the practical application and amplification of cathodes in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords h2o2 electrocatalysis oxygen reduction reaction three phase interfaces air breathing cathode 1 introduction hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is an important chemical reagent which is widely used in pulp and paper bleaching textile industry and detergent industry due to its strong oxidizing campos martin et al 2006 especially in the field of chemical engineering and environmental protection h2o2 is used in the advanced oxidation processes aops to generate reactive free radicals oh eº oh h2o 1 9 2 7 v rate constant 106 1010 m 1 s 1 sires et al 2014 for tertiary treatment and disinfection of water ki et al 2017 miklos et al 2018 the major drawback of aops is the high cost of reagents consumption in industrial scale h2o2 is produced by the anthraquinone oxidation ao process it needs hydrogenation oxidation extraction purification and concentration which is a multistep process requires massive energy input and generates waste campos martin et al 2006 although the sales price of h2o2 has reduced to 700 1200 t 1 ciriminna et al 2016 the transportation storage and handling of bulk h2o2 involve risk and escalating expenses in addition the crude h2o2 obtained from factory is purified and concentrated to the mass concentration over 35 for market much higher than the required concentration of aops usually 0 1 wt the concentration dilution process of h2o2 is a hassle and a waste of resources young et al 2016 in conclusion in situ generation and utilization of h2o2 is safe convenient and energy efficient for aops application over the recent two decades electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have gained increasing attention for its high degradation rate effective removal and low energy consumption brillas et al 2009 except for anodic oxidation ao h2o2 is produced on the cathode through two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr eq 1 and then oh is obtained in the bulk by catalyzing the electrogenerated h2o2 with o3 artificial light fe2 sono or natural sunlight respectively moreira et al 2017 wang et al 2018a b eaops have been applied for remediation of various kinds of wastewaters including textile wastewaters vaghela et al 2005 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 pharmaceutical wastewaters moreira et al 2014 landfill leachates moreira et al 2015a 2016 winery wastewaters moreira et al 2015b and cyanobacterial boom waters an et al 2019 a high yield of h2o2 is a prerequisite for the high efficiency of the eaops to increase the yield of h2o2 various cathodic catalyst materials have been developed including metal catalyst liao et al 2013 alloy jirkovsky et al 2011 and carbon materials carbon nanotubes cnt carbon back and graphite gao et al 2015 among these materials carbonaceous material is the best choice because of its large specific surface area high conductivity strong corrosion resistance and low price 1 2 h o2 2 e h2o2 after nearly two decades of development the most popular carbonaceous cathodes used in the eaops were graphite based cathodes graphite felt graphite granule etc which were submerged in electrolyte with air or pure o2 aeration yang et al 2017 chen et al 2014 dissolved oxygen do or oxygen microbubbles diffused into the electrode to reach active sites and then react with the electrolyte till now this kind of carbonaceous cathode has been applied in several eaops for various persistent organic pollution pops degradation moreira et al 2017 however most of researchers focused on the pops degradation pathway and kinetic mechanism besides the great majority of works have been performed at the laboratory scale with reactors volume lower than 1 l eaop technology is in pressing need of passing to pilot scale reactor design and even to industrialized application to treat large amount of wastewater sires et al 2014 moreira et al 2017 rapid accumulation of h2o2 to sufficient concentration in large volume water is the prerequisite of industrialized application which need the efficient h2o2 production of cathode at large current flux eq 1 showed that the 2 electron orr needs proton oxygen and electron as reactants with mole ratio of 2 1 2 and these three partners are from liquid gas and electrode respectively on one hand only the active sites stay in three phase interfaces tpis could catalyze the orr on the other hand liquid gas solid three phase equilibrium inside the cathode is vital to the efficient production of h2o2 yang et al 2018 pointed out the performance of the cathode strongly influences the overall cost of eaops improvement of catalyst performance would be the main solution for cost reduction devoted to reducing costs while ensuring the efficient performance of the air cathodes in engineering applications a sandwich like air breathing cathode fabricated by rolling method was developed which needed no aeration or pressurized gas to generate h2o2 instead of expensive multistep prepared cnts or graphene the cathode was prepared from raw graphite and carbon black powder making it cheap and easy to fabricate this paper investigated the performance of cathodes at large current density j and the catalysis mechanism based on the tpis of the rolling porous catalyst layer two kinds of air cathodes were fabricated based on the same catalyst layer and different o2 supply modes the electrochemical techniques including linear sweep voltammetry lsv cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were employed to analyze the different electrochemical characteristics the oxygen and hydrogen content in the electrolyte were in situ monitored using microsensors to determine the reduction reaction on the cathode the optimal condition in h2o2 production was investigated by identifying the fates of h2o and o2 in the porous cathode furthermore pressurized air was utilized to adjust the tpis and the mechanism of h2o2 production improvement was discussed 2 methods and materials 2 1 fabrication of different air cathodes the carbonaceous air breathing cathodes are consisted of a catalyst layer cl a gas diffusion layer gdl and a stainless steel mesh ssm in the middle as the matrix and current collector the cathodes were fabricated according to the rolling procedure previously reported by our group li et al 2016 2017 in brief cl consists of graphite 40 μm htf0325 99 9 huatai chemical reagent co ltd qingdao china carbon black cb 30 nm vulcan xc 72r cabot corporation us and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe emulsion 60 horizon shanghai china as binder the dough like mixture was roll pressed on one side of the ssm type 304n 60 meshes detiannuo commercial trade co ltd tianjin china to be a 0 5 mm flat sheet with catalyst coating 50 3 6 mg cm 2 the gdls were made by rolling a mixture of carbon black and ptfe emulsion with a mass ratio of 4 9 according to the procedure described previously an et al 2017 gdls were then rolled onto another side of ssm to form a final air breathing cathode named as abc with a total thickness of 1 mm as a control group another kind of air cathode was fabricated consisting of the same cl and ssm as abc in order to prevent direct contact between ssm and electrolyte insulation glue instead of gdl was coated on the other side of the ssm this kind of air cathode needs to operate under complete immersion with air aeration noted as air aerated cathode named as aac 2 2 reactor configuration and operation as shown in fig 1 a the assembled muti chamber reactor included electrolytic cell electrodes air chamber and a low pressure gauge the electrolytic cell consisted of two compartments with cavity indoor dimensions of 5 7 10 cm and 2 7 10 cm respectively separated by a cation exchange membrane 4 4 cm ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international inc glen rock nj usa the air breathing cathode was assembled tightly between the reaction chamber and air chamber 2 7 10 cm with cl facing to the electrolyte and gdl facing to the air two vessels were connected with the air chamber if needed the reactor could become single chamber by disassembling air chamber and the smaller electrolytic cell fig s1 titanium coated with iridium oxide ti iro2 plate 5 8 0 1 cm was placed 2 cm away from air breathing cathode in parallel and used as the anode in all of the electrolytic experiments titanium wires 1 mm diameter aida tech co ltd tianjin china were used to connect the electrodes the h2o2 electrochemical production experiments were operated in the undivided electrolytic cell containing 50 mm na2so4 0 3 l unless special illustration galvanostatic mode was applied with a dc power kd3005d korad china if needed 0 5 2 0 l min 1 air o2 n2 could be separately or together aerated into the electrolyte to control the oxygen content of the electrolyte 0 1200 μm at certain intervals 2 ml samples were taken to analyze the concentration of h2o2 formed the performance of the cathodes with pressurized air flow was examined as follows the air inlet rate was stabilized at 1 0 l min 1 and the applied pressure of the air chamber was adjusted over a range of 0 30 kpa by controlling the exhausting rate of air pressures were stabilized over 10 min before measurements it was found the abc with thickness of 1 mm could not withstand pressure over 25 kpa in the preliminary experiments all tests were conducted over 0 20 kpa with increasing pressure at 5 kpa intervals all analyses were conducted in triplicate to ensure consistency and reproducibility the results are presented with errors bars sd standard deviation in the following sections 2 3 chemical and electrochemical analysis cv eis and lsv were conducted using the electrochemical analyzer autolab pgstat 302n metrohm switzerland and the companion software nova cv was performed in a three electrode cell including a working electrode air cathodes a silver chloride reference electrode ag agcl 4 0 m kcl with e 0 198 v she and a counter electrode platinum sheet pt aida tech co ltd tianjin china in solution of 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 and 1 0 m kcl the potentials mentioned here were all versus ag agcl except as noted cv was used to determine the electroactive surface in a potential range of 0 8 v to 0 2 at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 according to previous studies mousset et al 2016 lsv and eis were used to study the electrochemical behavior of air cathodes during electro generation of h2o2 in a three electrode cell comprised of 50 mm na2so4 the electrolyte was bubbled with air o2 n2 for 20 min before analysis the curves were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 with the potential ranging from 0 3 to 2 0 v eis was measured at 0 5 v over a frequency range of 50 khz to 0 1 hz with a sinusoidal perturbation signal amplitude of 10 mv le et al 2015 o2 and h2 in the electrolyte were monitored using microsensors connected to a micromanipulator and a multimeter mm meter unisense aarhus n denmark during the electrolysis experiments zhou et al 2018a the concentration of h2o2 was measured by the potassium titanium iv oxalate method at λ 400 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer the basis of this method is the formation of titanium iv peroxide complex in the presence of sulfuric acid chen et al 2014 the iron content was measured by phenanthroline spectrophotometry wang et al 2018a b all these experiments and electrochemical tests were performed at ambient temperature 25 1 c 2 4 calculations in order to ensure the electroactive surface area of the electrodes randles sevcik formula was used as follows wen et al 2009 2 i p 2 69 10 5 a c d 1 2 n 3 2 v 1 2 where i p is the peak current taken from the baseline of

investigate liquid intrusion in tpis of abc fig s1a in the initial stage h2o2 production of abc continuously increased during first 6 rounds and then reached a plateau as showed in fig 2 a the h2o2 production at round 1 was 150 6 mg l 1 h 1 and increased by 21 181 5 mg l 1 h 1 at round 6 ce increased from 68 3 to 82 2 simultaneously the electrochemical behavior of cl was studied with cv in the ferrocyanide system because the redox wave of fe cn 6 3 fe cn 6 4 is sensitive to the surface chemistry of carbon based electrodes yang et al 2017 le et al 2015 cv results fig 2b showed that the cl presented favorable voltammetric responses with high electrochemical reversibility the peak to peak separation δe p has reduced 30 from 117 to 81 mv manifesting the decrease of electrode resistance due to the increasing operation time patel et al 2013 this was further confirmed by the 4 fold increase of peak current density j p from 0 3 to 1 5 ma cm 2 after 180 min of operation table s1 according to randles sevcik equation the electroactive surface areas were calculated to be 3 cm2 at beginning and then gradually increased up to 14 cm2 after round 6 the intrusion of the electrolyte towards cathodes enlarged the orr active sites to further increase cathode performance for h2o2 production as a strong piece of evidence after tearing off the gdl the electrolyte exudated from cl after about 180 min operation while no exudation was observed after 48 h of magnetic stirring without power supply fig s2 the h2o2 production of cathode without gdl was recorded in table s2 and same trend was observed as a control group the j p of abc only had a 1 6 fold final increase from 0 3 to 0 8 ma cm 2 after 18 h of soaking fig 2c proving the electrocatalytic reaction could accelerate the electrolyte intrusion inside the porous cl and result in the increase of active surface during the orr eis is a facile and efficient tool for investigating the interface properties and capability of electron transfer between the electrode and electroactive substance le et al 2016 according to nyquist plots with different operation time fig s3 the fitting resistance components of the cathodes were intuitively presented in fig 2d the ohmic resistance r o and charge transfer resistance r ct of fresh cathodes were 16 0 4 and 6 0 2 ω respectively after 180 min of operation r o and r ct finally decreased by 38 and 50 to 9 8 0 2 ω and 3 0 2 ω indicating more electrolyte entered the porous channel of the cl and turned air solid two phase interfaces into liquid gas solid tpis resulting in higher charge transfer efficiency the enhanced electroactive surface area and electrical conductivity of operated cathodes would thus improve the orr activity which was corroborated the increase in h2o2 production fig 2a 3 2 effect of oxygen supply in tpis in order to investigate the effect of oxygen diffusion on tpis for h2o2 production aac and abc were operated in undivided electrolytic cells as shown in fig 3 a the h2o2 production of aac decreased from 31 2 to 11 2 mg l 1 h 1 ce from 84 8 to 5 1 with j increased from 2 5 to 15 ma cm 2 meanwhile h2 accumulation in the bulk solution increased from 21 to 122 μm in 60 min fig s5a although pure o2 was continuously aerated into the electrolyte at surface of cathode it was still unable to provide enough o2 for the internal active sites of the porous catalyst layer resulting in the degradation of electrode performance consider the do kept stable at 1203 6 μm during operation fig s4b it is believed that the low diffusion rate of solution limits the mass transfer of do in stark contrast abc exhibited a gradual rise in h2o2 production rate with higher j giving increasing h2o2 accumulations of 61 4 119 8 172 11 211 13 257 15 289 6 and 317 12 mg l 1 h 1 at 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 ma cm 2 respectively fig 3b meanwhile only 2 6 μm of h2 were detected after 60 min the h2 accumulation from abc at 10 ma cm 2 was only 2 of aac operated at the j fig s5b in order to investigate the electrochemical reaction kinetics on cathodes as well as the electrocatalytic activity of air cathodes for h2o2 production lsv was conducted under different condition n2 aerated solution of aac was o2 free to inhibit orr while only the hydrogen evolution reaction her eq 4 occurred at 1 5 v red lines in fig 3c in air o2 aerated solution blue and yellow lines in fig 3c h2o2 formation was evidenced by the appearance of a unique double reduction peak related to the oxygen reduction and h2o2 reduction following eq 1 and 5 chen et al 2014 le et al 2015 higher o2 content and faster supplement in o2 aerated aac induced 74 higher net current response for h2o2 production 2 6 ma cm 2 between o2 and n2 saturated solutions compared to air aerated solution 1 5 ma cm 2 which indicated that o2 supply is the limiting factor for h2o2 production of aac with potential lower than 1 5 v a high reductive current was formed corresponding to her and the net current reduced to 0 the overlap of the three curves means her consumes most of the electrons even though in the high o2 content solution fig 3c 4 2 h 0 o2 2 e h2 5 h2o2 0 o2 2 h 2 e 2 h2o as a contrast no obvious inhibition of orr was observed in n2 aerated abc and the reductive j increased linearly with the potential fig 3d fig s6a however her was observed when n2 flow was provided at the air side of the gdl demonstrating that gdl was the main resource of oxygen in addition when lsv test with wider range of potential 0 3 to 5 0v was conducted no obvious reductive peak current or limiting current was found even j reached 50 ma cm 2 fig s6b the results manifested the gdl could provide enough oxygen to abc during orr even when j reached 50 ma cm 2 making it possible for the high ce low energy waste electro generation of h2o2 comparing the voltammograms under different conditions the onset potentials and net current densities presented same trends as follows o2 flow o2 aeration no aeration n2 aeration the above results indicated that o2 in the air was the major but not the only oxygen source for orr of abc in order to evaluate the oxygen utilization efficiency for h2o2 production the assistant electrolytic cell was assembled with the main electrolytic cell and operated at 15 ma cm 2 as depicted in fig s1b and fig 4 a o2 content in oxygen evolution reaction oer batch increased gradually from 270 to 1015 μm without any consumption red curve a similar trend was observed with abc operation blue curve while o2 content in aac batch presented an obviously slower increase from 270 to 720 μm due to the orr consumption with sufficient o2 supply from gdl cl of abc barely utilized do in the electrolyte however when external aeration was used h2o2 produced by abc increased by 22 from 162 6 to 198 6 mg l 1 h 1 fig 4b it could be deduced from the above results that cl would prefer the o2 in the air bubble instead of dissolved oxygen as oxygen source during the orr 3 3 effect of h2o2 mass transfer in tpis though h2o2 production of abc increased gradually with j ce still decreased obviously from 83 6 to 61 2 fig 3b to increase ce at large j abc was operated under pressurized air flow mode fig s1c when 5 kpa air flow was used small bubbles began to appear on the cl fig s7 if the air pressure increased from 5 to 20 kpa more air transfer through the cl into the electrolyte to form uniform gas curtain raise the applied air pressure from 0 to 20 kpa h2o2 production increased by 17 30 and 45 at 15 25 and 35 ma cm 2 correspondingly ce for h2o2 production increase by 20 30 and 46 at 15 25 and 35 ma cm 2 to reach 91 4 90 4 and 89 2 respectively fig 5 a fig s8 we compared the orr activity of abc with or without air pressure as well as with different applied pressures at 1 0 v a potential would not trigger her or increase the rates of h2o2 decomposition reactions mousset et al 2017 according to the lsv the net j of abc at 1 0 v without applied air pressure was 5 6 ma cm 2 while the net j increased by factors between 16 and 21 with the application of pressurized air of 5 20 kpa fig 5b sufficient oxygen supply with pressurized air enhanced the orr activity which induced higher h2o2 production fig 5a no obvious difference was observed among polarization curves under different pressures indicated that oxygen supply would be almost sufficient at 5 kpa however the h2o2 production at 20 kpa were 12 19 higher than at 5 kpa with different current density which probably attributed to more efficient mass transfer of h2o2 cv curves without air pressure showed that the voltammetric peak shape corresponded to a diffusion controlled reaction while reversible redox probe freely exchanging electrons with the electrode surface fig 5c after applying pressurized air flow δe p increased from 81 mv to a maximum of 286 7 mv manifesting that air bubbles were adsorbing on the porous electrode surfaces and impeding electron transfer he et al 2016 meantime the voltammetric curves moved downwards as a whole the reductive peak became indistinct and the sigmoidal catalytic waves were observed the limiting current densities j lim increased from 1 8 0 2 to 2 7 0 2 ma cm 2 with applied air pressure increasing from 5 to 20 kpa demonstrated that the electrochemical activity of the cl was enhanced with higher air pressure huge population of air bubbles within porous matrix accelerated the diffusion of fe cn 6 4 and ultimately increased the reduction current cv tests under different magnetic stirring rate without pressurized air flow were conducted to obtained similar shapes of the voltammograms fig s9 which confirmed again that the enhanced mass transfer of fe cn 6 4 indeed influence the reductive current according to the fitting resistances calculated by nova r o of abc decreased by 14 with applied air pressure increasing from 0 to 20 kpa fig 5d confirmed the enhancement of mass transfer in the electrolyte caused by pressurized air flow r ct increase by 115 from 3 2 0 2 to 6 9 0 4 ω due to the lower electron transfer efficiency caused by bubble adsorption according to eis results though charge transfer efficiency of the interfaces was partially reduced with pressurized air flow mass transfer in the porous channel was enhanced obviously 4 discussion in the previous researches we found that activated carbon with abundant micropores and large specific surface area performed high activity for 4 electron orr while carbon black and graphite with less specific surface area tended to catalyze 2 electron orr chen et al 2014 the selectivity of carbon materials toward orr could be changed by heteroatom doping or structure regulation dong et al found the interfaces could be adjusted by sintering the performance of the catalyst would be improved or degraded but it wouldn t change the orr selectivity of the catalyst dong et al 2012 conventionally a typical electrochemical interface is believed to consist of two phases the solid electrode and the liquid electrolyte xu 2018 however orr requires the solid liquid gas tpis to provide active sites and electrons solid proton or water liquid oxygen gas respectively eq 1 and 6 according to the above electrochemical tests in chapter 3 1 the electroactive surface areas were calculated to be 14 cm2 which was 222 electrochemically exfoliated graphene coated on carbon cloth 6 3 cm2 mousset et al 2016 consider the electrode projected area of abc was only 47 of carbon cloth 7 cm2 compared to 15 cm2 rolling method was proven to be an ideal method for cl fabrication by loading more active sites onto the unit area moreover both smaller δe p 81 mv fig 2b and lower r ct 3 6 ω fig 2d confirmed the good electron transfer ability of the abc as a result electrons would not be the limiting factor during orr capillary pressure is thought to be the driving force for water diffusion which depends on both the pore size and the internal contact angle between water and the porous medium garcia salaberri et al 2015 in the former researches porous carbonaceous cathodes were prepared with amorphous carbon activated carbon biochar to form hydrophilic interfaces benefit to 4 electron orr yuan et al 2013 dong et al 2013 moreover the local alkalization is inevitable during the orr eq 1 and 6 wang et al 2013 proved the alkalization of the carbonaceous cathode will further improve the hydrophlicity of the cl surface excessive contact between electrolyte and reactive interfaces will hinder the oxygen mass transfer toward the active sites which is widely known as flooding gurau et al 2007 however cl of abc was fabricated with high content of graphite 64 wt and carbon black 22 wt which exhibited hydrophobicity to induce insufficient contact between electrolyte and cathode fig s10 the free diffusion of electrolyte into the hydrophobic electrode was a slow and continuous process in the initial stage of orr solid air two phase interface instead of tpis was generated on cl due to the lack of the electrolyte as a result a large amount of electrons gather on active sites of cathode resulted in higher local j to activate the side reactions fig 6 a as shown in table s1 the faster increase of electroactive area and decrease of δe p after 6 rounds operation proved electrocatalytic reaction would accelerate the electrolyte intrusion into the porous hydrophobic channels and increase the amount of active sites of tpis besides the current flux in the 3d network structure was well distributed to enhance the performance of 2 electron orr fig 6b different from 4 electron orr magnetic stirring was often hired in 2 electron orr to transfer h2o2 into the electrolyte which would cause strong hydroflow at the interface between the cl and solution the hydrophobic character of cl and hydroflow at the interface would adjust the moisture management to reduce the flooding in summary the water phase plays a crucial role by transferring reactants toward the active sites as well as transferring products toward the solution after several rounds water would not be the limiting factor of tpis balance because acceleration of solution intrusion by electrocatalytic reaction induces the sufficient contact between electrolyte and cathode recently researchers gradually realize the importance of oxygen mass transfer in 4 electron orr particularly for porous carbon based catalysts han et al 2018 yin et al 2018 it is necessary to provide an unobstructed gas diffusion pathway for continual and enough oxygen supply to the active sites lu et al 2016 designed a micro nano structured electrode with superaerophilic surface property to accelerate the gas diffusion process as a result the unique architecture of superaerophilcity showed superior orr performance exceeding pt c which has higher intrinsic activity of the catalyst while in 2 electron orr system oxygen mass transfer is more vital because the oxygen demand doubles at the same faraday electron flux eq 1 and 6 actually the accessibility of the catalyst to high concentrations of o2 molecules is generally deficient the molecular ratio of o2 to h2o in an aqueous solution is only about 1 46 000 at 1 atm pressure 1200 μm which is far less than the optimal ratio of 1 2 shown in eq 1 6 4 h 1 o2 4 e 2 h2o 7 4 oh 4 e 2 h2o 1 o2 as oxygen released from the anode only covered half of the cathodic theoretical oxygen demand eq 1 and 7 exogenous oxygen supply become necessary for cathodic operation though aeration increased the local oxygen concentration at surface of aac large amounts of inner active sites on cl are still o2 deficient fig 6c according to eq 1 o2 demand at reaction interfaces per unit time deo2 mol s 1 was calculated as below 8 d e o 2 q nft j a nf here deo2 increases linearly with the j since a is constant at 7 cm2 in our system however diffusion rate of do towards the active sites was limited even with magnetic stirring and o2 aeration insufficient o2 supply would activate unwanted her especially for aac operated at j 2 5 ma cm 2 fig 3a moreover oxygen transfer towards the interface would be hindered by h2 bubbles from aac at higher j to further decrease the ce of 2 electron orr 3d electrodes like graphite felt or reticulated vitreous carbon foam electrodes were investigated to increase the contact area between electrode and o2 for higher orr performance zhou et al 2018b however the ce of graphite felt was still lower than 20 at 5 ma cm 2 unless the cathode was complexly modified by loading carbon black and anneal yu et al 2015 lower ce and h2o2 production of aac increased the cost and energy consumption which limited its actual application more importantly the accumulation of released h2 might also cause hidden trouble for production safety liu et al 2015 developed another method to thinly coat the catalyst onto the large area carbon paper 0 6 mg cm 2 which could reduce j and simultaneously enlarge the contact area between oxygen and electrode however in order to increase h2o2 production at higher current flux the catalyst coated carbon paper electrode has to be fabricated bigger and bigger making it unpractical for applications for comparison the rolling cl of abc was proven to have high activity and selectivity for 2 electron orr li et al 2016 besides the addition of hydrophobic gdl allowed o2 in the air to continuously diffuse into active sites of cl instead of predissolving into electrolyte and transferring with the electrolyte to active sites sufficient ambient oxygen continuously diffuses to active sites in cl forming stable tpis and resulting higher ce 76 with j lower than 15 ma cm 2 fig 6d three phases equilibrium inside the carbonaceous porous cathode is significant sufficient liquid in porous cathode is necessary for catalytic reaction as well as for proton h2o and h2o2 transfer however excessive liquid in cl and flow field channels will increase mass transportation losses by hindering the access of o2 to the cl at large j adding gdl or extra air pressure could effectively regulate the three phases equilibrium inside the cl when j was further increased to 35 ma cm 2 the ce of abc decreased sharply to 61 2 fig 3b meantime h2 content did not scale up with j indicating the h2o2 decomposition reaction was the main reason for ce decrease after pressurized air flow was applied both h2o2 production and ce increased significantly the improvement of h2o2 production by pressurized air flow can be explained by following mechanisms 1 the pressurized air will force air flow into abc resulting in more sufficient oxygen supply to reduce the her and increase the orr performance 2 more importantly enhancing h2o2 mass transfer is in favor of h2o2 production and ce improvement during 2 electron orr the directional flow of pressurized air ambient air gdl cl electrolyte will push generated h2o2 deviate from electrode interface into electrolyte to reduce the further decomposition of h2o2 for the porous air breathing cathode with enough oxygen supply h2o2 decomposition reaction instead of her was the main side reaction during 2 electron orr at large j consider h2o2 decomposition reaction only need solid liquid two phase interfaces and it has more positive potential than 2 electron orr 1 77v vs 0 78v the unwanted side reaction are likely to occur directional air flow was proved to be effective for improving ce by pushing h2o2 away from two phase interfaces fig 6e 5 conclusions in this work we focused on adjusting liquid gas solid tpis to improve the h2o2 production of carbonaceous porous film cathode especially at large j a cl with high density active sites was fabricated by rolling method the electrocatalytic reaction was found to accelerate the intrusion of electrolyte into the 3d structure of cl turned solid air two phase interfaces into tpis and thus improved the h2o2 production two kinds of air cathodes were fabricated based on same cl and different o2 supply modes aac was operated under aeration and abc relied on the passive diffusion of o2 from the gdl the ce of aac decreased from 84 8 to 5 1 with j increased from 2 5 to 15 ma cm 2 due to the conflict of high electroactive surface area and low contact area with oxygen simultaneously her was activated due to the lack of o2 in tpis stable tpis was formed in cl by the addition of gdl which was benefit to reducing the her side reaction both h2o2 production and ce increased by 14 6 times at 15 ma cm 2 ambient o2 through gdl was the major but not the only oxygen source of abc pressurized air application increased h2o2 production and ce by 17 and 45 at 15 and 35 ma cm 2 respectively it was confirmed pressurized air mainly enhanced h2o2 mass transfer rather than o2 supply during the orr notes the authors declare no competing financial interest declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18547,equilibrium of three reactants oxygen proton and electron in oxygen reduction reaction at large current flux is necessary for highly efficient electro generation of h2o2 in this work we investigated reactants equilibrium and h2o2 electrochemical production in liquid gas solid three phase interfaces on rolling cathodes with high electroactive area electrocatalytic reaction accelerated the electrolyte intrusion into hydrophobic porous catalyst layer for higher electroactive surface area resulting in a 21 increase of h2o2 yield at 15 ma cm 2 air aerated cathode submerged in air o2 aeration solution was unable to produce h2o2 efficiently due to the lack of o2 in three phase interfaces tpis especially at current density 2 5 ma cm 2 for air breathing cathode stable tpis inside the active sites was created by addition of gas diffusion layer to increase h2o2 production from 11 2 to 172 11 mg l 1 h 1 at 15 ma cm 2 pressurized air flow application enhanced both oxygen supply and h2o2 departure transfer to obtain a high h2o2 production of 461 11 mg l 1 h 1 with ce of 89 2 at 35 ma cm 2 45 higher than passive gas transfer systems our findings provided a new insight of carbonaceous air cathode performance in producing h2o2 providing important information for the practical application and amplification of cathodes in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords h2o2 electrocatalysis oxygen reduction reaction three phase interfaces air breathing cathode 1 introduction hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is an important chemical reagent which is widely used in pulp and paper bleaching textile industry and detergent industry due to its strong oxidizing campos martin et al 2006 especially in the field of chemical engineering and environmental protection h2o2 is used in the advanced oxidation processes aops to generate reactive free radicals oh eº oh h2o 1 9 2 7 v rate constant 106 1010 m 1 s 1 sires et al 2014 for tertiary treatment and disinfection of water ki et al 2017 miklos et al 2018 the major drawback of aops is the high cost of reagents consumption in industrial scale h2o2 is produced by the anthraquinone oxidation ao process it needs hydrogenation oxidation extraction purification and concentration which is a multistep process requires massive energy input and generates waste campos martin et al 2006 although the sales price of h2o2 has reduced to 700 1200 t 1 ciriminna et al 2016 the transportation storage and handling of bulk h2o2 involve risk and escalating expenses in addition the crude h2o2 obtained from factory is purified and concentrated to the mass concentration over 35 for market much higher than the required concentration of aops usually 0 1 wt the concentration dilution process of h2o2 is a hassle and a waste of resources young et al 2016 in conclusion in situ generation and utilization of h2o2 is safe convenient and energy efficient for aops application over the recent two decades electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have gained increasing attention for its high degradation rate effective removal and low energy consumption brillas et al 2009 except for anodic oxidation ao h2o2 is produced on the cathode through two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr eq 1 and then oh is obtained in the bulk by catalyzing the electrogenerated h2o2 with o3 artificial light fe2 sono or natural sunlight respectively moreira et al 2017 wang et al 2018a b eaops have been applied for remediation of various kinds of wastewaters including textile wastewaters vaghela et al 2005 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 pharmaceutical wastewaters moreira et al 2014 landfill leachates moreira et al 2015a 2016 winery wastewaters moreira et al 2015b and cyanobacterial boom waters an et al 2019 a high yield of h2o2 is a prerequisite for the high efficiency of the eaops to increase the yield of h2o2 various cathodic catalyst materials have been developed including metal catalyst liao et al 2013 alloy jirkovsky et al 2011 and carbon materials carbon nanotubes cnt carbon back and graphite gao et al 2015 among these materials carbonaceous material is the best choice because of its large specific surface area high conductivity strong corrosion resistance and low price 1 2 h o2 2 e h2o2 after nearly two decades of development the most popular carbonaceous cathodes used in the eaops were graphite based cathodes graphite felt graphite granule etc which were submerged in electrolyte with air or pure o2 aeration yang et al 2017 chen et al 2014 dissolved oxygen do or oxygen microbubbles diffused into the electrode to reach active sites and then react with the electrolyte till now this kind of carbonaceous cathode has been applied in several eaops for various persistent organic pollution pops degradation moreira et al 2017 however most of researchers focused on the pops degradation pathway and kinetic mechanism besides the great majority of works have been performed at the laboratory scale with reactors volume lower than 1 l eaop technology is in pressing need of passing to pilot scale reactor design and even to industrialized application to treat large amount of wastewater sires et al 2014 moreira et al 2017 rapid accumulation of h2o2 to sufficient concentration in large volume water is the prerequisite of industrialized application which need the efficient h2o2 production of cathode at large current flux eq 1 showed that the 2 electron orr needs proton oxygen and electron as reactants with mole ratio of 2 1 2 and these three partners are from liquid gas and electrode respectively on one hand only the active sites stay in three phase interfaces tpis could catalyze the orr on the other hand liquid gas solid three phase equilibrium inside the cathode is vital to the efficient production of h2o2 yang et al 2018 pointed out the performance of the cathode strongly influences the overall cost of eaops improvement of catalyst performance would be the main solution for cost reduction devoted to reducing costs while ensuring the efficient performance of the air cathodes in engineering applications a sandwich like air breathing cathode fabricated by rolling method was developed which needed no aeration or pressurized gas to generate h2o2 instead of expensive multistep prepared cnts or graphene the cathode was prepared from raw graphite and carbon black powder making it cheap and easy to fabricate this paper investigated the performance of cathodes at large current density j and the catalysis mechanism based on the tpis of the rolling porous catalyst layer two kinds of air cathodes were fabricated based on the same catalyst layer and different o2 supply modes the electrochemical techniques including linear sweep voltammetry lsv cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were employed to analyze the different electrochemical characteristics the oxygen and hydrogen content in the electrolyte were in situ monitored using microsensors to determine the reduction reaction on the cathode the optimal condition in h2o2 production was investigated by identifying the fates of h2o and o2 in the porous cathode furthermore pressurized air was utilized to adjust the tpis and the mechanism of h2o2 production improvement was discussed 2 methods and materials 2 1 fabrication of different air cathodes the carbonaceous air breathing cathodes are consisted of a catalyst layer cl a gas diffusion layer gdl and a stainless steel mesh ssm in the middle as the matrix and current collector the cathodes were fabricated according to the rolling procedure previously reported by our group li et al 2016 2017 in brief cl consists of graphite 40 μm htf0325 99 9 huatai chemical reagent co ltd qingdao china carbon black cb 30 nm vulcan xc 72r cabot corporation us and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe emulsion 60 horizon shanghai china as binder the dough like mixture was roll pressed on one side of the ssm type 304n 60 meshes detiannuo commercial trade co ltd tianjin china to be a 0 5 mm flat sheet with catalyst coating 50 3 6 mg cm 2 the gdls were made by rolling a mixture of carbon black and ptfe emulsion with a mass ratio of 4 9 according to the procedure described previously an et al 2017 gdls were then rolled onto another side of ssm to form a final air breathing cathode named as abc with a total thickness of 1 mm as a control group another kind of air cathode was fabricated consisting of the same cl and ssm as abc in order to prevent direct contact between ssm and electrolyte insulation glue instead of gdl was coated on the other side of the ssm this kind of air cathode needs to operate under complete immersion with air aeration noted as air aerated cathode named as aac 2 2 reactor configuration and operation as shown in fig 1 a the assembled muti chamber reactor included electrolytic cell electrodes air chamber and a low pressure gauge the electrolytic cell consisted of two compartments with cavity indoor dimensions of 5 7 10 cm and 2 7 10 cm respectively separated by a cation exchange membrane 4 4 cm ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international inc glen rock nj usa the air breathing cathode was assembled tightly between the reaction chamber and air chamber 2 7 10 cm with cl facing to the electrolyte and gdl facing to the air two vessels were connected with the air chamber if needed the reactor could become single chamber by disassembling air chamber and the smaller electrolytic cell fig s1 titanium coated with iridium oxide ti iro2 plate 5 8 0 1 cm was placed 2 cm away from air breathing cathode in parallel and used as the anode in all of the electrolytic experiments titanium wires 1 mm diameter aida tech co ltd tianjin china were used to connect the electrodes the h2o2 electrochemical production experiments were operated in the undivided electrolytic cell containing 50 mm na2so4 0 3 l unless special illustration galvanostatic mode was applied with a dc power kd3005d korad china if needed 0 5 2 0 l min 1 air o2 n2 could be separately or together aerated into the electrolyte to control the oxygen content of the electrolyte 0 1200 μm at certain intervals 2 ml samples were taken to analyze the concentration of h2o2 formed the performance of the cathodes with pressurized air flow was examined as follows the air inlet rate was stabilized at 1 0 l min 1 and the applied pressure of the air chamber was adjusted over a range of 0 30 kpa by controlling the exhausting rate of air pressures were stabilized over 10 min before measurements it was found the abc with thickness of 1 mm could not withstand pressure over 25 kpa in the preliminary experiments all tests were conducted over 0 20 kpa with increasing pressure at 5 kpa intervals all analyses were conducted in triplicate to ensure consistency and reproducibility the results are presented with errors bars sd standard deviation in the following sections 2 3 chemical and electrochemical analysis cv eis and lsv were conducted using the electrochemical analyzer autolab pgstat 302n metrohm switzerland and the companion software nova cv was performed in a three electrode cell including a working electrode air cathodes a silver chloride reference electrode ag agcl 4 0 m kcl with e 0 198 v she and a counter electrode platinum sheet pt aida tech co ltd tianjin china in solution of 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 and 1 0 m kcl the potentials mentioned here were all versus ag agcl except as noted cv was used to determine the electroactive surface in a potential range of 0 8 v to 0 2 at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 according to previous studies mousset et al 2016 lsv and eis were used to study the electrochemical behavior of air cathodes during electro generation of h2o2 in a three electrode cell comprised of 50 mm na2so4 the electrolyte was bubbled with air o2 n2 for 20 min before analysis the curves were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 with the potential ranging from 0 3 to 2 0 v eis was measured at 0 5 v over a frequency range of 50 khz to 0 1 hz with a sinusoidal perturbation signal amplitude of 10 mv le et al 2015 o2 and h2 in the electrolyte were monitored using microsensors connected to a micromanipulator and a multimeter mm meter unisense aarhus n denmark during the electrolysis experiments zhou et al 2018a the concentration of h2o2 was measured by the potassium titanium iv oxalate method at λ 400 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer the basis of this method is the formation of titanium iv peroxide complex in the presence of sulfuric acid chen et al 2014 the iron content was measured by phenanthroline spectrophotometry wang et al 2018a b all these experiments and electrochemical tests were performed at ambient temperature 25 1 c 2 4 calculations in order to ensure the electroactive surface area of the electrodes randles sevcik formula was used as follows wen et al 2009 2 i p 2 69 10 5 a c d 1 2 n 3 2 v 1 2 where i p is the peak current taken from the baseline of

investigate liquid intrusion in tpis of abc fig s1a in the initial stage h2o2 production of abc continuously increased during first 6 rounds and then reached a plateau as showed in fig 2 a the h2o2 production at round 1 was 150 6 mg l 1 h 1 and increased by 21 181 5 mg l 1 h 1 at round 6 ce increased from 68 3 to 82 2 simultaneously the electrochemical behavior of cl was studied with cv in the ferrocyanide system because the redox wave of fe cn 6 3 fe cn 6 4 is sensitive to the surface chemistry of carbon based electrodes yang et al 2017 le et al 2015 cv results fig 2b showed that the cl presented favorable voltammetric responses with high electrochemical reversibility the peak to peak separation δe p has reduced 30 from 117 to 81 mv manifesting the decrease of electrode resistance due to the increasing operation time patel et al 2013 this was further confirmed by the 4 fold increase of peak current density j p from 0 3 to 1 5 ma cm 2 after 180 min of operation table s1 according to randles sevcik equation the electroactive surface areas were calculated to be 3 cm2 at beginning and then gradually increased up to 14 cm2 after round 6 the intrusion of the electrolyte towards cathodes enlarged the orr active sites to further increase cathode performance for h2o2 production as a strong piece of evidence after tearing off the gdl the electrolyte exudated from cl after about 180 min operation while no exudation was observed after 48 h of magnetic stirring without power supply fig s2 the h2o2 production of cathode without gdl was recorded in table s2 and same trend was observed as a control group the j p of abc only had a 1 6 fold final increase from 0 3 to 0 8 ma cm 2 after 18 h of soaking fig 2c proving the electrocatalytic reaction could accelerate the electrolyte intrusion inside the porous cl and result in the increase of active surface during the orr eis is a facile and efficient tool for investigating the interface properties and capability of electron transfer between the electrode and electroactive substance le et al 2016 according to nyquist plots with different operation time fig s3 the fitting resistance components of the cathodes were intuitively presented in fig 2d the ohmic resistance r o and charge transfer resistance r ct of fresh cathodes were 16 0 4 and 6 0 2 ω respectively after 180 min of operation r o and r ct finally decreased by 38 and 50 to 9 8 0 2 ω and 3 0 2 ω indicating more electrolyte entered the porous channel of the cl and turned air solid two phase interfaces into liquid gas solid tpis resulting in higher charge transfer efficiency the enhanced electroactive surface area and electrical conductivity of operated cathodes would thus improve the orr activity which was corroborated the increase in h2o2 production fig 2a 3 2 effect of oxygen supply in tpis in order to investigate the effect of oxygen diffusion on tpis for h2o2 production aac and abc were operated in undivided electrolytic cells as shown in fig 3 a the h2o2 production of aac decreased from 31 2 to 11 2 mg l 1 h 1 ce from 84 8 to 5 1 with j increased from 2 5 to 15 ma cm 2 meanwhile h2 accumulation in the bulk solution increased from 21 to 122 μm in 60 min fig s5a although pure o2 was continuously aerated into the electrolyte at surface of cathode it was still unable to provide enough o2 for the internal active sites of the porous catalyst layer resulting in the degradation of electrode performance consider the do kept stable at 1203 6 μm during operation fig s4b it is believed that the low diffusion rate of solution limits the mass transfer of do in stark contrast abc exhibited a gradual rise in h2o2 production rate with higher j giving increasing h2o2 accumulations of 61 4 119 8 172 11 211 13 257 15 289 6 and 317 12 mg l 1 h 1 at 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 ma cm 2 respectively fig 3b meanwhile only 2 6 μm of h2 were detected after 60 min the h2 accumulation from abc at 10 ma cm 2 was only 2 of aac operated at the j fig s5b in order to investigate the electrochemical reaction kinetics on cathodes as well as the electrocatalytic activity of air cathodes for h2o2 production lsv was conducted under different condition n2 aerated solution of aac was o2 free to inhibit orr while only the hydrogen evolution reaction her eq 4 occurred at 1 5 v red lines in fig 3c in air o2 aerated solution blue and yellow lines in fig 3c h2o2 formation was evidenced by the appearance of a unique double reduction peak related to the oxygen reduction and h2o2 reduction following eq 1 and 5 chen et al 2014 le et al 2015 higher o2 content and faster supplement in o2 aerated aac induced 74 higher net current response for h2o2 production 2 6 ma cm 2 between o2 and n2 saturated solutions compared to air aerated solution 1 5 ma cm 2 which indicated that o2 supply is the limiting factor for h2o2 production of aac with potential lower than 1 5 v a high reductive current was formed corresponding to her and the net current reduced to 0 the overlap of the three curves means her consumes most of the electrons even though in the high o2 content solution fig 3c 4 2 h 0 o2 2 e h2 5 h2o2 0 o2 2 h 2 e 2 h2o as a contrast no obvious inhibition of orr was observed in n2 aerated abc and the reductive j increased linearly with the potential fig 3d fig s6a however her was observed when n2 flow was provided at the air side of the gdl demonstrating that gdl was the main resource of oxygen in addition when lsv test with wider range of potential 0 3 to 5 0v was conducted no obvious reductive peak current or limiting current was found even j reached 50 ma cm 2 fig s6b the results manifested the gdl could provide enough oxygen to abc during orr even when j reached 50 ma cm 2 making it possible for the high ce low energy waste electro generation of h2o2 comparing the voltammograms under different conditions the onset potentials and net current densities presented same trends as follows o2 flow o2 aeration no aeration n2 aeration the above results indicated that o2 in the air was the major but not the only oxygen source for orr of abc in order to evaluate the oxygen utilization efficiency for h2o2 production the assistant electrolytic cell was assembled with the main electrolytic cell and operated at 15 ma cm 2 as depicted in fig s1b and fig 4 a o2 content in oxygen evolution reaction oer batch increased gradually from 270 to 1015 μm without any consumption red curve a similar trend was observed with abc operation blue curve while o2 content in aac batch presented an obviously slower increase from 270 to 720 μm due to the orr consumption with sufficient o2 supply from gdl cl of abc barely utilized do in the electrolyte however when external aeration was used h2o2 produced by abc increased by 22 from 162 6 to 198 6 mg l 1 h 1 fig 4b it could be deduced from the above results that cl would prefer the o2 in the air bubble instead of dissolved oxygen as oxygen source during the orr 3 3 effect of h2o2 mass transfer in tpis though h2o2 production of abc increased gradually with j ce still decreased obviously from 83 6 to 61 2 fig 3b to increase ce at large j abc was operated under pressurized air flow mode fig s1c when 5 kpa air flow was used small bubbles began to appear on the cl fig s7 if the air pressure increased from 5 to 20 kpa more air transfer through the cl into the electrolyte to form uniform gas curtain raise the applied air pressure from 0 to 20 kpa h2o2 production increased by 17 30 and 45 at 15 25 and 35 ma cm 2 correspondingly ce for h2o2 production increase by 20 30 and 46 at 15 25 and 35 ma cm 2 to reach 91 4 90 4 and 89 2 respectively fig 5 a fig s8 we compared the orr activity of abc with or without air pressure as well as with different applied pressures at 1 0 v a potential would not trigger her or increase the rates of h2o2 decomposition reactions mousset et al 2017 according to the lsv the net j of abc at 1 0 v without applied air pressure was 5 6 ma cm 2 while the net j increased by factors between 16 and 21 with the application of pressurized air of 5 20 kpa fig 5b sufficient oxygen supply with pressurized air enhanced the orr activity which induced higher h2o2 production fig 5a no obvious difference was observed among polarization curves under different pressures indicated that oxygen supply would be almost sufficient at 5 kpa however the h2o2 production at 20 kpa were 12 19 higher than at 5 kpa with different current density which probably attributed to more efficient mass transfer of h2o2 cv curves without air pressure showed that the voltammetric peak shape corresponded to a diffusion controlled reaction while reversible redox probe freely exchanging electrons with the electrode surface fig 5c after applying pressurized air flow δe p increased from 81 mv to a maximum of 286 7 mv manifesting that air bubbles were adsorbing on the porous electrode surfaces and impeding electron transfer he et al 2016 meantime the voltammetric curves moved downwards as a whole the reductive peak became indistinct and the sigmoidal catalytic waves were observed the limiting current densities j lim increased from 1 8 0 2 to 2 7 0 2 ma cm 2 with applied air pressure increasing from 5 to 20 kpa demonstrated that the electrochemical activity of the cl was enhanced with higher air pressure huge population of air bubbles within porous matrix accelerated the diffusion of fe cn 6 4 and ultimately increased the reduction current cv tests under different magnetic stirring rate without pressurized air flow were conducted to obtained similar shapes of the voltammograms fig s9 which confirmed again that the enhanced mass transfer of fe cn 6 4 indeed influence the reductive current according to the fitting resistances calculated by nova r o of abc decreased by 14 with applied air pressure increasing from 0 to 20 kpa fig 5d confirmed the enhancement of mass transfer in the electrolyte caused by pressurized air flow r ct increase by 115 from 3 2 0 2 to 6 9 0 4 ω due to the lower electron transfer efficiency caused by bubble adsorption according to eis results though charge transfer efficiency of the interfaces was partially reduced with pressurized air flow mass transfer in the porous channel was enhanced obviously 4 discussion in the previous researches we found that activated carbon with abundant micropores and large specific surface area performed high activity for 4 electron orr while carbon black and graphite with less specific surface area tended to catalyze 2 electron orr chen et al 2014 the selectivity of carbon materials toward orr could be changed by heteroatom doping or structure regulation dong et al found the interfaces could be adjusted by sintering the performance of the catalyst would be improved or degraded but it wouldn t change the orr selectivity of the catalyst dong et al 2012 conventionally a typical electrochemical interface is believed to consist of two phases the solid electrode and the liquid electrolyte xu 2018 however orr requires the solid liquid gas tpis to provide active sites and electrons solid proton or water liquid oxygen gas respectively eq 1 and 6 according to the above electrochemical tests in chapter 3 1 the electroactive surface areas were calculated to be 14 cm2 which was 222 electrochemically exfoliated graphene coated on carbon cloth 6 3 cm2 mousset et al 2016 consider the electrode projected area of abc was only 47 of carbon cloth 7 cm2 compared to 15 cm2 rolling method was proven to be an ideal method for cl fabrication by loading more active sites onto the unit area moreover both smaller δe p 81 mv fig 2b and lower r ct 3 6 ω fig 2d confirmed the good electron transfer ability of the abc as a result electrons would not be the limiting factor during orr capillary pressure is thought to be the driving force for water diffusion which depends on both the pore size and the internal contact angle between water and the porous medium garcia salaberri et al 2015 in the former researches porous carbonaceous cathodes were prepared with amorphous carbon activated carbon biochar to form hydrophilic interfaces benefit to 4 electron orr yuan et al 2013 dong et al 2013 moreover the local alkalization is inevitable during the orr eq 1 and 6 wang et al 2013 proved the alkalization of the carbonaceous cathode will further improve the hydrophlicity of the cl surface excessive contact between electrolyte and reactive interfaces will hinder the oxygen mass transfer toward the active sites which is widely known as flooding gurau et al 2007 however cl of abc was fabricated with high content of graphite 64 wt and carbon black 22 wt which exhibited hydrophobicity to induce insufficient contact between electrolyte and cathode fig s10 the free diffusion of electrolyte into the hydrophobic electrode was a slow and continuous process in the initial stage of orr solid air two phase interface instead of tpis was generated on cl due to the lack of the electrolyte as a result a large amount of electrons gather on active sites of cathode resulted in higher local j to activate the side reactions fig 6 a as shown in table s1 the faster increase of electroactive area and decrease of δe p after 6 rounds operation proved electrocatalytic reaction would accelerate the electrolyte intrusion into the porous hydrophobic channels and increase the amount of active sites of tpis besides the current flux in the 3d network structure was well distributed to enhance the performance of 2 electron orr fig 6b different from 4 electron orr magnetic stirring was often hired in 2 electron orr to transfer h2o2 into the electrolyte which would cause strong hydroflow at the interface between the cl and solution the hydrophobic character of cl and hydroflow at the interface would adjust the moisture management to reduce the flooding in summary the water phase plays a crucial role by transferring reactants toward the active sites as well as transferring products toward the solution after several rounds water would not be the limiting factor of tpis balance because acceleration of solution intrusion by electrocatalytic reaction induces the sufficient contact between electrolyte and cathode recently researchers gradually realize the importance of oxygen mass transfer in 4 electron orr particularly for porous carbon based catalysts han et al 2018 yin et al 2018 it is necessary to provide an unobstructed gas diffusion pathway for continual and enough oxygen supply to the active sites lu et al 2016 designed a micro nano structured electrode with superaerophilic surface property to accelerate the gas diffusion process as a result the unique architecture of superaerophilcity showed superior orr performance exceeding pt c which has higher intrinsic activity of the catalyst while in 2 electron orr system oxygen mass transfer is more vital because the oxygen demand doubles at the same faraday electron flux eq 1 and 6 actually the accessibility of the catalyst to high concentrations of o2 molecules is generally deficient the molecular ratio of o2 to h2o in an aqueous solution is only about 1 46 000 at 1 atm pressure 1200 μm which is far less than the optimal ratio of 1 2 shown in eq 1 6 4 h 1 o2 4 e 2 h2o 7 4 oh 4 e 2 h2o 1 o2 as oxygen released from the anode only covered half of the cathodic theoretical oxygen demand eq 1 and 7 exogenous oxygen supply become necessary for cathodic operation though aeration increased the local oxygen concentration at surface of aac large amounts of inner active sites on cl are still o2 deficient fig 6c according to eq 1 o2 demand at reaction interfaces per unit time deo2 mol s 1 was calculated as below 8 d e o 2 q nft j a nf here deo2 increases linearly with the j since a is constant at 7 cm2 in our system however diffusion rate of do towards the active sites was limited even with magnetic stirring and o2 aeration insufficient o2 supply would activate unwanted her especially for aac operated at j 2 5 ma cm 2 fig 3a moreover oxygen transfer towards the interface would be hindered by h2 bubbles from aac at higher j to further decrease the ce of 2 electron orr 3d electrodes like graphite felt or reticulated vitreous carbon foam electrodes were investigated to increase the contact area between electrode and o2 for higher orr performance zhou et al 2018b however the ce of graphite felt was still lower than 20 at 5 ma cm 2 unless the cathode was complexly modified by loading carbon black and anneal yu et al 2015 lower ce and h2o2 production of aac increased the cost and energy consumption which limited its actual application more importantly the accumulation of released h2 might also cause hidden trouble for production safety liu et al 2015 developed another method to thinly coat the catalyst onto the large area carbon paper 0 6 mg cm 2 which could reduce j and simultaneously enlarge the contact area between oxygen and electrode however in order to increase h2o2 production at higher current flux the catalyst coated carbon paper electrode has to be fabricated bigger and bigger making it unpractical for applications for comparison the rolling cl of abc was proven to have high activity and selectivity for 2 electron orr li et al 2016 besides the addition of hydrophobic gdl allowed o2 in the air to continuously diffuse into active sites of cl instead of predissolving into electrolyte and transferring with the electrolyte to active sites sufficient ambient oxygen continuously diffuses to active sites in cl forming stable tpis and resulting higher ce 76 with j lower than 15 ma cm 2 fig 6d three phases equilibrium inside the carbonaceous porous cathode is significant sufficient liquid in porous cathode is necessary for catalytic reaction as well as for proton h2o and h2o2 transfer however excessive liquid in cl and flow field channels will increase mass transportation losses by hindering the access of o2 to the cl at large j adding gdl or extra air pressure could effectively regulate the three phases equilibrium inside the cl when j was further increased to 35 ma cm 2 the ce of abc decreased sharply to 61 2 fig 3b meantime h2 content did not scale up with j indicating the h2o2 decomposition reaction was the main reason for ce decrease after pressurized air flow was applied both h2o2 production and ce increased significantly the improvement of h2o2 production by pressurized air flow can be explained by following mechanisms 1 the pressurized air will force air flow into abc resulting in more sufficient oxygen supply to reduce the her and increase the orr performance 2 more importantly enhancing h2o2 mass transfer is in favor of h2o2 production and ce improvement during 2 electron orr the directional flow of pressurized air ambient air gdl cl electrolyte will push generated h2o2 deviate from electrode interface into electrolyte to reduce the further decomposition of h2o2 for the porous air breathing cathode with enough oxygen supply h2o2 decomposition reaction instead of her was the main side reaction during 2 electron orr at large j consider h2o2 decomposition reaction only need solid liquid two phase interfaces and it has more positive potential than 2 electron orr 1 77v vs 0 78v the unwanted side reaction are likely to occur directional air flow was proved to be effective for improving ce by pushing h2o2 away from two phase interfaces fig 6e 5 conclusions in this work we focused on adjusting liquid gas solid tpis to improve the h2o2 production of carbonaceous porous film cathode especially at large j a cl with high density active sites was fabricated by rolling method the electrocatalytic reaction was found to accelerate the intrusion of electrolyte into the 3d structure of cl turned solid air two phase interfaces into tpis and thus improved the h2o2 production two kinds of air cathodes were fabricated based on same cl and different o2 supply modes aac was operated under aeration and abc relied on the passive diffusion of o2 from the gdl the ce of aac decreased from 84 8 to 5 1 with j increased from 2 5 to 15 ma cm 2 due to the conflict of high electroactive surface area and low contact area with oxygen simultaneously her was activated due to the lack of o2 in tpis stable tpis was formed in cl by the addition of gdl which was benefit to reducing the her side reaction both h2o2 production and ce increased by 14 6 times at 15 ma cm 2 ambient o2 through gdl was the major but not the only oxygen source of abc pressurized air application increased h2o2 production and ce by 17 and 45 at 15 and 35 ma cm 2 respectively it was confirmed pressurized air mainly enhanced h2o2 mass transfer rather than o2 supply during the orr notes the authors declare no competing financial interest declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18548,humic substances humics are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic environments where they can serve as electron acceptors for anaerobic oxidation of organic compounds methane is a powerful greenhouse gas as well as the least reactive organic molecule anaerobic oxidation of methane aom coupled to microbial reduction of various electron acceptors plays a crucial role in mitigating methane emissions here we reported that humics could serve as terminal electron acceptors for aom using enriched nitrate reducing aom microorganisms aom coupled to the reduction of humics was demonstrated based on the production of 13c labelled carbon dioxide and aom activity was evaluated with different methane partial pressures and electron acceptor concentrations after three cycle reduction both aom activity and copy numbers of the archaea 16s rrna and mcra genes were the highest when anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid and anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid were electron acceptors the high throughput sequencing results suggested that anme 2d were the dominant methane oxidation archaea after humics reduction although the partner bacteria nc10 trended downward other reported humics reduction bacteria geobactor and anammox appeared the potential electron transfer models from anme 2d to humics were proposed these results enable a better understanding of available electron acceptors for aom in natural environments and broaden our insight into the significant role of anme 2d graphical abstract image 1 keywords humics methane anaerobic oxidation of methane aom electron acceptors anme 2d 1 introduction humic substances humics represent the redox fractions of natural organic matter nom in soils and sediments lovley et al 1996 1998 1999 valenzuela et al 2019 humics have the potential to serve as terminal electron acceptors during microbial respiration and to function as electron shuttles driving the redox bioconversion of metals and organic molecules rios del toro et al 2018b scott et al 1998 voordeckers et al 2010 quinones are the most important electron accepting and shuttling molecular groups in humics wolf et al 2009 diverse dissimilatory fe iii reducing microorganisms

scott et al 1998 voordeckers et al 2010 furthermore humics might play a significant role decreasing methane emissions from anaerobic ecosystems martinez et al 2013 mitigation of methane emissions by humics was originally thought to be caused by inhibiting methanogenesis in situ miller et al 2015 yap et al 2018 but more evidence suggests that anaerobic oxidation of methane aom also contributes to this effect blodau and deppe 2012 valenzuela et al 2019 aom is one of the major sinks of methane on earth hu et al 2011 and methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms play a crucial role in global methane flux most of the methane produced in the anoxic layers of soils and sediments is consumed by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme and anaerobic methanotrophic bacteria that use alternate electron acceptors such as nitrate haroon et al 2013 nitrite shen et al 2017 fe iii ettwig et al 2016 weber et al 2017 and mn iv ettwig et al 2016 anme are divided into three lineages of anme 1 subclusters a and b anme 2 subclusters a b c and d and anme 3 which have been detected in marine and freshwater environments and estimated to oxidize up to 90 of the methane released before it reaches the atmosphere vaksmaa et al 2017a among these anme 2d are mainly distributed in paddy soils vaksmaa et al 2017b and freshwater sediments ding et al 2015 these ecosystems commonly with high organic content represent the largest natural source of methane therefore we can infer the coexistence of methane and humics in these environments until now it has been estimated that humics contribute to suppress methane emissions in wetland sediments valenzuela et al 2019 soils miller et al 2015 and peat blodau and deppe 2012 however the relationship between methane oxidation and humics reduction the functional microbes and electron transfer mechanisms during these processes are poorly understood only two laboratory studies have explored the microbial community that performs humics dependent aom scheller et al 2016 demonstrated that anme 2a and 2c decouple from sulfate reducing bacteria srb partners and maintain high aom rates with has and aqds as electron acceptors valenzuela et al 2017 reported that the mbg d family a proposed microbial player in metal dependent aom performs aom coupled to the reduction of humics and aqds given recent evidence on the potential role of methanotrophic microorganisms as functional microbes for humics dependent aom we provide biogeochemical insight into the role of anme 2d catalyzed reduction of humics for aom anme 2d are known as denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo archaea that are capable of coupling nitrate reduction to methane oxidation via the reverse methanogenesis pathway using the key enzyme methyl coenzyme m reductase a mcra haroon et al 2013 anme 2d usually form syntrophic consortia with denitrifying methanotrophic bacteria nc10 as anme 2d can only reduce nitrate to nitrite and nitrite is converted to dinitrogen gas by nc10 however the reduction of extracellular fe iii and mn iv metals is independently achieved by anme 2d in the absence of a bacterial syntrophic partner ettwig et al 2016 cultivation and biochemical characterization of anme 2d have been started only recently and many unknowns remain regarding anme 2d even though they are widely distributed in many different environments ding et al 2015 welte 2018 welte et al 2016 if this clade is capable of performing humics dependent aom in environment it will represent an unrevealed methane sink that could have huge biogeochemical and ecological implications as the amount of ch4 mitigated by anme 2d in natural ecosystems may be much higher than previously considered due to the processes of nitrate fe iii and mn iv dependent aom therefore the aim of this study was to determine whether anme 2d could use humics as terminal electron acceptors for aom and decouple from its partner bacteria when the electron acceptor changed from nitrate to humics in this study we investigated the aom activity of aquatic has and quinones with different chemical structures i e anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid aqds and anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid aqs 13c labelled methane was used to verify the feasibility of aom coupled to different electron acceptors the effects of methane partial pressure and representative electron acceptor i e aqds concentrations on aom activity were also explored the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput sequencing were applied to evaluate the changes in copy numbers of the mcra and16s rrna genes of archaea and bacteria as well as the microbial consortia structure finally hypothesized electron transfer models of humics reduction were proposed it is anticipated that the findings will extend our knowledge on alternate electron acceptors for aom during biogeochemical carbon cycle processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and cultivation conditions the inoculum was taken from a damo reactor that had been fed nitrate nitrite and methane for more than 2 years and it contained damo archaea anme 2d and damo bacteria nc10 the inoculum was washed three times with fresh mineral medium to remove residual nitrate and diluted to a final biomass concentration of approximately 0 10 g volatile suspended solids vss l the mineral medium consisted of per l constant element of 0 5 g

hcl 2 2 isotope tracer experiments potential methane oxidation with different electron acceptors was evaluated using 13c labelled methane 13ch4 each 50 ml serum vial contained 20 ml of mineral medium and 5 ml of nitrate free inoculum and was continuously flushed with n2 co2 95 5 v v for about 30 min to produce anaerobic conditions one group was the negative control without addition any of electron acceptor named the control vials other serum vials were injected with different electron acceptor stock solutions to obtain a final concentration of similar electron acceptable capability table 1 because of the impurity and complexity of the has 50 60 as humic acids sigma aldrich we did not quantify the potential electron equivalent of has the concentration of 2 g l was chosen from a previous study lovley et al 1996 then 5 ml of headspace gas was replaced with an equal volume of 13ch4 99 sigma aldrich resulting in a final partial pressure of 0 2 atm 13ch4 the vials were cultured at 35 c in a shaking incubator at 150 rpm a 20 μl aliquot of headspace gas was sampled using a gas tight glass syringe sge analytical science ringwood vic australia and immediately measured by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890 5975c agilent technologies palo alto ca usa in selected ion monitoring m z 44 45 mode all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 3 effect of methane partial pressure and electron acceptor concentration on aom to evaluate the effect of methane partial pressure and electron acceptor e g aqds concentration on aom 50 ml serum vials were filled with 20 ml medium and 5 ml inoculum and sparged with n2 co2 95 5 v v for 30 min then different amounts of aqds stock solution were added to half of the vials to final concentrations of 0 1 1 5 and 10 mm with the same methane partial pressure of 0 4 atm methane was added to the other half of the vials with partial pressures of 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 atm respectively and the concentration of aqds was kept at 10 mm all experiments were performed in triplicate and operated at 35 c inside a shaking incubator methane 200 μl in the headspace was measured by gc 9790 fuli analytical instrument co ltd zhejiang china with hydrogen as the carrier gas the liquid sample was sampled and filtered via a 0 22 μm spin filter in an anaerobic glove box and then qualitatively analyzed for aqds and ah2qds by a uv vis spectrophotometer model sp 752 shanghai china liu et al 2007 2 4 microbial community changes with different electron acceptors four 200 ml reactors with 100 ml working volume were used to determine the repeatability of methane consumption aom activity and microbial community changes in response to the different electron acceptors after three cycle reduction the reactors were first sparged with n2 co2 95 5 v v for 30 min to ensure anaerobic conditions and then sparged with ch4 co2 95 5 v v for 15 min to supply methane the reactors were operated at 35 c and stirred at 150 rpm in an incubator shaker the electron acceptors i e has aqds aqs and no3 n were supplied manually via the stock solutions to achieve the same final concentrations described in table 1 every 7 8 days the reactors were settled and 80 ml of the supernatant was removed replaced with the same volume of fresh mineral medium then re sparged with ch4 co2 95 5 v v and injected with the electron acceptor stock solutions gas samples 200 μl were taken by a gas tight glass syringe sge australia at regular intervals from the headspace of the reactors to measure the methane concentration by gc in addition statistical analysis was conducted by one way anova method using ibm spss 23 to inspect the effect of electron acceptor type on methane consumption 2 5 dna extraction 16s rrna gene sequencing and qpcr analysis after three cycle reduction the inoculum and microbial samples 10 ml from the four reactors were taken for dna extraction using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the bacterial and archaeal 341b4 f 806 r universal primers lu et al 2016 and sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform by novogene biotechnology co beijing china the raw data analysis was identical to the methods used in our early study fu et al 2019 the abundance of 16s rrna genes from archaea and bacteria along with the crucial methane oxidation mcra gene was further analyzed by qpcr the qpcr primers and conditions were referred from a previous study lai et al 2018 and this process was conducted by majorbio shanghai china the sequences obtained in this study have been submitted to the sequence read archive sra database and the accession numbers are srr9201786 srr9201790 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of aom with nitrate and humics as electron acceptors we performed isotope labeling experiments using 13ch4 to detect aom with different electron acceptors 13c was enriched in carbon dioxide expressed as 13co2 from the oxidation of 13ch4 it was obvious that there was no 13co2 generation without the addition of any electron acceptor fig 1 as for the experiments with electron acceptors increase of 13fco2 calculated from 13co2 13co2 12co2 was observed over the first day of incubation and there was insignificant distinction among nitrate and humics electron acceptors p 0 509 0 05 although the potential electron equivalent accepted by 4 4 mm of no3 n 21 5 mm e was similar to 10 mm aqds aqs 20 mm e less 13co2 was generated with the humic electron acceptors compared with no3 after a 5 day incubation fig 1 which was possibly ascribed to the much more thermodynamically favorable aom coupled to nitrate reduction than humics taking aqds as an example the change in gibbs free energy was 43 2 kj mol 1 ch4 4aqds 2h2o co2 4aqh2ds δg0 43 2 kj mol 1 ch4 which is much lower than the changes in gibbs free energy with no3 5ch4 8no3 8h 5co2 4n2 14h2o δg0 765 kj mol 1 ch4 3 2 effects of electron acceptor concentration and methane partial pressure on aom the profiles of methane consumption were quantified by increasing methane partial pressure and aqds concentration to investigate the effects of electron donor and electron acceptor concentrations on aom the detailed changes in methane concentration are shown in fig s1 both the amount and rate of methane consumption increased as the aqds concentrations increased from 0 1 to 10 mm at the same methane partial pressure of 0 4 atm fig 2 a significant color changes associated with the redox processes occurred due to the change in quinone chemical structure thus the reduction of aqds to ah2qds was confirmed by uv vis absorption spectroscopy ah2qds and aqds were qualitatively determined from their absorbance values near 385 and 326 nm with a detection limit of 0 5 mm fig s2 although the initial ch4 aqds ratio table s1 was much higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 0 25 4aqds ch4 2h2o 4ah2qds co2 the consumption of methane was not linear with the change in aqds concentration for example when the concentration of aqds increased 10 times from 0 1 to 1 mm the consumption of methane only doubled the aom rate increased from 0 0026 mmol day to 0 0050 mmol day and then it increased more slowly with higher aqds concentrations fig 2a which mean that the reduction in aqds was not the rate limiting step the consumption of methane reached its maximum of 0 0043 mmol at 10 mm aqds fig 2a in contrast the consumption of methane increased linearly with the rise in methane partial pressure in the same aqds concentration i e 10 mm fig 2b this mean that even though methane was excessive in all cases methane transfer was still the crucial step to control the rate of aom due to the poor solubility of methane 3 5 mg 100 ml water he et al 2013 this result was consistent with the damo process in which methane must first dissolve in the liquid for utilization by microbes thus high methane partial pressures promote methane transfer cai et al 2018 ding et al 2014 3 3 methane consumption and aom activity during the reduction of various electron acceptors the 23 day operating period contained three cycles based on the consumption of the electron acceptors the concentration of methane continued to drop during each cycle fig 3 a the methane oxidation rate 0 0063 mmol day r2 0 9618 during cycle 1 was the highest when no3 was the electron acceptor and there was no obvious difference among the other three humics electron acceptors about 0 0055 mmol day fig 3b which was consistent with the isotope experimental result fig 1 the consumption rate of methane kept stable with no3 0 0063 mmol day r2 0 9573 and aqs 0 0056 mmol day r2 0 9765 during cycle 2 but dropped during cycle 3 no3 0 0035 mmol day r2 0 8443 and aqs 0 0036 mmol day r2 0 9726 fig 3b the consumption rate of methane with aqds 0 0039 mmol day r2 0 9139 in cycle 3 and has 0 0017 mmol day in cycle 3 r2 0 4213 decreased gradually over time on the whole the consumption rate of methane decreased from the beginning to the end of the experiments for the four electron acceptors it was thought that this result occurred because of the biomass loss by changing the culture medium for each cycle and partly because of the electron acceptor itself for example bio toxicity in addition we did not control the initial methane partial pressure strictly here which might be another reason for the decreasing of methane consumption rate in cycle 3 the downward trend was more pronounced particularly for the has and there was a slight methanogenesis trend at the end of cycle 3 statistically there was no significant difference among four electron acceptors on methane consumption p 0 973 0 05 over three cycles of the experiment this result indicated that humics electron acceptor can substitute nitrate for aom and methane metabolism is unaffected the variation in aom activity was further confirmed by quantifying the 16s rrna genes by qpcr fig 4 shows the copy numbers of archaeal and bacterial 16s rrna genes along with the mcra gene at the end of cycle 3 the mcra gene is a specific biomarker for detecting anme which catalyzes the activation of methane in the reverse methanogenic pathway hallam et al 2003 vaksmaa et al 2017a although the methane consumption rate decreased during cycle 3 the copy numbers of the archaeal 16s rrna and mcra genes increased with no3 aqds and aqs compared to the inoculum indicating growth of anme archaea in this system in addition mcra gene was expressed higher in aqds and aqs than in no3 which was consistent with the finding that mcra gene expression was higher in fe aom process than in nitrate aom process ettwig et al 2016 suggesting similar higher methane oxidation activity of anme 2d with humics and metal these results also indicated that anme 2d might be the only functional microorganisms performing methane oxidation in humics electron acceptors however both the copy numbers of the archaea 16s rrna and mcra genes decreased slightly with has which was parallel to the lower consumption rates of methane at the end of cycle 3 fig 3 it is likely attributed to the inherently complex structure and uneasy biodegradable character of the has lovley et al 1996 on the other hand has can inhibit enzyme activities yap et al 2018 which might be another reason for the low rate and expression in addition compared to the inoculum the gene copy number of the bacterial 16s rrna gene decreased among the four electron acceptors suggesting that archaea were more active than bacteria for aom under this condition 3 4 microbial community structure with different electron acceptors the microbial community in the inoculum and reactors after a three cycle reduction with different electron acceptors was analyzed using 16s rrna high throughput sequencing a total of 415 718 qualified sequences were generated from the five samples table s3 the distribution of bacteria and archaea at the phylum level are shown in fig 5 a the dominant phyla in the inoculum were euryarchaeota proteobacteria and nc10 with relative abundances of 27 90 13 30 and 30 59 respectively compared with the inoculum these three phyla remained the dominant microorganisms but the abundances of euryarchaeota and nc10 were slightly lower in four electron acceptors the abundance of proteobacteria was higher in abundance in the humic electron acceptors than that in the inoculum and nitrate further analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences at the genus level indicated that candidatus methylomirabilis 30 52 affiliated to nc10 phylum and candidatus methanoperedens 27 69 affiliated to anme 2d family and euryarchaeota phylum were dominant bacteria and archaea in inoculum respectively fig 5b similar to the inoculum candidatus methanoperedens was still the dominant archaea and accounted for 26 43 no3 23 90 aqds 25 46 aqs and 21 14 has with the different types of electron acceptors the abundance of candidatus methylomirabilis was 27 45 with no3 and 23 83 with aqs but sharply decreased to 17 78 with aqds and 9 06 with has nevertheless there was no emerging methane oxidizing microorganisms candidatus methylomirabilis damo bacteria and candidatus methanoperedens damo archaea were the only known microbes performing methane oxidation with the four electron acceptors although there was a slight methanogenesis trend at the end of cycle 3 with has fig 3a the abundance of methaneogens appeared with has were very low methanosaeta 0 02 methanoculleus 0 0032 and their roles were negligible furthermore under the humics electron acceptor conditions the total abundance of the two genera of candidatus brocadia aqds 4 66 aqs 1 92 has 5 49 and candidatus kuenenia aqds 1 08 aqs 0 79 has 0 13 increased compared with that in the inoculum candidatus brocadia 0 80 candidatus kuenenia 0 08 and nitrate candidatus brocadia 1 73 candidatus kuenenia 0 26 table s2 which are known as anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria the genus geobacter affiliated with the proteobacteria phylum was emerging with relative abundances of 2 39 aqds 2 05 aqs and 1 94 has in the humics electron acceptors this genus was almost negligible in the inoculum 0 03 and nitrate sludge 0 04 it is well known that geobacter is a representative iron reducing microorganism that transports electrons via electron shuttles or directly to an electrode iron oxide or other available electron acceptor such as humics voordeckers et al 2010 wolf et al 2009 3 5 the hypothesized different electron transfer models with nitrate and humics as electron acceptors the key difference between nitrate and humics was that nitrate is soluble inorganic salt and humics are macromolecular organic matters and usually extracellular electron acceptors nitrate dependent aom is well studied haroon et al 2013 which is commonly catalyzed by anme 2d using reverse methanogenesis and transfers its product nitrite to the nitrite dependent methanotroph nc10 which continue to mediate methane oxidation via an intra aerobic pathway ettwig et al 2010 in this study the dominant archaea and bacteria are still candidatus methanoperedens 26 43 and candidatus methylomirabilis 27 45 after nitrate reduction thus based on the reported studies and the result of microbial community structure the electron transfer model with nitrate as electron acceptor is shown in fig 6 a compared with the inoculum the relative abundance of nc10 in aqs aqds and has decreased from 30 52 to 23 90 17 78 and 9 06 respectively while the composition of anme 2d were relatively stable before and after reduction accounting for 21 15 27 69 the anme 2d clade contain genes encoding multihaem c type cytochromes mcglynn et al 2015 some of which are shuttles for extracellular electron transfer roden et al 2010 shi et al 2007 and are predicted to conduct electrons derived from reverse methanogenesis from the archaeal membrane to outside of the cell for reduction of extracellular electron acceptors such as fe iii mn iv beal et al 2009 ettwig et al 2016 and selenate luo et al 2018 in addition humics are macromolecular organic matters and cannot be directly transported into the cell which are usually reduced extracellularly with metal like reduction mechanism voordeckers et al 2010 moreover anme 2a and 2c were demonstrated to decouple from their syntrophic srb partners using has and aqds as terminal electron acceptors through an extracellular electron transfer mechanism scheller et al 2016 thus based on the results obtained in our study and those from the literature one hypothesis is that scheller et al 2016 anme 2d can also directly use humics as terminal electron acceptors for independent aom similar to other anme clades while nc10 can only reduce nitrite through dismutation of no to n2 and o2 via an intra aerobic methane oxidation pathway ettwig et al 2010 thus it was sure nc10 would not work in humics reduction according to this hypothesis this can be regarded as a method for decoupling anme 2d from its symbiotic bacteria nc10 in addition an intriguing finding was the emergence of geobacter and the increase of anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia in humics electron acceptors geobacter species contain c type cytochromes and transfer electrons extracellularly to fe iii and electrodes bond and lovley 2003 holmes et al 2017 lovley et al 2011 geobacter species can also use has or aqds as electron shuttles or terminal electron acceptors to support anaerobic oxidation of organic compounds such as acetate lovley et al 1996 voordeckers et al 2010 furthermore many studies have reported the synthetic consortium and intermediate mediated electron transfer mechanism between methane related archaea and geobacter species in methane based microbial fuel cell ding et al 2016 gao et al 2017 mcanulty et al 2017 yamasaki et al 2018 yu et al 2019 all of these studies support the same role for geobacter in our system anammox process has been speculated to play an important role in the global nitrogen biogeochemical cycle ding et al 2014 anammox bacteria oxidizing ammonium coupled to the reduction of nitrate thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 nitrite kuypers et al 2003 sulfate rios del toro et al 2018a and fe iii bao and li 2017 have been reported in marine and terrestrial ecosystems more recently anammox driven by nom promotes nitrogen loss in marine sediments where anmmox bacteria perform the nom dependent anammox process anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to nom reduction rios del toro et al 2018b which supports a novel pathway interconnecting the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and carbon humics represent the redox fractions of nom in this study ammonium was originally added as a nitrogen source but may also partly participate in the microbial conversion of humics and promote the growth of anammox bacteria thus there may be a synergistic role between anme 2d and partner bacteria from the above the two potential electron transfer models to humics are shown in fig 6b 3 6 environmental implications humics are stable organic matter that accumulate in soil martinez et al 2013 peatland blodau and deppe 2012 freshwater sediments valenzuela et al 2017 and marine sediments hansell 2013 the redox functional groups in humics possess three important roles 1 as terminal electron acceptors for microbial respiration 2 as redox mediators electron shuttles for electron transfer and 3 as electron donors for microbial reduction of more oxidized electron acceptors which significantly impacts the redox conversion and fate of a large variety of inorganic and organic contaminants martinez et al 2013 here we provide new evidence that humics serve as terminal acceptors for methanotrophs which simultaneously has environmental significance for mitigating greenhouse gases emissions from anoxic environments it is generally considered that the most important electron acceptors for methanotrophs in anaerobic environments are sulfate nitrate mn iv and fe iii however as the abundant form of nom in nature the role of humics should not be ignored this study supports the hypothesis reported in the literature that humics addition suppresses methane release is due to methane oxidation other than inhibiting methanogenesis blodau and deppe 2012 it might be the hidden mechanism for humics lowering methane release in natural environments which further extends our understanding of global methane flux in addition humics dependent aom might represent a direct methane sink that could have potent biogeochemical and ecological implications as the net amount of methane mitigated by humics in organotrophic ecosystems may be much higher than traditionally considered due to the electron shuttling mediated redox interactions involved in humics catalyzed fe aom processes valenzuela et al 2019 4 conclusions an enriched culture containing anme

18548,humic substances humics are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic environments where they can serve as electron acceptors for anaerobic oxidation of organic compounds methane is a powerful greenhouse gas as well as the least reactive organic molecule anaerobic oxidation of methane aom coupled to microbial reduction of various electron acceptors plays a crucial role in mitigating methane emissions here we reported that humics could serve as terminal electron acceptors for aom using enriched nitrate reducing aom microorganisms aom coupled to the reduction of humics was demonstrated based on the production of 13c labelled carbon dioxide and aom activity was evaluated with different methane partial pressures and electron acceptor concentrations after three cycle reduction both aom activity and copy numbers of the archaea 16s rrna and mcra genes were the highest when anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid and anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid were electron acceptors the high throughput sequencing results suggested that anme 2d were the dominant methane oxidation archaea after humics reduction although the partner bacteria nc10 trended downward other reported humics reduction bacteria geobactor and anammox appeared the potential electron transfer models from anme 2d to humics were proposed these results enable a better understanding of available electron acceptors for aom in natural environments and broaden our insight into the significant role of anme 2d graphical abstract image 1 keywords humics methane anaerobic oxidation of methane aom electron acceptors anme 2d 1 introduction humic substances humics represent the redox fractions of natural organic matter nom in soils and sediments lovley et al 1996 1998 1999 valenzuela et al 2019 humics have the potential to serve as terminal electron acceptors during microbial respiration and to function as electron shuttles driving the redox bioconversion of metals and organic molecules rios del toro et al 2018b scott et al 1998 voordeckers et al 2010 quinones are the most important electron accepting and shuttling molecular groups in humics wolf et al 2009 diverse dissimilatory fe iii reducing microorganisms transfer electrons to the quinone moieties of humic acids has or the model quinone compound anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds linked to anaerobic oxidation of organic compounds lovley et al 1996 scott et al 1998 voordeckers et al 2010 furthermore humics might play a significant role decreasing methane emissions from anaerobic ecosystems martinez et al 2013 mitigation of methane emissions by humics was originally thought to be caused by inhibiting methanogenesis in situ miller et al 2015 yap et al 2018 but more evidence suggests that anaerobic oxidation of methane aom also contributes to this effect blodau and deppe 2012 valenzuela et al 2019 aom is one of the major sinks of methane on earth hu et al 2011 and methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms play a crucial role in global methane flux most of the methane produced in the anoxic layers of soils and sediments is consumed by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme and anaerobic methanotrophic bacteria that use alternate electron acceptors such as nitrate haroon et al 2013 nitrite shen et al 2017 fe iii ettwig et al 2016 weber et al 2017 and mn iv ettwig et al 2016 anme are divided into three lineages of anme 1 subclusters a and b anme 2 subclusters a b c and d and anme 3 which have been detected in marine and freshwater environments and estimated to oxidize up to 90 of the methane released before it reaches the atmosphere vaksmaa et al 2017a among these anme 2d are mainly distributed in paddy soils vaksmaa et al 2017b and freshwater sediments ding et al 2015 these ecosystems commonly with high organic content represent the largest natural source of methane therefore we can infer the coexistence of methane and humics in these environments until now it has been estimated that humics contribute to suppress methane emissions in wetland sediments valenzuela et al 2019 soils miller et al 2015 and peat blodau and deppe 2012 however the relationship between methane oxidation and humics reduction the functional microbes and electron transfer mechanisms during these processes are poorly understood only two laboratory studies have explored the microbial community that performs humics dependent aom scheller et al 2016 demonstrated that anme 2a and 2c decouple from sulfate reducing bacteria srb partners and maintain high aom rates with has and aqds as electron acceptors valenzuela et al 2017 reported that the mbg d family a proposed microbial player in metal dependent aom performs aom coupled to the reduction of humics and aqds given recent evidence on the potential role of methanotrophic microorganisms as functional microbes for humics dependent aom we provide biogeochemical insight into the role of anme 2d catalyzed reduction of humics for aom anme 2d are known as denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo archaea that are capable of coupling nitrate reduction to methane oxidation via the reverse methanogenesis pathway using the key enzyme methyl coenzyme m reductase a mcra haroon et al 2013 anme 2d usually form syntrophic consortia with denitrifying methanotrophic bacteria nc10 as anme 2d can only reduce nitrate to nitrite and nitrite is converted to dinitrogen gas by nc10 however the reduction of extracellular fe iii and mn iv metals is independently achieved by anme 2d in the absence of a bacterial syntrophic partner ettwig et al 2016 cultivation and biochemical characterization of anme 2d have been started only recently and many unknowns remain regarding anme 2d even though they are widely distributed in many different environments ding et al 2015 welte 2018 welte et al 2016 if this clade is capable of performing humics dependent aom in environment it will represent an unrevealed methane sink that could have huge biogeochemical and ecological implications as the amount of ch4 mitigated by anme 2d in natural ecosystems may be much higher than previously considered due to the processes of nitrate fe iii and mn iv dependent aom therefore the aim of this study was to determine whether anme 2d could use humics as terminal electron acceptors for aom and decouple from its partner bacteria when the electron acceptor changed from nitrate to humics in this study we investigated the aom activity of aquatic has and quinones with different chemical structures i e anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid aqds and anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid aqs 13c labelled methane was used to verify the feasibility of aom coupled to different electron acceptors the effects of methane partial pressure and representative electron acceptor i e aqds concentrations on aom activity were also explored the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput sequencing were applied to evaluate the changes in copy numbers of the mcra and16s rrna genes of archaea and bacteria as well as the microbial consortia structure finally hypothesized electron transfer models of humics reduction were proposed it is anticipated that the findings will extend our knowledge on alternate electron acceptors for aom during biogeochemical carbon cycle processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and cultivation conditions the inoculum was taken from a damo reactor that had been fed nitrate nitrite and methane for more than 2 years and it contained damo archaea anme 2d and damo bacteria nc10 the inoculum was washed three times with fresh mineral medium to remove residual nitrate and diluted to a final biomass concentration of approximately 0 10 g volatile suspended solids vss l the mineral medium consisted of per l constant element of 0 5 g

hcl 2 2 isotope tracer experiments potential methane oxidation with different electron acceptors was evaluated using 13c labelled methane 13ch4 each 50 ml serum vial contained 20 ml of mineral medium and 5 ml of nitrate free inoculum and was continuously flushed with n2 co2 95 5 v v for about 30 min to produce anaerobic conditions one group was the negative control without addition any of electron acceptor named the control vials other serum vials were injected with different electron acceptor stock solutions to obtain a final concentration of similar electron acceptable capability table 1 because of the impurity and complexity of the has 50 60 as humic acids sigma aldrich we did not quantify the potential electron equivalent of has the concentration of 2 g l was chosen from a previous study lovley et al 1996 then 5 ml of headspace gas was replaced with an equal volume of 13ch4 99 sigma aldrich resulting in a final partial pressure of 0 2 atm 13ch4 the vials were cultured at 35 c in a shaking incubator at 150 rpm a 20 μl aliquot of headspace gas was sampled using a gas tight glass syringe sge analytical science ringwood vic australia and immediately measured by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890 5975c agilent technologies palo alto ca usa in selected ion monitoring m z 44 45 mode all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 3 effect of methane partial pressure and electron acceptor concentration on aom to evaluate the effect of methane partial pressure and electron acceptor e g aqds concentration on aom 50 ml serum vials were filled with 20 ml medium and 5 ml inoculum and sparged with n2 co2 95 5 v v for 30 min then different amounts of aqds stock solution were added to half of the vials to final concentrations of 0 1 1 5 and 10 mm with the same methane partial pressure of 0 4 atm methane was added to the other half of the vials with partial pressures of 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 atm respectively and the concentration of aqds was kept at 10 mm all experiments were performed in triplicate and operated at 35 c inside a shaking incubator methane 200 μl in the headspace was measured by gc 9790 fuli analytical instrument co ltd zhejiang china with hydrogen as the carrier gas the liquid sample was sampled and filtered via a 0 22 μm spin filter in an anaerobic glove box and then qualitatively analyzed for aqds and ah2qds by a uv vis spectrophotometer model sp 752 shanghai china liu et al 2007 2 4 microbial community changes with different electron acceptors four 200 ml reactors with 100 ml working volume were used to determine the repeatability of methane consumption aom activity and microbial community changes in response to the different electron acceptors after three cycle reduction the reactors were first sparged with n2 co2 95 5 v v for 30 min to ensure anaerobic conditions and then sparged with ch4 co2 95 5 v v for 15 min to supply methane the reactors were operated at 35 c and stirred at 150 rpm in an incubator shaker the electron acceptors i e has aqds aqs and no3 n were supplied manually via the stock solutions to achieve the same final concentrations described in table 1 every 7 8 days the reactors were settled and 80 ml of the supernatant was removed replaced with the same volume of fresh mineral medium then re sparged with ch4 co2 95 5 v v and injected with the electron acceptor stock solutions gas samples 200 μl were taken by a gas tight glass syringe sge australia at regular intervals from the headspace of the reactors to measure the methane concentration by gc in addition statistical analysis was conducted by one way anova method using ibm spss 23 to inspect the effect of electron acceptor type on methane consumption 2 5 dna extraction 16s rrna gene sequencing and qpcr analysis after three cycle reduction the inoculum and microbial samples 10 ml from the four reactors were taken for dna extraction using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the bacterial and archaeal 341b4 f 806 r universal primers lu et al 2016 and sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform by novogene biotechnology co beijing china the raw data analysis was identical to the methods used in our early study fu et al 2019 the abundance of 16s rrna genes from archaea and bacteria along with the crucial methane oxidation mcra gene was further analyzed by qpcr the qpcr primers and conditions were referred from a previous study lai et al 2018 and this process was conducted by majorbio shanghai china the sequences obtained in this study have been submitted to the sequence read archive sra database and the accession numbers are srr9201786 srr9201790 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of aom with nitrate and humics as electron acceptors we performed isotope labeling experiments using 13ch4 to detect aom with different electron acceptors 13c was enriched in carbon dioxide expressed as 13co2 from the oxidation of 13ch4 it was obvious that there was no 13co2 generation without the addition of any electron acceptor fig 1 as for the experiments with electron acceptors increase of 13fco2 calculated from 13co2 13co2 12co2 was observed over the first day of incubation and there was insignificant distinction among nitrate and humics electron acceptors p 0 509 0 05 although the potential electron equivalent accepted by 4 4 mm of no3 n 21 5 mm e was similar to 10 mm aqds aqs 20 mm e less 13co2 was generated with the humic electron acceptors compared with no3 after a 5 day incubation fig 1 which was possibly ascribed to the much more thermodynamically favorable aom coupled to nitrate reduction than humics taking aqds as an example the change in gibbs free energy was 43 2 kj mol 1 ch4 4aqds 2h2o co2 4aqh2ds δg0 43 2 kj mol 1 ch4 which is much lower than the changes in gibbs free energy with no3 5ch4 8no3 8h 5co2 4n2 14h2o δg0 765 kj mol 1 ch4 3 2 effects of electron acceptor concentration and methane partial pressure on aom the profiles of methane consumption were quantified by increasing methane partial pressure and aqds concentration to investigate the effects of electron donor and electron acceptor concentrations on aom the detailed changes in methane concentration are shown in fig s1 both the amount and rate of methane consumption increased as the aqds concentrations increased from 0 1 to 10 mm at the same methane partial pressure of 0 4 atm fig 2 a significant color changes associated with the redox processes occurred due to the change in quinone chemical structure thus the reduction of aqds to ah2qds was confirmed by uv vis absorption spectroscopy ah2qds and aqds were qualitatively determined from their absorbance values near 385 and 326 nm with a detection limit of 0 5 mm fig s2 although the initial ch4 aqds ratio table s1 was much higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 0 25 4aqds ch4 2h2o 4ah2qds co2 the consumption of methane was not linear with the change in aqds concentration for example when the concentration of aqds increased 10 times from 0 1 to 1 mm the consumption of methane only doubled the aom rate increased from 0 0026 mmol day to 0 0050 mmol day and then it increased more slowly with higher aqds concentrations fig 2a which mean that the reduction in aqds was not the rate limiting step the consumption of methane reached its maximum of 0 0043 mmol at 10 mm aqds fig 2a in contrast the consumption of methane increased linearly with the rise in methane partial pressure in the same aqds concentration i e 10 mm fig 2b this mean that even though methane was excessive in all cases methane transfer was still the crucial step to control the rate of aom due to the poor solubility of methane 3 5 mg 100 ml water he et al 2013 this result was consistent with the damo process in which methane must first dissolve in the liquid for utilization by microbes thus high methane partial pressures promote methane transfer cai et al 2018 ding et al 2014 3 3 methane consumption and aom activity during the reduction of various electron acceptors the 23 day operating period contained three cycles based on the consumption of the electron acceptors the concentration of methane continued to drop during each cycle fig 3 a the methane oxidation rate 0 0063 mmol day r2 0 9618 during cycle 1 was the highest when no3 was the electron acceptor and there was no obvious difference among the other three humics electron acceptors about 0 0055 mmol day fig 3b which was consistent with the isotope experimental result fig 1 the consumption rate of methane kept stable with no3 0 0063 mmol day r2 0 9573 and aqs 0 0056 mmol day r2 0 9765 during cycle 2 but dropped during cycle 3 no3 0 0035 mmol day r2 0 8443 and aqs 0 0036 mmol day r2 0 9726 fig 3b the consumption rate of methane with aqds 0 0039 mmol day r2 0 9139 in cycle 3 and has 0 0017 mmol day in cycle 3 r2 0 4213 decreased gradually over time on the whole the consumption rate of methane decreased from the beginning to the end of the experiments for the four electron acceptors it was thought that this result occurred because of the biomass loss by changing the culture medium for each cycle and partly because of the electron acceptor itself for example bio toxicity in addition we did not control the initial methane partial pressure strictly here which might be another reason for the decreasing of methane consumption rate in cycle 3 the downward trend was more pronounced particularly for the has and there was a slight methanogenesis trend at the end of cycle 3 statistically there was no significant difference among four electron acceptors on methane consumption p 0 973 0 05 over three cycles of the experiment this result indicated that humics electron acceptor can substitute nitrate for aom and methane metabolism is unaffected the variation in aom activity was further confirmed by quantifying the 16s rrna genes by qpcr fig 4 shows the copy numbers of archaeal and bacterial 16s rrna genes along with the mcra gene at the end of cycle 3 the mcra gene is a specific biomarker for detecting anme which catalyzes the activation of methane in the reverse methanogenic pathway hallam et al 2003 vaksmaa et al 2017a although the methane consumption rate decreased during cycle 3 the copy numbers of the archaeal 16s rrna and mcra genes increased with no3 aqds and aqs compared to the inoculum indicating growth of anme archaea in this system in addition mcra gene was expressed higher in aqds and aqs than in no3 which was consistent with the finding that mcra gene expression was higher in fe aom process than in nitrate aom process ettwig et al 2016 suggesting similar higher methane oxidation activity of anme 2d with humics and metal these results also indicated that anme 2d might be the only functional microorganisms performing methane oxidation in humics electron acceptors however both the copy numbers of the archaea 16s rrna and mcra genes decreased slightly with has which was parallel to the lower consumption rates of methane at the end of cycle 3 fig 3 it is likely attributed to the inherently complex structure and uneasy biodegradable character of the has lovley et al 1996 on the other hand has can inhibit enzyme activities yap et al 2018 which might be another reason for the low rate and expression in addition compared to the inoculum the gene copy number of the bacterial 16s rrna gene decreased among the four electron acceptors suggesting that archaea were more active than bacteria for aom under this condition 3 4 microbial community structure with different electron acceptors the microbial community in the inoculum and reactors after a three cycle reduction with different electron acceptors was analyzed using 16s rrna high throughput sequencing a total of 415 718 qualified sequences were generated from the five samples table s3 the distribution of bacteria and archaea at the phylum level are shown in fig 5 a the dominant phyla in the inoculum were euryarchaeota proteobacteria and nc10 with relative abundances of 27 90 13 30 and 30 59 respectively compared with the inoculum these three phyla remained the dominant microorganisms but the abundances of euryarchaeota and nc10 were slightly lower in four electron acceptors the abundance of proteobacteria was higher in abundance in the humic electron acceptors than that in the inoculum and nitrate further analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences at the genus level indicated that candidatus methylomirabilis 30 52 affiliated to nc10 phylum and candidatus methanoperedens 27 69 affiliated to anme 2d family and euryarchaeota phylum were dominant bacteria and archaea in inoculum respectively fig 5b similar to the inoculum candidatus methanoperedens was still the dominant archaea and accounted for 26 43 no3 23 90 aqds 25 46 aqs and 21 14 has with the different types of electron acceptors the abundance of candidatus methylomirabilis was 27 45 with no3 and 23 83 with aqs but sharply decreased to 17 78 with aqds and 9 06 with has nevertheless there was no emerging methane oxidizing microorganisms candidatus methylomirabilis damo bacteria and candidatus methanoperedens damo archaea were the only known microbes performing methane oxidation with the four electron acceptors although there was a slight methanogenesis trend at the end of cycle 3 with has fig 3a the abundance of methaneogens appeared with has were very low methanosaeta 0 02 methanoculleus 0 0032 and their roles were negligible furthermore under the humics electron acceptor conditions the total abundance of the two genera of candidatus brocadia aqds 4 66 aqs 1 92 has 5 49 and candidatus kuenenia aqds 1 08 aqs 0 79 has 0 13 increased compared with that in the inoculum candidatus brocadia 0 80 candidatus kuenenia 0 08 and nitrate candidatus brocadia 1 73 candidatus kuenenia 0 26 table s2 which are known as anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria the genus geobacter affiliated with the proteobacteria phylum was emerging with relative abundances of 2 39 aqds 2 05 aqs and 1 94 has in the humics electron acceptors this genus was almost negligible in the inoculum 0 03 and nitrate sludge 0 04 it is well known that geobacter is a representative iron reducing microorganism that transports electrons via electron shuttles or directly to an electrode iron oxide or other available electron acceptor such as humics voordeckers et al 2010 wolf et al 2009 3 5 the hypothesized different electron transfer models with nitrate and humics as electron acceptors the key difference between nitrate and humics was that nitrate is soluble inorganic salt and humics are macromolecular organic matters and usually extracellular electron acceptors nitrate dependent aom is well studied haroon et al 2013 which is commonly catalyzed by anme 2d using reverse methanogenesis and transfers its product nitrite to the nitrite dependent methanotroph nc10 which continue to mediate methane oxidation via an intra aerobic pathway ettwig et al 2010 in this study the dominant archaea and bacteria are still candidatus methanoperedens 26 43 and candidatus methylomirabilis 27 45 after nitrate reduction thus based on the reported studies and the result of microbial community structure the electron transfer model with nitrate as electron acceptor is shown in fig 6 a compared with the inoculum the relative abundance of nc10 in aqs aqds and has decreased from 30 52 to 23 90 17 78 and 9 06 respectively while the composition of anme 2d were relatively stable before and after reduction accounting for 21 15 27 69 the anme 2d clade contain genes encoding multihaem c type cytochromes mcglynn et al 2015 some of which are shuttles for extracellular electron transfer roden et al 2010 shi et al 2007 and are predicted to conduct electrons derived from reverse methanogenesis from the archaeal membrane to outside of the cell for reduction of extracellular electron acceptors such as fe iii mn iv beal et al 2009 ettwig et al 2016 and selenate luo et al 2018 in addition humics are macromolecular organic matters and cannot be directly transported into the cell which are usually reduced extracellularly with metal like reduction mechanism voordeckers et al 2010 moreover anme 2a and 2c were demonstrated to decouple from their syntrophic srb partners using has and aqds as terminal electron acceptors through an extracellular electron transfer mechanism scheller et al 2016 thus based on the results obtained in our study and those from the literature one hypothesis is that scheller et al 2016 anme 2d can also directly use humics as terminal electron acceptors for independent aom similar to other anme clades while nc10 can only reduce nitrite through dismutation of no to n2 and o2 via an intra aerobic methane oxidation pathway ettwig et al 2010 thus it was sure nc10 would not work in humics reduction according to this hypothesis this can be regarded as a method for decoupling anme 2d from its symbiotic bacteria nc10 in addition an intriguing finding was the emergence of geobacter and the increase of anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia in humics electron acceptors geobacter species contain c type cytochromes and transfer electrons extracellularly to fe iii and electrodes bond and lovley 2003 holmes et al 2017 lovley et al 2011 geobacter species can also use has or aqds as electron shuttles or terminal electron acceptors to support anaerobic oxidation of organic compounds such as acetate lovley et al 1996 voordeckers et al 2010 furthermore many studies have reported the synthetic consortium and intermediate mediated electron transfer mechanism between methane related archaea and geobacter species in methane based microbial fuel cell ding et al 2016 gao et al 2017 mcanulty et al 2017 yamasaki et al 2018 yu et al 2019 all of these studies support the same role for geobacter in our system anammox process has been speculated to play an important role in the global nitrogen biogeochemical cycle ding et al 2014 anammox bacteria oxidizing ammonium coupled to the reduction of nitrate thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 nitrite kuypers et al 2003 sulfate rios del toro et al 2018a and fe iii bao and li 2017 have been reported in marine and terrestrial ecosystems more recently anammox driven by nom promotes nitrogen loss in marine sediments where anmmox bacteria perform the nom dependent anammox process anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to nom reduction rios del toro et al 2018b which supports a novel pathway interconnecting the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and carbon humics represent the redox fractions of nom in this study ammonium was originally added as a nitrogen source but may also partly participate in the microbial conversion of humics and promote the growth of anammox bacteria thus there may be a synergistic role between anme 2d and partner bacteria from the above the two potential electron transfer models to humics are shown in fig 6b 3 6 environmental implications humics are stable organic matter that accumulate in soil martinez et al 2013 peatland blodau and deppe 2012 freshwater sediments valenzuela et al 2017 and marine sediments hansell 2013 the redox functional groups in humics possess three important roles 1 as terminal electron acceptors for microbial respiration 2 as redox mediators electron shuttles for electron transfer and 3 as electron donors for microbial reduction of more oxidized electron acceptors which significantly impacts the redox conversion and fate of a large variety of inorganic and organic contaminants martinez et al 2013 here we provide new evidence that humics serve as terminal acceptors for methanotrophs which simultaneously has environmental significance for mitigating greenhouse gases emissions from anoxic environments it is generally considered that the most important electron acceptors for methanotrophs in anaerobic environments are sulfate nitrate mn iv and fe iii however as the abundant form of nom in nature the role of humics should not be ignored this study supports the hypothesis reported in the literature that humics addition suppresses methane release is due to methane oxidation other than inhibiting methanogenesis blodau and deppe 2012 it might be the hidden mechanism for humics lowering methane release in natural environments which further extends our understanding of global methane flux in addition humics dependent aom might represent a direct methane sink that could have potent biogeochemical and ecological implications as the net amount of methane mitigated by humics in organotrophic ecosystems may be much higher than traditionally considered due to the electron shuttling mediated redox interactions involved in humics catalyzed fe aom processes valenzuela et al 2019 4 conclusions an enriched culture containing anme 2d was used to study the potential of aom coupled to the reduction of humics the main outcomes were 13c labled isotopic experiment showed that humics could serve as terminal electron acceptors for aom after three cycle incubation aom activity was highest when aqds and aqs were electron acceptors anme 2d were the dominant methane oxidation archaea after humics reduction although the partner bacteria nc10 decreased other reported humics reduction bacteria geobactor and anammox appeared the potential electron transfer models from anme 2d to humics were proposed declaration of competing interest the

18549,the high pollutant loads discharged from cities pose risks to urban waterways and in turn the estuarine environments making it challenging to improve urban liveability past studies on the behaviour of pollutants in rivers have largely investigated their transport along the waterway primarily focusing on the movement of water and sediment however the current approaches in pollutant transport modelling provide limited insights into how pollutant transfer between water and sediment phases influences their transport from the upstream towards the estuarine environment this research study firstly identified typical patterns of metal loads along an urban river in a highly populated city in china the outcomes were then used to conceptualise metal transfer between water and sediment phases it was noted that physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments play a key role in metal transfer between the two phases and the dominant transfer path sediment to water water to sediment is different between different metals independent of their origin crustal anthropogenic or marine related several scenarios were derived from the conceptualisation of metal behaviour these in turn were then used to develop real world scenarios of metal transport in rivers based on the field data the conceptualisation of metal behaviour confirmed that each metal is likely to have a dominant phase of transport sediment water which is influenced by the dominant transfer path of that metal between water and sediments graphical abstract image 1 keywords estuarine environment metals pollutant transfer pollutant transport urban liveability urban river pollution 1 introduction the transition of human population from rural areas to cities has been increasing over the past decades and currently more than half of global population is urban according to the united nations as of 2016 512 cities around the world are inhabited by over one million people and this number will increase to 662 cities by 2030 further 31 of these cities the most in china 6 had more than 10 million inhabitants in 2016 and this figure is projected to increase to 41 cities by 2030 still the most from china 8 undesa 2016 2018 most of these highly populated cities are geographically located in the proximity of the bay area estuary of a large river in fact urban rivers as the primary source of water ranging from consumptive uses to recreational activities play an important role in the liveability of cities wb drc 2013 however the cities commonly discharge stormwater and treated wastewater that carry non biodegradable pollutants such as metals into the river posing risks to both human and ecosystem health islam et al 2015 landrigan et al 2018 li et al 2014 xu et al 2014 it is also likely that river waters transport large amounts of pollutants to the estuarine environment further there is pollutants transfer between water and sediments as such sediments will also transport pollutants to the estuarine environment ciszewski and grygar 2016 rügner et al 2019 xiao et al 2013 zhou and broodbank 2014 moreover the degradation of the estuarine environment associated with urban rivers can be substantial because of the increase in pollutant loads over time as the river continues to transport pollutants and sea water intrusion into the river due to tidal effects brady et al 2014a b kennish 2017 the degree of pollution of the estuarine environment is dependent on the capacity of the river to transport pollutants through the water column as well as sediments although the flow dynamics of the water column and sediments have been well documented merritt et al 2003 nakagawa 2017 van rijn 1993 the transfer of pollutants between the water and sediment phases has received only limited attention the modelling approaches used to replicate pollutant transport along rivers ani et al 2009 benedini and tsakiris 2013 markus et al 2016 mcbride and rutherford 1984 periáñez et al 2013 are largely based on the principles of stream hydraulics for example analytical and numerical modelling of pollutant transport by ani et al 2009 relied on advection dispersion equations to predict pollutant mass transport governed by water flow characteristics e g flow velocity and channel characteristics e g wetted area of the channel however they did not note the possibility of pollutants transfer with sediments markus et al 2016 modelled the transport of engineered metallic nanoparticles along the water column of a fast flowing river although they accounted for the transfer of nanoparticles between river water and sediments little attention was given to the transport of nanoparticles via the sediment mass or transfer of nanoparticles from sediments to water these studies have typically accounted for pollutant transport via either water or sediments separately some commercially available models for example mike 11 allows combining both water and sediment phases but the pollutant mass balance calculations do not adequately account for the interactions between pollutants in the two phases benedini and tsakiris 2013 the study by huang et al 2015 created models by incorporating pollutant interactions between water and sediment phases in environmental systems such as large reservoirs however these models may not be appropriate to investigate the behaviour of pollutants in urban rivers due to their dynamic nature continuous flow currents and turbulence compared to reservoirs pollutants potentially exhibit rather complex behaviours within the water and sediment phases such as adsorption and desorption past research studies show that the interactions between terrestrial particulate solids e g soils and road dust and ionic molecular forms of pollutants such as metals are influenced by a range of physico chemical characteristics of water ph and dissolved organic matter as well as sediment particles organic matter content mineralogical composition and particle size bradl 2004 gunawardana 2011 peng et al 2018 sposito 2008 therefore there is a need for a major step forward in knowledge of changes to pollutant loads during transport in the aquatic environment in order to understand how terrestrial pollution leads to degradation of rivers and in turn marine environments such as estuaries this research study hypothesised that changes to the physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments along the river influence metal transfer between water and sediment phases and in turn the transport of metals into the estuarine environment as such the investigation aimed a to understand the relationships between water and sediment characteristics and metal loads along the river and how these relationships are influenced by changes to these characteristics and b to conceptualise pollutant interactions between water and sediment phases for modelling pollutant transport in urban rivers the study lays the foundation for understanding the mechanisms of pollutant transfer between water and sediment phases for modelling of pollutant transport along urban rivers this is a critical need for the design of measures to improve urban water quality and to protect the aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area water and sediment samples were collected from shenzhen river located in shenzhen south china where a large number of production facilities of major technology companies are located the river which is also the natural border between mainland of china and hong kong spans over 37 km with a catchment area of 297 km2 172 km2 in shenzhen and 125 km2 in hong kong and flows into shenzhen bay the sampling was undertaken at 11 locations from the upstream to shenzhen bay these locations are surrounded primarily by residential commercial industrial agricultural and natural land uses as shown in fig 1 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis at each location three water samples and three sediment samples were collected sample collection and handling procedures are discussed in detail in the supplementary information the basic water quality parameters ph salinity dissolved oxygen and turbidity were tested in situ and the data is provided in table s1 in the supplementary information the salinity of water was found to increase from upstream to downstream in the range of 0 20 8 90 this indicates the impact of tidal effects in the estuarine area dissolved oxygen and turbidity in water ranged 0 5 6 0 mg l and 36 7 126 6 ntu respectively these results imply a relatively high variation in water quality along the river due to changes in the surrounding environment at each sampling site the samples collected were transported to the laboratory for further analysis the sediment samples were analysed for particle size distribution psd and mineralogical composition and both water and sediment samples were analysed for thirteen metals al ti mn fe ni cu zn ba pb na mg k and ca and organic carbon oc content the metals which are ubiquitous in urban areas were selected such that they represent crustal metals soil sourced al ti mn and fe anthropogenic metals sourced from human activities ni cu zn ba and pb and marine related metals sourced from marine estuarine environments na mg k and ca the testing methods and quality control and quality assurance procedures are discussed in the supplementary information 2 3 data analysis the data analyses consisted of three stages 1 evaluation of the variations in metal loads and physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments along the river from upstream to the estuarine environment 2 identification of the relationships between water and sediment characteristics and metal loads along the river and how these relationships are influenced by changes to these characteristics and 3 development of a conceptual model describing the role of interactions between water and sediment phases in the transport of metals along the river 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation in metal loads from upstream to estuarine environment in the context of environmental pollution the origin of pollutants and their transport pathways are important for effective pollution mitigation understanding of these factors helps to determine whether to adopt a source control or transport control approach for the design of effective pollution mitigation strategies accordingly in this section the identification of the patterns of variations in crustal anthropogenic and marine related metal loads and how these three types of metals behave along the river were analysed fig 2 shows total metal loads in water from upstream to the estuarine environment crustal metals al ti mn and fe show a decreasing pattern particularly from sampling location 3 s3 in fig 1 and marine related metals na mg k and ca show an increasing pattern particularly from sampling location 5 s5 in fig 1 and both patterns are generally consistent for all metals in each group however anthropogenic metals ni cu zn ba and pb do not exhibit a consistent pattern fig 3 shows the total metal loads in sediments at each sampling location compared to the patterns in water metals in sediments exhibit more distinct patterns at different longitudinal sections along the river crustal metal load generally increases from s1 to s5 then decreases towards s8 and again increases in the proximity of the estuarine environment s9 s11 unlike in water fig 2 anthropogenic metals in sediments show a consistent increase from s1 to s4 decrease towards s7 and again show an increase near the estuarine environment further marine related metal load generally increases from upstream to downstream except for ca accordingly it is evident that even the same group of metals exhibit rather inconsistent patterns between water and sediment phases this on one hand underlines the complexity of the behaviour of metals not only between groups that are based on the origin of metals but also between individual metals within the same group on the other hand there is a need for an in depth analysis of the influence of the physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments on the variations of metal loads identified 3 2 interactions between water and sediment phases in metal transport as water and sediment phases are in contact the interactions of ionic and molecular forms of pollutants in each phase would occur primarily through adsorption and desorption processes these processes are underpinned by three mechanisms chemisorption ion exchange and precipitation chemisorption occurs when the pollutants in the solution water forms strong covalent bonds with chemically reactive surface functional groups on the surface of solid particles sediments bradl 2004 ion exchange results in the replacement of charged ions on solid particles in the solution through relatively weak electrostatic bonds mcbride 1994 in essence the above two mechanisms are largely influenced by the physico chemical characteristics of the solid particles e g particle size specific surface area mineralogy and surface coatings while pollutants in the solution can precipitate on the surface of solid particles depending on the ph and concentration of pollutants gunawardana 2011 3 2 1 implications of the change in particle size from upstream to downstream while particle size plays the key role in metal adsorption to particulate solids other influential physico chemical characteristics e g particle surface area and surface coatings are closely related to particle size gunawardana et al 2012 2014 as it is an important parameter particle size was separately investigated before other parameters those discussed in section 3 2 2 fig 4 shows both volume based and surface area based psd of sediments collected at the sampling locations along the river the psds are consistent with the fact that fine particles have relatively larger surface area increasing the potential for adsorbing pollutants due to the presence of more surface functional groups wijesiri et al 2016 however the most important observation from fig 4 is that particle size decreases in turn the particle surface area increases from upstream towards the estuarine environment compare psds for s1 s5 psds for s6 s8 and psds for s9 s11 this is due to the transport of fine sediment particles along the river as these are more likely to be suspended in water and subject to currents and turbulence than larger particles moreover as the river approaches the estuarine environment its bed slope tends to reduce and accordingly the flow velocity tends to reduce and larger particles will gradually settle on the bed however when there is a flood high flow high velocity the bed will be flushed out due to the above phenomenon the metal load associated with sediments in the proximity of the estuarine environment could be higher than that in upstream locations as the finer particles have a relatively greater capacity to adsorb cations in fact this occurrence is valid for crustal metals and marine related metals except for ca in sediments fig 3 which show an increasing trend from s1 to s11 for crustal metals this is further supported by the decreasing metal load in water fig 2 which is attributed to the adsorption of metals by fine particles in sediments that are abundantly available in the estuarine environment although marine related metals load in water increases fig 2 it could be potentially due to sea water intrusion na mg2 k and ca2 in the form of salts from tidal effects moreover anthropogenic metals in sediments and water do not support the increase in metal loads in sediments with the increase in fine particles accordingly it is likely that fine sediment particles would preferentially adsorb crustal and marine related metals rather than anthropogenic metals these inconsistencies could be attributed to the contribution of anthropogenic activities along the river and tributaries which is not related to the physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments as well as metal transport via water and sediments as evident from fig 1 the estuarine area surrounded by the natural environment do not support many anthropogenic activities compared to the upstream areas 3 2 2 implications of the change in mineralogy organic carbon and ph from upstream to downstream mineralogy is important as it determines the types of surface functional groups protruding from the surface of sediment particles this influences what species of metals are likely to be adsorbed jayarathne et al 2018 sutherland et al 2012 on the other hand organic carbon content in sediments indicates the presence of organic coatings around particles which also provide specific surface functional groups organic carbon in water would play a key role in metal adsorption as it influences organic complexation of metals murakami et al 2008 further ph of water influences the surface electrochemical properties of sediment particles i e positive and negative charge distribution and in turn the adsorption and desorption of metals from sediments wijesiri et al 2016 given that mineralogy organic carbon content and ph are factors that influence the interactions between metals and surface functional groups on sediment particles it was necessary to undertake a quantitative analysis of the data in order to better understand metal transfer between water and sediment phases therefore a bayesian network bn model was developed and its graphical structure is shown in fig 5 the markov property of bns accounts for the conditional dependencies among a given set of random variables such that a particular variable is dependent only on its immediate parent variables korb and nicholson 2010 this enables effectively dealing with small data sets by avoiding the curse of dimensionality wijesiri et al 2018 these dependencies are firstly identified using expert opinion state of the art knowledge of the process system being modelled the identified relationships are then visualised as a graphical structure which is then fitted with the observed measured data this will result in estimations of model parameters which indicate the strength of the relationships between variables in terms of conditional probabilities for discrete variables and conditional regression coefficients for continuous variables chen and pollino 2012 provide guidelines for good practice in bns modelling while aguilera et al 2011 and uusitalo 2007 provide in depth discussions on the applications of bns in environmental modelling the bn shown in fig 5 describes how mineralogy of sediments organic carbon in water and sediments and ph of water can influence the interactions between metals in water and sediment phases it is important to note that 1 this bn is expected to describe only the metal transfer between the two phases under the influence of factors that stimulate or restrain adsorption and desorption by sediment particles 2 for a given metal this bn model does not account for the potential influence on a particular metal from other metals present in the water sediment matrix e g cations competing for functional groups on sediment particles therefore the outcomes of the bn model are conditional on the model structure shown in fig 5 the proposed model was fitted with observed data metals in water mg l metals in sediments μg g organic carbon in water mg l organic carbon in sediments g kg sediment mineralogy ph in water using bnlearn package in the r statistical computing platform scutari 2009 data on the mineralogical composition of sediments organic carbon content in sediments and water and ph in water are given in table s1 in the supplementary information the model parameters were estimated for two metal transfer paths see table 1 from water to sediments and see table 2 from sediments to water the more likely path of metal transfer is identified by comparing the relative magnitude of model parameters corresponding to each path see influence column in tables 1 and 2 it was evident from the root mean squared error rmse calculated tables 1 and 2 observed vs predicted plots and residual plots figs s2 s5 in supplementary information that the model relating to metal transfer from water to sediments i e model 1 performs satisfactorily for all metals however the other model i e model 2 performs well only for a limited number of metals i e mn cu and marine related metals this implies that desorption of most crustal and anthropogenic metals from sediments to water model 2 can be influenced by other factors other than ph mineralogy and organic carbon content and also the potential competition between cations which was not accounted for in this study as the new knowledge on these influential factors becomes available the structure of the bn model can be improved by adding new predictor variables resulting in better model performance accordingly the following discussion is based on the metals where the model performs well as evident from tables 1 and 2 metals show both positive and negative inverse relationships between the total metal loads in water and sediment phases the positive relationships mean that when the metal load in one phase increases the metal load in the other phase would also increase on the other hand the inverse relationships mean that when metal load in one phase increases the metal load in the other phase is expected to decrease in fact when considering metal transfer from one phase to another obviously those metals with inverse relationships are more likely to undergo adsorption desorption however the metals with positive relationships could also be transferred between water and sediment phases while they are more likely to be transported via water or sediments these complex behaviours are discussed in detail with examples below as such more mn a crustal metal is transferred from sediments to water 63 082 influence table 2 than from water to sediments 3 913 influence table 1 thus the more dominant transfer path of mn is sediments to water which is also supported by the inverse relationships between mn in sediments and water conditional regression coefficient 0 631 table 2 the inverse relationship further implies that at a given location the mn load desorbed transferred from sediments to water is greater than mn load transported via sediments from upstream similarly for k a marine related metal the transfer from sediments to water 6 816 influence table 2 is dominant over the transfer from water to sediments 0 512 influence table 1 however unlike mn k loads in sediments and water are positively related when they are transferred between phases conditional regression coefficient 3 942 table 2 the implication of this observation is that at a given location k in sediments is desorbed to water however the k load desorbed is less than the k load transported via sediments from upstream contrary to mn and k behaviour cu an anthropogenic metal exhibits a different behaviour more cu in water is adsorbed by sediments 1 999 influence table 1 than what is already attached to sediments being desorbed into water 0 439 influence table 2 this is further supported by the inverse relationship between cu loads in water and sediment phases conditional regression coefficient 0 226 table 1 this means that cu load transferred from water to sediments is larger than cu load transported via water from upstream in conclusion sediment phase plays the key role in k and cu transport and more mn is likely to be transported via water to the estuarine environment similarly the dominant transfer path i e sediments to water water to sediments and dominant transport phase i e sediments or water for other metals can be determined using the bn outcomes given in tables 1 and 2 and are summarised in table 3 below 3 3 conceptualisation of pollutant interactions between water and sediment phases as discussed in the introduction current modelling approaches to pollutant transport in river systems rely on the movement of water and sediment and does not account for the changes to pollutant load resulting from the interactions between the two phases such changes are typically not influenced by the water and sediment movements but rather would be determined by the physico chemical characteristics of these media as discussed in section 3 2 accordingly this section conceptualises the impact of changes to pollutant loads between water and sediment phases on the overall pollutant transport along the river towards the estuarine environment the conceptual model which was developed based on mass balance principles is shown in fig 6 accordingly the river is divided into longitudinal sections based on major locations where the pollutants are discharged via anthropogenic and natural processes thus at a given section si and at a given time ti the load of a particular pollutant in water m w i would be a function of the pollutant load discharged ii load transported in via water from the preceding section m wt i 1 load transferred from sediment at the current section due to adsorption desorption processes m str i and load transported out via water towards the next section m wt i 1 similarly the load of the same pollutant in sediments m s i would be a function of the load transported in via sediment from the preceding section m st i 1 load transferred from water at the current section due to adsorption desorption processes m wtr i and load transported out via sediment towards the next section m st i 1 accordingly equations 1 3 define the load of pollutant in water sediment and total pollutant load at a given section based on these equations hypothetical scenarios of pollutant transport along the river can be developed facilitating the understanding of pollutant behaviour 3 3 1 general mass balance pollutant load in water at section si 1 m w i i i m w t i 1 m w t i 1 m s t r i m w t r i pollutant load in sediments at section si 2 m s i m s t i 1 m s t i 1 m w t r i m s t r i total pollutant load at section si 3 m w i m s i m i i i m w t i 1 m s t i 1 m w t i 1 m s t i 1 3 4 evaluation of hypothetical scenarios of pollutant transport as outlined below the hypothetical scenario 1 reduces equations 1 and 2 to equations 4 and 5 which leads to case 1 and case 2 3 4 1 hypothetical scenario 1 input pollutant load i and net pollutant load transferred between water and sediment phases mstr mwtr do not vary at different sections this implies that physico chemical properties of water and sediments which influence pollutant transfer between the two phases remain unchanged along the river thus equations 1 and 2 can be written as 4 m w i m w t i 1 m w t i 1 c 1 5 m s i m s t i 1 m s t i 1 c 2 where c1 and c2 are constants case 1 inward transport is greater than outward transport of pollutants i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 case 2 inward transport is less than outward transport of pollutants i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 according to case 1 the load of pollutants transported decreases along the river thus compared to pollutant loads found in the upstream largely reduced pollutant loads can be released into the estuarine environment in fact crustal metals in water fig 2 and ca in sediments fig 3 show similar patterns in order for this to be a real world case there should be factor s that would constrain the movement of ionic and molecular forms of pollutants together with water or sediment mass however hypothetical scenario 1 is inadequate to investigate the causation for such decrease in metal discharge into the estuarine environment this is because of the assumption that pollutant input and transfer between water and sediment phases do not vary at different sections on the other hand case 2 describes pollutant behaviour such that the pollutant load can increase from upstream to downstream this is more likely than case 1 because pollutants would move as the water and sediment masses move along the river in fact case 2 is similar to most modelling approaches undertaken in past studies which have not accounted for pollutant transfer between water and sediment phases this will be explored in hypothetical scenario 2 outlined below 3 4 2 hypothetical scenario 2 input pollutant load i does not vary at different sections but net pollutant load transferred between water and sediment phases mstr mwtr varies this implies that the physico chemical properties of water and sediments which influence pollutant transfer between the two phases are subject to change at different locations along the river thus equations 1 and 2 remains the same therefore case 1 and case 2 in scenario 1 can be elaborated by incorporating the possibilities of metal transfer between water and sediment phases case 1 1 inward transport is greater than outward transport of pollutants given that metal load transferred from water is greater than the metal load transferred from sediments i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 m wtr i m str i case 1 2 inward transport is greater than outward transport of pollutants given that metal load transferred from water is less than the metal load transferred from sediments i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 m wtr i m str i in case 1 1 and case 1 2 pollutant load transported is expected to decrease from upstream to downstream however case 1 1 will be likely only for pollutant transport via water as these pollutants are continuously adsorbed by sediments e g cu see discussion in section 3 2 2 case 1 2 will be likely only for pollutant transport via sediments as these pollutants attached to sediment particles are continuously desorbed into water e g mn and k see discussion in section 3 2 2 case 2 1 inward transport is less than outward transport of pollutants given that metal load transferred from water is greater than the metal load transferred from sediments i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 m wtr i m str i case 2 2 inward transport is less than outward transport of pollutants given that metal load transferred from water is less than the metal load transferred from sediments i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 m wtr i m str i in case 2 1 and case 2 2 both water and sediment masses are expected to transport an amount of pollutants that increases towards the estuarine environment similar to cases 1 1 and 1 2 these two cases will also be likely either in water or sediment phase such that case 2 1 for sediments e g mn and k and case 2 2 for water e g cu more importantly it is possible to replicate real world systems of pollutant transport by combining the cases discussed in the hypothetical scenarios above for example case 1 1 and case 2 1 and case 1 2 and case 2 2 can be combined as each set has the same system of pollutant transfer between water and sediment phases accordingly in the system formed by case 1 1 and case 2 1 sediment mass would play a key role in transporting pollutants towards the estuarine environment as pollutant loads transported have a decreasing trend in water and an increasing trend in sediments similarly water mass contributes most to the pollutant transport in the system formed by case 1 2 and case 2 2 4 conclusions this research study investigated the key role of metal transfer between water and sediment phases in an urban river in relation to metal transport from upstream to the estuarine environment and conceptualised the incorporation of metal transfer processes for metal transport modelling the research outcomes indicated that metals from different origins crustal anthropogenic and marine related generally exhibit consistent patterns in water and sediment phases along the river it was noted that different metals exhibit different behaviour during the transfer between water and sediment phases and the physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments influence the adsorption and desorption processes that underpin metal transfer between the two phases the results also show that each metal has a dominant transfer path sediments to water water to sediments and this dominant path determines the phase that transports the largest amount of metals to the estuarine environment the conceptualisation of the behaviour of metals in water and sediment phases led to the creation of several hypothetical scenarios which helps in understanding the complex real world scenarios observed from the field data accordingly it was revealed that the dominant transfer path sediments to water water to sediments and dominant transport phase sediment water are different for different metals irrespective of their origin these conceptualisations will contribute to enhancing the modelling of pollutant transport in urban waterways and

improve urban water quality and to protect the aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area water and sediment samples were collected from shenzhen river located in shenzhen south china where a large number of production facilities of major technology companies are located the river which is also the natural border between mainland of china and hong kong spans over 37 km with a catchment area of 297 km2 172 km2 in shenzhen and 125 km2 in hong kong and flows into shenzhen bay the sampling was undertaken at 11 locations from the upstream to shenzhen bay these locations are surrounded primarily by residential commercial industrial agricultural and natural land uses as shown in fig 1 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis at each location three water samples and three sediment samples were collected sample collection and handling procedures are discussed in detail in the supplementary information the basic water quality parameters ph salinity dissolved oxygen and turbidity were tested in situ and the data is provided in table s1 in the supplementary information the salinity of water was found to increase from upstream to downstream in the range of 0 20 8 90 this indicates the impact of tidal effects in the estuarine area dissolved oxygen and turbidity in water ranged 0 5 6 0 mg l and 36 7 126 6 ntu respectively these results imply a relatively high variation in water quality along the river due to changes in the surrounding environment at each sampling site the samples collected were transported to the laboratory for further analysis the sediment samples were analysed for particle size distribution psd and mineralogical composition and both water and sediment samples were analysed for thirteen metals al ti mn fe ni cu zn ba pb na mg k and ca and organic carbon oc content the metals which are ubiquitous in urban areas were selected such that they represent crustal metals soil sourced al ti mn and fe anthropogenic metals sourced from human activities ni cu zn ba and pb and marine related metals sourced from marine estuarine environments na mg k and ca the testing methods and quality control and quality assurance procedures are discussed in the supplementary information 2 3 data analysis the data analyses consisted of three stages 1 evaluation of the variations in metal loads and physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments along the river from upstream to the estuarine environment 2 identification of the relationships between water and sediment characteristics and metal loads along the river and how these relationships are influenced by changes to these characteristics and 3 development of a conceptual model describing the role of interactions between water and sediment phases in the transport of metals along the river 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation in metal loads from upstream to estuarine environment in the context of environmental pollution the origin of pollutants and their transport pathways are important for effective pollution mitigation understanding of these factors helps to determine whether to adopt a source control or transport control approach for the design of effective pollution mitigation strategies accordingly in this section the identification of the patterns of variations in crustal anthropogenic and marine related metal loads and how these three types of metals behave along the river were analysed fig 2 shows total metal loads in water from upstream to the estuarine environment crustal metals al ti mn and fe show a decreasing pattern particularly from sampling location 3 s3 in fig 1 and marine related metals na mg k and ca show an increasing pattern particularly from sampling location 5 s5 in fig 1 and both patterns are generally consistent for all metals in each group however anthropogenic metals ni cu zn ba and pb do not exhibit a consistent pattern fig 3 shows the total metal loads in sediments at each sampling location compared to the patterns in water metals in sediments exhibit more distinct patterns at different longitudinal sections along the river crustal metal load generally increases from s1 to s5 then decreases towards s8 and again increases in the proximity of the estuarine environment s9 s11 unlike in water fig 2 anthropogenic metals in sediments show a consistent increase from s1 to s4 decrease towards s7 and again show an increase near the estuarine environment further marine related metal load generally increases from upstream to downstream except for ca accordingly it is evident that even the same group of metals exhibit rather inconsistent patterns between water and sediment phases this on one hand underlines the complexity of the behaviour of metals not only between groups that are based on the origin of metals but also between individual metals within the same group on the other hand there is a need for an in depth analysis of the influence of the physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments on the variations of metal loads identified 3 2 interactions between water and sediment phases in metal transport as water and sediment phases are in contact the interactions of ionic and molecular forms of pollutants in each phase would occur primarily through adsorption and desorption processes these processes are underpinned by three mechanisms chemisorption ion exchange and precipitation chemisorption occurs when the pollutants in the solution water forms strong covalent bonds with chemically reactive surface functional groups on the surface of solid particles sediments bradl 2004 ion exchange results in the replacement of charged ions on solid particles in the solution through relatively weak electrostatic bonds mcbride 1994 in essence the above two mechanisms are largely influenced by the physico chemical characteristics of the solid particles e g particle size specific surface area mineralogy and surface coatings while pollutants in the solution can precipitate on the surface of solid particles depending on the ph and concentration of pollutants gunawardana 2011 3 2 1 implications of the change in particle size from upstream to downstream while particle size plays the key role in metal adsorption to particulate solids other influential physico chemical characteristics e g particle surface area and surface coatings are closely related to particle size gunawardana et al 2012 2014 as it is an important parameter particle size was separately investigated before other parameters those discussed in section 3 2 2 fig 4 shows both volume based and surface area based psd of sediments collected at the sampling locations along the river the psds are consistent with the fact that fine particles have relatively larger surface area increasing the potential for adsorbing pollutants due to the presence of more surface functional groups wijesiri et al 2016 however the most important observation from fig 4 is that particle size decreases in turn the particle surface area increases from upstream towards the estuarine environment compare psds for s1 s5 psds for s6 s8 and psds for s9 s11 this is due to the transport of fine sediment particles along the river as these are more likely to be suspended in water and subject to currents and turbulence than larger particles moreover as the river approaches the estuarine environment its bed slope tends to reduce and accordingly the flow velocity tends to reduce and larger particles will gradually settle on the bed however when there is a flood high flow high velocity the bed will be flushed out due to the above phenomenon the metal load associated with sediments in the proximity of the estuarine environment could be higher than that in upstream locations as the finer particles have a relatively greater capacity to adsorb cations in fact this occurrence is valid for crustal metals and marine related metals except for ca in sediments fig 3 which show an increasing trend from s1 to s11 for crustal metals this is further supported by the decreasing metal load in water fig 2 which is attributed to the adsorption of metals by fine particles in sediments that are abundantly available in the estuarine environment although marine related metals load in water increases fig 2 it could be potentially due to sea water intrusion na mg2 k and ca2 in the form of salts from tidal effects moreover anthropogenic metals in sediments and water do not support the increase in metal loads in sediments with the increase in fine particles accordingly it is likely that fine sediment particles would preferentially adsorb crustal and marine related metals rather than anthropogenic metals these inconsistencies could be attributed to the contribution of anthropogenic activities along the river and tributaries which is not related to the physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments as well as metal transport via water and sediments as evident from fig 1 the estuarine area surrounded by the natural environment do not support many anthropogenic activities compared to the upstream areas 3 2 2 implications of the change in mineralogy organic carbon and ph from upstream to downstream mineralogy is important as it determines the types of surface functional groups protruding from the surface of sediment particles this influences what species of metals are likely to be adsorbed jayarathne et al 2018 sutherland et al 2012 on the other hand organic carbon content in sediments indicates the presence of organic coatings around particles which also provide specific surface functional groups organic carbon in water would play a key role in metal adsorption as it influences organic complexation of metals murakami et al 2008 further ph of water influences the surface electrochemical properties of sediment particles i e positive and negative charge distribution and in turn the adsorption and desorption of metals from sediments wijesiri et al 2016 given that mineralogy organic carbon content and ph are factors that influence the interactions between metals and surface functional groups on sediment particles it was necessary to undertake a quantitative analysis of the data in order to better understand metal transfer between water and sediment phases therefore a bayesian network bn model was developed and its graphical structure is shown in fig 5 the markov property of bns accounts for the conditional dependencies among a given set of random variables such that a particular variable is dependent only on its immediate parent variables korb and nicholson 2010 this enables effectively dealing with small data sets by avoiding the curse of dimensionality wijesiri et al 2018 these dependencies are firstly identified using expert opinion state of the art knowledge of the process system being modelled the identified relationships are then visualised as a graphical structure which is then fitted with the observed measured data this will result in estimations of model parameters which indicate the strength of the relationships between variables in terms of conditional probabilities for discrete variables and conditional regression coefficients for continuous variables chen and pollino 2012 provide guidelines for good practice in bns modelling while aguilera et al 2011 and uusitalo 2007 provide in depth discussions on the applications of bns in environmental modelling the bn shown in fig 5 describes how mineralogy of sediments organic carbon in water and sediments and ph of water can influence the interactions between metals in water and sediment phases it is important to note that 1 this bn is expected to describe only the metal transfer between the two phases under the influence of factors that stimulate or restrain adsorption and desorption by sediment particles 2 for a given metal this bn model does not account for the potential influence on a particular metal from other metals present in the water sediment matrix e g cations competing for functional groups on sediment particles therefore the outcomes of the bn model are conditional on the model structure shown in fig 5 the proposed model was fitted with observed data metals in water mg l metals in sediments μg g organic carbon in water mg l organic carbon in sediments g kg sediment mineralogy ph in water using bnlearn package in the r statistical computing platform scutari 2009 data on the mineralogical composition of sediments organic carbon content in sediments and water and ph in water are given in table s1 in the supplementary information the model parameters were estimated for two metal transfer paths see table 1 from water to sediments and see table 2 from sediments to water the more likely path of metal transfer is identified by comparing the relative magnitude of model parameters corresponding to each path see influence column in tables 1 and 2 it was evident from the root mean squared error rmse calculated tables 1 and 2 observed vs predicted plots and residual plots figs s2 s5 in supplementary information that the model relating to metal transfer from water to sediments i e model 1 performs satisfactorily for all metals however the other model i e model 2 performs well only for a limited number of metals i e mn cu and marine related metals this implies that desorption of most crustal and anthropogenic metals from sediments to water model 2 can be influenced by other factors other than ph mineralogy and organic carbon content and also the potential competition between cations which was not accounted for in this study as the new knowledge on these influential factors becomes available the structure of the bn model can be improved by adding new predictor variables resulting in better model performance accordingly the following discussion is based on the metals where the model performs well as evident from tables 1 and 2 metals show both positive and negative inverse relationships between the total metal loads in water and sediment phases the positive relationships mean that when the metal load in one phase increases the metal load in the other phase would also increase on the other hand the inverse relationships mean that when metal load in one phase increases the metal load in the other phase is expected to decrease in fact when considering metal transfer from one phase to another obviously those metals with inverse relationships are more likely to undergo adsorption desorption however the metals with positive relationships could also be transferred between water and sediment phases while they are more likely to be transported via water or sediments these complex behaviours are discussed in detail with examples below as such more mn a crustal metal is transferred from sediments to water 63 082 influence table 2 than from water to sediments 3 913 influence table 1 thus the more dominant transfer path of mn is sediments to water which is also supported by the inverse relationships between mn in sediments and water conditional regression coefficient 0 631 table 2 the inverse relationship further implies that at a given location the mn load desorbed transferred from sediments to water is greater than mn load transported via sediments from upstream similarly for k a marine related metal the transfer from sediments to water 6 816 influence table 2 is dominant over the transfer from water to sediments 0 512 influence table 1 however unlike mn k loads in sediments and water are positively related when they are transferred between phases conditional regression coefficient 3 942 table 2 the implication of this observation is that at a given location k in sediments is desorbed to water however the k load desorbed is less than the k load transported via sediments from upstream contrary to mn and k behaviour cu an anthropogenic metal exhibits a different behaviour more cu in water is adsorbed by sediments 1 999 influence table 1 than what is already attached to sediments being desorbed into water 0 439 influence table 2 this is further supported by the inverse relationship between cu loads in water and sediment phases conditional regression coefficient 0 226 table 1 this means that cu load transferred from water to sediments is larger than cu load transported via water from upstream in conclusion sediment phase plays the key role in k and cu transport and more mn is likely to be transported via water to the estuarine environment similarly the dominant transfer path i e sediments to water water to sediments and dominant transport phase i e sediments or water for other metals can be determined using the bn outcomes given in tables 1 and 2 and are summarised in table 3 below 3 3 conceptualisation of pollutant interactions between water and sediment phases as discussed in the introduction current modelling approaches to pollutant transport in river systems rely on the movement of water and sediment and does not account for the changes to pollutant load resulting from the interactions between the two phases such changes are typically not influenced by the water and sediment movements but rather would be determined by the physico chemical characteristics of these media as discussed in section 3 2 accordingly this section conceptualises the impact of changes to pollutant loads between water and sediment phases on the overall pollutant transport along the river towards the estuarine environment the conceptual model which was developed based on mass balance principles is shown in fig 6 accordingly the river is divided into longitudinal sections based on major locations where the pollutants are discharged via anthropogenic and natural processes thus at a given section si and at a given time ti the load of a particular pollutant in water m w i would be a function of the pollutant load discharged ii load transported in via water from the preceding section m wt i 1 load transferred from sediment at the current section due to adsorption desorption processes m str i and load transported out via water towards the next section m wt i 1 similarly the load of the same pollutant in sediments m s i would be a function of the load transported in via sediment from the preceding section m st i 1 load transferred from water at the current section due to adsorption desorption processes m wtr i and load transported out via sediment towards the next section m st i 1 accordingly equations 1 3 define the load of pollutant in water sediment and total pollutant load at a given section based on these equations hypothetical scenarios of pollutant transport along the river can be developed facilitating the understanding of pollutant behaviour 3 3 1 general mass balance pollutant load in water at section si 1 m w i i i m w t i 1 m w t i 1 m s t r i m w t r i pollutant load in sediments at section si 2 m s i m s t i 1 m s t i 1 m w t r i m s t r i total pollutant load at section si 3 m w i m s i m i i i m w t i 1 m s t i 1 m w t i 1 m s t i 1 3 4 evaluation of hypothetical scenarios of pollutant transport as outlined below the hypothetical scenario 1 reduces equations 1 and 2 to equations 4 and 5 which leads to case 1 and case 2 3 4 1 hypothetical scenario 1 input pollutant load i and net pollutant load transferred between water and sediment phases mstr mwtr do not vary at different sections this implies that physico chemical properties of water and sediments which influence pollutant transfer between the two phases remain unchanged along the river thus equations 1 and 2 can be written as 4 m w i m w t i 1 m w t i 1 c 1 5 m s i m s t i 1 m s t i 1 c 2 where c1 and c2 are constants case 1 inward transport is greater than outward transport of pollutants i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 case 2 inward transport is less than outward transport of pollutants i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 according to case 1 the load of pollutants transported decreases along the river thus compared to pollutant loads found in the upstream largely reduced pollutant loads can be released into the estuarine environment in fact crustal metals in water fig 2 and ca in sediments fig 3 show similar patterns in order for this to be a real world case there should be factor s that would constrain the movement of ionic and molecular forms of pollutants together with water or sediment mass however hypothetical scenario 1 is inadequate to investigate the causation for such decrease in metal discharge into the estuarine environment this is because of the assumption that pollutant input and transfer between water and sediment phases do not vary at different sections on the other hand case 2 describes pollutant behaviour such that the pollutant load can increase from upstream to downstream this is more likely than case 1 because pollutants would move as the water and sediment masses move along the river in fact case 2 is similar to most modelling approaches undertaken in past studies which have not accounted for pollutant transfer between water and sediment phases this will be explored in hypothetical scenario 2 outlined below 3 4 2 hypothetical scenario 2 input pollutant load i does not vary at different sections but net pollutant load transferred between water and sediment phases mstr mwtr varies this implies that the physico chemical properties of water and sediments which influence pollutant transfer between the two phases are subject to change at different locations along the river thus equations 1 and 2 remains the same therefore case 1 and case 2 in scenario 1 can be elaborated by incorporating the possibilities of metal transfer between water and sediment phases case 1 1 inward transport is greater than outward transport of pollutants given that metal load transferred from water is greater than the metal load transferred from sediments i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 m wtr i m str i case 1 2 inward transport is greater than outward transport of pollutants given that metal load transferred from water is less than the metal load transferred from sediments i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 m wtr i m str i in case 1 1 and case 1 2 pollutant load transported is expected to decrease from upstream to downstream however case 1 1 will be likely only for pollutant transport via water as these pollutants are continuously adsorbed by sediments e g cu see discussion in section 3 2 2 case 1 2 will be likely only for pollutant transport via sediments as these pollutants attached to sediment particles are continuously desorbed into water e g mn and k see discussion in section 3 2 2 case 2 1 inward transport is less than outward transport of pollutants given that metal load transferred from water is greater than the metal load transferred from sediments i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 m wtr i m str i case 2 2 inward transport is less than outward transport of pollutants given that metal load transferred from water is less than the metal load transferred from sediments i e m wt i 1 m wt i 1 and m st i 1 m st i 1 m wtr i m str i in case 2 1 and case 2 2 both water and sediment masses are expected to transport an amount of pollutants that increases towards the estuarine environment similar to cases 1 1 and 1 2 these two cases will also be likely either in water or sediment phase such that case 2 1 for sediments e g mn and k and case 2 2 for water e g cu more importantly it is possible to replicate real world systems of pollutant transport by combining the cases discussed in the hypothetical scenarios above for example case 1 1 and case 2 1 and case 1 2 and case 2 2 can be combined as each set has the same system of pollutant transfer between water and sediment phases accordingly in the system formed by case 1 1 and case 2 1 sediment mass would play a key role in transporting pollutants towards the estuarine environment as pollutant loads transported have a decreasing trend in water and an increasing trend in sediments similarly water mass contributes most to the pollutant transport in the system formed by case 1 2 and case 2 2 4 conclusions this research study investigated the key role of metal transfer between water and sediment phases in an urban river in relation to metal transport from upstream to the estuarine environment and conceptualised the incorporation of metal transfer processes for metal transport modelling the research outcomes indicated that metals from different origins crustal anthropogenic and marine related generally exhibit consistent patterns in water and sediment phases along the river it was noted that different metals exhibit different behaviour during the transfer between water and sediment phases and the physico chemical characteristics of water and sediments influence the adsorption and desorption processes that underpin metal transfer between the two phases the results also show that each metal has a dominant transfer path sediments to water water to sediments and this dominant path determines the phase that transports the largest amount of metals to the estuarine environment the conceptualisation of the behaviour of metals in water and sediment phases led to the creation of several hypothetical scenarios which helps in understanding the complex real world scenarios observed from the field data accordingly it was revealed that the dominant transfer path sediments to water water to sediments and dominant transport phase sediment water are different for different metals irrespective of their origin these conceptualisations will contribute to enhancing the modelling of pollutant transport in urban waterways and
