14210,an advanced photoreduction apr system of uv h2o2 hcooh has been explored to remove nitrate no3 in water by reduction of co2 radical which was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis the removal of no3 and product selectivity were systematically investigated under varied conditions including initial no3 concentrations molar ratios of h2o2 to hcooh and initial ph values the removal rate of no3 increased with higher initial concentrations of no3 while decreased with greater molar ratios of h2o2 hcooh and higher initial ph almost 100 of no3 was reduced in the presence of 53 0 mm h2o2 and 106 1 mm hcooh in 120 min the main products of reduction were nitrogen n2 ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and hydrazine n2h4 among various factors examined the molar ratio was critical to enhance the selectivity to form n2 as the major final product at the molar ratio of h2o2 to hcooh as 1 1 80 of gaseous n product selectivity was achieved with 50 removal rate of no3 in addition toxic byproduct of no2 was low less than 2 7 of total n during reactions when the initial ph increased from 2 to 7 the removal rate of no3 declined from 100 to 70 while gaseous n product selectivity increased to 40 after 120 min overall the apr process has provided an attractive approach to remove no3 in natural waters keywords carbon dioxide anion radical uv irradiation no3 reduction hydrogen peroxide formic acid 1 introduction no3 is a persistent and widespread contaminant in underground waters and has become a serious environment issue 1 2 a high level of no3 may pose a threat to human health because it can be converted to carcinogenic no2 and other n species in human body leading to methemoglobin or blue baby syndrome for infants 3 5 even stomach cancer and other diseases as a result the world health organization has recommended that the maximum no3 concentration should be limited to 10 ppm 6 7 in addition high n causes waterbody eutrophication and deteriorates natural aquatic and ecological systems currently several technologies are available to remove no3 from water mainly including ion exchange 8 9 electrochemical method 10 biological denitrification 11 12 and chemical reduction 13 14 however these technologies still have some disadvantages for example ion exchange not only requires frequent regeneration of resins but also produces waste brine 8 9 electrochemical method requires high electric energy 10 biological denitrification method has a lower efficiency than other technologies and produces excessive waste sludge which can cause secondary environmental pollution 11 12 chemical reduction has advantages of high reduction rate and low cost for removal of no3 in groundwater such as using nano zero valent iron nzvi as a representative reductant nevertheless some constraints still limit extensive applications of nzvi such as low selectivity low reaction rate and easy agglomeration 14 a recently discovered reductive radical anion co2 e co2 co2 1 9 v has been proved efficient to reduce no3 into nh4 e no3 nh4 1 203 v e no2 nh4 0 897 v 15 16 or n2 e no2 n2 1 45 v 17 however how to optimize the production of radical and to improve product selectivity of n2 i e producing n2 as the main final product still remain as key problems to be solved in no3 reduction process in general there are two ways to produce co2 radical i e indirect and direct method the indirect method means that photo holes h react with scavenger formic acid hcoo and or hcooh or oxalate to generate reductive co2 radical 18 19 the direct method is using oxidative species such as sulfate radical so4 e0 2 6 v or hydroxyl radical oh e0 2 7 v 20 21 which can be converted to a reductive system in the presence of hcooh and or hcoo by producing reductive co2 radical for instance uv s2o8 2 hcooh 20 heat s2o8 2 hcooh 22 percarbonate fe ii hcooh 23 h2o2 fe ii hcooh 23 24 and uv h2o2 hcooh 25 systems compared to the indirect method the direct one could be a better option because of a higher production rate of radicals at a lower cost schutz and meyerstein 25 reported that maleate and fumarate were reduced by co2 radical generated by uv activating h2o2 in the presence of hcooh perissinotti et al 26 showed that co2 radical was generated by a uv h2o2 hcooh system and used to reduce no3 eqs 1 3 1 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 2 o h h c o o c o 2 h 2 o 3 o h h c o

rate of no3 and to improve the product selectivity of n2 as the main final product in this study an advanced photoreduction apr system uv h2o2 hcooh to produce co2 for reductive removal of no3 was explored comprehensively the no3 reduction performance and the product selectivity were systematically investigated with varied reaction conditions including initial no3 concentrations molar ratios of h2o2 to hcooh and initial ph values the presence of co2 radical in the apr system was examined by the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiment the main objectives of this study were to 1 enhance no3 removal rate in the uv h2o2 hcooh system 2 improve reduction product selectivity as n2 under varied effect parameters and 3 propose no3 reduction mechanisms and pathways with co2 and oh radicals involved 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials potassium nitrate kno3 and formic acid hcooh were purchased from sigma aldrich usa 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was obtained from macklin biochemical co ltd china hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh ammonium sulfamate nh4so3nh2 hydrazine dihydrochloride n2h4 2hcl p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde c9h11no and sodium sulfite na2so3 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all the chemicals were utilized directly without further purification 2 2 photochemical experiments batch steady irradiation experiments were conducted in the photochemical reactor fig s1 equipped with a 500 w high pressure mercury uv lamp ggz500 from osram with dominant emitting wavelength of 365 nm the uv light intensity was 25 3 mw cm2 the calculated incident photon flux was 772 55 μmol m2 s 1 27 determined by a light meter cel np 2000 from ceaulioht appropriate amounts of hcooh and h2o2 were homogeneously mixed in 100 ml no3 solution of varied concentrations during the irradiation the temperature of photo reactor was maintained at a constant value 25 by running a cooling water system n2 was bubbled to the solutions to remove volatile gaseous n species mainly for accuracy of sample analyses and dissolved oxygen do likely consumes the generated co2 and to provide thorough mixing of the solutions as well in practical applications bubbling n2 can be an option since it is unlikely to change the major effectiveness or cost of the system given less redox potential of do than no3 the effects of molar ratio of h2o2 to hcooh nh2o2 nhcooh 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 and 1 1 initial ph value ph 2 3 5 and 7 and initial concentration of no3 no3 0 20 35 60 100 and 400 mg n l on the removal rate of no3 and product selectivity were systematically investigated the ph value of the solutions was adjusted by 1 m hcl or naoh in addition each experiment was performed in triplicate for quality assurance 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 nh3 in samples were determined by ion chromatography ic metrohm mic switzerland after appropriate dilutions the n2h4 concentration was quantified by p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde spectrophotometric method 28 residual h2o2 in the samples was quenched by adding 0 1 m na2so3 immediately except for analyzing nh4 nh3 by ic to avoid interference by the quenching agent because our control tests and literature 29 30 suggest oxidation of nh4 by h2o2 was insignificant the product selectivity to no2 nh4 nh3 n2h4 and gaseous n species mainly n2 with small amounts of n2o3 and n2o4 31 32 were calculated according to eqs 4 7 4 s n o 2 n o 2 t n o 3 5 s n h 4 n h 4 t n o 3 6 s n 2 h 4 n 2 h 4 t n o 3 7 s g a s e o u s n s n 2 100 s n o 2 s n h 4 s n 2 h 4 where no3 no2 t nh4 t and n2h4 t represents removed no3 concentration the concentration of no2 nh4 and n2h4 in solution at reaction time t respectively the product selectivity to gaseous n species mainly n2 when ph was much lower than pka 9 246 of nh4 33 was calculated based on mass balance by subtracting the residual concentrations of no2 and nh4 from the removed concentration of no3 for water purification point of view once n species are in gaseous form they are readily volatized from water as a control test n2h4 was detected as 0 0117 0 001 mg n l i e 0 03 of total n the experimental condition was initial ph 2 3 no3 0 35 mg n l hcooh 0 21 2 mm h2o2 0 23 32 mm illumination t 120 min n2h4 is a thermodynamically unstable compound consistent with prior publications 34 35 as a result it is reasonable to count no2 nh4 and n2 as the main products in reductive removal of no3 epr experiments bruker emx 8 for detection of radicals were performed by adding 53 0 mm h2o2 106 1 mm hcooh 35 mg n l no3 and 100 mm dmpo prior to photo reactions 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo induced no3 reduction in the presence of h2o2 and hcooh fig 1 a and b show no3 reduction and product selectivity of no3 solution alone and with the presence of hcooh and h2o2 hcooh results indicate that only 33 no3 was reduced to no2 because of photoreduction of no3 36 the overall no3 photolysis process could be described by the following reactions 36 37 8 n o 3 h v n o 3 9 n o 3 n o 2 o 10 o h 2 o o h o h 11 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h it is worth noting that no3 induces oh upon exposure to uv irradiation as shown in eqs 8 11 more specifically o reacts with h2o and forms oh eq 10 in addition photolysis of no2 also produces oh radicals and the reaction pathways are similar to no3 i e no2 produces no2 under uv irradiation no2 an unstable excited intermediate then decomposes into no and o eqs 12 and 13 12 n o 2 h v n o 2 13 n o 2 n o o 14 n o o h h n o 2 apparently photolysis of no3 or no2 alone does not produce co2 radical without the presence of reductive organic compounds such as hcooh one of the simplest organics the wavelength of the peak absorbance of both hcoo and hcooh was 196 nm fig s2 since the dominant wavelength was 365 nm in this uv h2o2 hcooh system which suggests the photolysis of hcooh and cooh could be neglected with the presence of 106 1 mm hcooh 77 of no3 was reduced in 120 min about 2 3 times as high as the system of no3 alone nh4 was the main final product the presence of hcooh enhanced no3 reduction under uv irradiation the final product of nh4 instead of n2 suggests over reduction of no3 presumably by co2 see section 3 2 detection of co2 note that co2 can be produced via the reactions of formic acid reducing oh which is generated by photolysis of no3 in water eqs 8 10 in contrast 100 removal of no3 was observed in the uv h2o2 hcooh system meanwhile with the addition of h2o2 5 gaseous n species product selectivity was obtained despite 95 selectivity of nh4 the presence of 53 0 mm h2o2 provides an additional significant source to generate oh under uv irradiation see eq 1 as a result the greatest amounts of oh were produced in the presence of h2o2 among all of the three conditions shown in fig 1 the steady state concentration of oh is typically in the range of 10 12 10 14 m in advanced oxidation processes aops 38 39 the second order reaction rate constant of hcooh h2o2 no2 and nh3 with oh is 2 108 40 2 7 107 41 1 0 1010 42 and 1 0 0 1 108 m 1s 1 33 respectively considering the initial concentration of hcooh h2o2 and no3 was 106 1 53 0 and 2 5 mm respectively oh reacting with hcooh was about 15 times as fast as with h2o2 as a result around 90 of oh were readily captured by hcooh or hcoo to produce co2 on the other hand the presence of 53 mm h2o2 about half of the initial concentration of hcooh an oxidant and scaverger of oh prevents the system from being too reductive consequently 5 gaseous n species selectivity mainly n2 was observed given the reductive removal of no3 has several kinetic steps with different products and intermediates more discussions of improving the product selectivity of gaseous n species are presented in section 3 4 3 2 detection of co2 in the photo induced uv h2o2 hcooh system radical species induced by uv irradiation were examined as shown in fig 2 the main reactive intermediates such as oh and co2 radicals were detected by epr spin trapping technique to confirm the proposed reaction kinetics the epr spectrum fig 2a illustrates that nearly no signal appeared in the systems of uv hcooh dmpo and uv dmpo however dmpo oh adduct an 14 9 g aβ h 14 9 g and g 2 0059 was obtained in the uv h2o2 dmpo system the dmpo oh signal arises from the reactions of uv h2o2 rather than decomposition of dmpo ooh radical adduct this is in agreement with wolfrum et al 43 who reported dmpo ooh radical adduct was not observed in the uv h2o2 system in the uv hcooh h2o2 dmpo system a new signal an 15 7 g aβ h 18 7 g and g 2 0059 appeared which was assigned to dmpo co2 adduct the observed hyperfine coupling constants hfcc here for dmpo co2 and dmpo oh are almost identical with literature 26 44 which provide direct evidences of the formed coexisting co2 radical and oh radicals fig 2b moreover the presence of oh also supports the mechanisms of generating co2 radical illustrated in eqs 1 3 more specifically oh radical is generated by photolysis of h2o2 under uv illumination subsequently oh radical reacts with hcooh hcoo and produces reductive co2 radical 3 3 evolution processes of n species the evolution processes of n species under uv irradiation are shown in fig 3 the results showed that 35 mg n l no3 was mostly reduced to nh4 in 120 min the ph value started at 2 3 and fluctuated during reactions with an average of 2 46 fig s3 nevertheless low no2 concentrations less than 0 93 mg n l or 2 7 of total n maintained during the whole reaction process suggesting little accumulation since no2 is more toxic than no3 low accumulation of no2 in the system indicates a great advantage of the apr technology it is likely that once formed no2 was rapidly reduced to nh4 or n2 45 46 or oxidized to no3 given the second order reaction rate constant of no2 with oh is as high as 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 42 in addition h2o2 could oxidize no2 47 while oxidizing nh4 is very slow 29 30 with the progress of the reaction the products of gaseous n species had an increasing trend to a peak value of 12 70 mg n l at 91 08 j m2 uv dose then decreased to the end of the reaction since the uv h2o2 hcooh system was open gaseous n species mainly n2 were released instantaneously rather than accumulation this is different from nh4 which could accumulate with time as the most reductive product among n species it was found that no3 residue and nh4 concentrations were 1 67 and 30 65 mg n l at the end of 182 16 j m2 uv dose respectively based on the results the possible reaction pathways are ⅰ no3 is reduced to no2 by reductive co2 radical ⅱ once formed no2 is rapidly reduced to n2 n2h4 or nh4 these reactions are presented in eqs 15 18 15 n o 3 2 h 2 c o 2 n o 2 2 c o 2 h 2 o 16 2 n o 2 8 h 6 c o 2 n 2 4 h 2 o 6 c o 2 17 2no 2 12h co 2 n 2 h 4 4h 2 o co 2 18 n o 2 8 h 6 c o 2 n h 4 2 h 2 o 6 c o 2 furthermore the degradation kinetics of no3 followed pseudo first order kinetic ln c c0 kt with r 2 0 95 during the 120 min as shown in the insert of fig 3 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant k was 0 023 min 1 3 4 factors affecting the photo reduction of no3 and product selectivity to gas n species 3 4 1 effect of the initial concentration of no3 fig 4 a and 4b show the effects of no3 initial concentration on no3 removal rate product selectivity and final total soluble n species i e tn with an increment of the initial concentration of no3 from 20 to 400 mg n l the removal rate of no3 decreased from 100 to 40 after 120 min however the absolute amount of removed no3 increased from 20 to 152 mg n l with an increase of no3 concentration greater no3 anions could capture and react with reductive co2 and thus the removed amounts of no3 increased as a result a high initial no3 concentration enhanced the utilization rate of co2 radical on the other hand when the initial concentration of no3 went up from 20 to 400 mg l selectivity to gaseous n species mainly as n2 had a rising trend from 3 470 mg n l to 7 829 mg n l as an oxidant a higher level of initial no3 increases the redox potential of the system masten et al 38 and shankar et al 48 suggested more oh radicals are generated because of photolysis of no3 and no2 eqs 8 10 and 12 and 13 thus a less reductive environment was created than the situation of a lower initial no3 concentration which is likely to prevent over reduction of no3 to nh4 on the whole a relatively high no3 concentration is beneficial to enhance the absolute removal amount of no3 and to improve the product selectivity to n2 although the percentage of no3 removal declined in 120 min 3 4 2 effect of the molar ratio of h2o2 to hcooh the addition of h2o2 is very important for no3 reduction from both aspects of co2 generation related to no3 removal efficiency and the redox potential of the system related to the product selectivity of no3 reduction the results of the molar ratio of h2o2 hcooh on no3 removal and product selectivity are shown in fig 5 a and b in fig 5a the removal rate of no3 kept rising to almost 100 with h2o2 hcooh molar ratio increased from 0 1 to 0 5 it can be explained that more h2o2 generate more oh under uv irradiation 21 49 before the scavenging effect of oh becomes apparent eq 19 24 50 52 the presence of excess hcooh much more than oh which is in the range of 10 12 10 14 m typically in aops 38 39 converts oxidative oh to reductive species by yielding more co2 53 however as the molar ratio increased to 1 1 the no3 removal rate declined to 50 excess h2o2 oxidizes hcooh 54 which makes less hcooh available to capture oh and thus produce fewer co2 radicals eqs 20 and 21 therefore a declined removal rate of no3 was observed the generated oh via photolysis of h2o2 which are not captured by hcooh and co2 can oxidize nh4 into n2h4 and then n2 34 in addition no2 can be oxidized by oh radical and converted to no3 resulting in a decreased removal rate of no3 55 56 eqs 22 and 23 19 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o 20 h c o o h h 2 o 2 h c o o o h h 2 o 21 h c o o o h c o 2 h 2 o 22 n o 2 o h n o 2 o h 23 n o 2 o h n o 3 h when the molar ratio of h2o2 to hcooh remained constant generally no3 removal rate rose slightly as the hcooh or h2o2 concentration increased as shown in fig 5a the results suggest that more co2 radicals were produced leading to more reduction of no3 this result is consistent with a decreased product selectivity at a greater hcooh initial concentration but with the same h2o2 hcooh ratio as shown in fig 6 b in other words a higher no3 removal rate and a lower product selectivity of gaseous n happened in a more reductive environment i e a greater amount of co2 produced as shown in fig 6b the main product was nh4 when h2o2 hcooh molar ratio was less than or equal to 0 7 however smaller amounts of nh4 and greater amounts of gaseous n products were found when the molar ratio was above 0 7 although poor percentage removal of no3 was obtained more specifically the products of 80 gaseous n and 20 nh4 were achieved at h2o2 hcooh molar ratio of 1 1 although the removal rate of no3 was down to 45 in eqs 15 18 theoretically 1 mol of no3 reacts with 8 and 5 mol of co2 radical to produce nh4 and n2 respectively the experimental results can be elucidated that no3 was over reduced to nh4 in a relatively high co2 radical concentration eq 18 thus conversion of no3 to nh4 may be limited when co2 radical was of a relatively low level and production of gaseous n species mainly n2 became dominant for the apr system eq 16 it means the selectivity of reduction products to gaseous n2 could be boosted by managing a lower co2 level or less reductive environment in the uv h2o2 hcooh system however on the other hand poor removal performance of no3 is inevitable when co2 concentration is low in conclusion a higher molar ratio 0 7 of h2o2 to hcooh benefits greater product selectivity to gaseous n because it is likely to avoid over reduction of no3 to nh4 3 4 3 effect of the initial ph value ph plays an important role in the apr system and affects the redox potential of no3 17 stability of h2o2 57 deprotonation of nh4 pka 9 246 33 and hcooh pka 3 745 58 and thus the generation of co2 fig 6a displays the effect of initial ph on reduction rate and ph changes over the reaction time when initial ph was 2 3 the reduction rate of no3 achieved near 100 while the final ph value went up to 2 5 and 3 7 respectively however when initial ph was 5 and 7 no3 removal rate presented a descending trend and the final ph increased to 9 5 after 120 min consumption of h in reduction of no3 eqs 15 18 37 can explain the experimental results of increased ph at the end and decreased no3 removal rate at higher initial ph levels these results suggest that acidic condition was in favor of no3 reduction the likely reason is that h directly participates in reducing no3 as shown in eqs 15 18 with the extent of reduction of no3 to no2 n2 and finally nh4 more and more h are demanded to make the reactions happen although it is possible that h consumes co2 because it has a greater redox potential than co2 eq 24 the results suggest that this effect is less important for the overall no3 reduction processes 24 h c o 2 1 2 h 2 c o 2 the product selectivity for reduction of no3 is presented in fig 6b with an increase of initial ph selectivity to nh4 was suppressed and to n2 appeared increasing as mentioned before with the progress of continued reduction of n species more and more h are demanded to promote the reactions as shown in eqs 15 18 6 mol of h are needed to reduce 1 mol of no3 to n2 in contrast 10 mol of h are required to form nh4 as the final reduction product apparently when h becomes less and less available with increasing ph to 7 the condition favors the reduction pathways of less h consumption i e forming n2 rather than nh4 in fact a high ph level near or greater than pka 9 246 of nh4 33 makes the product selectivity to form n2 less important because nh3 can escape from water via volatilization assuming nh3 can be recovered as a resource or at least does not cause significant secondary pollution in this case deep reduction of no3 by a great amount of co2 is preferred to improve its removal rate ph affects bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations in the solution pka1 6 35 pka2 10 33 for h2co3 59 which could scavenge oh radical eq 25 k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 and eq 26 k 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 37 given the tested ph range was much below 10 33 hco3 was the dominant species in the system however its second order reaction rate constant with oh is about 4 of hcooh as a result the scavenging effect of hco3 seems unimportant unless ph is much greater than neutral level in which co3 2 becomes significant with a higher secondary order reaction rate constant with oh than hcooh in this case oh would be scavenged by co3 2 likely instead of reacting with cooh to produce co2 or participating the oxidation of n species directly 25 o h h c o 3 h 2 o c o 3 26 o h c o 3 2 o h c o 3 at ph 7 or neutral level the removal rate of no3 was 70 and the product selectivity of gaseous n species was 40 therefore the results reveal that the uv h2o2 hcooh system is viable to remove no3 in most natural waters the comprehensive reaction pathways are proposed in fig 7 which summarizes the mechanisms of the reactions discussed earlier in this paper other than the reductions initiated by co2 it is possible that small amount of free oh not captured by hcooh hcoo can oxidize nh4 nh3 to form nh2 eq 27 then nh2 combines to form n2h4 eq 28 60 an unstable intermediate product 61 nh2 and n2h4 pka 7 9 62 can be further oxidized by oh to form n2 or no2 or no3 subsequently 35 27 o h n h 3 n h 2 h 2 o 28 n h 2 n h 2 n 2 h 4 4 conclusion this study systematically investigated reductive removal of no3 and final product selectivity by co2 species produced in a uv h2o2 hcooh system both co2 and oh radicals were detected by epr analysis nearly 100 no3 removal rate was achieved at h2o2 hcooh molar ratio of 0 5 ph 2 3 after 120 min the highest product selectivity of 80 to form gaseous n mainly n2 was achieved with 1 1 m ratio of h2o2 hcooh while 50 removal rate of no3 was obtained the results suggest that high co2 yield was in favor of enhancing no3 removal rate while low co2 yield could promote product selectivity to gaseous n instead of over reduction to nh4 overall the uv h2o2 hcooh process can provide a viable solution to remove no3 and maintain a high product selectivity to form gaseous n for water purification purpose declaration of competing interest the authors of the manuscript have assured there is no conflict interest involved

14210,an advanced photoreduction apr system of uv h2o2 hcooh has been explored to remove nitrate no3 in water by reduction of co2 radical which was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis the removal of no3 and product selectivity were systematically investigated under varied conditions including initial no3 concentrations molar ratios of h2o2 to hcooh and initial ph values the removal rate of no3 increased with higher initial concentrations of no3 while decreased with greater molar ratios of h2o2 hcooh and higher initial ph almost 100 of no3 was reduced in the presence of 53 0 mm h2o2 and 106 1 mm hcooh in 120 min the main products of reduction were nitrogen n2 ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and hydrazine n2h4 among various factors examined the molar ratio was critical to enhance the selectivity to form n2 as the major final product at the molar ratio of h2o2 to hcooh as 1 1 80 of gaseous n product selectivity was achieved with 50 removal rate of no3 in addition toxic byproduct of no2 was low less than 2 7 of total n during reactions when the initial ph increased from 2 to 7 the removal rate of no3 declined from 100 to 70 while gaseous n product selectivity increased to 40 after 120 min overall the apr process has provided an attractive approach to remove no3 in natural waters keywords carbon dioxide anion radical uv irradiation no3 reduction hydrogen peroxide formic acid 1 introduction no3 is a persistent and widespread contaminant in underground waters and has become a serious environment issue 1 2 a high level of no3 may pose a threat to human health because it can be converted to carcinogenic no2 and other n species in human body leading to methemoglobin or blue baby syndrome for infants 3 5 even stomach cancer and other diseases as a result the world health organization has recommended that the maximum no3 concentration should be limited to 10 ppm 6 7 in addition high n causes waterbody eutrophication and deteriorates natural aquatic and ecological systems currently several technologies are available to remove no3 from water mainly including ion exchange 8 9 electrochemical method 10 biological denitrification 11 12 and chemical reduction 13 14 however these technologies still have some disadvantages for example ion exchange not only requires frequent regeneration of resins but also produces waste brine 8 9 electrochemical method requires high electric energy 10 biological denitrification method has a lower efficiency than other technologies and produces excessive waste sludge which can cause secondary environmental pollution 11 12 chemical reduction has advantages of high reduction rate and low cost for removal of no3 in groundwater such as using nano zero valent iron nzvi as a representative reductant nevertheless some constraints still limit extensive applications of nzvi such as low selectivity low reaction rate and easy agglomeration 14 a recently discovered reductive radical anion co2 e co2 co2 1 9 v has been proved efficient to reduce no3 into nh4 e no3 nh4 1 203 v e no2 nh4 0 897 v 15 16 or n2 e no2 n2 1 45 v 17 however how to optimize the production of radical and to improve product selectivity of n2 i e producing n2 as the main final product still remain as key problems to be solved in no3 reduction process in general there are two ways to produce co2 radical i e indirect and direct method the indirect method means that photo holes h react with scavenger formic acid hcoo and or hcooh or oxalate to generate reductive co2 radical 18 19 the direct method is using oxidative species such as sulfate radical so4 e0 2 6 v or hydroxyl radical oh e0 2 7 v 20 21 which can be converted to a reductive system in the presence of hcooh and or hcoo by producing reductive co2 radical for instance uv s2o8 2 hcooh 20 heat s2o8 2 hcooh 22 percarbonate fe ii hcooh 23 h2o2 fe ii hcooh 23 24 and uv h2o2 hcooh 25 systems compared to the indirect method the direct one could be a better option because of a higher production rate of radicals at a lower cost schutz and meyerstein 25 reported that maleate and fumarate were reduced by co2 radical generated by uv activating h2o2 in the presence of hcooh perissinotti et al 26 showed that co2 radical was generated by a uv h2o2 hcooh system and used to reduce no3 eqs 1 3 1 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 2 o h h c o o c o 2 h 2 o 3 o h h c o o h c o 2 h 2 o h eqs 1 3 indicate the pathways of generating co2 however the uv h2o2 hcooh system used for no3 reduction has not been comprehensively studied yet especially how to enhance reduction rate of no3 and to improve the product selectivity of n2 as the main final product in this study an advanced photoreduction apr system uv h2o2 hcooh to produce co2 for reductive removal of no3 was explored comprehensively the no3 reduction performance and the product selectivity were systematically investigated with varied reaction conditions including initial no3 concentrations molar ratios of h2o2 to hcooh and initial ph values the presence of co2 radical in the apr system was examined by the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiment the main objectives of this study were to 1 enhance no3 removal rate in the uv h2o2 hcooh system 2 improve reduction product selectivity as n2 under varied effect parameters and 3 propose no3 reduction mechanisms and pathways with co2 and oh radicals involved 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials potassium nitrate kno3 and formic acid hcooh were purchased from sigma aldrich usa 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was obtained from macklin biochemical co ltd china hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh ammonium sulfamate nh4so3nh2 hydrazine dihydrochloride n2h4 2hcl p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde c9h11no and sodium sulfite na2so3 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all the chemicals were utilized directly without further purification 2 2 photochemical experiments batch steady irradiation experiments were conducted in the photochemical reactor fig s1 equipped with a 500 w high pressure mercury uv lamp ggz500 from osram with dominant emitting wavelength of 365 nm the uv light intensity was 25 3 mw cm2 the calculated incident photon flux was 772 55 μmol m2 s 1 27 determined by a light meter cel np 2000 from ceaulioht appropriate amounts of hcooh and h2o2 were homogeneously mixed in 100 ml no3 solution of varied concentrations during the irradiation the temperature of photo reactor was maintained at a constant value 25 by running a cooling water system n2 was bubbled to the solutions to remove volatile gaseous n species mainly for accuracy of sample analyses and dissolved oxygen do likely consumes the generated co2 and to provide thorough mixing of the solutions as well in practical applications bubbling n2 can be an option since it is unlikely to change the major effectiveness or cost of the system given less redox potential of do than no3 the effects of molar ratio of h2o2 to hcooh nh2o2 nhcooh 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 and 1 1 initial ph value ph 2 3 5 and 7 and initial concentration of no3 no3 0 20 35 60 100 and 400 mg n l on the removal rate of no3 and product selectivity were systematically investigated the ph value of the solutions was adjusted by 1 m hcl or naoh in addition each experiment was performed in triplicate for quality assurance 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 nh3 in samples were determined by ion chromatography ic metrohm mic switzerland after appropriate dilutions the n2h4 concentration was quantified by p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde spectrophotometric method 28 residual h2o2 in the samples was quenched by adding 0 1 m na2so3 immediately except for analyzing nh4 nh3 by ic to avoid interference by the quenching agent because our control tests and literature 29 30 suggest oxidation of nh4 by h2o2 was insignificant the product selectivity to no2 nh4 nh3 n2h4 and gaseous n species mainly n2 with small amounts of n2o3 and n2o4 31 32 were calculated according to eqs 4 7 4 s n o 2 n o 2 t n o 3 5 s n h 4 n h 4 t n o 3 6 s n 2 h 4 n 2 h 4 t n o 3 7 s g a s e o u s n s n 2 100 s n o 2 s n h 4 s n 2 h 4 where no3 no2 t nh4 t and n2h4 t represents removed no3 concentration the concentration of no2 nh4 and n2h4 in solution at reaction time t respectively the product selectivity to gaseous n species mainly n2 when ph was much lower than pka 9 246 of nh4 33 was calculated based on mass balance by subtracting the residual concentrations of no2 and nh4 from the removed concentration of no3 for water purification point of view once n species are in gaseous form they are readily volatized from water as a control test n2h4 was detected as 0 0117 0 001 mg n l i e 0 03 of total n the experimental condition was initial ph 2 3 no3 0 35 mg n l hcooh 0 21 2 mm h2o2 0 23 32 mm illumination t 120 min n2h4 is a thermodynamically unstable compound consistent with prior publications 34 35 as a result it is reasonable to count no2 nh4 and n2 as the main products in reductive removal of no3 epr experiments bruker emx 8 for detection of radicals were performed by adding 53 0 mm h2o2 106 1 mm hcooh 35 mg n l no3 and 100 mm dmpo prior to photo reactions 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo induced no3 reduction in the presence of h2o2 and hcooh fig 1 a and b show no3 reduction and product selectivity of no3 solution alone and with the presence of hcooh and h2o2 hcooh results indicate that only 33 no3 was reduced to no2 because of photoreduction of no3 36 the overall no3 photolysis process could be described by the following reactions 36 37 8 n o 3 h v n o 3 9 n o 3 n o 2 o 10 o h 2 o o h o h 11 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h it is worth noting that no3 induces oh upon exposure to uv irradiation as shown in eqs 8 11 more specifically o reacts with h2o and forms oh eq 10 in addition photolysis of no2 also produces oh radicals and the reaction pathways are similar to no3 i e no2 produces no2 under uv irradiation no2 an unstable excited intermediate then decomposes into no and o eqs 12 and 13 12 n o 2 h v n o 2 13 n o 2 n o o 14 n o o h h n o 2 apparently photolysis of no3 or no2 alone does not produce co2 radical without the presence of reductive organic compounds such as hcooh one of the simplest organics the wavelength of the peak absorbance of both hcoo and hcooh was 196 nm fig s2 since the dominant wavelength was 365 nm in this uv h2o2 hcooh system which suggests the photolysis of hcooh and cooh could be neglected with the presence of 106 1 mm hcooh 77 of no3 was reduced in 120 min about 2 3 times as high as the system of no3 alone nh4 was the main final product the presence of hcooh enhanced no3 reduction under uv irradiation the final product of nh4 instead of n2 suggests over reduction of no3 presumably by co2 see section 3 2 detection of co2 note that co2 can be produced via the reactions of formic acid reducing oh which is generated by photolysis of no3 in water eqs 8 10 in contrast 100 removal of no3 was observed in the uv h2o2 hcooh system meanwhile with the addition of h2o2 5 gaseous n species product selectivity was obtained despite 95 selectivity of nh4 the presence of 53 0 mm h2o2 provides an additional significant source to generate oh under uv irradiation see eq 1 as a result the greatest amounts of oh were produced in the presence of h2o2 among all of the three conditions shown in fig 1 the steady state concentration of oh is typically in the range of 10 12 10 14 m in advanced oxidation processes aops 38 39 the second order reaction rate constant of hcooh h2o2 no2 and nh3 with oh is 2 108 40 2 7 107 41 1 0 1010 42 and 1 0 0 1 108 m 1s 1 33 respectively considering the initial concentration of hcooh h2o2 and no3 was 106 1 53 0 and 2 5 mm respectively oh reacting with hcooh was about 15 times as fast as with h2o2 as a result around 90 of oh were readily captured by hcooh or hcoo to produce co2 on the other hand the presence of 53 mm h2o2 about half of the initial concentration of hcooh an oxidant and scaverger of oh prevents the system from being too reductive consequently 5 gaseous n species selectivity mainly n2 was observed given the reductive removal of no3 has several kinetic steps with different products and intermediates more discussions of improving the product selectivity of gaseous n species are presented in section 3 4 3 2 detection of co2 in the photo induced uv h2o2 hcooh system radical species induced by uv irradiation were examined as shown in fig 2 the main reactive intermediates such as oh and co2 radicals were detected by epr spin trapping technique to confirm the proposed reaction kinetics the epr spectrum fig 2a illustrates that nearly no signal appeared in the systems of uv hcooh dmpo and uv dmpo however dmpo oh adduct an 14 9 g aβ h 14 9 g and g 2 0059 was obtained in the uv h2o2 dmpo system the dmpo oh signal arises from the reactions of uv h2o2 rather than decomposition of dmpo ooh radical adduct this is in agreement with wolfrum et al 43 who reported dmpo ooh radical adduct was not observed in the uv h2o2 system in the uv hcooh h2o2 dmpo system a new signal an 15 7 g aβ h 18 7 g and g 2 0059 appeared which was assigned to dmpo co2 adduct the observed hyperfine coupling constants hfcc here for dmpo co2 and dmpo oh are almost identical with literature 26 44 which provide direct evidences of the formed coexisting co2 radical and oh radicals fig 2b moreover the presence of oh also supports the mechanisms of generating co2 radical illustrated in eqs 1 3 more specifically oh radical is generated by photolysis of h2o2 under uv illumination subsequently oh radical reacts with hcooh hcoo and produces reductive co2 radical 3 3 evolution processes of n species the evolution processes of n species under uv irradiation are shown in fig 3 the results showed that 35 mg n l no3 was mostly reduced to nh4 in 120 min the ph value started at 2 3 and fluctuated during reactions with an average of 2 46 fig s3 nevertheless low no2 concentrations less than 0 93 mg n l or 2 7 of total n maintained during the whole reaction process suggesting little accumulation since no2 is more toxic than no3 low accumulation of no2 in the system indicates a great advantage of the apr technology it is likely that once formed no2 was rapidly reduced to nh4 or n2 45 46 or oxidized to no3 given the second order reaction rate constant of no2 with oh is as high as 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 42 in addition h2o2 could oxidize no2 47 while oxidizing nh4 is very slow 29 30 with the progress of the reaction the products of gaseous n species had an increasing trend to a peak value of 12 70 mg n l at 91 08 j m2 uv dose then decreased to the end of the reaction since the uv h2o2 hcooh system was open gaseous n species mainly n2 were released instantaneously rather than accumulation this is different from nh4 which could accumulate with time as the most reductive product among n species it was found that no3 residue and nh4 concentrations were 1 67 and 30 65 mg n l at the end of 182 16 j m2 uv dose respectively based on the results the possible reaction pathways are ⅰ no3 is reduced to no2 by reductive co2 radical ⅱ once formed no2 is rapidly reduced to n2 n2h4 or nh4 these reactions are presented in eqs 15 18 15 n o 3 2 h 2 c o 2 n o 2 2 c o 2 h 2 o 16 2 n o 2 8 h 6 c o 2 n 2 4 h 2 o 6 c o 2 17 2no 2 12h co 2 n 2 h 4 4h 2 o co 2 18 n o 2 8 h 6 c o 2 n h 4 2 h 2 o 6 c o 2 furthermore the degradation kinetics of no3 followed pseudo first order kinetic ln c c0 kt with r 2 0 95 during the 120 min as shown in the insert of fig 3 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant k was 0 023 min 1 3 4 factors affecting the photo reduction of no3 and product selectivity to gas n species 3 4 1 effect of the initial concentration of no3 fig 4 a and 4b show the effects of no3 initial concentration on no3 removal rate product selectivity and final total soluble n species i e tn with an increment of the initial concentration of no3 from 20 to 400 mg n l the removal rate of no3 decreased from 100 to 40 after 120 min however the absolute amount of removed no3 increased from 20 to 152 mg n l with an increase of no3 concentration greater no3 anions could capture and react with reductive co2 and thus the removed amounts of no3 increased as a result a high initial no3 concentration enhanced the utilization rate of co2 radical on the other hand when the initial concentration of no3 went up from 20 to 400 mg l selectivity to gaseous n species mainly as n2 had a rising trend from 3 470 mg n l to 7 829 mg n l as an oxidant a higher level of initial no3 increases the redox potential of the system masten et al 38 and shankar et al 48 suggested more oh radicals are generated because of photolysis of no3 and no2 eqs 8 10 and 12 and 13 thus a less reductive environment was created than the situation of a lower initial no3 concentration which is likely to prevent over reduction of no3 to nh4 on the whole a relatively high no3 concentration is beneficial to enhance the absolute removal amount of no3 and to improve the product selectivity to n2 although the percentage of no3 removal declined in 120 min 3 4 2 effect of the molar ratio of h2o2 to hcooh the addition of h2o2 is very important for no3 reduction from both aspects of co2 generation related to no3 removal efficiency and the redox potential of the system related to the product selectivity of no3 reduction the results of the molar ratio of h2o2 hcooh on no3 removal and product selectivity are shown in fig 5 a and b in fig 5a the removal rate of no3 kept rising to almost 100 with h2o2 hcooh molar ratio increased from 0 1 to 0 5 it can be explained that more h2o2 generate more oh under uv irradiation 21 49 before the scavenging effect of oh becomes apparent eq 19 24 50 52 the presence of excess hcooh much more than oh which is in the range of 10 12 10 14 m typically in aops 38 39 converts oxidative oh to reductive species by yielding more co2 53 however as the molar ratio increased to 1 1 the no3 removal rate declined to 50 excess h2o2 oxidizes hcooh 54 which makes less hcooh available to capture oh and thus produce fewer co2 radicals eqs 20 and 21 therefore a declined removal rate of no3 was observed the generated oh via photolysis of h2o2 which are not captured by hcooh and co2 can oxidize nh4 into n2h4 and then n2 34 in addition no2 can be oxidized by oh radical and converted to no3 resulting in a decreased removal rate of no3 55 56 eqs 22 and 23 19 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o 20 h c o o h h 2 o 2 h c o o o h h 2 o 21 h c o o o h c o 2 h 2 o 22 n o 2 o h n o 2 o h 23 n o 2 o h n o 3 h when the molar ratio of h2o2 to hcooh remained constant generally no3 removal rate rose slightly as the hcooh or h2o2 concentration increased as shown in fig 5a the results suggest that more co2 radicals were produced leading to more reduction of no3 this result is consistent with a decreased product selectivity at a greater hcooh initial concentration but with the same h2o2 hcooh ratio as shown in fig 6 b in other words a higher no3 removal rate and a lower product selectivity of gaseous n happened in a more reductive environment i e a greater amount of co2 produced as shown in fig 6b the main product was nh4 when h2o2 hcooh molar ratio was less than or equal to 0 7 however smaller amounts of nh4 and greater amounts of gaseous n products were found when the molar ratio was above 0 7 although poor percentage removal of no3 was obtained more specifically the products of 80 gaseous n and 20 nh4 were achieved at h2o2 hcooh molar ratio of 1 1 although the removal rate of no3 was down to 45 in eqs 15 18 theoretically 1 mol of no3 reacts with 8 and 5 mol of co2 radical to produce nh4 and n2 respectively the experimental results can be elucidated that no3 was over reduced to nh4 in a relatively high co2 radical concentration eq 18 thus conversion of no3 to nh4 may be limited when co2 radical was of a relatively low level and production of gaseous n species mainly n2 became dominant for the apr system eq 16 it means the selectivity of reduction products to gaseous n2 could be boosted by managing a lower co2 level or less reductive environment in the uv h2o2 hcooh system however on the other hand poor removal performance of no3 is inevitable when co2 concentration is low in conclusion a higher molar ratio 0 7 of h2o2 to hcooh benefits greater product selectivity to gaseous n because it is likely to avoid over reduction of no3 to nh4 3 4 3 effect of the initial ph value ph plays an important role in the apr system and affects the redox potential of no3 17 stability of h2o2 57 deprotonation of nh4 pka 9 246 33 and hcooh pka 3 745 58 and thus the generation of co2 fig 6a displays the effect of initial ph on reduction rate and ph changes over the reaction time when initial ph was 2 3 the reduction rate of no3 achieved near 100 while the final ph value went up to 2 5 and 3 7 respectively however when initial ph was 5 and 7 no3 removal rate presented a descending trend and the final ph increased to 9 5 after 120 min consumption of h in reduction of no3 eqs 15 18 37 can explain the experimental results of increased ph at the end and decreased no3 removal rate at higher initial ph levels these results suggest that acidic condition was in favor of no3 reduction the likely reason is that h directly participates in reducing no3 as shown in eqs 15 18 with the extent of reduction of no3 to no2 n2 and finally nh4 more and more h are demanded to make the reactions happen although it is possible that h consumes co2 because it has a greater redox potential than co2 eq 24 the results suggest that this effect is less important for the overall no3 reduction processes 24 h c o 2 1 2 h 2 c o 2 the product selectivity for reduction of no3 is presented in fig 6b with an increase of initial ph selectivity to nh4 was suppressed and to n2 appeared increasing as mentioned before with the progress of continued reduction of n species more and more h are demanded to promote the reactions as shown in eqs 15 18 6 mol of h are needed to reduce 1 mol of no3 to n2 in contrast 10 mol of h are required to form nh4 as the final reduction product apparently when h becomes less and less available with increasing ph to 7 the condition favors the reduction pathways of less h consumption i e forming n2 rather than nh4 in fact a high ph level near or greater than pka 9 246 of nh4 33 makes the product selectivity to form n2 less important because nh3 can escape from water via volatilization assuming nh3 can be recovered as a resource or at least does not cause significant secondary pollution in this case deep reduction of no3 by a great amount of co2 is preferred to improve its removal rate ph affects bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations in the solution pka1 6 35 pka2 10 33 for h2co3 59 which could scavenge oh radical eq 25 k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 and eq 26 k 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 37 given the tested ph range was much below 10 33 hco3 was the dominant species in the system however its second order reaction rate constant with oh is about 4 of hcooh as a result the scavenging effect of hco3 seems unimportant unless ph is much greater than neutral level in which co3 2 becomes significant with a higher secondary order reaction rate constant with oh than hcooh in this case oh would be scavenged by co3 2 likely instead of reacting with cooh to produce co2 or participating the oxidation of n species directly 25 o h h c o 3 h 2 o c o 3 26 o h c o 3 2 o h c o 3 at ph 7 or neutral level the removal rate of no3 was 70 and the product selectivity of gaseous n species was 40 therefore the results reveal that the uv h2o2 hcooh system is viable to remove no3 in most natural waters the comprehensive reaction pathways are proposed in fig 7 which summarizes the mechanisms of the reactions discussed earlier in this paper other than the reductions initiated by co2 it is possible that small amount of free oh not captured by hcooh hcoo can oxidize nh4 nh3 to form nh2 eq 27 then nh2 combines to form n2h4 eq 28 60 an unstable intermediate product 61 nh2 and n2h4 pka 7 9 62 can be further oxidized by oh to form n2 or no2 or no3 subsequently 35 27 o h n h 3 n h 2 h 2 o 28 n h 2 n h 2 n 2 h 4 4 conclusion this study systematically investigated reductive removal of no3 and final product selectivity by co2 species produced in a uv h2o2 hcooh system both co2 and oh radicals were detected by epr analysis nearly 100 no3 removal rate was achieved at h2o2 hcooh molar ratio of 0 5 ph 2 3 after 120 min the highest product selectivity of 80 to form gaseous n mainly n2 was achieved with 1 1 m ratio of h2o2 hcooh while 50 removal rate of no3 was obtained the results suggest that high co2 yield was in favor of enhancing no3 removal rate while low co2 yield could promote product selectivity to gaseous n instead of over reduction to nh4 overall the uv h2o2 hcooh process can provide a viable solution to remove no3 and maintain a high product selectivity to form gaseous n for water purification purpose declaration of competing interest the authors of the manuscript have assured there is no conflict interest involved

14211,coal ldh g c3n4 coal ldh cn heterostructures was prepared through self assembly method using exfoliated coal ldh and g c3n4 nanosheets via electrostatic attraction force the morphology and physicochemical properties characterization verified the success synthesis of layer by layer structure of coal ldh cn heterogeneous catalytic degradation of sulfadiazine sdz was assessed using coal ldh cn combined with peroxymonosulfate pms and visible light irradiation a remarkable synergistic effect was obtained in sdz removal after 15 min 10 μm sdz could be removed by 87 1 at conditions of 0 1 g l coal ldh cn 0 5 mm pms and ph 6 0 the reusability tests signified the excellent reusing potential of coal ldh cn mechanism study suggested that coal ldh in the heterostructures activated pms to produce so4 and oh while g c3n4 acted as dual roles electron acceptor and pms activator additionally density functional theory dft calculations successfully disclosed that the sites with high fukin index f 0 on sdz molecule were more vulnerable to radicals attack eco toxicity evaluation signified the generation of less toxic intermediates compared to sdz after photocatalysis our findings demonstrate the integration of coal ldh cn visible light and pms can be applied as a promising approach for efficient degradation of organic compound polluted water keywords multi layered ldh g c3n4 peroxymonosulfate sulfadiazine degradation 1 introduction sulfadiazine sdz is a widely used sulfonamide antibiotic due to its strong inhibiting properties on bacterial pathogens 1 it s reported that incomplete metabolized sdz is continually discharged into natural waters the excess sulfadiazine results in the formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria genes and variation of microbial community structure and composition posing serious threat to human health 2 therefore the residual sulfadiazine in the ecosystems become one of the particularly concerned emerging environmental contaminants in the past few years apparently the effective remediation technique is desperately needed 3 peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have received increasingly attention and been considered as a promising alternative for recalcitrant antibiotics elimination owing to its impressive characteristics such as high oxidative capability long half time period high reaction selectivity and great adaptive capability in a wide ph range 4 5 generally pms can be activated with the assistance of ultraviolet uv 6 heat 7 microwave 8 and transition metals 9 10 to produce highly reactive radicals such as so4 oh etc compared to energy based activation approaches transition metals activation is consistently regarded as an effective and viable approach because of the low cost and simple operation thus many efforts have been made to develop different heterogeneous catalysts for pms activation 11 nevertheless the pms catalytic efficiency still needs to be improved therefore the construction of low cost green catalytic and sustainable system that can effectively activate pms to degrade recalcitrant antibiotics is essential 12 as a particularly attractive metal free two dimensional carbon nanomaterial graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has boost up the long cherished photo electrocatalytic performance in the past decade 13 15 thanks to the suitable band gap 2 7 ev impressive visible light absorption prominent chemical stability facile synthesis and low cost g c3n4 has been regarded as a gifted material in photocatalytic fields 14 16 yet the fast recombination rate of electron hole pairs and low specific surface area of the pristine g c3n4 limited its practical application thus strategies of elements doping 17 19 heterostructures construction 14 and sensitizing by organic dyes 20 21 have been proposed to address these shortcomings layered double hydroxides ldhs are a type of interesting clay minerals consisting of mixed metal oxides 22 23 the unique layer structure have motivated its application in many fields specially the oxo bridges can inhibit the electron hole recombination through a metal to metal charge transfer mechanism 24 25 nevertheless the ldh is not effective in photocatalytic processes because of the short living electron hole pairs produced 26 therefore the combination of ldh and g c3n4 could address the shortcomings as far as we know the ldh g c3n4 composites have been applied as supercapacitor 27 photocatalysts in decontamination of organic wastewater 28 water splitting 29 yet there is no study about the organic pollutants degradation by ldh g c3n4 with the assistant of pms besides the reported ldh g c3n4 have been always synthesized through co precipitation strategy 27 the ldh tended to be aggregated during the synthesis process which greatly inhibited the intimate contact of ldh and g c3n4 and the efficient charge transfer as the surface of ldh layers is positively charged whereas g c3n4 sheets carry negative charge thus the assembling of exfoliated ldh layers and g c3n4 layers can be accomplished thanks to the electrostatic attraction force it s rational to believe that the development of layer by layer structure will be an efficient technique to facilitate the charge transfer however to our knowledge very few literature has recorded the synthesis of ldh g c3n4 heterostructures from exfoliate ldh and g c3n4 nanosheets using the self assembly method not to mention that no study has been carried out to utilize ldh g c3n4 for pms activation for organic pollutant decontamination herein we have built coal ldh g c3n4 coal ldh cn heterostructures through the layer by layer assembly technique sulfadiazine sdz was selected as a model compound to estimate the catalytic property of coal ldh cn toward pms activation under visible light irradiation electron paramagnetic resonance epr and radical scavenge experiments were conducted to clarify the possible mechanism degradation intermediates identification and density functional theory dft calculations were performed to elucidate the possible degradation pathways for sdz in addition the eco toxicity of sdz and its degradation intermediates were evaluated via ecological structure activity relationships ecosar program 2 materials and methods 2 1 photocatalysts synthesis 2 1 1 synthesis of coal ldh nanosheets all

colloidal solution was added into cn colloidal solution with different mass ratios m coal ldh m cn 4 1 2 1 1 1 0 8 1 and 0 5 1 thereafter the resultant solution was agitated for 24 h for the complete self assembly reaction the solids was collected washed and dried for further use 2 2 characterization and analytical methods characterization and analytical methods are provided in text s1 in supporting material 2 3 experimental procedures all batch type experiments was performed in a quartz reactor 100 ml at 25 typically 0 2 g l catalyst and 0 5 mm pms were added into 50 ml sdz solution 10 μm then the vessel was immediately placed under the visible light source 100 w m2 to start the reaction at regular intervals 1 ml aliquot was collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter then quenching in na2s2o3 solution prepared for analyzed all experiments were performed at least three times 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalysts characterization xrd patterns of the coal ldh cn and coal ldh cn heterostructures are compared in fig 1 for coal ldh the typical diffraction peaks at 2θ of 11 6 23 4 34 7 61 7 and 62 2 correspond to the 003 006 009 110 and 113 crystalline planes of hexagonal coal ldh jcpds 51 0045 respectively 31 meanwhile the pristine cn displays two typical peaks at 12 8 and 27 6 the detected peaks are indexed as 100 and 002 crystal facets which are attributed to the interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic complex and the in plane structural packing motif of tri s triazine units respectively 32 this observation confirms the successful synthesis of coal ldh and cn no additional impurity are detected signifying the high purity of the samples the resultant coal ldh cn heterostructures inherits the characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to both coal ldh and cn implying the successful incorporation of coal ldh and cn with increasing mass content of ldh the diffraction intensities of cn gradually declines reflecting their contents in coal ldh cn hybrids ftir spectroscopy of coal ldh cn and coal ldh cn were studied to probe their surface functional groups fig 2 a for the cn the board absorption band at 3000 3500 cm 1 can be attributed to the nh2 and nh groups stretching modes and their intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions 33 the absorption band at 802 and 895 cm 1 are related to the s triazine ring mode and the cross linked deformation mode of nh respectively 34 several intense bands at 1240 1650 cm 1 correspond to the particular stretching vibration modes of aromatic cn cn heterocycles 35 36 one can see that the spectra of coal ldh cn hybrids resembles that of the pure cn revealing that the chemical structure of cn in coal ldh cn hybrids was not destroyed during the self assembly process the pure coal ldh displays strong absorption bands at 400 800 cm 1 corresponding to the translational modes of m o and m om bands m represents co and al the broad band centered at 3478 cm 1 is related to oh groups vibrations the peak located at 1570 cm 1 could be assigned to the stretching vibration of s triazine ring 37 surprisingly as compared with the pristine cn the band at 1570 cm 1 shows a tiny blue shift to 1581 cm 1 with the introduction of coal ldh as illustrated in fig 2b this can probably be attributed to the electrostatic interactions between coal ldh and cn 38 sem tem and hrtem analyses were carried out to look into the morphologies and microstructures of coal ldh cn along with coal ldh and cn for the purpose of comparison as seen in figs 3a and 4 a the single ldh nanosheet presents a hexagonal morphology with a lateral size of 20 50 nm and ldh nanosheets tends to aggregate to diminish their surface areas because of the high surface energy while the cn displays typical hierarchical morphology over the whole surface with numerous wrinkles and folds figs 3b and 4 b sem images of coal ldh cn clearly reveals that a large number of tiny hexagonal nanocrystallines of coal ldh are uniformly lying flat on the surface of cn as depicted in fig 3c g the number of ldh nanosheets increases gradually with the increase of its mass content in the heterostructures the tem image of the 0 8coal ldh cn in fig 4c also clearly demonstrates the intimate contact of ldh and g c3n4 which is good for the efficient charge transfer between two materials the hrtem image illustrates that the lattice fringe had a spacing value of 0 769 nm with respect to the 003 crystal planes of the as prepared ldh fig 4d additionally edx elemental mapping was performed to elucidate the chemical constitution of the heterostructures as represented in fig 4e c and n elements are dispersed equably on the whole composite and the even distribution of co al and o elements is symbolic of the uniform dispersion of coal ldh on cn and the close contact of these two materials thus it can be concluded that coal ldh cn has been successfully self assembled through the synthesis process schematically illustrated in fig 4f the optical properties of the samples were studied using the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra from fig 5 a the cn displays an absorption edge at around 450 nm correlating with the intrinsic band gap absorption of g c3n4 39 apparently coal ldh cn heterostructures represent a high absorbance in the studied range particularly in the visible light region indicating that the incorporation of coal ldh greatly improves the visible light absorption ability of cn this agrees well with the color change from yellow cn to brown 4coal ldh cn as shown in fig s1 in order to obtain the optical direct band gap values of coal ldh and cn the kubelka munk function was employed and the band gap energy of pure coal ldh and cn was determined by the equation αhν a hν e g 1 2 where e g α and h are the band gap energy absorption coefficient and planck constant respectively the band gaps of coal ldh and cn were calculated to be 2 04 and 2 76 ev respectively fig s2 fig 5b represents the photoluminescence pl spectra of cn and coal ldh cn heterostructures at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm in comparison with the pristine cn coal ldh cn heterostructures display much weaker emission intensity this evinces that the introduction of coal ldh boosts the electron transfer and inhibits the recombination rate of electron hole pairs effectively 40 notably the 0 8coal ldh cn possesses the lowest peak magnitude indicating the lowest recombination rate and the greatest photocatalytic activity in addition as illustrated in fig 5c the electrochemical impedance spectrum eis of coal ldh cn presents a smaller semicircular than that of cn manifesting a lower charge transfer resistance this verifies the effective migration and separation of charge carriers in coal ldh cn collectively the above analysis supports that the combination of ldh nanosheets and g c3n4 nanosheets was highly effective in promoting the separation of electron hole pairs 3 2 photocatalytic activity evaluation firstly the photocatalytic property of coal ldh cn heterostructures were evaluated as illustrated in fig s3 the sdz degradation by cn in the presence of pms under the visible light irradiation was very limited obviously the photocatalytic efficiency of coal ldh cn relied on the ldh content in 15 min the degradation efficiencies achieved by 4coal ldh cn 2coal ldh cn 1coal ldh cn 0 8coal ldh cn and 0 5coal ldh cn were 96 5 88 2 86 3 87 1 and 44 9 respectively although the coal ldh and 4coal ldh cn exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity the leaching cobalt ion concentration in the coal ldh and 4coal ldh cn systems were 1 9 mg l and 1 mg l respectively while the leaching in 0 8coal ldh cn and 0 5coal ldh cn systems were negligible fig s4 considering the photocatalytic activity and reducing secondary pollution 0 8coal ldh cn was chosen as the optimum photocatalyst in following tests meanwhile the sdz degradation in different systems were also studied to determine the synergistic effect of pms and visible light irradiation as depicted in fig 6 a the adsorption of 0 8coal ldh cn played a minor role in sdz removal the direct photolysis by 0 8coal ldh cn did not occur due to a negligible degradation 7 9 the binary mixture of pms and 0 8coal ldh cn removed approximately 49 9 of sdz which was mainly ascribed to the heterogeneous activation of pms over 0 8coal ldh cn as expected the 0 8coal ldh cn pms visible light system exhibited a superior degradation efficiency as compared with the 0 8coal ldh cn pms system the sdz degradation reached 87 1 in 0 8coal ldh cn pms visible light system the observations signified that the improved catalytic efficiency arose from the synergistic effect between the 0 8coal ldh cn pms and visible light the as synthesized layer by layer heterostructures could be a promising green heterogeneous catalyst for effective organic contaminants removal by pms activation under visible light irradiation 3 3 effect of ph it is of great importance to evaluate the influence of ph on the photocatalytic removal of sdz as the ph of most wastewaters is neutral or alkaline 41 fig 6b clearly indicated that the studied system possessed an excellent photocatalytic efficiency for sdz degradation within ph range of 6 0 10 5 and the sdz degradation was promoted along with the increase of ph it is accepted that the major form of pms is h2so5 at ph lower than pka of pms pka 9 4 42 and the activation of pms could be inhibited as h2so5 was stable under acid conditions besides as the ph was relatively low ph 5 76 cnh2 and c2nh groups on the surface of g c3n4 could be protonated in the aqueous solution resulting in the instability of the composites thereby acquiring a lower degradation efficiency 43 44 the photocatalytic system was more efficient under alkaline conditions and a complete sdz removal was accomplished at ph 10 5 this was might be due to the base activation of pms through the following reactions so4 oh oh o2 h 1o2 apparently the higher oh concentration in solution resulted in the generation of more number of reactive 1o2 it s an advantage that the as prepared coal ldh cn heterostructures can be used in actual application without the requirement of ph adjustment 3 4 quenching tests and esr analysis to identify the involved reactive species radical trapping tests were performed by using meoh scavengers of oh and so4 tba scavengers of oh edta 2na scavengers of h and bq scavengers of o2 45 as seen in fig 7 a the oxidative process was suppressed differently with the addition of different scavengers the sdz degradation was sharply suppressed upon the addition of edta 2na implying that photogenerated holes played the dominant role in the presence of tba the removal rate of sdz dropped from 87 1 47 9 because of the scavenging of oh the sdz degradation declined to 25 by adding meoh this suggested that oh and so4 radicals generated simultaneously in the studied photocatalytic system and they worked together for the sdz decomposition moreover the degradation decreased from 87 1 56 4 by adding bq this revealed that the degradation process involved o2 radicals generating from the reaction of pms and h2o 46 to further evidence the involved reactive species we also carried out in situ electron paramagnetic resonance epr tests with spin trapping reagents of dmpo bmpo and temp as illustrated in fig 7b no obvious signal was observed in dark while an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 four line signal and a six line signal were detected in the presence of 0 5 mm pms and visible light irradiation this was related to the typical peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 respectively fig 7c showed characteristic peaks of bmpo o2 confirming the generation of o2 during the reaction with the excess 5 mm temp a strong 1 1 1 triplet signal characteristic of temp 1o2 were observed fig 7d signifying the contribution of singlet oxygen hence h oh so4 o2 and 1o2 were suggested to account for the sdz degradation while h was evidenced to be the dominant species the synergetic degradation effect resulting from the hybridizing ldh and g c3n4 nanosheets favored the separation or charge carriers causing the enhancement of reactive species production and thereby improving the photocatalytic activity 3 5 degradation mechanism xps spectra was further performed for elucidating the chemical compositions and valence states of the elements on the catalyst before and after reaction fig 8 the survey spectrum fig 8a of 0 8coal ldh cn revealed photoelectron peaks of co 2p al 2p c 1s n 1s and o 1s the high resolution xps spectra of al 2p before and after reaction were identical figure not shown indicating that al did not participate in the photocatalytic process in fig 8b two major peaks at 798 2 and 799 7 ev were assigned to co3 and co2 respectively the relative ratios of the two peaks to the overall co intensity before reaction were 68 and 32 table s1 respectively while after reaction the relative ratios change to 65 and 35 respectively the improved ratio of co2 was ascribed to the reduction of co3 to co2 demonstrating the involvement of co2 co3 co3 redox cycles during degradation process the c 1s spectrum of the heterostructures was deconvoluted into two peaks at 284 9 and 288 3 ev fig 8c corresponding to the contaminated carbon and sp2 bonded carbon ncn in g c3n4 47 in the meanwhile the peaks at 398 7 399 1 and 400 9 ev were related to sp2 hybridized aromatic n cnc tertiary n bonded to carbon atoms n c 3 and c nh groups fig 8d 48 the xps spectrum of c 1s and n 1s before and after photocatalytic reaction remained unchanged revealing that g c3n4 was stable component of the photocatalyst therefore a tentative catalytic mechanism was put forward fig 9 with the visible light irradiation the electron hole pairs of coal ldh cn heterostructures were excited in both coal ldh and g c3n4 eq 1 49 the mobilized e could migrate instantly from the cb of coal ldh 1 14 ev to the cb of g c3n4 1 06 ev then reacted with the dissolved oxygen to produce o2 through eq 2 50 in the meantime e could react with pms to produce so4 and oh eqs 3 4 notably high active 1o2 could be yielded via reaction of oh with o2 through eq 5 51 besides the reaction of h and o2 could also produce 1o2 eq 6 52 according to the xps results co2 also participated in the pms activation for the production of so4 through eqs 7 11 in conclusion coal ldh in heterostructures activated pms to produce so4 and oh while g c3n4 acted as dual roles electron acceptor and pms activator 1 coal ldh cn hv

calculation and eco toxicity evaluation for understanding the sdz degradation pathway in the pms assisted photocatalytic system hplc esi ms ms analysis and computation based on dft calculation were carried out the possible degradation intermediates were listed in table s2 the natural population analysis charge distribution and fukin index f 0 were determined on gaussian 03 package for further clarifying the degradation pathway details on dft calculations are illustrated in text s1 results show that n1 n3 c8 c9 o1 and o2 atoms holding larger f 0 are more vulnerable to radicals attack based on the detected intermediates and fukin index fig s5 the degradation pathway of sdz is schematically proposed in fig 10 c8 and c9 atoms with the f 0 of 0 0042 on sdz could be easily attacked by oh radicals to yield hydroxylated sdz p1 m z 267 0 53 then owing to the largest f 0 0 0645 the n3 atom underwent cn bond cleavage to produce p2 m z 217 1 on the other hand n1 atom with the second highest f 0 0 0545 was oxidized by so4 directly to generate p3 m z 266 1 and p4 m z 281 1 n3 and n4 could be further attacked by so4 resulting in the ring open of the heterocyclic ring 54 later p2 would be transformed into p5 m z 173 0 and p6 m z 173 0 by cleavage of the sn bond and cn bond respectively 55 with the continuous oxidation of active species in the system ring opening of all intermediates would happen in addition ecological structure activity relationships ecosar program was implemented for the eco toxicity prediction of sdz and its degradation intermediates as we can see in fig 11 the chronic toxicities chvs for sdz to fish daphnia and green algae are 8 953 0 148 and 14 888 mg l respectively based on the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals united nations 2011 56 sdz can be classified as a highly toxic organic contaminant after the photocatalytic degradation the acute and chronic toxicities of the detected degradation intermediates to three aquatic species are less expect the chvs values of p1 p3 and p4 toward fish than the apparent compound this definitely implies that the photocatalytic degradation of sdz using coal ldh cn heterostructures is of significance for the aquatic environment safety 3 7 reusability and stability of the coal ldh cn the reusability is a key factor for long run applications of catalysts during the degradation process accordingly the reusability of multi layered coal ldh cn heterostructures was examined for four successive runs as seen in fig 12 a the decline in sdz removal was not significant following four cycles all four cycles of photocatalytic from coal ldh cn yielded degradation efficiency of 87 1 84 6 82 3 and 80 2 respectively this evidence clearly suggested the robustness of coal ldh cn for the target pollutant degradation furthermore xrd patterns was carried out to estimate the nature of the recovered catalyst no detectable difference was observed between the fresh coal ldh cn heterostructures and used one as depicted in fig 12b this verified the excellent stability of coal ldh cn heterostructures throughout the photocatalytic process 4 conclusions in summary multi layered coal ldh cn heterostructures was developed via a facile self assemble process as tested for sdz degradation under visible light the designed layer by layer coal ldh cn was a good heterogeneous catalyst with low level of metal ions leaching the robust activity of efficient charge separation led to the improved photocatalytic production of reactive species including h oh so4 o2 and 1o2 after 15 min reaction 10 μm sdz could be removed by 87 1 at the condition of 0 1 g l coal ldh cn 0 5 mm pms and ph 6 0 dft calculation suggested that the atoms with high fukin index f 0 interpret the ring hydroxylation and cn bond cleavage under reactive radicals attack the eco toxicity of sdz was alleviated during the photocatalysis based on the prediction by ecosar program overall coal ldh cn activation of pms under visible light irradiation can be a successful and promising approach to degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants effectively owing to the facile preparation of the heterostructures cogeneration of different reactive radicals and excellent recyclability and durability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14211,coal ldh g c3n4 coal ldh cn heterostructures was prepared through self assembly method using exfoliated coal ldh and g c3n4 nanosheets via electrostatic attraction force the morphology and physicochemical properties characterization verified the success synthesis of layer by layer structure of coal ldh cn heterogeneous catalytic degradation of sulfadiazine sdz was assessed using coal ldh cn combined with peroxymonosulfate pms and visible light irradiation a remarkable synergistic effect was obtained in sdz removal after 15 min 10 μm sdz could be removed by 87 1 at conditions of 0 1 g l coal ldh cn 0 5 mm pms and ph 6 0 the reusability tests signified the excellent reusing potential of coal ldh cn mechanism study suggested that coal ldh in the heterostructures activated pms to produce so4 and oh while g c3n4 acted as dual roles electron acceptor and pms activator additionally density functional theory dft calculations successfully disclosed that the sites with high fukin index f 0 on sdz molecule were more vulnerable to radicals attack eco toxicity evaluation signified the generation of less toxic intermediates compared to sdz after photocatalysis our findings demonstrate the integration of coal ldh cn visible light and pms can be applied as a promising approach for efficient degradation of organic compound polluted water keywords multi layered ldh g c3n4 peroxymonosulfate sulfadiazine degradation 1 introduction sulfadiazine sdz is a widely used sulfonamide antibiotic due to its strong inhibiting properties on bacterial pathogens 1 it s reported that incomplete metabolized sdz is continually discharged into natural waters the excess sulfadiazine results in the formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria genes and variation of microbial community structure and composition posing serious threat to human health 2 therefore the residual sulfadiazine in the ecosystems become one of the particularly concerned emerging environmental contaminants in the past few years apparently the effective remediation technique is desperately needed 3 peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have received increasingly attention and been considered as a promising alternative for recalcitrant antibiotics elimination owing to its impressive characteristics such as high oxidative capability long half time period high reaction selectivity and great adaptive capability in a wide ph range 4 5 generally pms can be activated with the assistance of ultraviolet uv 6 heat 7 microwave 8 and transition metals 9 10 to produce highly reactive radicals such as so4 oh etc compared to energy based activation approaches transition metals activation is consistently regarded as an effective and viable approach because of the low cost and simple operation thus many efforts have been made to develop different heterogeneous catalysts for pms activation 11 nevertheless the pms catalytic efficiency still needs to be improved therefore the construction of low cost green catalytic and sustainable system that can effectively activate pms to degrade recalcitrant antibiotics is essential 12 as a particularly attractive metal free two dimensional carbon nanomaterial graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has boost up the long cherished photo electrocatalytic performance in the past decade 13 15 thanks to the suitable band gap 2 7 ev impressive visible light absorption prominent chemical stability facile synthesis and low cost g c3n4 has been regarded as a gifted material in photocatalytic fields 14 16 yet the fast recombination rate of electron hole pairs and low specific surface area of the pristine g c3n4 limited its practical application thus strategies of elements doping 17 19 heterostructures construction 14 and sensitizing by organic dyes 20 21 have been proposed to address these shortcomings layered double hydroxides ldhs are a type of interesting clay minerals consisting of mixed metal oxides 22 23 the unique layer structure have motivated its application in many fields specially the oxo bridges can inhibit the electron hole recombination through a metal to metal charge transfer mechanism 24 25 nevertheless the ldh is not effective in photocatalytic processes because of the short living electron hole pairs produced 26 therefore the combination of ldh and g c3n4 could address the shortcomings as far as we know the ldh g c3n4 composites have been applied as supercapacitor 27 photocatalysts in decontamination of organic wastewater 28 water splitting 29 yet there is no study about the organic pollutants degradation by ldh g c3n4 with the assistant of pms besides the reported ldh g c3n4 have been always synthesized through co precipitation strategy 27 the ldh tended to be aggregated during the synthesis process which greatly inhibited the intimate contact of ldh and g c3n4 and the efficient charge transfer as the surface of ldh layers is positively charged whereas g c3n4 sheets carry negative charge thus the assembling of exfoliated ldh layers and g c3n4 layers can be accomplished thanks to the electrostatic attraction force it s rational to believe that the development of layer by layer structure will be an efficient technique to facilitate the charge transfer however to our knowledge very few literature has recorded the synthesis of ldh g c3n4 heterostructures from exfoliate ldh and g c3n4 nanosheets using the self assembly method not to mention that no study has been carried out to utilize ldh g c3n4 for pms activation for organic pollutant decontamination herein we have built coal ldh g c3n4 coal ldh cn heterostructures through the layer by layer assembly technique sulfadiazine sdz was selected as a model compound to estimate the catalytic property of coal ldh cn toward pms activation under visible light irradiation electron paramagnetic resonance epr and radical scavenge experiments were conducted to clarify the possible mechanism degradation intermediates identification and density functional theory dft calculations were performed to elucidate the possible degradation pathways for sdz in addition the eco toxicity of sdz and its degradation intermediates were evaluated via ecological structure activity relationships ecosar program 2 materials and methods 2 1 photocatalysts synthesis 2 1 1 synthesis of coal ldh nanosheets all chemicals were reagent grade and used as received without further purification deionized water was used throughout this study the solution ph was adjusted using a phs 3e ph meter typically co no3 2

into solution b under vigorous agitation the resultant mixture was injected into a teflon lined autoclave to heat at 110 for 9 h the pink product coal ldh was obtained washed thoroughly and desiccated at 60 overnight the obtained coal ldh 1 0 g was then dispersed evenly in a solution 1 0 l containing hno3 0 0045 mol and nano3 1 5 mol and continuously stirred under a nitrogen flow at ambient temperature overnight the resultant was collected washed and dried finally the solid product was mixed in 100 ml formamide ultrasonicated for 30 min and agitated intensely for another 24 h to yield a

lowest peak magnitude indicating the lowest recombination rate and the greatest photocatalytic activity in addition as illustrated in fig 5c the electrochemical impedance spectrum eis of coal ldh cn presents a smaller semicircular than that of cn manifesting a lower charge transfer resistance this verifies the effective migration and separation of charge carriers in coal ldh cn collectively the above analysis supports that the combination of ldh nanosheets and g c3n4 nanosheets was highly effective in promoting the separation of electron hole pairs 3 2 photocatalytic activity evaluation firstly the photocatalytic property of coal ldh cn heterostructures were evaluated as illustrated in fig s3 the sdz degradation by cn in the presence of pms under the visible light irradiation was very limited obviously the photocatalytic efficiency of coal ldh cn relied on the ldh content in 15 min the degradation efficiencies achieved by 4coal ldh cn 2coal ldh cn 1coal ldh cn 0 8coal ldh cn and 0 5coal ldh cn were 96 5 88 2 86 3 87 1 and 44 9 respectively although the coal ldh and 4coal ldh cn exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity the leaching cobalt ion concentration in the coal ldh and 4coal ldh cn systems were 1 9 mg l and 1 mg l respectively while the leaching in 0 8coal ldh cn and 0 5coal ldh cn systems were negligible fig s4 considering the photocatalytic activity and reducing secondary pollution 0 8coal ldh cn was chosen as the optimum photocatalyst in following tests meanwhile the sdz degradation in different systems were also studied to determine the synergistic effect of pms and visible light irradiation as depicted in fig 6 a the adsorption of 0 8coal ldh cn played a minor role in sdz removal the direct photolysis by 0 8coal ldh cn did not occur due to a negligible degradation 7 9 the binary mixture of pms and 0 8coal ldh cn removed approximately 49 9 of sdz which was mainly ascribed to the heterogeneous activation of pms over 0 8coal ldh cn as expected the 0 8coal ldh cn pms visible light system exhibited a superior degradation efficiency as compared with the 0 8coal ldh cn pms system the sdz degradation reached 87 1 in 0 8coal ldh cn pms visible light system the observations signified that the improved catalytic efficiency arose from the synergistic effect between the 0 8coal ldh cn pms and visible light the as synthesized layer by layer heterostructures could be a promising green heterogeneous catalyst for effective organic contaminants removal by pms activation under visible light irradiation 3 3 effect of ph it is of great importance to evaluate the influence of ph on the photocatalytic removal of sdz as the ph of most wastewaters is neutral or alkaline 41 fig 6b clearly indicated that the studied system possessed an excellent photocatalytic efficiency for sdz degradation within ph range of 6 0 10 5 and the sdz degradation was promoted along with the increase of ph it is accepted that the major form of pms is h2so5 at ph lower than pka of pms pka 9 4 42 and the activation of pms could be inhibited as h2so5 was stable under acid conditions besides as the ph was relatively low ph 5 76 cnh2 and c2nh groups on the surface of g c3n4 could be protonated in the aqueous solution resulting in the instability of the composites thereby acquiring a lower degradation efficiency 43 44 the photocatalytic system was more efficient under alkaline conditions and a complete sdz removal was accomplished at ph 10 5 this was might be due to the base activation of pms through the following reactions so4 oh oh o2 h 1o2 apparently the higher oh concentration in solution resulted in the generation of more number of reactive 1o2 it s an advantage that the as prepared coal ldh cn heterostructures can be used in actual application without the requirement of ph adjustment 3 4 quenching tests and esr analysis to identify the involved reactive species radical trapping tests were performed by using meoh scavengers of oh and so4 tba scavengers of oh edta 2na scavengers of h and bq scavengers of o2 45 as seen in fig 7 a the oxidative process was suppressed differently with the addition of different scavengers the sdz degradation was sharply suppressed upon the addition of edta 2na implying that photogenerated holes played the dominant role in the presence of tba the removal rate of sdz dropped from 87 1 47 9 because of the scavenging of oh the sdz degradation declined to 25 by adding meoh this suggested that oh and so4 radicals generated simultaneously in the studied photocatalytic system and they worked together for the sdz decomposition moreover the degradation decreased from 87 1 56 4 by adding bq this revealed that the degradation process involved o2 radicals generating from the reaction of pms and h2o 46 to further evidence the involved reactive species we also carried out in situ electron paramagnetic resonance epr tests with spin trapping reagents of dmpo bmpo and temp as illustrated in fig 7b no obvious signal was observed in dark while an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 four line signal and a six line signal were detected in the presence of 0 5 mm pms and visible light irradiation this was related to the typical peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 respectively fig 7c showed characteristic peaks of bmpo o2 confirming the generation of o2 during the reaction with the excess 5 mm temp a strong 1 1 1 triplet signal characteristic of temp 1o2 were observed fig 7d signifying the contribution of singlet oxygen hence h oh so4 o2 and 1o2 were suggested to account for the sdz degradation while h was evidenced to be the dominant species the synergetic degradation effect resulting from the hybridizing ldh and g c3n4 nanosheets favored the separation or charge carriers causing the enhancement of reactive species production and thereby improving the photocatalytic activity 3 5 degradation mechanism xps spectra was further performed for elucidating the chemical compositions and valence states of the elements on the catalyst before and after reaction fig 8 the survey spectrum fig 8a of 0 8coal ldh cn revealed photoelectron peaks of co 2p al 2p c 1s n 1s and o 1s the high resolution xps spectra of al 2p before and after reaction were identical figure not shown indicating that al did not participate in the photocatalytic process in fig 8b two major peaks at 798 2 and 799 7 ev were assigned to co3 and co2 respectively the relative ratios of the two peaks to the overall co intensity before reaction were 68 and 32 table s1 respectively while after reaction the relative ratios change to 65 and 35 respectively the improved ratio of co2 was ascribed to the reduction of co3 to co2 demonstrating the involvement of co2 co3 co3 redox cycles during degradation process the c 1s spectrum of the heterostructures was deconvoluted into two peaks at 284 9 and 288 3 ev fig 8c corresponding to the contaminated carbon and sp2 bonded carbon ncn in g c3n4 47 in the meanwhile the peaks at 398 7 399 1 and 400 9 ev were related to sp2 hybridized aromatic n cnc tertiary n bonded to carbon atoms n c 3 and c nh groups fig 8d 48 the xps spectrum of c 1s and n 1s before and after photocatalytic reaction remained unchanged revealing that g c3n4 was stable component of the photocatalyst therefore a tentative catalytic mechanism was put forward fig 9 with the visible light irradiation the electron hole pairs of coal ldh cn heterostructures were excited in both coal ldh and g c3n4 eq 1 49 the mobilized e could migrate instantly from the cb of coal ldh 1 14 ev to the cb of g c3n4 1 06 ev then reacted with the dissolved oxygen to produce o2 through eq 2 50 in the meantime e could react with pms to produce so4 and oh eqs 3 4 notably high active 1o2 could be yielded via reaction of oh with o2 through eq 5 51 besides the reaction of h and o2 could also produce 1o2 eq 6 52 according to the xps results co2 also participated in the pms activation for the production of so4 through eqs 7 11 in conclusion coal ldh in heterostructures activated pms to produce so4 and oh while g c3n4 acted as dual roles electron acceptor and pms activator 1 coal ldh cn hv

calculation and eco toxicity evaluation for understanding the sdz degradation pathway in the pms assisted photocatalytic system hplc esi ms ms analysis and computation based on dft calculation were carried out the possible degradation intermediates were listed in table s2 the natural population analysis charge distribution and fukin index f 0 were determined on gaussian 03 package for further clarifying the degradation pathway details on dft calculations are illustrated in text s1 results show that n1 n3 c8 c9 o1 and o2 atoms holding larger f 0 are more vulnerable to radicals attack based on the detected intermediates and fukin index fig s5 the degradation pathway of sdz is schematically proposed in fig 10 c8 and c9 atoms with the f 0 of 0 0042 on sdz could be easily attacked by oh radicals to yield hydroxylated sdz p1 m z 267 0 53 then owing to the largest f 0 0 0645 the n3 atom underwent cn bond cleavage to produce p2 m z 217 1 on the other hand n1 atom with the second highest f 0 0 0545 was oxidized by so4 directly to generate p3 m z 266 1 and p4 m z 281 1 n3 and n4 could be further attacked by so4 resulting in the ring open of the heterocyclic ring 54 later p2 would be transformed into p5 m z 173 0 and p6 m z 173 0 by cleavage of the sn bond and cn bond respectively 55 with the continuous oxidation of active species in the system ring opening of all intermediates would happen in addition ecological structure activity relationships ecosar program was implemented for the eco toxicity prediction of sdz and its degradation intermediates as we can see in fig 11 the chronic toxicities chvs for sdz to fish daphnia and green algae are 8 953 0 148 and 14 888 mg l respectively based on the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals united nations 2011 56 sdz can be classified as a highly toxic organic contaminant after the photocatalytic degradation the acute and chronic toxicities of the detected degradation intermediates to three aquatic species are less expect the chvs values of p1 p3 and p4 toward fish than the apparent compound this definitely implies that the photocatalytic degradation of sdz using coal ldh cn heterostructures is of significance for the aquatic environment safety 3 7 reusability and stability of the coal ldh cn the reusability is a key factor for long run applications of catalysts during the degradation process accordingly the reusability of multi layered coal ldh cn heterostructures was examined for four successive runs as seen in fig 12 a the decline in sdz removal was not significant following four cycles all four cycles of photocatalytic from coal ldh cn yielded degradation efficiency of 87 1 84 6 82 3 and 80 2 respectively this evidence clearly suggested the robustness of coal ldh cn for the target pollutant degradation furthermore xrd patterns was carried out to estimate the nature of the recovered catalyst no detectable difference was observed between the fresh coal ldh cn heterostructures and used one as depicted in fig 12b this verified the excellent stability of coal ldh cn heterostructures throughout the photocatalytic process 4 conclusions in summary multi layered coal ldh cn heterostructures was developed via a facile self assemble process as tested for sdz degradation under visible light the designed layer by layer coal ldh cn was a good heterogeneous catalyst with low level of metal ions leaching the robust activity of efficient charge separation led to the improved photocatalytic production of reactive species including h oh so4 o2 and 1o2 after 15 min reaction 10 μm sdz could be removed by 87 1 at the condition of 0 1 g l coal ldh cn 0 5 mm pms and ph 6 0 dft calculation suggested that the atoms with high fukin index f 0 interpret the ring hydroxylation and cn bond cleavage under reactive radicals attack the eco toxicity of sdz was alleviated during the photocatalysis based on the prediction by ecosar program overall coal ldh cn activation of pms under visible light irradiation can be a successful and promising approach to degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants effectively owing to the facile preparation of the heterostructures cogeneration of different reactive radicals and excellent recyclability and durability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14212,diclofenac dcf is an anti inflammatory drug detected in various aquatic sources and found harmful to aquatic life in spite of adopting various treatment techniques complete removal is not observed and remaining dcf can interact with other existing contaminants leading to the generation of more toxic contaminants in wastewater in the present work investigations on removal of dcf from aqueous solutions were carried out through pseudo emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion pehfsd technique with pseudo emulsion consisting of di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa as carrier n heptane as diluent and hcl as stripping phase morphological features of hollow fiber membrane module were revealed through field emission scanning electron microscopy which shows pore size and size distribution ranging from 95 nm to 120 nm energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of membrane phase before and after extraction of dcf confirms interaction

forming dcf d2ehpa complex uniform droplet sizes and size distribution of pseudo emulsion provides high interfacial contact area and higher extraction efficiency studies on permeability and investigations regarding the effect of several operational parameters such as concentration of feed phase f carrier c and stripping phase s for the extraction of dcf as well as multivariable optimization were carried out by response surface methodology using box behnken design approach 97 50 extraction of dcf was achieved with pehfsd technique at optimum conditions keywords diclofenac pseudo emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion response surface methodology box behnken design analysis of variance 1 introduction diclofenac dcf is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and is being used in the form of oral tablets or as a topical gel it decreases inflammation and relieves pain in arthritis or serious injury it undergoes biotransformation in the human body and finds its way in waste water treatment plants wwtp or in landfills in the form of dcf or its metabolites 1 it has adversely affected the vulture population due to their consumption of cattle corpses 2 dcf also affects aquatic life and shows more pronounced effects on the liver kidney and gills of fish 3 if dcf is maternally transmitted into fish eggs it can harm the eggs or embryos 4 dcf use at higher quantity 150 mg daily in longer duration treatment points to rise in risk of arterial thrombotic happenings as revealed from clinical trial and epidemiological data 5 table 1 shows the reported concentration of dcf in aquatic sources its chemical structure and physico chemical properties are presented in fig 1 and table 2 respectively elimination of dcf in wwtp is not as high by the traditional treatment processes except activated carbon adsorption technique as revealed by various studies as follows submerged membrane bioreactor 40 conventional activated sludge 75 21 activated carbon adsorption followed by ozonation 93 22 activated sludge process 25 23 and conventional biological waste water treatment 75 20 but processes like ozonation and degradation lead to undesirable and toxic by products formation molinari et al 24 investigated the removal of dcf from aqueous solution by supported liquid membrane flat sheet polypropylene microfiltration membrane and stagnant sandwich liquid membrane polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane 30 v v concentration of tributyl phosphate in n decane was selected as the optimal concentration in organic phase dcf transfer from feed to strip phase was fairly attained after 3 hours in supported liquid membrane slm as compared to only 39 of initial dcf in stripping phase after 30 hours in stagnant sandwich liquid membrane payán et al 25 also investigated the hplc determination of ibuprofen diclofenac and salicylic acid from human urine samples by hollow fiber based liquid phase microextraction hf lpme method polypropylene based hollow fiber membrane with dihexyl ether was used as the membrane phase the enrichment factors attained with hf lpme are 70 1060 and 200 for salicylic acid diclofenac and ibuprofen respectively seifollahi and rahbar kelishami 26 obtained 99 65 removal of dcf from aqueous solution through emulsion liquid membrane elm process using tetrabutylammonium bromide carrier span 80 surfactant dichloromethane diluent and sodium hydroxide solution stripping phase elm process is as an effective technique for the removal of dcf but scaling up of the process is difficult due to the instability of emulsion globule and their larger size reduces the mass transfer area amid feed phase and emulsion droplets 27 in view of this recently pseudo emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion pehfsd technique has been developed which inculcates benefits of elm by offering greater area of surface and too eliminates the stability problem associated with slm by maintaining continuous transfer of organic solution to the porous anatomy of membrane support 28 pseudo emulsion consisting of organic and stripping solution is passed through shell side and feed phase is flowed from the membrane fibers both extraction and stripping takes place immediately in a lone module of hollow fiber solute movement occurs via feed to membrane and then to stripping solution rapidly after the experiment organic and stripping solutions are separated spontaneously 29 several heavy metal ions like u vi cu ii au i zn ii 28 31 and different organic compounds such as bisphenol a nitrophenol propylparaben 32 34 are separated by pehfsd process using various extractants and stripping solutions experimental design by response surface methodology rsm optimizes the process parameters and enhances its

composite design ccd box behnken design bbd three level full factorial design and doehlert matrix 35 in the present work an effort has been made to correlate removal efficiency of dcf by pehfsd technique with membrane characteristics like hollow fiber morphology hydrophobicity of membrane pore size and size distribution composition of membrane phase droplet size distribution and turbiscan analysis of pseudo emulsion etc which has not been reported previously so the present investigation deals with the separation of dcf from aqueous streams by pehfsd system using di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa as carrier hydrochloric acid hcl as stripping solution and n heptane as diluent mass transfer coefficients and permeability of dcf were estimated while studying the effect of different parameters like carrier concentration stripping phase concentration and the ratio of membrane phase to stripping phase on the removal of dcf box behnken design had been applied for optimization of process parameters with the help of design expert version 10 0 stat ease inc minneapolis significance of each factor affecting the removal of dcf had been also studied 1 1 extraction

were prepared separately in stirred tanks as per the literature mentioned above dcf concentration in aquatic environment ranges as 2 4900 ng l so dcf content was maintained low 10 20 mg l at ph of 5 6 for investigation to prepare pseudo emulsion phase stripping phase hydrochloric acid is added to the tank having diluent n heptane and carrier d2ehpa mixture as per the table 4 both feed and pseudo emulsion phases were pumped to the tube and shell side respectively in counter current manner at 30 1 c with the help of gear pumps the flow rate of feed and pseudo emulsion phase were 300 ml min and 200 ml min respectively as per our earlier studies 34 36 the organic solution having d2ehpa immobilized the porous assembly of hollow fiber owing to its hydrophobic characteristics boundary layer was retained at the pores opening of fiber as the pressure on tube side was 2 psi higher than on shell side the retrieval of dcf from pseudo emulsion occurred as it split easily into organic and stripping

been applied for the optimization of various analytical methods including spectroanalytical chromatographic capillary electrophoresis electronalytical etc 3 results and discussions 3 1 surface morphology and pore size distribution of hollow fiber membrane pseudo emulsion phase flows through the shell side outer cell of module feed phase containing dcf passes through several thin microporous bundle of hollow fibers tube side arranged in a well ordered manner fig 3 a presents the fesem image of these microporous hollow fibers made of polymeric materials pp pe and used for the extraction of dcf image 3b presents the enlarged view x 50 of the hollow fibers in which its outer diameter is 300 μm fig 3c shows the magnified view x 50000 of image b and confirms the porosity of hollow fibers used for the extraction of dcf fig 3d shows pore size and size distribution ranging from 95 nm to 120 nm membrane phase is immobilized into these micropores and helps to transport dcf d2ehpa complex high surface area 1 4 m2 provided by these micropores plays a pivotal role for the removal of dcf from feed phase and improves the separation efficiency 3 2 contact angle studies of hollow fiber surface in order to understand the stability of membrane phase on hollow fiber microporous surface contact angle studies were carried out surfaces with contact angle of water less than 90 are hydrophilic while greater than 90 are hydrophobic 40 it also quantifies the wettability of a solid surface by a liquid the water droplet was allowed to fall through hamilton 500 μl syringe at a dosing rate of 0 5 μl s on the fiber surface to measure static contact angle fig 4 a shows the contact angle of 114 5 for the fiber without any contact of n heptane membrane phase after immobilization of n heptane into the micropores contact angle increased to 119 2 fig 4b which confirms increase in the hydrophobicity of fiber surface rise in the hydrophobicity prevents penetration of water from feed phase through micropores and maintains the stability of membrane phase due to the strong capillary force membrane phase retains within the micropores of the hollow fiber and helps to diffuse dcf forming dcf d2ehpa complex 3 3 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx of hollow fiber surface the edx spectra of hollow fiber membrane surface before and after extraction of dcf are represented in fig 5 in fig 5a peaks of elements like oxygen o phosphorous p confirms that after impregnation of membrane phase n heptane with d2ehpa in the micropores of hollow fiber it retains within the pores and membrane phase is quite stable against the possible solvent action of stripping phase image 5b shows the presence of elements like chlorine cl phosphorous p sodium na oxygen o which confirms d2ehpa dcf complex being formed at feed membrane phase interface which helps to transfer dcf this also confirms that even after extraction trace amount of dcf is trapped in the membrane phase 3 4 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy of membrane phase ftir spectra of membrane phase n heptane with d2ehpa before and after extraction of dcf are presented in fig 6 presence of d2ehpa is confirmed from ch3 bending peaks at 1450 cm 1 and 1375 cm 1 with hydrogen bonded oh broad peak between 3400 3200 cm 1 stretching vibrational band of po and po at 1176 cm 1 and 731 cm 1 respectively as soon as dcf is contacted with the membrane phase dcf is extracted from the feed phase due to complex formation amid d2ehpa and dcf by reversible reaction at membrane feed phase interface which eventually helps to transfer dcf this complex is created due to the binding of positively charged carrier with carboxylic group of dcf due to complex formation shift in the characteristic ir vibrational bands of ftir spectra takes place between 1650 500 cm 1 which are shown as follows nh bending peaks between 1640 1550 cm 1 cc aromatic peak at 1600 and 1475 cm 1 ccl stretching 730 550 cm 1 coo na symmetric strong stretching near 1400 cm 1 41 this confirms the presence and interaction of dcf with d2ehpa resulting in the formation of complex the complex diffuses through membrane phase to membrane stripping phase interface dissociating discharging the dcf molecules to stripping phase and instantaneously renewing d2ehpa which diffuses back to membrane feed phase interface 3 5 droplets size and size distribution of pseudo emulsion smaller droplets of internal stripping phase of pseudo emulsion increases the mass transfer rate of dcf from membrane pseudo emulsion phase interface to stripping phase hcl and improves the removal efficiency chakraborty and bart 42 found that the dispersed drop sizes as well as internal droplets sizes define the interfacial contact area and are important in determining the efficiency of extraction to study the droplets size and size distribution of pseudo emulsion oil and stripping phase 1 1 were properly stirred at 600 rpm and the droplets were then immediately viewed on an inverted microscope with a high resolution digital camera fig 7 a shows image of the droplets being formed here pseudo emulsion forms due to stirring of oil n heptane d2ehpa and water hcl wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the external phase droplets number and diameter were determined by analysing the fig 7a using the imagej 1 52a processing program size distribution of these droplets is represented in fig 7b inset where the majority of droplet diameter varies from 35 to 200 μm coalescence occurs when droplets collides with each other and forms larger droplet so the average droplet size increases within short time span 3 6 turbiscan analysis of pseudo emulsion feed phase containing dcf flows through the membrane fibers and pseudo emulsion phase passes through the shell side outer cell of module counter currently pseudo emulsion comprises of membrane phase n heptane and d2ehpa and stripping phase hcl which is basically a primary emulsion dcf is extracted by the carrier and stripped by the stripping solution present in the pseudo emulsion pseudo emulsion phase plays an important role to recover dcf as dcf will be in concentrated form inside the stripping phase pseudo emulsion coming out from the shell side of the module was scanned using turbiscan from the lower end 0 mm to the top end 60 mm of the vial for 5 minutes top part above 50 mm of the emulsion sample has shown some changes probably due to the release of bubbles backscattering profile of the pseudo emulsion is elucidated in fig 8 b higher backscattering of light for emulsion occurs due to increase in population density of droplets which too leads to flocculation and coalescences of an emulsion 27 43 rudin and wasan 44 reported that primary emulsions are not stable and it separates into two phases this is clearly visible from fig 8a where oil and aqueous phase separates within fraction of time and concentrated dcf is recovered from stripping phase the turbiscan result too concludes the instability of pseudo emulsion moreover it was also reported that the primary emulsions have diameter more than 1 μm this is evident from fig 7 where the majority of droplets diameter varies from 35 to 200 μm so this proves that the pseudo emulsion is unstable raatz and klapper 45 observed that only monomer and anioninc form reduces interfacial tension in our system extractant d2ehpa exists as the dimer in aliphatic solvent like n heptane membrane phase which is not interfacially active so pseudo emulsion is unstable and at the end of the operation concentrated dcf can be easily recovered from stripping phase 3 7 influence of various factors on diclofenac dcf removal through pehfsd system 3 7 1 influence of carrier concentration fig 9 presents the effect of different concentration of d2ehpa on dcf extraction 97 50 removal of dcf was observed with 1 w v d2ehpa within 20 minutes of the experiment extraction was found to be 91 59 and 93 22 at 0 25 w v and 0 5 w v d2ehpa respectively at higher concentration of d2ehpa i e 2 w v extraction decreased to 83 59 and this might be due to increase in viscosity of the membrane phase which leads to slower rate of diffusion of the species gupta et al 36 too witnessed reduction in extraction rate of mercury through pehfsd system beyond the d2ehpa concentration of 5 5 w v due to rise in viscosity at higher concentration of carrier which in turn slows down the diffusivity of the complex in the membrane phase recently pirom et al 46 too investigated the recovery of yttrium iii with d2ehpa by pehfsd system 99 97 extraction of yttrium iii from the feed phase having initial concentration of 1 mm yttrium iii was achieved with 0 1 m d2ehpa 3 m nitric acid stripping agent and kerosene as the diluent from the graph of vfln c0 cf vs time fig 9 with eq 6 permeabillity is evaluated it is found that with rise in d2ehpa concentration from 0 25 w v to 1 w v permeability increases from 0 041 cm min to 0 216 cm min fig 9 inset 3 7 2 influence of stripping phase concentration it is found from fig 10 that rise in the concentration of hcl from 0 01 to 0 05 n increased the extraction of dcf from 93 04 to 94 52 respectively further rise to 0 1 n hcl provided 97 50 removal of dcf but at 0 2 n hcl removal efficiency of dcf decreased to 89 04 as higher acidity retards the rate of decomplexation at membrane stripping phase interface permeabilities fig 10 inset were estimated by using eq 6 from the plot of vfln c0 cf vs time rise in permeability from 0 055 cm min to 0 216 cm min were observed with increase in hcl concentration from 0 01 n to 0 1 n respectively 3 7 3 influence of volume ratio of membrane phase to stripping phase volume ratio vr of membrane phase to stripping phase in pseudo emulsion solution was varied from 0 5 to 2 maintaining the volume ratio of feed phase to pseudo emulsion at 2 5 for extraction of solute using pseudo emulsion liquid membrane the dispersed drop sizes size distribution uniform dispersion stability of the droplets and interfacial contact area are important in determining the efficiency of extraction breakup and coalescence of dispersed droplets also plays an important role 47 smaller vr 0 5 reduces the probability of stripping phase dispersion in membrane phase and also increases the probability of coalescence with increasing vr 1 droplets of strip solution disperses properly in the membrane phase which results in uniformly distributed stable emulsion droplets and eventually increases the chance of interaction of complex with the stripping phase at higher vr 2 droplets are far apart from each other so the probability of coalescence decreases but at the same time interfacial contact area decreases which results in lower extraction maximum extraction efficiency obtained was 97 50 at vr 1 as compared to 81 53 and 90 70 at vr of 0 5 and 2 respectively fig 11 highest value of permeability calculated at vr 1 was 0 216 cm min fig 11 inset 3 8 evaluation of mass transfer and diffusion coefficients mass transfer coefficients for internal aqueous boundary layer ki membrane phase km and diffusion coefficient dm were calculated using eqs 11 13 the calculated values were 7 85 10 7 m s for ki 3 33 10 6 m s for km and 1 10 9 m2 s for dm this showed that mass transfer coefficient for membrane phase km was found to be more than internal aqueous boundary layer ki the overall resistance 1 pdcf as evaluated experimentally from eq 6 and theoretically using eq 10 at optimum conditions 20 mg l dcf 1 w v d2ehpa 0 1 n hcl were 0 28 105 s m and 13 18 105 s m respectively fractional mass transfer resistances due to feed ri and membrane phase rm are given as 36 16 r i r i r i r m x 100 17 r m r m r i r m x 100 ri and rm are calculated from the subsequent eqs 18 19 and then the values are replaced in eqs 16 and 17 to attain fractional resistances 18 r i 1 k i 19 r m r i r l m 1 d d c f k m the values of ri and rm were calculated as 96 65 and 3 35 respectively this revealed that the rate controlling step was the diffusion of dcf in aqueous feed solution 3 9 design of experiments design of experiments refers to the matrix comprising of definite set of experiments prepared by the diverse levels arrangements for the variables under study and experiments must be performed accordingly to obtain responses for the system 35 factors like feed f carrier c and stripping phase s concentration were identified to have effect on dcf removal depending on the experiments conducted preliminary by pehfsd technique so further experiments were performed based on box behnken design these factors along with their numerical values are presented in table 5 taking these factors into consideration with three levels box behnken design matrix for different experiments by design expert 10 0 6 was executed and is presented in table 6 these experiments were then successively performed for obtaining the responses extraction extraction of diclofenac by pehfsd technique was performed at different time intervals and maximum extraction obtained within 20 minutes is reported diclofenac extraction efficiency was almost good in each run the comprehensive model regression equation for the extraction of dcf depending on the factors such as f c and s by design expert for bbd is given by eq 20 as 20 e x t r a c t i o n 101 37892 5 57325 f 35 21704 c 109 20679 s 0 27067 f c 4 13333 f s 161 92593 c s 0 19720 f 2 17 15556 c 2 32 09877 s 2 in eq 20 f c and s signifies feed carrier and stripping phase concentration respectively for run 1 having factors values as f 20 c 0 625 and s 0 1 extraction predicted from eq 20 is estimated as 96 23 similarly for other runs with different values of factors f c and s predicted values are estimated and are shown in table 6 along with experimental and residual values fig 12 represents the plot of predicted values of dcf extraction versus the values of dcf extraction obtained through experiments almost all the points of predicted and experimental responses are closed to the 45 line representing the higher precision r2 0 9172 as predicted by the model this also proves that the established model effectively seizes the correlation among factors and response 3 10 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova analysed the experimental data to statistically understand the significance of each factor table 7 presents the anova results for dcf extraction from aqueous feed phase using pehfsd technique the f value for model is 6 16 which confirm its significance model terms having p value less than 0 0500 shows significance and so a b c a2 are significant terms the lack of fit f value of 1 22 suggests that it is not significant comparative to pure error non significant lack of fit is good and model should fit the value of r2 for response surface quadratic model is 0 9172 which means that 91 72 of the total variations in response was described by the model the adjusted r2 value of 0 7682 shows high significance of the model adeq precision gives the signal to noise ratio and value greater than 4 is needed ratio of 10 642 specifies an adequate signal and so this model can be used for optimization navigating the design space 3 11 response 3d surface and contour plots for dcf extraction 3d surface and contour plots for dcf extraction are presented in fig 13 which shows the interaction amid the concentration for factors like feed dcf carrier d2ehpa and stripping phase hcl from fig 13 the finest optimum values for maximum extraction of dcf lies in the range as follows concentration of feed dcf 18 20 mg l concentration of carrier d2ehpa 0 7 to 1 w v and concentration of stripping phase hcl 0 07 to 0 1 n all these values also appropriately corresponds to our initial investigation on dcf separation from feed phase design of experiment optimised the value for all three factors 100 various optimum solutions predicting the extraction of dcf were obtained through the design expert one of the optimum solution predicting the highest extraction of 96 23 as predicted by the regression equation using rsm was selected the conditions for this particular solution and optimised experimental conditions are represented in table 8 extraction of dcf at experimentally optimized conditions was 97 50 which was in good agreement with that predicted 96 23 value so this model can be effectively used for evaluating the extraction of dcf from aqueous streams by pehfsd technique 4 conclusions diclofenac extraction from aqueous streams by pseudo emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion process was carried out the influences of hollow fiber membrane morphology membrane phase pseudo emulsion phase characteristics and various operating parameters like extractant concentration stripping phase concentration and volume ratio of membrane to stripping solution on the extraction of dcf were studied it is observed that other than the operating parameters membrane characteristics are also having the pronounced effect on dcf extraction maximum extraction of 97 50 was observed for 20 mg l dcf 1 w v d2ehpa and 0 1 n hcl concentration with volume ratio of membrane phase to stripping phase in pseudo emulsion solution as 1 mass transfer coefficients for internal aqueous boundary layer ki membrane phase km and diffusion coefficient dm were found to be 7 85 10 7 m s 3 33 10 6 m s and 1 10 9 m2 s respectively box behnken design was applied for parameters optimization for the effective separation of dcf experimental and predicted values were in good agreement with each other which establishes the effectiveness of the developed model 
14212,diclofenac dcf is an anti inflammatory drug detected in various aquatic sources and found harmful to aquatic life in spite of adopting various treatment techniques complete removal is not observed and remaining dcf can interact with other existing contaminants leading to the generation of more toxic contaminants in wastewater in the present work investigations on removal of dcf from aqueous solutions were carried out through pseudo emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion pehfsd technique with pseudo emulsion consisting of di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa as carrier n heptane as diluent and hcl as stripping phase morphological features of hollow fiber membrane module were revealed through field emission scanning electron microscopy which shows pore size and size distribution ranging from 95 nm to 120 nm energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of membrane phase before and after extraction of dcf confirms interaction

pseudo emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion response surface methodology box behnken design analysis of variance 1 introduction diclofenac dcf is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and is being used in the form of oral tablets or as a topical gel it decreases inflammation and relieves pain in arthritis or serious injury it undergoes biotransformation in the human body and finds its way in waste water treatment plants wwtp or in landfills in the form of dcf or its metabolites 1 it has adversely affected the vulture population due to their consumption of cattle corpses 2 dcf also affects aquatic life and shows more pronounced effects on the liver kidney and gills of fish 3 if dcf is maternally transmitted into fish eggs it can harm the eggs or embryos 4 dcf use at higher quantity 150 mg daily in longer duration treatment points to rise in risk of arterial thrombotic happenings as revealed from clinical trial and epidemiological data 5 table 1 shows the reported concentration of dcf in aquatic sources its chemical structure and physico chemical properties are presented in fig 1 and table 2 respectively elimination of dcf in wwtp is not as high by the traditional treatment processes except activated carbon adsorption technique as revealed by various studies as follows submerged membrane bioreactor 40 conventional activated sludge 75 21 activated carbon adsorption followed by ozonation 93 22 activated sludge process 25 23 and conventional biological waste water treatment 75 20 but processes like ozonation and degradation lead to undesirable and toxic by products formation molinari et al 24 investigated the removal of dcf from aqueous solution by supported liquid membrane flat sheet polypropylene microfiltration membrane and stagnant sandwich liquid membrane polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane 30 v v concentration of tributyl phosphate in n decane was selected as the optimal concentration in organic phase dcf transfer from

respectively seifollahi and rahbar kelishami 26 obtained 99 65 removal of dcf from aqueous solution through emulsion liquid membrane elm process using tetrabutylammonium bromide carrier span 80 surfactant dichloromethane diluent and sodium hydroxide solution stripping phase elm process is as an effective technique for the removal of dcf but scaling up of the process is difficult due to the instability of emulsion globule and their larger size reduces the mass transfer area amid feed phase and emulsion droplets 27 in view of this recently pseudo emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion pehfsd technique has been developed which inculcates benefits of elm by offering greater area of surface and too eliminates the stability problem associated with slm by maintaining continuous transfer of organic solution to the porous anatomy of membrane support 28 pseudo emulsion consisting of organic and stripping solution is passed through shell side and feed phase is flowed from the membrane fibers both extraction and stripping takes place immediately in a lone module of hollow fiber solute movement occurs via feed to membrane and then to stripping solution rapidly after the experiment

morphology and pore size distribution of hollow fiber membrane pseudo emulsion phase flows through the shell side outer cell of module feed phase containing dcf passes through several thin microporous bundle of hollow fibers tube side arranged in a well ordered manner fig 3 a presents the fesem image of these microporous hollow fibers made of polymeric materials pp pe and used for the extraction of dcf image 3b presents the enlarged view x 50 of the hollow fibers in which its outer diameter is 300 μm fig 3c shows the magnified view x 50000 of image b and confirms the porosity of hollow fibers used for the extraction of dcf fig 3d shows pore size and size distribution ranging from 95 nm to 120 nm membrane phase is immobilized into these micropores and helps to transport dcf d2ehpa complex high surface area 1 4 m2 provided by these micropores plays a pivotal role for the removal of dcf from feed phase and improves the separation efficiency 3 2 contact angle studies of hollow fiber surface in order to understand the stability of membrane phase on hollow fiber microporous surface contact angle studies were carried out surfaces with contact angle of water less than 90 are hydrophilic while greater than 90 are hydrophobic 40 it also quantifies the wettability of a solid surface by a liquid the water droplet was allowed to fall through hamilton 500 μl syringe at a dosing rate of 0 5 μl s on the fiber surface to measure static contact angle fig 4 a shows the contact angle of 114 5 for the fiber without any contact of n heptane membrane phase after immobilization of n heptane into the micropores contact angle increased to 119 2 fig 4b which confirms increase in the hydrophobicity of fiber surface rise in the hydrophobicity prevents penetration of water from feed phase through micropores and maintains the stability of membrane phase due to the strong capillary force membrane phase retains within the micropores of the hollow fiber and helps to diffuse dcf forming dcf d2ehpa complex 3 3 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx of hollow fiber surface the edx spectra of hollow fiber membrane surface before and after extraction of dcf are represented in fig 5 in fig 5a peaks of elements like oxygen o phosphorous p confirms that after impregnation of membrane phase n heptane with d2ehpa in the micropores of hollow fiber it retains within the pores and membrane phase is quite stable against the possible solvent action of stripping phase image 5b shows the presence of elements like chlorine cl phosphorous p sodium na oxygen o which confirms d2ehpa dcf complex being formed at feed membrane phase interface which helps to transfer dcf this also confirms that even after extraction trace amount of dcf is trapped in the membrane phase 3 4 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy of membrane phase ftir spectra of membrane phase n heptane with d2ehpa before and after extraction of dcf are presented in fig 6 presence of d2ehpa is confirmed from ch3 bending peaks at 1450 cm 1 and 1375 cm 1 with hydrogen bonded oh broad peak between 3400 3200 cm 1 stretching vibrational band of po and po at 1176 cm 1 and 731 cm 1 respectively as soon as dcf is contacted with the membrane phase dcf is extracted from the feed phase due to complex formation amid d2ehpa and dcf by reversible reaction at membrane feed phase interface which eventually helps to transfer dcf this complex is created due to the binding of positively charged carrier with carboxylic group of dcf due to complex formation shift in the characteristic ir vibrational bands of ftir spectra takes place between 1650 500 cm 1 which are shown as follows nh bending peaks between 1640 1550 cm 1 cc aromatic peak at 1600 and 1475 cm 1 ccl stretching 730 550 cm 1 coo na symmetric strong stretching near 1400 cm 1 41 this confirms the presence and interaction of dcf with d2ehpa resulting in the formation of complex the complex diffuses through membrane phase to membrane stripping phase interface dissociating discharging the dcf molecules to stripping phase and instantaneously renewing d2ehpa which diffuses back to membrane feed phase interface 3 5 droplets size and size distribution of pseudo emulsion smaller droplets of internal stripping phase of pseudo emulsion increases the mass transfer rate of dcf from membrane pseudo emulsion phase interface to stripping phase hcl and improves the removal efficiency chakraborty and bart 42 found that the dispersed drop sizes as well as internal droplets sizes define the interfacial contact area and are important in determining the efficiency of extraction to study the droplets size and size distribution of pseudo emulsion oil and stripping phase 1 1 were properly stirred at 600 rpm and the droplets were then immediately viewed on an inverted microscope with a high resolution digital camera fig 7 a shows image of the droplets being formed here pseudo emulsion forms due to stirring of oil n heptane d2ehpa and water hcl wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the external phase droplets number and diameter were determined by analysing the fig 7a using the imagej 1 52a processing program size distribution of these droplets is represented in fig 7b inset where the majority of droplet diameter varies from 35 to 200 μm coalescence occurs when droplets collides with each other and forms larger droplet so the average droplet size increases within short time span 3 6 turbiscan analysis of pseudo emulsion feed phase containing dcf flows through the membrane fibers and pseudo emulsion phase passes through the shell side outer cell of module counter currently pseudo emulsion comprises of membrane phase n heptane and d2ehpa and stripping phase hcl which is basically a primary emulsion dcf is extracted by the carrier and stripped by the stripping solution present in the pseudo emulsion pseudo emulsion phase plays an important role to recover dcf as dcf will be in concentrated form inside the stripping phase pseudo emulsion coming out from the shell side of the module was scanned using turbiscan from the lower end 0 mm to the top end 60 mm of the vial for 5 minutes top part above 50 mm of the emulsion sample has shown some changes probably due to the release of bubbles backscattering profile of the pseudo emulsion is elucidated in fig 8 b higher backscattering of light for emulsion occurs due to increase in population density of droplets which too leads to flocculation and coalescences of an emulsion 27 43 rudin and wasan 44 reported that primary emulsions are not stable and it separates into two phases this is clearly visible from fig 8a where oil and aqueous phase separates within fraction of time and concentrated dcf is recovered from stripping phase the turbiscan result too concludes the instability of pseudo emulsion moreover it was also reported that the primary emulsions have diameter more than 1 μm this is evident from fig 7 where the majority of droplets diameter varies from 35 to 200 μm so this proves that the pseudo emulsion is unstable raatz and klapper 45 observed that only monomer and anioninc form reduces interfacial tension in our system extractant d2ehpa exists as the dimer in aliphatic solvent like n heptane membrane phase which is not interfacially active so pseudo emulsion is unstable and at the end of the operation concentrated dcf can be easily recovered from stripping phase 3 7 influence of various factors on diclofenac dcf removal through pehfsd system 3 7 1 influence of carrier concentration fig 9 presents the effect of different concentration of d2ehpa on dcf extraction 97 50 removal of dcf was observed with 1 w v d2ehpa within 20 minutes of the experiment extraction was found to be 91 59 and 93 22 at 0 25 w v and 0 5 w v d2ehpa respectively at higher concentration of d2ehpa i e 2 w v extraction decreased to 83 59 and this might be due to increase in viscosity of the membrane phase which leads to slower rate of diffusion of the species gupta et al 36 too witnessed reduction in extraction rate of mercury through pehfsd system beyond the d2ehpa concentration of 5 5 w v due to rise in viscosity at higher concentration of carrier which in turn slows down the diffusivity of the complex in the membrane phase recently pirom et al 46 too investigated the recovery of yttrium iii with d2ehpa by pehfsd system 99 97 extraction of yttrium iii from the feed phase having initial concentration of 1 mm yttrium iii was achieved with 0 1 m d2ehpa 3 m nitric acid stripping agent and kerosene as the diluent from the graph of vfln c0 cf vs time fig 9 with eq 6 permeabillity is evaluated it is found that with rise in d2ehpa concentration from 0 25 w v to 1 w v permeability increases from 0 041 cm min to 0 216 cm min fig 9 inset 3 7 2 influence of stripping phase concentration it is found from fig 10 that rise in the concentration of hcl from 0 01 to 0 05 n increased the extraction of dcf from 93 04 to 94 52 respectively further rise to 0 1 n hcl provided 97 50 removal of dcf but at 0 2 n hcl removal efficiency of dcf decreased to 89 04 as higher acidity retards the rate of decomplexation at membrane stripping phase interface permeabilities fig 10 inset were estimated by using eq 6 from the plot of vfln c0 cf vs time rise in permeability from 0 055 cm min to 0 216 cm min were observed with increase in hcl concentration from 0 01 n to 0 1 n respectively 3 7 3 influence of volume ratio of membrane phase to stripping phase volume ratio vr of membrane phase to stripping phase in pseudo emulsion solution was varied from 0 5 to 2 maintaining the volume ratio of feed phase to pseudo emulsion at 2 5 for extraction of solute using pseudo emulsion liquid membrane the dispersed drop sizes size distribution uniform dispersion stability of the droplets and interfacial contact area are important in determining the efficiency of extraction breakup and coalescence of dispersed droplets also plays an important role 47 smaller vr 0 5 reduces the probability of stripping phase dispersion in membrane phase and also increases the probability of coalescence with increasing vr 1 droplets of strip solution disperses properly in the membrane phase which results in uniformly distributed stable emulsion droplets and eventually increases the chance of interaction of complex with the stripping phase at higher vr 2 droplets are far apart from each other so the probability of coalescence decreases but at the same time interfacial contact area decreases which results in lower extraction maximum extraction efficiency obtained was 97 50 at vr 1 as compared to 81 53 and 90 70 at vr of 0 5 and 2 respectively fig 11 highest value of permeability calculated at vr 1 was 0 216 cm min fig 11 inset 3 8 evaluation of mass transfer and diffusion coefficients mass transfer coefficients for internal aqueous boundary layer ki membrane phase km and diffusion coefficient dm were calculated using eqs 11 13 the calculated values were 7 85 10 7 m s for ki 3 33 10 6 m s for km and 1 10 9 m2 s for dm this showed that mass transfer coefficient for membrane phase km was found to be more than internal aqueous boundary layer ki the overall resistance 1 pdcf as evaluated experimentally from eq 6 and theoretically using eq 10 at optimum conditions 20 mg l dcf 1 w v d2ehpa 0 1 n hcl were 0 28 105 s m and 13 18 105 s m respectively fractional mass transfer resistances due to feed ri and membrane phase rm are given as 36 16 r i r i r i r m x 100 17 r m r m r i r m x 100 ri and rm are calculated from the subsequent eqs 18 19 and then the values are replaced in eqs 16 and 17 to attain fractional resistances 18 r i 1 k i 19 r m r i r l m 1 d d c f k m the values of ri and rm were calculated as 96 65 and 3 35 respectively this revealed that the rate controlling step was the diffusion of dcf in aqueous feed solution 3 9 design of experiments design of experiments refers to the matrix comprising of definite set of experiments prepared by the diverse levels arrangements for the variables under study and experiments must be performed accordingly to obtain responses for the system 35 factors like feed f carrier c and stripping phase s concentration were identified to have effect on dcf removal depending on the experiments conducted preliminary by pehfsd technique so further experiments were performed based on box behnken design these factors along with their numerical values are presented in table 5 taking these factors into consideration with three levels box behnken design matrix for different experiments by design expert 10 0 6 was executed and is presented in table 6 these experiments were then successively performed for obtaining the responses extraction extraction of diclofenac by pehfsd technique was performed at different time intervals and maximum extraction obtained within 20 minutes is reported diclofenac extraction efficiency was almost good in each run the comprehensive model regression equation for the extraction of dcf depending on the factors such as f c and s by design expert for bbd is given by eq 20 as 20 e x t r a c t i o n 101 37892 5 57325 f 35 21704 c 109 20679 s 0 27067 f c 4 13333 f s 161 92593 c s 0 19720 f 2 17 15556 c 2 32 09877 s 2 in eq 20 f c and s signifies feed carrier and stripping phase concentration respectively for run 1 having factors values as f 20 c 0 625 and s 0 1 extraction predicted from eq 20 is estimated as 96 23 similarly for other runs with different values of factors f c and s predicted values are estimated and are shown in table 6 along with experimental and residual values fig 12 represents the plot of predicted values of dcf extraction versus the values of dcf extraction obtained through experiments almost all the points of predicted and experimental responses are closed to the 45 line representing the higher precision r2 0 9172 as predicted by the model this also proves that the established model effectively seizes the correlation among factors and response 3 10 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova analysed the experimental data to statistically understand the significance of each factor table 7 presents the anova results for dcf extraction from aqueous feed phase using pehfsd technique the f value for model is 6 16 which confirm its significance model terms having p value less than 0 0500 shows significance and so a b c a2 are significant terms the lack of fit f value of 1 22 suggests that it is not significant comparative to pure error non significant lack of fit is good and model should fit the value of r2 for response surface quadratic model is 0 9172 which means that 91 72 of the total variations in response was described by the model the adjusted r2 value of 0 7682 shows high significance of the model adeq precision gives the signal to noise ratio and value greater than 4 is needed ratio of 10 642 specifies an adequate signal and so this model can be used for optimization navigating the design space 3 11 response 3d surface and contour plots for dcf extraction 3d surface and contour plots for dcf extraction are presented in fig 13 which shows the interaction amid the concentration for factors like feed dcf carrier d2ehpa and stripping phase hcl from fig 13 the finest optimum values for maximum extraction of dcf lies in the range as follows concentration of feed dcf 18 20 mg l concentration of carrier d2ehpa 0 7 to 1 w v and concentration of stripping phase hcl 0 07 to 0 1 n all these values also appropriately corresponds to our initial investigation on dcf separation from feed phase design of experiment optimised the value for all three factors 100 various optimum solutions predicting the extraction of dcf were obtained through the design expert one of the optimum solution predicting the highest extraction of 96 23 as predicted by the regression equation using rsm was selected the conditions for this particular solution and optimised experimental conditions are represented in table 8 extraction of dcf at experimentally optimized conditions was 97 50 which was in good agreement with that predicted 96 23 value so this model can be effectively used for evaluating the extraction of dcf from aqueous streams by pehfsd technique 4 conclusions diclofenac extraction from aqueous streams by pseudo emulsion hollow fiber strip dispersion process was carried out the influences of hollow fiber membrane morphology membrane phase pseudo emulsion phase characteristics and various operating parameters like extractant concentration stripping phase concentration and volume ratio of membrane to stripping solution on the extraction of dcf were studied it is observed that other than the operating parameters membrane characteristics are also having the pronounced effect on dcf extraction maximum extraction of 97 50 was observed for 20 mg l dcf 1 w v d2ehpa and 0 1 n hcl concentration with volume ratio of membrane phase to stripping phase in pseudo emulsion solution as 1 mass transfer coefficients for internal aqueous boundary layer ki membrane phase km and diffusion coefficient dm were found to be 7 85 10 7 m s 3 33 10 6 m s and 1 10 9 m2 s respectively box behnken design was applied for parameters optimization for the effective separation of dcf experimental and predicted values were in good agreement with each other which establishes the effectiveness of the developed model 
14213,the rwqi raw water quality index was developed in compliance with deterministic models in order to assess the treatability of natural waters for human consumption by means of conventional process basing on the similar procedure of the well known water quality index developed by the national sanitation foundation wqinsf the rwqi however seemed to require further adjustments regarding mainly rating criteria in order to find a non deterministic model that would allow handling uncertainties the non linearity of the parameters and the knowledge of the specialists the fuzzy logic was used in new approach to the rwqi in this context the new index named raw water quality index fuzzy rwqif was applied to data set of 24 water sources in brazil evaluating the correlations with the rwqi the wqicetesb treated water turbidity and coagulant dose the inverse correlation between the rwqif with coagulant dose and treated water turbidity was obtained however the low intensity of these correlations indicated that there are other intervening factors in this relation finally this research points out the rwqif as a suitable support decision making tool that allows managers to prioritize watershed protection actions in short medium and long term aiming at minimizing the water treatment costs and improving the treated water quality keywords surface water quality raw water quality index fuzzy logic water treatment 1 introduction and relevance 1 1 water quality indexes information about raw water quality is essential to define the adequate process to treat natural water for human consumption as well as to assess the plant s performance when water sources are monitored for environmental purposes it is common practice to use numerical indexes to show the water quality in specific points of water bodies in this context the first formal presentation of a water quality index wqi was developed by horton in 1965 later a similar wqi based on a survey supported by the national sanitation foundation nsf was proposed known as the wqinsf 1 the delphi method was employed based on the insights of 142 experts to define the parameters of interest weights were assigned to each parameter the nine selected parameters and their respective weights composed the index namely dissolved oxygen do 17 faecal thermotolerant coliforms 15 ph 12 biological oxygen demand bod 10 total phosphate 10 nitrate 10 temperature 10 turbidity 8 and total solids 8 finally nine curves were later developed to represent the variations in the water quality produced by the several measures of each parameter according to noori et al 2 the wqinsf has changed over the time substitution of the parameter total solids by total dissolved solids or total suspended solids total phosphate by orthophosphate faecal coliforms by e coli has been affecting the obtained results considering that environmental issues require monitoring and analysis of several parameters simultaneously adaptations of the wqinsf with the insertion of other water quality parameters have been made 3 5 in this scenario the environmental company of the state of são paulo brazil cetesb adapted the wqinsf named wqicetesb expressing in the product form and replacing nitrate by total nitrogen and total phosphate by total phosphorus 6 in order to deal with uncertainties and non linearity of environmental parameters statistical techniques such as regression 7 principal component analysis 8 fuzzy logic 9 11 neural networks 12 and neuro fuzzy 13 were used to determine the more suitable parameters or even the development of a new index in the majority of these studies the comparison with the wqinsf and its variations was carried out it was observed that the indexes presented the same tendency of response but those developed with artificial intelligence technique were more rigorous presenting lower values table 1 presents a summary of these studies notwithstanding its use in several countries worldwide as an indicator of environmental health in water bodies the wqinsf just like any other index has its limitations a clear overlap of certain parameters that provide similar information is evident such as do and bod turbidity and total solids and frequently also faecal coliforms or e coli and bod furthermore the wqinsf comprises a very limited number of biological and physiochemical parameters 15 in other context the wqinsf is not suitable to evaluate the treatability of a surface water due to the absence of some important parameters such as algae cyanobacteria blue green algae total organic carbon iron and manganese in addition some relevant environmental water quality parameters such as bod and dissolved oxygen whose respond for 27 of the wqinsf are almost useless to evaluate the treatability of the majority of surface water sources this assertive is corroborated by the vast majority of water sources presents low bod and high do almost always close to the saturation in this way with exception of some high polluted water sources the wqinsf would present high values and this fact makes more fragile the objective of comparing distinct surface waters in terms of treatability for human consumption 1 2 raw water quality indexes focusing on water treatability the raw water quality index rwqi was developed using the delphi method with a board composed of 24 specialists in water treatment employing as reference odourless and tasteless water with pesticides and trace metals heavy metals virtually absent this board defined the eight more relevant water quality parameters in terms of treatability by means of conventional water treatment process which comprises coagulation flocculation sedimentation or dissolved air flotation filtration and disinfection steps a weight for each water quality parameter was established in a similar way of the wqinsf 16 according to gharibi et al 10 the fuzzy logic is appropriate to environmental systems since it has the capacity to reflect human thinking dealing with non linear information which has a degree of subjectivity and with quantitative and qualitative information in this context following the trend of using the artificial intelligence technique oliveira et al 17 developed the rwqi using the fuzzy logic thus the interest variables were separated into three subindexes the fuzzy biological the fuzzy physical and the fuzzy chemical which in turn composed the raw water quality index fuzzy rwqif 1 3 the influence of raw water quality in water treatment water treatment plants aim to remove harmful pollutants and pathogens from the raw water making it safe for human consumption for this proposal it is fundamental the continuous monitoring of the plant performance based on treated water quality only it involves a large number of variables thus becoming a complex problem using a multicriteria analysis nawazi and ali 18 defined the eight most significant factors on plant performance evaluation such as pipeline length treatment time climatic conditions equipment and operator efficiency chemical dosage treatment process and raw water quality choudhury and saha 19 used these eight variables to compose a water treatment plant performance index the score used in the index was defined based on literature review and feedback from engineers and consumers on the importance of each parameter for the good plant performance as well as the risk associated with each of them to produce safe water this study highlights four main parameters responsible for the good plant performance operator efficiency treatment process raw water quality and coagulant dosage several researches have indicated the existence of a strong correlation between the actions focused on the watershed protection and the expenses with the chemical products employed in the water treatment and even with the treated water quality 20 the preservation of the natural vegetation of the watershed from anthropic actions minimizes the effects of erosion and the transport of sediments to the water source reducing the concentration of particles and microorganisms to the water treatment plant this statement was corroborated by a research carried out with 40 water supply systems in usa the main conclusion emphasized that an increase of 10 in preserved or reforested area will result in approximately reduction of 20 in the cost of chemicals products at water treatment plant 21 in a similar point of view postel and thompson 22 reported that several cities such as boston new york and seattle have avoided investments at their treatment plants by river basin protection through municipal or private investment garcia 23 also mentioned the example of the catskill delaware watershed that supplies 90 of new york in which the city agreed to spend us 1 5 billion on water source protection instead of us 5 billions on implementation of new water treatment processes islan et al 24 state that the protection of the water source is associated with the implementation of multiple barriers in the production of high quality drinking water with an adequate cost of production improving raw water quality favors the implementation of simplified water treatment processes for small communities that are unable to implement costly treatment plants that require skilled personnel santana et al 25 using data from tippin water treatment plant in florida found that the raw water quality influences the energy expenditure in the treatment that raises by 14 5 due to the chemical dosage total organic carbon and electric conductivity have great influence on the dosage of the coagulants ferric sulfate and sulfuric acid and only ferric sulfate dosage has increased energy expenditure by 11 despite of these researches kreye et al 26 also states that there are few studies on the economic value of watershed conservation associated with treatment costs and highlights the relevance of this information for the construction of public policies in this issue according to these concepts this paper proposes to apply the three mentioned indexes wqicetesb rwqi and rwqif in a more robust database composed of 24 water sources in the southeast region of brazil additionally the paper aims to evaluate the water treatability through conventional water treatment process depending on the hydrological period hierarchy of watersheds regarding the need for intervention correlation between the indices and the coagulant dosage and treated water turbidity evaluating in this way the influence of raw water quality in the treatment evaluation the raw water quality coagulant dose and turbidity of the treated water according to the to the treatment average flow rate 2 methods 2 1 data handling the operational data related to the period from 2009 to 2014 were used involving 24 water sources associated with respective conventional water treatment plants in three states of the southeast of brazil all systems operate with surface intake with average flow rate ranging from 7 l s 1 to 3000 l s 1 the operational data were divided according to rainy season from october to april when more than 80 of annual precipitation verified in last 11 years 2007 2017 and dry season from may to september hence the analysis of water quality indexes aims to identify the distinct characteristics of natural water sources as well as the variations in terms of the hydrological period in addition to the response trends of the indexes the parameters related to surface water were algae chlorophyll a e coli apparent colour cyanobacteria iron manganese ph and turbidity in addition other water quality parameters related to the wqicetesb are included in this analysis the data were submitted to statistical analysis with identification of uncommon censored and inconsistent data censored data frequent in monitoring program from environmental purposes occur when the concentration or value of a specific parameter is close to zero and may lie below the detection limit dl of the analytical method the most common practice consists of replacing these values with a value equivalent to dl 2 usepa 27 does not recommend the use of this method for series with over 15 censored data furthermore regarding the data set outliers are atypical observations substantially different from the other data the occurrence of such values may indicate actual characteristics of the population or measuring errors that may severely distort the results of statistical tests according to grubbs and beck 28 the identification of outliers may be done using the quartile explanatory method observation upper quartile percentile 75 1 5 upper quartile lower quartile observation lower quartile percentile 25 1 5 upper quartile lower quartile in this research inconsistent data obtained from measurement error were identified based on technical literature concerning surface water quality for example ph values beyond the range 5 0 9 0 or turbidity higher than 3000 ntu were considered inconsistent and excluded from the sample all other data were maintained as they may occur naturally in some water sources evaluated environmental data usually present non normal distribution and positive asymmetry which hinders the utilization of parametric methods 29 hence data normality was verified by means of the graphic test known as normal probability plot associated to a shapiro wilk test for a significance level of 5 when these variables could not be represented by a normal distribution non parametric statistical tests were applied using the software statistica 7 30 2 2 determination of the wqicetesb for the determination of the wqicetesb 6 the formulation presented by eq 1 was used with the daily average data referring to the nine raw water quality parameters and respective weights and curves of the 24 water sources for each mentioned hydrological period 1 w q i c e t e s b i 1 n q i w i in which wi weight assigned to each water quality parameter established by the specialist judgment qi rate assigned to the water quality parameter as observed in the quality curves i each water quality parameter included in the relevant index n number of water quality parameters the presence of agrochemicals trace metals and toxic elements in the natural water leads the wqicetesb to a null value as these substances are considered harmful to humans animals and aquatic life 2 3 determination of the rwqi for the determination of the rwqi the formulation proposed by libânio and souza 16 presented by eq 2 the same formula of the mentioned wqinsf and the daily average operational data referring to the raw water characteristics of the water sources that make up the database as shown in fig 1 were used the fig 1 also illustrates the criterion of ph scoring where the highest values q are associated with more acidic waters and the lower ones with more alkaline waters in the most of plants all over the world the use of acid such as h2so4 or hcl for ph reduction in coagulation process is absolutely rare becoming the treatment of surface water with high ph much more difficult mainly for natural organic matter or manganese removal likewise seven other curves for each grading criterion were defined 2 r w q i i n q i w i in which wi weight assigned to each water quality parameter established by the specialist judgment qi rate assigned to the water quality parameter as observed in the quality curves i each water quality parameter included in the index n number 8 of water quality parameters the true colour values were replaced by apparent colour considering that the first parameter was not monitored in the most water treatment plants in brazil and developing countries there is the understanding that the value found for the rwqi will be lower than it should actually be found others considerations were made aiming at the application of the previous formulation of the rwqi such as as the water sources did not show evidence of algal bloom the days without records of chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria were kept in data set having been assigned to them zero value for the first parameter and one 1 0 for cyanobacteria since the grading criterion curve was developed using a logarithmic function the days without record from other variables except chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria were excluded from the data set some records of colour e coli cyanobacteria iron manganese and turbidity extrapolated the grading criterion curves in this case the scores were adjusted considering the asymptotic shape of these curves when the number of censored data was less than 15 these data were replaced by half the detection limit ld 2 in data set in such way all considerations listed above were also applied to the rwqif determination 2 4 determination of the rwqif for the determination of the rwqif the formulation proposed by oliveira et al 17 and the daily average operational data referring to the raw water characteristics of the water sources of data set were used the eight variables of raw water used in the development of rwqif were the same defined by the delphi method to composition of rwqi considering the substitution of the true colour for the apparent colour the variables were divided into three groups for formulation of subindexes biological fuzzy index bfi physical fuzzy index pfi and chemical fuzzy index cfi which in turn determined the rwqif the division proposed for this index aims to enable water supply system managers to identify which water quality parameters are more relevant for rwqif value the structure of the system is shown in fig 2 all the computational processing of this methodology was supported by the fuzzy logic toolbox and the routines of the matlab software 2 5 results analysis the values of the three indexes wqi rwqi and rwqif were evaluated based on the classification presented in table 2 the operational data of all water sources did not follow a normal distribution thus for each index the following tests were performed 31 using matlab 7 10 32 kruskal wallis non parametrical hypothesis test followed by the multiple comparison test at significance level of 5 α aiming at the comparison among the indexes of the water sources evaluated and the groups of water sources in terms of average flow rate q q 50 l s 1 50 l s 1 q 200 l s 1 and q 200 l s 1 mann whitney u test with significance level of 5 for comparison between the indexes and the hydrological periods determination of the spearman s correlation coefficient ρ using eq 3 to verify the correlation between the index developed with the fuzzy logic rwqif rwqi and wqicetesb and the occasional correlation with the coagulant dosage and treated water turbidity from each water treatment plant with this analysis was possible to verify if the indexes have the same response trends 3 ρ 1 6 i 1 n d i 2 n 3 n in which n number of data pairs xi yi di difference between ranks for each xi yi data pairs 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination and interpretation of the values of the three indices for each hydrological period the descriptive statistics of the already consolidated data were carried out and the analysis of the asymmetry coefficient and the graphics of normality showed that the data did not follow a normal distribution except for ph values thus the median was used as a measure of central tendency and non parametric tests were applied the data set comprised 24 water sources and 553 valid data the median values of the three indices were determined as well as the values referring to the hydrological periods as presented in table 3 evaluating the table 3 the water source 4 reservoir and 5 river presented the highest values of the wqicetesb excellent quality however in terms of treatability by means of conventional process these water sources present a good quality despite a probable difficulty in the potabilization due to the high density of cyanobacteria the friedman s anova and the kendall s test for a significance level of 5 indicated significant difference between the median values of wqicetesb rwqi and rwqif as shown in fig 3 the rwqif values are significantly lower than the other indices as observed by 10 the diagnosis is the initial phase of a technical administrative and economic process in the area of sanitation and environment based on this principle it is concluded that rwqif is a more useful management tool because it presents values more restrictive than the rwqi leading managers to a more immediate action regarding the beginning of the watershed conservation procedures moreover as expected the indices are clearly higher in the dry seasons when the raw water quality presents low variability and generally better quality as well affirmative corroborated by the mann whitney u test with significance level of 5 as shown in fig 4 this perception seems to be based on the relevance of the turbidity parameter that represents 22 of the rwqif 3 2 hierarchy of watersheds regarding the need for intervention the kruskal wallis test followed by the multiple comparisons test performed for the rwqif with a significance level of 5 allowed to identify the significant differences between the 24 water sources as shown in fig 5 based on table 3 and fig 5 it is possible to infer that water source 21 is in the most critical condition presenting the lowest median of the rwqif for both periods indicating an urgent need for a watershed protection plan water sources 10 13 20 and 24 present for the rainy period a median of the rwqif as regular 36 51 and as good 51 79 in the dry period indicating the need for protection and regulation actions of soil use in respective watersheds minimizing the pollution of the water sources in the rainy season water sources 5 6 and 22 present the highest median values of the rwqif and with little variation between the values in the rainy and the dry periods indicating a suitable protection of respective watersheds 3 3 correlation between the indices and the coagulant dosage and the treated water turbidity the spearman correlation coefficient ρ between the rwqi and the rwqif was 89 indicating that they had the same response tendency considering the evaluated water sources for a significance level of 5 a correlation between the rwqi and the wqicetesb was 64 and between the rwqif and the wqicetesb was 62 as shown in fig 6 these correlations indicate that the two raw water indices do not show the same response trend than the wqicetesb this conclusion was already expected since the wqicetesb has a clear function of assessing the water source in terms of its environmental condition while the other indices are directed to the treatability by conventional process the spearman correlation ρ between the rwqif and the treated water turbidity was significant and inverse at about 36 for the significance level of 5 this correlation remained significant and inverse of the order of 16 in the dry period and 41 in the rainy season fig 7 concerning the coagulant dosage aluminum sulphate or polyaluminum chloride the spearman correlation ρ was also significant and inverse approximately 45 for the significance level of 5 this correlation remained significant and inverse at about 32 in the dry period and 46 in the rainy period fig 8 the inverse correlation indicates that an improvement in water quality tends to reduce the coagulant expenditure and the treated water turbidity however the observed correlations are relatively low and it can be inferred that for water treatment by means of conventional process there are other intervening factors in these relations thus it is some imprecise to define a clear tendency between these variables or a cause and effect relationship between them in this scenario choudhury and saha 19 mention some factors that may have greater relevance in the production of safe water such as the operator commitment and hydraulic characteristics of the water treatment plant the kruskal wallis test was performed followed by the multiple comparison test for three groups of water sources and respective water treatment plants in terms of average flow rate q q 50 l s 1 50 l s 1 q 200 l s 1 and q 200 l s 1 basing on these results it can be deduced that the rwqif values for larger water supply systems are significantly smaller than for medium and small size systems this condition can be associated with higher degradation of water sources close to large urban centers the coagulant dosage applied to the water treatment plants seems a function of the flow rate the water source quality and the dosage form manual or automated there is a tendency for smaller water supply systems of a higher consumption of chemicals probably associated with manual dosage of the coagulant and the lower efficiency of this operation regarding the treated water turbidity the results are statistically different for evaluation of the plant size focusing on the rwqif values there is a clear association indicating that the lower values of this index are associated with higher treated water turbidity fig 9 illustrates the results presented above tables 4 6 present the results for dry and rainy periods indicating the same trend of response of the data set 4 conclusions from the results obtained the following statements may be construed i the rwqif presented high correlation ρ 0 89 with the previous rwqi developed by libânio and souza 2009 the rwqif

14213,the rwqi raw water quality index was developed in compliance with deterministic models in order to assess the treatability of natural waters for human consumption by means of conventional process basing on the similar procedure of the well known water quality index developed by the national sanitation foundation wqinsf the rwqi however seemed to require further adjustments regarding mainly rating criteria in order to find a non deterministic model that would allow handling uncertainties the non linearity of the parameters and the knowledge of the specialists the fuzzy logic was used in new approach to the rwqi in this context the new index named raw water quality index fuzzy rwqif was applied to data set of 24 water sources in brazil evaluating the correlations with the rwqi the wqicetesb treated water turbidity and coagulant dose the inverse correlation between the rwqif with coagulant dose and treated water turbidity was obtained however the low intensity of these correlations indicated that there are other intervening factors in this relation finally this research points out the rwqif as a suitable support decision making tool that allows managers to prioritize watershed protection actions in short medium and long term aiming at minimizing the water treatment costs and improving the treated water quality keywords surface water quality raw water quality index fuzzy logic water treatment 1 introduction and relevance 1 1 water quality indexes information about raw water quality is essential to define the adequate process to treat natural water for human consumption as well as to assess the plant s performance when water sources are monitored for environmental purposes it is common practice to use numerical indexes to show the water quality in specific points of water bodies in this context the first formal presentation of a water quality index wqi was developed by horton in 1965 later a similar wqi based on a survey supported by the national sanitation foundation nsf was proposed known as the wqinsf 1 the delphi method was employed based on the insights of 142 experts to define the parameters of interest weights were assigned to each parameter the nine selected parameters and their respective weights composed the index namely dissolved oxygen do 17 faecal thermotolerant coliforms 15 ph 12 biological oxygen demand bod 10 total phosphate 10 nitrate 10 temperature 10 turbidity 8 and total solids 8 finally nine curves were later developed to represent the variations in the water quality produced by the several measures of each parameter according to noori et al 2 the wqinsf has changed over the time substitution of the parameter total solids by total dissolved solids or total suspended solids total phosphate by orthophosphate faecal coliforms by e coli has been affecting the obtained results considering that environmental issues require monitoring and analysis of several parameters simultaneously adaptations of the wqinsf with the insertion of other water quality parameters have been made 3 5 in this scenario the environmental company of the state of são paulo brazil cetesb adapted the wqinsf named wqicetesb expressing in the product form and replacing nitrate by total nitrogen and total phosphate by total phosphorus 6 in order to deal with uncertainties and non linearity of environmental parameters statistical techniques such as regression 7 principal component analysis 8 fuzzy logic 9 11 neural networks 12 and neuro fuzzy 13 were used to determine the more suitable parameters or even the development of a new index in the majority of these studies the comparison with the wqinsf and its variations was carried out it was observed that the indexes presented the same tendency of response but those developed with artificial intelligence technique were more rigorous presenting lower values table 1 presents a summary of these studies notwithstanding its use in several countries worldwide as an indicator of environmental health in water bodies the wqinsf just like any other index has its limitations a clear overlap of certain parameters that provide similar information is evident such as do and bod turbidity and total solids and frequently also faecal coliforms or e coli and bod furthermore the wqinsf comprises a very limited number of biological and physiochemical parameters 15 in other context the wqinsf is not suitable to evaluate the treatability of a surface water due to the absence of some important parameters such as algae cyanobacteria blue green algae total organic carbon iron and manganese in addition some relevant environmental water quality parameters such as bod and dissolved oxygen whose respond for 27 of the wqinsf are almost useless to evaluate the treatability of the majority of surface water sources this assertive is corroborated by the vast majority of water sources presents low bod and high do almost always close to the saturation in this way with exception of some high polluted water sources the wqinsf would present high values and this fact makes more fragile the objective of comparing distinct surface waters in terms of treatability for human consumption 1 2 raw water quality indexes focusing on water treatability the raw water quality index rwqi was developed using the delphi method with a board composed of 24 specialists in water treatment employing as reference odourless and tasteless water with pesticides and trace metals heavy metals virtually absent this board defined the eight more relevant water quality parameters in terms of treatability by means of conventional water treatment process which comprises coagulation flocculation sedimentation or dissolved air flotation filtration and disinfection steps a weight for each water quality parameter was established in a similar way of the wqinsf 16 according to gharibi et al 10 the fuzzy logic is appropriate to environmental systems since it has the capacity to reflect human thinking dealing with non linear information which has a degree of subjectivity and with quantitative and qualitative information in this context following the trend of using the artificial intelligence technique oliveira et al 17 developed the rwqi using the fuzzy logic thus the interest variables were separated into three subindexes the fuzzy biological the fuzzy physical and the fuzzy chemical which in turn composed the raw water quality index fuzzy rwqif 1 3 the influence of raw water quality in water treatment water treatment plants aim to remove harmful pollutants and pathogens from the raw water making it safe for human consumption for this proposal it is fundamental the continuous monitoring of the plant performance based on treated water quality only it involves a large number of variables thus becoming a complex problem using a multicriteria analysis nawazi and ali 18 defined the eight most significant factors on plant performance evaluation such as pipeline length treatment time climatic conditions equipment and operator efficiency chemical dosage treatment process and raw water quality choudhury and saha 19 used these eight variables to compose a water treatment plant performance index the score used in the index was defined based on literature review and feedback from engineers and consumers on the importance of each parameter for the good plant performance as well as the risk associated with each of them to produce safe water this study highlights four main parameters responsible for the good plant performance operator efficiency treatment process raw water quality and coagulant dosage several researches have indicated the existence of a strong correlation between the actions focused on the watershed protection and the expenses with the chemical products employed in the water treatment and even with the treated water quality 20 the preservation of the natural vegetation of the watershed from anthropic actions minimizes the effects of erosion and the transport of sediments to the water source reducing the concentration of particles and microorganisms to the water treatment plant this statement was corroborated by a research carried out with 40 water supply systems in usa the main conclusion emphasized that an increase of 10 in preserved or reforested area will result in approximately reduction of 20 in the cost of chemicals products at water treatment plant 21 in a similar point of view postel and thompson 22 reported that several cities such as boston new york and seattle have avoided investments at their treatment plants by river basin protection through municipal or private investment garcia 23 also mentioned the example of the catskill delaware watershed that supplies 90 of new york in which the city agreed to spend us 1 5 billion on water source protection instead of us 5 billions on implementation of new water treatment processes islan et al 24 state that the protection of the water source is associated with the implementation of multiple barriers in the production of high quality drinking water with an adequate cost of production improving raw water quality favors the implementation of simplified water treatment processes for small communities that are unable to implement costly treatment plants that require skilled personnel santana et al 25 using data from tippin water treatment plant in florida found that the raw water quality influences the energy expenditure in the treatment that raises by 14 5 due to the chemical dosage total organic carbon and electric conductivity have great influence on the dosage of the coagulants ferric sulfate and sulfuric acid and only ferric sulfate dosage has increased energy expenditure by 11 despite of these researches kreye et al 26 also states that there are few studies on the economic value of watershed conservation associated with treatment costs and highlights the relevance of this information for the construction of public policies in this issue according to these concepts this paper proposes to apply the three mentioned indexes wqicetesb rwqi and rwqif in a more robust database composed of 24 water sources in the southeast region of brazil additionally the paper aims to evaluate the water treatability through conventional water treatment process depending on the hydrological period hierarchy of watersheds regarding the need for intervention correlation between the indices and the coagulant dosage and treated water turbidity evaluating in this way the influence of raw water quality in the treatment evaluation the raw water quality coagulant dose and turbidity of the treated water according to the to the treatment average flow rate 2 methods 2 1 data handling the operational data related to the period from 2009 to 2014 were used involving 24 water sources associated with respective conventional water treatment plants in three states of the southeast of brazil all systems operate with surface intake with average flow rate ranging from 7 l s 1 to 3000 l s 1 the operational data were divided according to rainy season from october to april when more than 80 of annual precipitation verified in last 11 years 2007 2017 and dry season from may to september hence the analysis of water quality indexes aims to identify the distinct characteristics of natural water sources as well as the variations in terms of the hydrological period in addition to the response trends of the indexes the parameters related to surface water were algae chlorophyll a e coli apparent colour cyanobacteria iron manganese ph and turbidity in addition other water quality parameters related to the wqicetesb are included in this analysis the data were submitted to statistical analysis with identification of uncommon censored and inconsistent data censored data frequent in monitoring program from environmental purposes occur when the concentration or value of a specific parameter is close to zero and may lie below the detection limit dl of the analytical method the most common practice consists of replacing these values with a value equivalent to dl 2 usepa 27 does not recommend the use of this method for series with over 15 censored data furthermore regarding the data set outliers are atypical observations substantially different from the other data the occurrence of such values may indicate actual characteristics of the population or measuring errors that may severely distort the results of statistical tests according to grubbs and beck 28 the identification of outliers may be done using the quartile explanatory method observation upper quartile percentile 75 1 5 upper quartile lower quartile observation lower quartile percentile 25 1 5 upper quartile lower quartile in this research inconsistent data obtained from measurement error were identified based on technical literature concerning surface water quality for example ph values beyond the range 5 0 9 0 or turbidity higher than 3000 ntu were considered inconsistent and excluded from the sample all other data were maintained as they may occur naturally in some water sources evaluated environmental data usually present non normal distribution and positive asymmetry which hinders the utilization of parametric methods 29 hence data normality was verified by means of the graphic test known as normal probability plot associated to a shapiro wilk test for a significance level of 5 when these variables could not be represented by a normal distribution non parametric statistical tests were applied using the software statistica 7 30 2 2 determination of the wqicetesb for the determination of the wqicetesb 6 the formulation presented by eq 1 was used with the daily average data referring to the nine raw water quality parameters and respective weights and curves of the 24 water sources for each mentioned hydrological period 1 w q i c e t e s b i 1 n q i w i in which wi weight assigned to each water quality parameter established by the specialist judgment qi rate assigned to the water quality parameter as observed in the quality curves i each water quality parameter included in the relevant index n number of water quality parameters the presence of agrochemicals trace metals and toxic elements in the natural water leads the wqicetesb to a null value as these substances are considered harmful to humans animals and aquatic life 2 3 determination of the rwqi for the determination of the rwqi the formulation proposed by libânio and souza 16 presented by eq 2 the same formula of the mentioned wqinsf and the daily average operational data referring to the raw water characteristics of the water sources that make up the database as shown in fig 1 were used the fig 1 also illustrates the criterion of ph scoring where the highest values q are associated with more acidic waters and the lower ones with more alkaline waters in the most of plants all over the world the use of acid such as h2so4 or hcl for ph reduction in coagulation process is absolutely rare becoming the treatment of surface water with high ph much more difficult mainly for natural organic matter or manganese removal likewise seven other curves for each grading criterion were defined 2 r w q i i n q i w i in which wi weight assigned to each water quality parameter established by the specialist judgment qi rate assigned to the water quality parameter as observed in the quality curves i each water quality parameter included in the index n number 8 of water quality parameters the true colour values were replaced by apparent colour considering that the first parameter was not monitored in the most water treatment plants in brazil and developing countries there is the understanding that the value found for the rwqi will be lower than it should actually be found others considerations were made aiming at the application of the previous formulation of the rwqi such as as the water sources did not show evidence of algal bloom the days without records of chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria were kept in data set having been assigned to them zero value for the first parameter and one 1 0 for cyanobacteria since the grading criterion curve was developed using a logarithmic function the days without record from other variables except chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria were excluded from the data set some records of colour e coli cyanobacteria iron manganese and turbidity extrapolated the grading criterion curves in this case the scores were adjusted considering the asymptotic shape of these curves when the number of censored data was less than 15 these data were replaced by half the detection limit ld 2 in data set in such way all considerations listed above were also applied to the rwqif determination 2 4 determination of the rwqif for the determination of the rwqif the formulation proposed by oliveira et al 17 and the daily average operational data referring to the raw water characteristics of the water sources of data set were used the eight variables of raw water used in the development of rwqif were the same defined by the delphi method to composition of rwqi considering the substitution of the true colour for the apparent colour the variables were divided into three groups for formulation of subindexes biological fuzzy index bfi physical fuzzy index pfi and chemical fuzzy index cfi which in turn determined the rwqif the division proposed for this index aims to enable water supply system managers to identify which water quality parameters are more relevant for rwqif value the structure of the system is shown in fig 2 all the computational processing of this methodology was supported by the fuzzy logic toolbox and the routines of the matlab software 2 5 results analysis the values of the three indexes wqi rwqi and rwqif were evaluated based on the classification presented in table 2 the operational data of all water sources did not follow a normal distribution thus for each index the following tests were performed 31 using matlab 7 10 32 kruskal wallis non parametrical hypothesis test followed by the multiple comparison test at significance level of 5 α aiming at the comparison among the indexes of the water sources evaluated and the groups of water sources in terms of average flow rate q q 50 l s 1 50 l s 1 q 200 l s 1 and q 200 l s 1 mann whitney u test with significance level of 5 for comparison between the indexes and the hydrological periods determination of the spearman s correlation coefficient ρ using eq 3 to verify the correlation between the index developed with the fuzzy logic rwqif rwqi and wqicetesb and the occasional correlation with the coagulant dosage and treated water turbidity from each water treatment plant with this analysis was possible to verify if the indexes have the same response trends 3 ρ 1 6 i 1 n d i 2 n 3 n in which n number of data pairs xi yi di difference between ranks for each xi yi data pairs 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination and interpretation of the values of the three indices for each hydrological period the descriptive statistics of the already consolidated data were carried out and the analysis of the asymmetry coefficient and the graphics of normality showed that the data did not follow a normal distribution except for ph values thus the median was used as a measure of central tendency and non parametric tests were applied the data set comprised 24 water sources and 553 valid data the median values of the three indices were determined as well as the values referring to the hydrological periods as presented in table 3 evaluating the table 3 the water source 4 reservoir and 5 river presented the highest values of the wqicetesb excellent quality however in terms of treatability by means of conventional process these water sources present a good quality despite a probable difficulty in the potabilization due to the high density of cyanobacteria the friedman s anova and the kendall s test for a significance level of 5 indicated significant difference between the median values of wqicetesb rwqi and rwqif as shown in fig 3 the rwqif values are significantly lower than the other indices as observed by 10 the diagnosis is the initial phase of a technical administrative and economic process in the area of sanitation and environment based on this principle it is concluded that rwqif is a more useful management tool because it presents values more restrictive than the rwqi leading managers to a more immediate action regarding the beginning of the watershed conservation procedures moreover as expected the indices are clearly higher in the dry seasons when the raw water quality presents low variability and generally better quality as well affirmative corroborated by the mann whitney u test with significance level of 5 as shown in fig 4 this perception seems to be based on the relevance of the turbidity parameter that represents 22 of the rwqif 3 2 hierarchy of watersheds regarding the need for intervention the kruskal wallis test followed by the multiple comparisons test performed for the rwqif with a significance level of 5 allowed to identify the significant differences between the 24 water sources as shown in fig 5 based on table 3 and fig 5 it is possible to infer that water source 21 is in the most critical condition presenting the lowest median of the rwqif for both periods indicating an urgent need for a watershed protection plan water sources 10 13 20 and 24 present for the rainy period a median of the rwqif as regular 36 51 and as good 51 79 in the dry period indicating the need for protection and regulation actions of soil use in respective watersheds minimizing the pollution of the water sources in the rainy season water sources 5 6 and 22 present the highest median values of the rwqif and with little variation between the values in the rainy and the dry periods indicating a suitable protection of respective watersheds 3 3 correlation between the indices and the coagulant dosage and the treated water turbidity the spearman correlation coefficient ρ between the rwqi and the rwqif was 89 indicating that they had the same response tendency considering the evaluated water sources for a significance level of 5 a correlation between the rwqi and the wqicetesb was 64 and between the rwqif and the wqicetesb was 62 as shown in fig 6 these correlations indicate that the two raw water indices do not show the same response trend than the wqicetesb this conclusion was already expected since the wqicetesb has a clear function of assessing the water source in terms of its environmental condition while the other indices are directed to the treatability by conventional process the spearman correlation ρ between the rwqif and the treated water turbidity was significant and inverse at about 36 for the significance level of 5 this correlation remained significant and inverse of the order of 16 in the dry period and 41 in the rainy season fig 7 concerning the coagulant dosage aluminum sulphate or polyaluminum chloride the spearman correlation ρ was also significant and inverse approximately 45 for the significance level of 5 this correlation remained significant and inverse at about 32 in the dry period and 46 in the rainy period fig 8 the inverse correlation indicates that an improvement in water quality tends to reduce the coagulant expenditure and the treated water turbidity however the observed correlations are relatively low and it can be inferred that for water treatment by means of conventional process there are other intervening factors in these relations thus it is some imprecise to define a clear tendency between these variables or a cause and effect relationship between them in this scenario choudhury and saha 19 mention some factors that may have greater relevance in the production of safe water such as the operator commitment and hydraulic characteristics of the water treatment plant the kruskal wallis test was performed followed by the multiple comparison test for three groups of water sources and respective water treatment plants in terms of average flow rate q q 50 l s 1 50 l s 1 q 200 l s 1 and q 200 l s 1 basing on these results it can be deduced that the rwqif values for larger water supply systems are significantly smaller than for medium and small size systems this condition can be associated with higher degradation of water sources close to large urban centers the coagulant dosage applied to the water treatment plants seems a function of the flow rate the water source quality and the dosage form manual or automated there is a tendency for smaller water supply systems of a higher consumption of chemicals probably associated with manual dosage of the coagulant and the lower efficiency of this operation regarding the treated water turbidity the results are statistically different for evaluation of the plant size focusing on the rwqif values there is a clear association indicating that the lower values of this index are associated with higher treated water turbidity fig 9 illustrates the results presented above tables 4 6 present the results for dry and rainy periods indicating the same trend of response of the data set 4 conclusions from the results obtained the following statements may be construed i the rwqif presented high correlation ρ 0 89 with the previous rwqi developed by libânio and souza 2009 the rwqif because it is more conservative than the rwqi can lead to managers to anticipate decision making regarding the preservation of water sources an ideal condition for optimization of water treatment plants performance ii the wqi presented the highest values reinforcing its function as tool for evaluation of the environmental conditions of water sources iii as expected the two raw water quality indexes are higher in the dry periods when the raw water quality usually presents low variability and better quality iv the most prominent limitation to the full scale application of rwqif is related to determination of chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria not routinely monitored in several water sources as well as the number of viable data v the rwqif showed a negative and relatively low correlation with the treated water turbidity and the coagulant dosage respectively ρ 0 36 e ρ 0 45 the inverse correlation indicates that an improvement in raw water quality tends to reduce the coagulant consumption and the treated water turbidity however it can be inferred that other factors should be considered in this relation vi finally the results do not exhaust the discussion but they foment and

14214,biosorption using cellulosic wastes has been considered as a clean technology for the uptake of heavy metals in this study a novel biosorbent was synthesized by extracting the cellulose from the waste rice husk using soda bleaching technique followed by its coating using humic acid the biosorbent was found to be very effective for the removal of nickel and chromium from the aquatic medium various physicochemical conditions for uptake like ph 5 6 contact time 8 h were optimized using batch method the sorption capacity enhanced significantly by providing humic acid coating experiment data were fitted in sorption isotherm and kinetic modelstodescribe the sorption process sorption capacity of developed biosorbent was 12 41 mg g 1 and 19 39 mg g 1for nickel and chromium respectively and the sorption followed the langmuir isotherm for both the elements keywords biosorption humic acid cellulose soda bleaching sorption isotherms 1 introduction heavy metal pollution in the aquatic streams is an ever increasing environmental concern the major sources of heavy metal pollution are various factories each releasing a different pollutant in the effluent corrosion of different components release from waste disposal facilitiesetc 1 2 they are highly hazardous due to their property of being non biodegradable thus resulting in bioaccumulation in living organisms leading to diseases 3 4 nickel and chromium are among the few heavy metals that are considered as environmental pollutants because as their toxicities 5 6 many nickel salts are easily soluble in water making it more prone to leaching and subsequent water contamination it is seen that acid rain increases nickel leaching into water soil ph use sampling depth affect the concentration of nickel in groundwater although some amount of nickel is required by the human body acute nickel toxicity may lead to kidney malfunction and at extremes to cancer major source of nickel are metal factories incinerators fertilizers and power plants 7 chromium is a colorless metallic element found in rocks soils plants and volcanic elements being an essential dietary product it is found in fruits vegetables grains and meat in the environment chromium is released by the various industries like tanning wood preservation dyes chrome plating and various alloy manufacturers it exists as both cr ii and cr vi of which the latter is the more dangerous and highly carcinogenic the maximum permissible level for cr was set at 0 1 μgml 1 by the epa one of the most common symptoms of chromium poisoning is contact dermatitis 8 several chemical agents have been used as sorbents for adsorption of heavy metals these agents are for most of the time ineffective or uneconomical due to the scale of the operation this led to the development of a new class of sorbents using biomass when the sorbent is of a biological origin it is termed as a biosorbent 9 12 biosorbents can be both living and non living it is an active process when a living cell is involved as the metabolic process of the cell leads to sorption on the other hand when dead cells or biomass acts as a sorbent the process is a passive process various materials have been used as a biosorbent like dried water hyacinth roots seaweed tea leaves yeast biomass sawdust olive stones fish scales soybean hulls oil palm fibres moss rice hulls chitin animal bones bacteria fungi 13 14 adsorption of cr vi ions onto various sorbents was reported for example optimum ph for cr vi adsorption on chitin and chitosan was found as 3 0 which is very low for some of the sorbents uptake kinetics was found to very slow 15 recently kaolinite 16 and blast furnace slag 17 have been used for ni uptake from water several factors need to be considered during biosorption studies like the cost of metal usefulness after recovery its toxicity and its use in further research one of the most common adsorbent used is cellulose which is mainly the cell wall structure of the biomass which enable the metal uptake and thus purify water cell walls contain several functional groups that bind with certain metal ions aiding in biosorption the metal ions may form a surface coating over the sorbent and can then be easily separated from the water 18 19 cellulose is a polymer of β 1 4 linked glucose it is generally used as an adsorbent for various gases like co2 over the time various research identified the potential of cellulose for the adsorption of metal ions from sample when the cellulose used for adsorption is derived from a plant source rather than chemically synthesised one it becomes a biosorbent 20 21 with advanced research certain modifications induced in the cellulose structure gave better sorption results and thus this area has been studied extensively these modifications add some functional groups to the natural cellulose which capture the metal ions in a better fashion this is due to the fact that the added functional groups have more binding affinity to the sorbate than pure cellulose one of the most commonly used cellulose derivative is the microcrystalline cellulose this depolymerisation eliminates any form of amorphous structure and give pure crystalline powder this enhances the properties of cellulose 22 other modifications to cellulose includes functionalization using amine thiol polyethyleneimine and amidoxime moieties each functional group aids in the adsorption of a different set of sorbates based on their binding affinities 23 24 the hard outercovering of the rice grain is known as rice husk rh or hulls they are essentially the seed coat of the rice which protects the grain while its growth it is tough due to its lignocellulosic nature and thus is indigestible to humans it is an agricultural waste and open burning of it by the farmers create a lot of environmental issues which can be minimized by its meaningful utilization rice husk contains celluloseand hemicellulose about 50 as major chemical component 25 30 lignin and silica 15 20 25 this high cellulosic content of rh can be used to carry out several adsorption processes at a cheaper rate humic acids ha are naturally occurring complex molecules and last degradation product of living beings it is an excellent natural way of providing plants and soil with essential elements nutrients and vitamins 26 transition and heavy metals as well as compoundshaving hydrophobic organic structures react with humic acid reactivity of humic acid towards these agents enable it to be effective for removal of many pollutants 27 in the present work new biosorbent material humic acid coated cellulose was developed using soda bleaching technique to extract cellulose from rice husk followed by its coating with humic acid experimental results clearly indicate this new developed material efficiently reduce the elevated levels of ni and cr in aquatic bodies without compromising the water quality parameters 2 experimental 2 1 reagents analytical grade chemicals reagents were used andobtained from sigma aldrich milliq water having resistivity 0 01 μscm 1 and dissolved organic carbon doc 5 ng ml 1 was used for preparation of solutions standards reagents standard stock solutions 5000 mg l 1 of chromium iii and nickel ii in hno3 were used for preparation of experimental solution the ph adjustment was done with hno3 and naoh depending upon the requirements 2 2 extraction of cellulose from rice husk rice husk 5 kg was collected from a rice mill in panvel maharashtra india and were dried at 50 c for 12 h and stored the rice husk was dried in glass perti dishes 10 dishes of 15 cm diameter were used to accommodate rice husk inside an oven the moisture content of rice husk was about 4 before drying and after drying it was 0 1 cellulose was extracted from rice husk according to method reported in the literature 28 31 in a typical process 10 g of rice husk was weighed and added to 18 200 ml of naoh solution in a beaker this was then heated to 70 c under continuous stirring for 1 h after cooling down the solution was filtered and washed with di waterseveral times retentate was then added to hypochlorite solution for bleaching it was then filtered through millipore filtration assembly using 0 45 μm filter paper the retentate was dried keeping under ir lamp philips ir lamp of 250 w 220 v ac and the dried mass was then powdered using havells premio i mixer grinders 750 w in pulse mode this is the cellulose powder cell rh which was stored and used for further experiments 2 3 preparation of humic acid coated cellulose 5gm of cellulose powder extracted from rice husk was treated with 50 ml of 0 1 alkaline humic acid solution for 24 h aldrich humic acid powder cat no 53680 was used for providing the coating the mixture was kept in orbital shaker overnight the resultant solid material humic acid coated cellulose extracted from rice husk ha cell rh was filtered out it was washed first using 0 1 n naoh solution to get rid of the free humic acid and later on several times by demineralized water the composite material was dried in an oven until constant weight moisture content 0 1 the process was repeated to obtain the ha cell rh powder in bulk 2 4 quantification of ni and cr inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer horiba activa s with simultaneous detector array solid state

pulping is known as the soda pulping method as naoh was used in disintegrating the sample addition of 18 naoh and heating resulted in the softening of the rice husk to a great extent it also aids in delignification of the rice husk where the lignin content of the sample is separated this is one of the main steps in obtaining cellulose the washing step is used mainly for defibrillation further bleaching of the sample with hypochlorite made the sample close to white in color this step will also add to the delignification process by repeated washing the ph of the solution came down from very high to moderate ph 7 8 the original rice husk fibres contained cellulose hemicelluloses lignin and silica ash in the first step due to the treatment with highly concentrated alkali ph 12 the lignin and the silica got removed in the second step bleaching the hemicelluloses is also lost and only cellulose is obtained 31 humic acid was coated uniformly over the cell rh particles by soaking 0 1 humic acid solution overnight cellulose is organic polymer having oh coc groups which are partially charged based on the ph of the medium humic acid on the other hand is organic macromolecules probably with presence of all organic functional groups like alcoholic ketonic carboxylic phenolic and even amino groups now attraction of opposite charges of the groups from both humic acid and cellulose will make humic acid stabilized on the cellulose through the oxygen present in oh and coc groups of cellulose and form the biosorbent ha cell rh 3 2 characterization of cell rh and ha cell rh fig 1 gives the number distribution of the particles cell rh and ha cell rh both with size derived through dls measurement the diameter of cell rh particles was 2 4 μm whereas size of ha cell rh was in slightly higher range 2 7 μm which is clear from the nature of the distributions the shift of the size distribution of ha cell rh towards the higher size is obvious since humic acid was coated over the cell rhresulting surface coating or growth and hence the increase in size fig 2 gives the xrd pattern of cell rh and ha cell rh in the xrd of cell rh peak at 27 7 and at 32 7 confirm the presence of cellulose 32 33 the peak at 46 25 is that of lignin as verified from the literature 34 this shows that some of the lignin is not removed completely the small peak from 14 8 to 24 8 is also a characteristic of the cellulose crystalline structure it is proved from the xrd pattern that a decent crystalline structure of cellulose is formed from rh in the xrd pattern of ha cell rh peak intensities of cell rh got reduced because of the amorphous nature of the humic acid in the ftir spectrum of cell rh fig 3 signature of various vibrational bands of cellulose was obtained in fig 3the ftir of cell rh was compared to ftir of pure cellulose powder procured from market bands obtained between 3300 and 3500 cm 1 are attributed to oh stretching not shown in fig 3 a small peak at around 2900 cm 1which is also not shown in the selected scale is associated with c h symmetrical stretching where both the bonds are equally stretched a peak at 1563 cm 1 indicated an oh bend where the bond angles change at 1250 cm 1 a g ring bending occurs 1100 cm 1 corresponds to coc asymmetrical stretching where the bond length change is disproportional 33 35 in the ftir spectrum of ha cell rh peaks of humic acids were also observed along with the peaks of cellulose major peaks of humic acid like 1600 1650 cm 1 due to aromatic and aliphatic carboxylates 1700 1720 cm 1 due to carboxylic acid groups and signature of oh in the range of 3200 3400 cm 1 are merged along with the cell rh peaks 36 sem image at fig 4 a shows the surface morphology of cell rh where non uniform spherical shape of the particles are observed fig 4b is the sem image of the same cell rh particles but at higher magnification the size range of the particles obtained from sem matches well with the size obtained from dls from the sem image of ha cell rh fig 4c the surface morphology is changed because of deposition or coating of the humic acid over the cellulose particles in the morphology of the ha cell rh it is observed that the distinct boundary between the particle fades or vanishes as seen in fig 4c but boundaries were clear in case of fig 4a 3 3 uptake of ni and cr 3 3 1 uptake of ni and cr by cell rh and ha cell rh fig 5 gives the percentage uptake of ni and cr by cell rh and ha cell rh by keeping all other parameters identical initial concentration of both ni and cr as 10 μgml 1 ph 5 0 contact time 24 h sorbent dose 10 mgml 1 the uptake increases significantly as seen in fig 5 upon modification of cell rh by humic acid batch adsorption studies was performed for various parameters that generally affect sorption capacity of a ha cell rh five replicate analyses were simultaneously carried out in identical conditions to derive the standard deviation 3 3 2 effect of ph on uptake ph is one of the most important factor as it decides several properties of the sorbate and the sorbent the sorption was tested from ph 2 to ph8 fig 6 keeping other parameters constant initial concentration of both ni and cr as 10 μgml 1 contact time 24 h sorbent dose 10 mg ml 1 it was found that increasing ph increases the sorption capacity to a point at which maximum sorption is attained after this with increasing ph the sorption decreases ph around 5 was found ideal for both ni and cr at the acidic ph the positively charged ni and cr iii ions compete with the hydronium ions hence the uptake is less at very high ph 7 the hydrolyzed species which are not positively charged of ni ii and cr iii are formed the uptake is therefore reduced all the further studies were carried out in the ph of 5 0 0 5 3 3 3 effect of contact time and temperature ni and cr uptake was studied at different temperatures 276 k 298 k and 333 k withvarying contact time 5 min to 48 h keeping other parameters constant ni crconcentration 100 μg ml 1 ph 5 dose rate 10 mg ml 1 there was increase in uptake initially with time up to 8 h for both ni and cr thereafterit reached a saturation fig 7 a and fig 7b initially when ni cr and ha cell rhare in contact number of vacant sites on ha cell rh surface are more to be available for ni cr to be sorbed with time probability for ni cr to occupy vacant sites decreases due to repulsive forces between sorbed ni cr molecules and the bulky surface of ha cell rh a contact time of 8 h was followed for the batch experiments the fig 7a and fig 7b gives the dependency of uptake on temperatures also 3 4 kinetics thermodynamicsand isotherm study to find solute uptake rate kinetic study was carried out both pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic model were tested to understand the reaction kinetics of ni and cr sorption by ha cell rh results show that the pseudo second order model was most appropriate for the sorption of ni and cr on ha cell rh fig 8 the rate constants correlation coefficients along with the rate equation are presented in table 1 temperature at which ni cr sorption takes place will influence the sorption rate and the extent of sorption as observed in fig 7a and b sorption percentage of both ni and cr increases with temperature indicating endothermic nature of the sorption process the reason may be enhanced rate of intra particle diffusion of the solute ni cr into ha cell rh matrix the rate constant value depends on a complex factor of reaction environment ionic potential of the reactants various experimental conditions 37 2 δg0 rt ln k using universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and equilibrium constant k obtained from the sorption experiment at 298 k change in free energy δg0 was obtained as 6 62 kj mol 1 for uptake of niand 7 13 kj mol 1 for uptake of cr by ha cell rh spontaneity of the sorption process is confirmed by the negative value of δg0 the difference in free energy between ni and cr is arising because of the difference in their rate constant values which has been explained earlier to evaluate sorption capacity of ha mcnp composite equilibrium sorption was studied under stp 25oc 1 atm as a function of concentration the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are most widely used toillustratethe adsorption process and the interaction between sorbent and solute 38 39 the langmuir eq 3 and freundlich eq 4 isotherms are given below 3 q e q o b c e 1 b c e 4 q e k c e 1 n where qe and ce are uranium concentration at equilibrium in sorbent and in solution respectively various assumptions of langmuir and freundlich models are discussed elsewhere 32 33 sorption of both ni and cr were seen to follow the langmuir model which is clear from the r2 regression coefficient values 0 96 and 0 98 respectively for ni and cr r2 values were poor for freundlich isotherm fitting the maximum sorption capacities q0 were evaluated from the fitting as 12 41 mg g 1 for ni and 19 39 mg g 1 for cr fig 9 3 5 intraparticle diffusion model the sorption process on the adsorbate occurs in various steps depending on the various interaction mechanisms between the sorbate and the sorbent mostly in the first step the sorption of sorbate molecules on the outer layer of the sorbent occurs in the next step the sorbate molecules migrate from the outer layer of the sorbent to the core finally the sorbate is sorbed on the core vacant sites of the sorbent the process is called intraparticle diffusion the mathematical expression for intraparticle diffusion was given by weber morris equation 5 q t k i t 1 2 c where kirepresents the rate constant for intraparticle diffusion mg g 1 h1 2 c mg g 1 is a constant dependent on the thickness of boundary layer the intercept c can be expressed as the extrapolation of the linear portion of the plot which are proportional to the extent of the boundary layer thickness if the effect of the boundary layer is greater then larger intercept values will be obtained if the experimental intercepts were negative then it can be explained as the boundary layer thickness retarded inter particle diffusion the eq 5 has been widely used by the researchers in the literature most of the reported intercepts were positive which indicates rapid adsorption 40 42 plot qt vs t1 2 is given in fig 10 the characteristics of the plot qt vs t1 2 for both ni and cr is multilinear which indicates that three mechanisms are involved in the sorption process 40 42 in the first step the ni cr ions interact with the outer layer of the ha cell rh which is mostly surrounded by the solvent molecules hydronium ions in this case which orient themselves according to the surface charge of the ha cell rh zeta potential of ha cell rh measured was 42 mv at ph 5 which suggest the negative surface charge on the sorbent this is mainly because of the ionnisation of the organic groups cooh oh etc of the humic acid the second slope in the plot is due to the transportation of diffusion of the ni cr ions in the sorbate i e the humic acid layer over the cell rh the third region in the plot is due to the interaction of the ni cr ions with the core cellulose part of ha cell rh from the fig 10 it is also observed that slope of the three linear regions are in decreasing order which indicates the decrease in the rate of interaction consecutively 3 6 applicability of ha cell rh in real water samples different groundwater samples 5 no were taken to check the applicability of the sorbent in these water samples 20 ml of water samples spiked with 10 μg ml 1ni and cr each was filled in polypropylene bottles and a measured amount of sorbate were added and left for 8 h and then the sorbent wasfiltered and water samples were analyzed almost 100 removal of both the elements ni and cr was observed while using ha cell rh which shows the effectiveness of the developed sorbent for actual field application it is very important to test the leaching of the components of ha cell rh into the water system while treating with the sorbent drinking water quality parameters were tested before and after the treatment with ha cell rh values are given in table 2 no significance change in the values after the treatment suggest that the developed sorbent ha cell rh doesn t affect the water quality the unaltered doc value humic acid concentration suggest no leaching of the components humic acid cellulose into the water system 4 conclusion in the present work a novel biosorbent humic acid coated cellulose derived from rice husk was developed to take up chromium and nickel from potable water without compromising primary water quality parameters developed sorbent was characterized and used for the uptake of chromium and nickel from aquatic medium it was observed that the humic acid coating over the cellulose significantly increase the sorption of the ni and cr uptake study carried out in batch method showed more than 95 sorption of both chromium and nickel in the concentration range of 5 to 100 ppm various parameters like ph equilibrium time were optimized sorption isotherm followed the langmuir method and the sorption capacity was evaluated as 12 41 mg g 1 for ni and 19 39 mg g 1 for cr 
14214,biosorption using cellulosic wastes has been considered as a clean technology for the uptake of heavy metals in this study a novel biosorbent was synthesized by extracting the cellulose from the waste rice husk using soda bleaching technique followed by its coating using humic acid the biosorbent was found to be very effective for the removal of nickel and chromium from the aquatic medium various physicochemical conditions for uptake like ph 5 6 contact time 8 h were optimized using batch method the sorption capacity enhanced significantly by providing humic acid coating experiment data were fitted in sorption isotherm and kinetic modelstodescribe the sorption process sorption capacity of developed biosorbent was 12 41 mg g 1 and 19 39 mg g 1for nickel and chromium respectively and the sorption followed the langmuir isotherm for both the elements keywords biosorption humic acid cellulose soda bleaching sorption isotherms 1 introduction heavy metal pollution in the aquatic streams is an ever increasing environmental concern the major sources of heavy metal pollution are various factories each releasing a different pollutant in the effluent corrosion of different components release from waste disposal facilitiesetc 1 2 they are highly hazardous due to their property of being non biodegradable thus resulting in bioaccumulation in living organisms leading to diseases 3 4 nickel and chromium are among the few heavy metals that are considered as environmental pollutants because as their toxicities 5 6 many nickel salts are easily soluble in water making it more prone to leaching and subsequent water contamination it is seen that acid rain increases nickel leaching into water soil ph use sampling depth affect the concentration of nickel in groundwater although some amount of nickel is required by the human body acute nickel toxicity may lead to kidney malfunction and at extremes to cancer major source of nickel are metal factories incinerators fertilizers and power plants 7 chromium is a colorless metallic element found in rocks soils plants and volcanic elements being an essential dietary product it is found in fruits vegetables grains and meat in the environment chromium is released by the various industries like tanning wood preservation dyes chrome plating and various alloy manufacturers it exists as both cr ii and cr vi of which the latter is the more dangerous and highly carcinogenic the maximum permissible level for cr was set at 0 1 μgml 1 by the epa one of the most common symptoms of chromium poisoning is contact dermatitis 8 several chemical agents have been used as sorbents for adsorption of heavy metals these agents are for most of the time ineffective or uneconomical due to the scale of the operation this led to the development of a new class of sorbents using biomass when the sorbent is of a biological origin it is termed as a biosorbent 9 12 biosorbents can be both living and non living it is an active process when a living cell is involved as the metabolic process of the cell leads to sorption on the other hand when dead cells or biomass acts as a sorbent the process is a passive process various materials have been used as a biosorbent like dried water hyacinth roots seaweed tea leaves yeast biomass sawdust olive stones fish scales soybean hulls oil palm fibres moss rice hulls chitin animal bones bacteria fungi 13 14 adsorption of cr vi ions onto various sorbents was reported for example optimum ph for cr vi adsorption on chitin and chitosan was found as 3 0 which is very low for some of the sorbents uptake kinetics was found to very slow 15 recently kaolinite 16 and blast furnace slag 17 have been used for ni uptake from water several factors need to be considered during biosorption studies like the cost of metal usefulness after recovery its toxicity and its use in further research one of the most common adsorbent used is cellulose which is mainly the cell wall structure of the biomass which enable the metal uptake and thus purify water cell walls contain several functional groups that bind with certain metal ions aiding in biosorption the metal ions may form a surface coating over the sorbent and can then be easily separated from the water 18 19 cellulose is a polymer of β 1 4 linked glucose it is generally used as an adsorbent for various gases like co2 over the time various research identified the potential of cellulose for the adsorption of metal ions from sample when the cellulose used for adsorption is derived from a plant source rather than chemically synthesised one it becomes a biosorbent 20 21 with advanced research certain modifications induced in the cellulose structure gave better sorption results and thus this area has been studied extensively these modifications add some functional groups to the natural cellulose which capture the metal ions in a better fashion this is due to the fact that the added functional groups have more binding affinity to the sorbate than pure cellulose one of the most commonly used cellulose derivative is the microcrystalline cellulose this depolymerisation eliminates any form of amorphous structure and give pure crystalline powder this enhances the properties of cellulose 22 other modifications to cellulose includes functionalization using amine thiol polyethyleneimine and amidoxime moieties each functional group aids in the adsorption of a different set of sorbates based on their binding affinities 23 24 the hard outercovering of the rice grain is known as rice husk rh or hulls they are essentially the seed coat of the rice which protects the grain while its growth it is tough due to its lignocellulosic nature and thus is indigestible to humans it is an agricultural waste and open burning of it by the farmers create a lot of environmental issues which can be minimized by its meaningful utilization rice husk contains celluloseand hemicellulose about 50 as major chemical component 25 30 lignin and silica 15 20 25 this high cellulosic content of rh can be used to carry out several adsorption processes at a cheaper rate humic acids ha are naturally occurring complex molecules and last degradation product of living beings it is an excellent natural way of providing plants and soil with essential elements nutrients and vitamins 26 transition and heavy metals as well as compoundshaving hydrophobic organic structures react with humic acid reactivity of humic acid towards these agents enable it to be effective for removal of many pollutants 27 in the present work new biosorbent material humic acid coated cellulose was developed using soda bleaching technique to extract cellulose from rice husk followed by its coating with humic acid experimental results clearly indicate this new developed material efficiently reduce the elevated levels of ni and cr in aquatic bodies without compromising the water quality parameters 2 experimental 2 1 reagents

solutions standards reagents standard stock solutions 5000 mg l 1 of chromium iii and nickel ii in hno3 were used for preparation of experimental solution the ph adjustment was done with hno3 and naoh depending upon the requirements 2 2 extraction of cellulose from rice husk rice husk 5 kg was collected from a rice mill in panvel maharashtra india and were dried at 50 c for 12 h and stored the rice husk was dried in glass perti dishes 10 dishes of 15 cm diameter were used to accommodate rice husk inside an oven the moisture content of rice husk was about 4 before drying and after drying it was 0 1 cellulose was extracted from rice husk according to method reported in the literature 28 31 in a typical process 10 g of rice husk was weighed and added to 18 200 ml of naoh solution in a beaker this was then heated to 70 c under continuous stirring for 1 h after cooling down the solution was filtered and washed with di waterseveral times retentate was then added to hypochlorite solution for bleaching it was then filtered through millipore filtration assembly using 0 45 μm filter paper the retentate was dried keeping under ir lamp philips ir lamp of 250 w 220 v ac and the dried mass was then powdered using havells premio i mixer grinders 750 w in pulse mode this is the cellulose powder cell rh which was stored and used for further experiments 2 3 preparation of humic acid coated cellulose 5gm of cellulose powder extracted from rice husk was treated with 50 ml of 0 1 alkaline humic acid solution for 24 h aldrich humic acid powder cat no 53680 was used for providing the coating the mixture was kept in orbital shaker overnight the resultant solid material humic acid coated cellulose extracted from rice husk ha cell rh was filtered out it was washed first using 0 1 n naoh solution to get rid of the free humic acid and later on several times by demineralized water the composite material was dried in an oven until constant weight moisture content 0 1 the process was repeated to obtain the ha cell rh powder in bulk 2 4 quantification of ni and cr inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer horiba activa s with simultaneous detector array solid state was used for the determination of ni and cr concentrations emission intensities for each elementat two different wavelengths were measured for some selective samples concentrations of ni and cr were also measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometer faas model savantaa σ australia with multialkali photomultiplier tube to cover entire wavelength range 175 900 nm air acetylene flame was used for

negative surface charge on the sorbent this is mainly because of the ionnisation of the organic groups cooh oh etc of the humic acid the second slope in the plot is due to the transportation of diffusion of the ni cr ions in the sorbate i e the humic acid layer over the cell rh the third region in the plot is due to the interaction of the ni cr ions with the core cellulose part of ha cell rh from the fig 10 it is also observed that slope of the three linear regions are in decreasing order which indicates the decrease in the rate of interaction consecutively 3 6 applicability of ha cell rh in real water samples different groundwater samples 5 no were taken to check the applicability of the sorbent in these water samples 20 ml of water samples spiked with 10 μg ml 1ni and cr each was filled in polypropylene bottles and a measured amount of sorbate were added and left for 8 h and then the sorbent wasfiltered and water samples were analyzed almost 100 removal of both the elements ni and cr was observed while using ha cell rh which shows the effectiveness of the developed sorbent for actual field application it is very important to test the leaching of the components of ha cell rh into the water system while treating with the sorbent drinking water quality parameters were tested before and after the treatment with ha cell rh values are given in table 2 no significance change in the values after the treatment suggest that the developed sorbent ha cell rh doesn t affect the water quality the unaltered doc value humic acid concentration suggest no leaching of the components humic acid cellulose into the water system 4 conclusion in the present work a novel biosorbent humic acid coated cellulose derived from rice husk was developed to take up chromium and nickel from potable water without compromising primary water quality parameters developed sorbent was characterized and used for the uptake of chromium and nickel from aquatic medium it was observed that the humic acid coating over the cellulose significantly increase the sorption of the ni and cr uptake study carried out in batch method showed more than 95 sorption of both chromium and nickel in the concentration range of 5 to 100 ppm various parameters like ph equilibrium time were optimized sorption isotherm followed the langmuir method and the sorption capacity was evaluated as 12 41 mg g 1 for ni and 19 39 mg g 1 for cr
