20470,the complex offshore foundation is required to adapt to the extreme marine climate such as tripile tripod pile group foundations for this reason it is of great importance to consider an advanced tri usaf analogous to tripile since previous studies only take into account monousaf in which scouring tests of a usaf were performed and influences of steady currents waves as well as the combination of waves and currents were evaluated in this work a series of scouring tests were conducted computationally by using a vof method to capture the sharp interface and finite volume finite difference method to solve rans equations combined with sediment transport equations in order to explore the characteristics of local scour around a tri usaf with different arrangements in sand seabed under steady current state the three dimensional scour model was established and validated against available experimental data reported in the literature and own measured data furthermore parametric analysis was performed regarding the influence of spacing ratio and froude number the predicted results imply that flow field and scour characteristics involving a tri usaf are more complicated than those of monousaf and the impact of the neighbouring structure is interpreted differently compared with piles as tri usaf possesses several specific components keywords tri usaf local scour arrangement spacing ratio froude number steady current cfd 1 introduction monopile is one of the most commonly used offshore foundations over the last several decades 81 of offshore wind turbines in europe are supported by monopile at the end of 2019 with the rapid expansion of offshore wind farms across the world several types of offshore foundations have to be created for application in distinctive offshore environments for instance gravity based foundation bucket foundation jacket foundation semi submersible floating platform foundation etc have been successfully installed to support offshore structures in different regions in particular suction bucket foundation or suction anchor foundation has gradually been an alternative of monopile since the early 1980s attributing to its numerous advantages simplicity easy installation low noise and high loading capacity one of its most notable features is that the bucket foundation can be directly inserted into the seafloor through a driving force induced by the difference of pressure inside and outside of the bucket with a suction pump attached at the top of the bucket as a result the time request for foundation installation and corresponding cost might be reduced to a large extent it is already proved that a novel umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf designed by the authors group has the potential capability to prevent scouring issues as shown in fig 1 the maximum equilibrium scour depth for the usaf is rather double that of a conventional suction anchor foundation subjected to the actions of combined waves and currents yang et al 2020 apart from this the usaf has extra peculiarities such as higher bearing performance due to its specific component more detailed information associated with the usaf can be referred to ref liu and li 2014 li et al 2014 2015 however in light of the increasing of the complicated loads in the upper part of the wind turbine monopile or monobucket foundation may not be properly suitable in this situation given that either pile group foundations or tripiles and tripods were proposed to resolve this problem as they convert the external overturning moments into mostly axial tension or compression loads which are exerted on the top of each pile or bucket note that tripile is essentially different from tripod foundation since the former carries a tripod crosspiece at the water surface to support the wind turbine whereas the latter consists of three steel tubes welded together at an angle of 120 to form a tripod carrying a precisely centred central tube in which the tower is installed more recently a tri pod suction bucket foundation has been successfully applied in south korea ryu et al 2017 in spite of the aforementioned key features that the suction bucket foundation has the scouring issue requires to be considered carefully regarding offshore foundation design and management like conventional monopile as a shallow foundation the suction bucket foundation is more susceptible to the local scour compared with monopile it is reported that most of the piers in the river and offshore foundations in the offshore region become unstable or even collapse due to the unexpected large scour depth and width around the structures exposed to the steady currents or waves especially for the extreme climate condition such as floods tidal storms therefore the studies focused on the local sour around a pier or monopile have been increased exponentially and the mechanisms influencing factors on scouring process prediction formula of maximum scour depth have been investigated sumer and fredsøe 1992 sumer and fredsøe 2001a 2001b boon et al 2004 whitehouse et al 2006 whitehouse et al 2008 nielsen et al 2013 qi and gao 2014 petersen et al 2015 larsen et al 2017 schendel et al 2018 song et al 2019 actually three basic physical mechanisms are acceptable with respect to the formation of local scour around a pile namely horseshoe vortex in front of the pile streamline contraction along the sides and wake vortices behind the pile the flow structure around a single usaf is described in fig 2 the bed shear stress has to be amplified arising from the above mentioned actions which in turn leads to sediment erosion at the vicinity of the pile a detailed analysis of the vortex system and the scouring mechanism was performed by niedoroda and dalton 1982 in addition to monopile the studies on local scour around a variety of suction bucket foundations were also conducted by some researchers stroescu et al 2016 shin et al 2017 yu et al 2016 2019 2020 2019 yang et al 2020 yao et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 due to the fact that the interaction and interference of the flow and sediment transport procedure around tripiles tripods group piles are more complicated compared with that of monopile or monobucket the scouring issue regarding those foundations has been received much attention one of the early experimental explorations on the scour around a pile group with various arrangements was made by hannah 1978 and he established a correlation between scour depth and pile spacing ratio hereafter salim and jones 1996 carried out a series of scouring tests to investigate the scour around pile group subjected to the current and they elucidated that the scour depth reduces with the increase of pile spacing ratio bayram and larson 2000 found the wave induced scour depth around pile groups in a real field is mainly dependent on the kc number keulegan carpenter number and also has a strong relationship between sediment number and pile reynolds number but kc number has a minor influence on scour width the observed trend is similar to the one reported by sumer and fredsøe 1998 lança et al 2013 conducted large quantities of long duration scouring tests for a pile group with the purpose of exploring the effect of pile spacing pile columns and attack angle on the sour evolution and maximum equilibrium scour depth two formulas for calculating the group pile factor were suggested diwedar 2013 claimed that the scour depth and length are increased after the pile spacing becomes large for all kinds of pile arrangements including tandem side by side and triangular configurations which is contrary to the previous findings the scour depth for any pile group case is larger than the single pile condition moreover a physically based formula allowing to predict the scour depth and length was proposed and validated against measurement evidence but the application of the equation is applicable for limited specific conditions ma et al 2018 carried out a set of laboratory scouring tests for examining the time development of scour depth around a dumbbell shaped pile group under unidirectional and tidal flows the observations are in accordance with those of sumer and fredsøe 2002 in which local scour around each pile and global scour around the pile group occur in both unidirectional and tidal flow conditions but the maximum scour depth resides at the central part of the upstream pile group for unidirectional flow whereas the location of maximum scour depth occurs at both central part of upstream and downstream pile group amini et al 2012 proposed an empirical equation for predicting the scour depth of a group of piles based on the experimental measurements considering various parameters pile spacing pile arrangements submergence ratio influencing scour characteristics it was evident that the predicted values reasonably match with the observed data yang et al 2020 conducted a number of experiments to explore the scour profiles around the group of piles with four kinds of arrangements namely tandem two piles square 2 2 piles rectangular 2 3 piles and staggered piles the influence of froude number and pile spacing on the scour properties was further investigated it is suggested that the maximum equilibrium scour depth decreases with the increase of pile spacing and the scour depth in the rear pile is less than that of the front pile the effect of pile spacing on the scour around pile group is more significant for a larger froude number the correlations between those two factors froude number and pile spacing concerned and the scour quantities scour area and volume were also given in their work in recent years with the development of supercomputer and numerical algorithms numerical models have been considerably improved and widely applied to various engineering applications many studies were already performed using numerical simulations to explore the scouring process around complex offshore foundations vasquez and walsh 2009 studied the local scour around a complex pier made of a large cap and 10 piles under the tidal flow by using numerical methods the predicted results show a qualitative agreement with the available measured data reported in the literature however their field observations have limited to only one kind of pile arrangement abdeldayem et al 2011 conducted scouring tests for a group of piles with a variety of arrangements and spacing ratios by employing ssiim cfd code the numerical results show that the spacing ratio has a significant influence on scour depth for a side by side configuration while negligible effect regarding a tandem arrangement with respect to the multiple columns and rows the scour depth decreases with the increase of the spacing ratio furthermore each pile of the group tends to behave like a single pile when the spacing ratio in ranges from 7 7 to 10 3 which is in accordance with the previously measured data salim and jones 1996 hamidi and siadatmousavi 2018 also found that the scour depth is increasing with the spacing ratio for a side by side two piles arrangement which is consistent with the observations of hannah 1978 they further investigated the impact of the angle of attack on the scour depth for a staggered arrangement the predicted trend is qualitatively the same as experimental data hannah 1978 but the scour depth at front of piles was underestimated whereas overestimated between the piles kim et al 2014 numerically investigated the local scour around two tandem and side by side piles under a clear water regime by using les methods coupled with a sediment transport model and morphodynamic model the results show that the local scour profiles are similar to that of a single pile for side by side arrangement when the pile spacing ratio is greater than 2 5 while the scour depth in front of the pile is less than that of a single pile when the pile spacing ratio is smaller than 3 75 in general the maximum scour depth increases with the distance decreasing in terms of tandem configuration the front pile has a strong effect on weakening the horseshoe vortex at the vicinity of the rear pile resulting in a lower value of scour depth and sediment accumulation at the nose of the rear pile when the pile spacing ratio is less than 3 75 in contrast the larger scour depth is detected around the rear pile when the pile spacing ratio is larger than 3 75 which implies the influence of the front pile will be reduced with the distance between each pile increasing interestingly the maximum scour depth increases with the distance until the peak value is reached and then decreases again with the purpose of clarifying the mechanism of local scour around three adjacent piles exposed to steady current a series of cfd calculations were carried out by solving the rans equations with a closure rng k ε turbulence model incorporated with a sediment transport model zhang et al 2017 the predicted results elucidate that the scour evolution and scour morphological properties for a pile group are significantly different from those of monopile the effects of different configurations of piles and corresponding spacing among each pile on the scour characteristics were also examined ahmad et al 2018 investigated the scour around two adjacent piles in a side by side arrangement under the wave action by using an open source cfd code called reef3d it was demonstrated that the scour depth increases with pile spacing ratio in the range of 0 0 3 and then decreases as distance increases for the spacing ratio ranging from 0 3 to 2 the scour depth was no longer changed once the spacing ratio is over 2 which is consistent with the measurements of sumer and fredsøe 1998 despite the fact that there are some contributions made on concerning the scour phenomenon of monopile monobucket and pile group including tripiles understanding of local scour around complex offshore foundations is far from complete and the studies on scouring issue with respect to an offshore foundation linked to multi bucket foundations are rarely found in the literature in order to fill the gap in the research this work is a preliminary attempt to investigate the scouring issue of the offshore foundation having multi suction buckets thereby tripile associated with usaf tri usaf is considered rather than more complex tri pod usaf as illuminated in fig 3 furthermore the effects of different foundation arrangements the spacing ratio between each usaf and froude number on the scour profiles are examined 2 numerical methodology in this work a commercial cfd package flow 3d v11 0 3 2013 was used to carry out numerical scouring tests by solving all governing equations using a finite volume finite difference approach in a fixed eulerian grid in order to accurately capture the free surface dynamics such as the water air interface the volume of fluid vof method was adopted one specific algorithm called favortm fractional area volume obstacle representation was employed to define the fractional face areas and fractional volumes of the cells which are open to fluid flow therefore wall boundaries and other solid components like offshore foundation were embedded in the orthogonal structured mesh and there was no need to optimize the mesh for adapting the surface of the complex geometry during the pre processing flow3d 2013 to achieve this algorithm all partial differential equations were multiplied by volume and area porosity functions the details of the cfd models have been described by hirt and sicilian 1985 1993 considering the numerical strategy an automatic time step adjustment was selected to ensure the stability and convergence of simulation the first order numerical scheme was adopted to discretize each term in the momentum equation generalized minimal residual gmres algorithm applied is aimed at iteratively solving the linear system of pressure equations derived from continuity equation of fluid due to fewer iterations needed to get converged in comparison to another two pressure solvers provided in cfd codes the default settings for each solver were maintained concerning the convergence criterion basically all cfd calculations were not stopped until the scour depth was kept unchanged in general most of the cfd calculations in this study required about 312 h cpu time using a computer with intel core i7 4790 cpu 3 60 ghz 3 60 ghz and 8 00 gb ram 2 1 mathematical model 2 1 1 mass conservation and rans equations the computations of fluid are based on mass conservation equation and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to evaluate the time averaged velocity and pressure fields in the three dimensional computational domain the governing equations for incompressible viscous fluid read as below 1 x i u i a i 0 2 u i t 1 v f u j a j u i x j 1 ρ p x i b i f i 3 f i 1 v f τ w i ρ x j a j ν ν t u i x j u j x i where v f is the volume fraction of the fluid in each cell a i is the fractional areas open to the flow b i is the body acceleration τ w i is the wall shear stress in the subscript directions f i is the viscous acceleration 2 1 2 turbulence model among several turbulence models available in flow 3d the rng k ε turbulence model has certain advantages of predicting the turbulent flow around an obstruction since the rng model allows systematically removing the smallest scales of turbulence and calculating their effect on the remaining flow scales as known the rng model is capable of well capture the flow field regarding extensive separations and recirculation thus the rng k ε turbulence model is selected here and the transport equations are as follows 4 k t 1 v f u j a j k x i p k b d i f f k ε 5 ε t 1 v f a j u j ε x i c 1 ε k p k c 3 b d i f f ε c 2 ε 2 k where p k is the production of turbulent kinetic energy b is the turbulence energy produced by the buoyancy force diff k and diff ε are the diffusion coefficient for turbulence kinetic energy and corresponding dissipation rate respectively c 1 c 2 c 3 are the non dimensional parameters defined by users 2 1 3 sediment transport model sediment transport is mainly dominated by the following four mechanisms namely entrainment suspended load transport bedload transport and deposition entrainment occurs once the bed shear stress is larger than the critical value it is the process that turbulent eddies remove the grains from the top of the packed sediment and carry them to suspend after that the flow carries the grains into a certain height above the packed bed which is known as suspended load transport bedload transport indicates the response of grains to the bed shear stress induced by the approaching fluid they tend to roll hop and slides along the packed bed due to the existence of gravity buoyancy and friction the suspended grains have to settle down resulting in deposition on the packed bed the sediment scour model assumes multiple non cohesive sediment grains with different properties including grain size mass density critical shear stress angle of repose and parameters for entrainment and transport the model estimates the motion of the sediments by predicting the erosion advection and deposition of the sediments the entrainment lift velocity of sediment is computed according to the reference mastbergen and van den berg 2003 6 u l i f t s α s n s d s 0 3 θ s θ c r s 1 5 g d s ρ s ρ f ρ f where the dimensionless parameter d s 7 d s d s ρ f ρ s ρ f g μ f 2 1 3

volume of the fluid sediment mixture u s is the sediment velocity of species s and γ f is the diffusion coefficient 2 2 computational domain and meshing the dimension of the computational domain used for all runs is 230 m in length 50 m in width and 25 m in height note that identifying the region of computational domain in which fully developed flow is reached indicating that the boundary layer occupies the entire flow depth in terms of free surface flows is a fundamental step to ensure the reliability of numerical model since the experimental data are usually measured in fully developed flow region in natural environments with alluvial and rough beds the development of the flow will definitely occur if there is enough field length thus the length of the computational domain requires to be long enough to achieve a fully developed flow state before the fluid approaching the structure due to no general criterion found in the open literature the evaluation of the development of the flow is done without the presence of a structure in the bed ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 and with the help of monitoring velocity turbulence quantities and stress profiles in the longitudinal direction a packed sediment bed composed of medium sand with a median diameter of 0 25 mm was created with a thickness of 11 12 m the front and behind of the sediment are the solid component baffle which cannot be eroded tri usaf model in stl format was imported into cfd codes the location of each usaf and the spacing ratio were modified by the translation tool to reach the required arrangements as shown in fig 4 the dimensions of the usaf used in experiments and cfd calculations are summarized in table 1 to reduce the computational effort a nested grid technique was applied to discretize the computational domain with a global cell size of 0 35 in which the extent of the local refinement around the suction anchor is 50 m 50 m and the size of the local grid is 0 17 as depicted in fig 4 the total number of cells in the grids is 14 6 million which not only reduces the number of units but also ensures the accuracy of the calculation it should be noted that the grid independent analysis has been done with three different mesh sizes namely the global grid 0 29 local grid 0 14 global grid 0 35 local grid 0 17 global grid 0 42 local grid 0 2 the second mesh configuration was selected because the solutions already reached grid convergence 2 3 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations proper boundary conditions need to be given indeed a wrong boundary condition can lead to unexpected simulation aborting thus it is of great importance to pay much attention to boundary conditions in this exploration boundary conditions applied in all simulations are demonstrated in fig 4 a specific velocity was attributed to the inlet the outflow was used to simulate the outlet where the gradient of each variable is zero even having the capability of helping reduce the reflection of flow and overcome the limitation of physical dimensions zhang et al 2017 therefore the adverse effect induced by the distance between structure and outlet boundary could be alleviated to large extent regardless of this advantage relatively long distance was still preferred in this study in order to avoid the influence the wall boundary was set at the bottom of the sediment which is equivalent to a no slip condition symmetry was distributed to the rest of the domain boundaries including the two sides and the top of the domain 3 experimental methods 3 1 experimental setup the souring tests were conducted in a wave flume fig 5 a at the lab of the coastal engineering environment ocean university of china the linear wave was generated by a piston type wave generator equipped at the end of the flume and a wave absorption with porous materials was positioned at the other end allowing to reduce any reflections that might occur during tests the dimension of the flume is 0 5 m in width 0 7 m in height and 14 m a sand basin of 0 6 m in thickness 2 5 m in length and 0 5 m in width was located in the central part of the flume a simple self design circular current system realized by a two phase pump was applied into wave flume with the purpose of evaluating the scouring profiles around the usaf exposed to the wave current actions on the other hand the measured data were made use of verifying the cfd model throughout the whole test an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv current meter was installed 5 m away from the usaf and 0 05 m above the sand bed to monitor the bottom velocity of the incoming current for the sake of determining the wave height period and other wave parameters in the flume a capacitive voltage wave height meter wg 55 was installed at the sides of the flume an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter equipped on the top of the flume was used to measure the scour depth along measuring lines and the whole topography 3 2 test conditions first of all a steel usaf plus a tube with a diameter d p of 0 1 the diameter in a real situation is 4 m thereby d p 4 40 explained below m was mounted in the middle part of the flume along its longitudinal axis to function as an anchor foundation then the sand was laid down to support the structure and to function as the eroding material in fact the usaf is initially designed for a specific region yellow river estuary where the typical seabed is mainly composed of silt and clay yang and liu 2018 due to the complex characteristics of those fine particles pure silt and sand were simply mixed as the testing sediment bed the sediment particle size is between 0 005 and 1 mm and the median diameter of the sand grains d s is 0 257 mm according to the similarity of gravity geometry and resistance sha 1963 the flow conditions imposed in experiments were obtained based on the actual environment in that region the flow velocity is 1 2 m s and the water depth is 15 m with a scale of 1 40 therefore the water depth h was maintained at 0 375 15 40 m for a steady current depth averaged velocity u and critical shields number θ cr are 0 189 1 2 40 m s and 0 0408 3 3 test procedure regarding this small scale test the maximum equilibrium scour depth was anticipated to be small therefore the initial condition of the sediment bed had to be kept fine enough to get rid of its influence on the final observations each run began with the levelling and flattening of the sand bed after which water was slowly added until the required water depth was reached afterwards the current generator was switched on five surveying lines were conducted at intervals of 2 h and the distance between the measuring points on the lines was 1 cm as illustrated in fig 5b when the last two successive runs reach similar scour depth the current generator was stopped and the water was slowly drained by a pump plus siphoning until the scour hole could be observed clearly topographical measurements of the scour hole were realized through an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter in a total station with a grid of 0 01 m 0 01 m fig 5b and the morphological profiles of the scour hole were acquired through a camera fig 6 4 validation of scouring model verification of the cfd model is of great value for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of further application so that this process has to become necessary for all numerical simulations making a comparison of predicted results and experimental data or analytical values has been widely used to validate the cfd model concerning the scouring issue in this study the measured data made by roulund et al 2005 was first considered to approach this goal although only a cylindrical pile was regarded as a test structure in their scouring experiments the flow field around the pile could be validated also one simple test condition is as follows water depth is 0 54 m bulk velocity is 0 326 m s and a pile mounted in a rigid bed with a diameter of 0 536 m the other condition concerning scouring has the following parameters water depth is 0 4 m bulk velocity is 0 46 m s pile diameter is 1 m the median diameter of sediment is 0 26 mm with a critical shields number of 0 0405 the comparison between the horizontal distribution of the current velocity calculated by the present model and the data from their test is illustrated in fig 7 a it is clear that the streamwise velocity in the upstream of the pile predicted by the present model is smaller than the experimental data whereas the calculated velocity for the downstream side is larger than the measurement additionally it is also shown that the present model performed well in capturing the vertical velocity in the upstream side of the single pile while the obvious deviation for the downstream of the pile can be observed fig 7b the probable reason might be the large pressure gradient and vortices that occur in those regions resulting in a strong turbulent flow which is difficult to be accurately predicted by the eddy viscosity turbulence model even though there are some discrepancies between the predictions and the experimental data the velocity distribution is basically the same the time development curve of scour depth is also compared between measurement and cfd calculation as shown in fig 7c overall the numerical solution is in agreement with the experimental data the dimensionless scour depth s max d p gradually increases exponentially over time for both methods although the scour depth predicted by the present model is lower than that of the experiment to further verify the scour model for the usaf structure the scour development curve over time for the measuring point data x 0 08 y 0 08 and the scour depth of line y4 fig 5b measured in our experiment were considered as a reference to validate the cfd calculations as shown in fig 8 the numerical result shows that the time required to reach the scouring balance is lower than that of the scouring test fig 8a the equilibrium time predicted by the current model is 16 h while the measured one is 18 h the possible reason why the numerical simulation seemly produces a faster scour might be the scour process is totally continuous during the calculation as interpreted by roulund et al 2005 a steady state solver was adopted in their simulations where intrinsic unsteadiness of scouring phenomenon has not been accounted for resulting in the deviation of equilibrium time since transient solver was already utilized here another reason probably lies in the source of uncertainty of numerical modelling approach such as the turbulence model in this work the rng k ε turbulence model was applied to resolve turbulence quantities but it is still a linear eddy viscosity based model despite it has some advantages regarding adverse pressure gradient flow and curvature streamline flow compared with the standard k ε model it is evident that the trend for the scour depth is similar between cfd and experiment however between 4 h and 14 h the predicted scour depth is smaller than the experimental data and the maximum difference is 25 9 as can be seen from fig 8b the scour characteristics along this measuring line are fundamentally similar for most of the positions regardless of the predicted distribution slightly shifted towards the streamwise direction with a distance of 0 04 m the above analysis demonstrates that the predicted results are in fairly good agreement with the experimental evidence which suggests that the current model is reasonable and reliable thus it should be concluded that the present model has the capability to capture the flow field around the usaf and can be used for further investigations 5 results and discussion the main objective of this study is to investigate the scour characteristics around the tri usaf with respect to the different arrangements it should be noted that the scaling issue of laboratory tests and cfd calculations has not been accounted for in this section for this reason particle size water depth and velocity used here are irrelevant to those involved in experiments which are simply decided on the grounds of the climate in the yellow river estuary region as listed in table 2 a series of cfd calculations were performed in which three types of configurations varying with spacing ratio are considered the first arrangement is composed of three usaf where two usaf symmetrically distribute in front of another obviously the geometry of the whole tri usaf is an equilateral triangle in the second scenario one usaf resides in front of another two but the angle of attack denoting the angle between flow direction and symmetric line of tri usaf is 15 in the last configuration one usaf is located in front of another two with zero angle of attack the spacing ratios g d p of each arrangement are 4 5 6 7 each test is named by the composition of rgu for instance r1 indicates the first type of arrangement g4 represents the spacing ratio is 4 u05 denotes the velocity is 0 5 m s corresponding to the froude number of 0 0505 the sediment embedded in each case is made up of uniformly graded medium sands with a median diameter of 0 25 mm the froude number is changed from 0 0505 to 0 1515 corresponding to the bulk velocity 0 5 m s 1 5 m s besides the other property of sand and flow conditions used in the cfd calculations as well as the maximum scour depth of each run are also given in table 2 5 1 flow field around monousaf and tri usaf before analyzing the scour characteristics understanding the flow structure at the vicinity of the offshore foundation is of great value since the modification of the flow field after passing the obstruction changes the bed shear stress which in turn probably leads to the movement of sand as mentioned before three mechanisms relating to the local scour around monousaf are similar to those of monopile namely horseshoe vortex streamline contraction and wake vortices the velocity fields of monousaf and tri usaf at the end of the calculation time predicted by the current model are depicted in fig 9 undoubtedly the flow has reached a fully developed condition before attaching the structure because the domain length in upstream is long enough the fully developed boundary layer above the sediment associated with a strong velocity gradient can be clearly detected in fig 9a b which is known as the main factor for inducing the horseshoe vortex the wake region is also captured behind the monousaf as can be seen from fig 9a b the horseshoe vortex occurs in front of the monousaf near the seabed and the streamline contraction with accelerating velocity appears at two sides of the monousaf under the combination of those actions local scour around the monousaf is gradually starting developing and finally tending to be equilibrium fig 9b also suggests that the horseshoe vortex is somewhat weaker than streamline contraction as well as wake vortices for the suction foundation like monousaf as a consequence the scour holes are mainly formed at the two sides and downstream of the structure which is consistent with the observations of yu et al 2019 indeed this phenomenon is different from scouring evolution around a monopile since the maximum scour depth always happens in the front of the monopile due to strong horseshoe vortex action as reported by unger and hager 2007 the horseshoe vortex can only be developed into a full system provided that the scour hole is intensified in upstream of the pile therefore the skirt part of the suction foundation and even the branches on the monousaf can protect the offshore structure from scouring problems to a large degree compared with the monopile generally the maximum scour depth for a monopile when it comes to structure design can be reached several times its diameter in the case of the extreme marine state whereas the maximum scour depth for the monousaf is remarkably reduced in the light of tri usaf the situation is very like to the individual usaf as shown in fig 9c d for the sake of brevity only the results with respect to case r3g4u1 present here observation of velocity fields is a typical way to recognize vortex system and accelerating velocity filed around each usaf alternatively vortex structure can be easily visualized based on several criteria in this study the q criterion is selected in which a vortex is defined as a connected fluid region with a positive second invariant of the velocity gradient basically the q criterion indicates the local balance between shear strain rate and vorticity magnitude defining vortices as areas where the vorticity magnitude is larger compared with the magnitude of rate of strain on the grounds of this criterion fig 10 illustrates the visualization of three dimensional vortices structure made up by the u shaped necklace like vortex folding around each usaf and lee wake vortices appearing at the downstream also indicating that the wake vortices behind each usaf play a major role due to the fact that the existence of skirt and branches regarding usaf resulting in the smallest spacing ratio of 4 the impact induced by the upstream usaf on the downstream one is not expected to be as remarkable as the situation of the pile group in which for instance the separated boundary layer around the upstream pile could be either directly enclose to the behind one or attach the front surface of the downstream one yang et al 2018 nevertheless the flow field of tri usaf appears still more complicated than that of monousaf after the flow passes through the upstream usaf the streamwise velocity at the two sides of downstream usaf is significantly accelerated those impacts exerted by the neighbouring structure on the rests are accounted for while processing the numerical results 5 2 temporal development of maximum scour depth fig 11 shows the development of scour holes around the tri usaf with time variations regarding the case r3g4u1 which is similar to that of monousaf but the impacts of extra structures appearing in tri usaf at the initial stage of scouring a series of small scour holes occur at the locations between two anchor branches subsequently the small scour holes gradually become larger and then some of them unify to be an entire hole not only the scour is deepening but the range of the scour hole is extending specifically the scour holes residing in the middle of the two downstream usaf tend to be emerged and overlapped the scour depth regarding the two downstream usaf is deeper than that of upstream one probably due to the combined action of velocity acceleration and wake vortices induced by the upstream usaf finally all of the scour holes achieve the largest scour depth and the scouring process is in a typical equilibrium state the maximum equilibrium scour depth is 0 129dp which occurs between two anchor branches close to the skirt in downstream on the other hand the sand deposition usually appears at the upstream of each usaf on the surface of anchor branches and skirt because of the interaction among horseshoe vortex buoyancy force and gravity force the maximum deposition height is 0 041dp occurring on the surface of the anchor branch and skirt in the front of the upstream usaf figs 12 14 illustrate the time evolution of the maximum scour depth regarding all arrangements varying with the spacing ratio at the velocity of 1 m s froude number 0 101 overall one of the peculiar features is that the curve of maximum scour depth development with respect to tri usaf appears rather distinctive arising from the extra structures compared with that of monousaf in which the shape can be practically fitted using an exponential function however at the initial 100 s the development curve of monousaf and tri usaf coincides three stages like monopile could be roughly detected namely quick scouring slow rate scouring and equilibrium scouring stages although some sub stages appear in the main stage in terms of tri usaf scouring process additionally the equilibrium time for all cases is around 1800 s excluding cases r1g6u1 r1g7u1 r3g6u1 r3g7u1 as anticipated the maximum scour depth for tri usaf at any arrangement and spacing ratio is larger than that of monousaf 0 0613dp regardless of some cases having not reached an equilibrium state as for the first and third arrangements with zero attack angle the maximum scour depth tends to enlarge at a similar scouring rate after 1800 s in the case of spacing ratio higher than 6 the shape of the curves is qualitatively the same as each other except for the case in which the spacing ratio is 4 the difference of arrangements between the second and third is a result of the angle of attack qualitatively speaking the time development curve of maximum scour depth for the second arrangement has negligible difference among each spacing ratio irrespective of the maximum scour depth slightly change after 850 s concerning the spacing ratio of 7 interestingly the developing process of the maximum scour depth between 650 s and 1700 s for the smallest spacing ratio regarding the third arrangement seems considerably strange where the scouring rate changes from quasi equilibrium state to be nearly the same as the initial stage before real equilibrium condition approaching which has never been found in scouring phenomenon regarding pile foundations in spite of those similarities the time evolution of the maximum scour depth varies from arrangements and spacing ratio from a quantitative point of view 5 3 morphological characteristics to observe the predicted scour shape scour range and scour depth figs 15 17 demonstrate the morphological characteristics of tri usaf involving three types of arrangements with different spacing ratios for the froude number of 0 101 in terms of the first arrangement as shown in fig 15 the sediment always deposits on the surface of the anchor branch and skirt of each usaf whereas the scour holes appear between two branches distributed around sides and behind each usaf the morphological profile presents a typically symmetrical distribution the largest deposition 0 223 m occurs in the downstream usaf at the smallest spacing ratio and the corresponding position is gradually transferred upstream as the spacing ratio increases additionally scour holes residing in the middle of two upstream usaf interact with each other which disappears when the spacing ratio becomes large instead the deepest scour depth appears in the case of a spacing ratio of 7 about 0 364 m regarding the second and third arrangements in which the difference arising from the angle of attack is focused the scour characteristics of these arrangements involving different spacing ratios are depicted in figs 16 17 in spite of this they can still be explained using analogous mechanisms since the angle of attack is small both largest deposition height and scour depth occur in the case of the smallest spacing ratio compared with the previous arrangement the site related to the largest deposition is a little different and the scour range between two anchor branches distributed around sides of usaf seems extended along the longitudinal direction of the anchor branch as expected the scour profile is not symmetrically distributed anymore regarding the second arrangement 5 4 the effect of spacing ratio on maximum scour depth fig 18 demonstrates the impact of the spacing ratio on the maximum scour depth with respect to three arrangements obviously the dependence of the spacing ratio on the maximum scour depth regarding the first and third arrangement is similar regardless of the quantities the maximum scour depth is decreased remarkably from the spacing ratio of 4 5 it seems that the maximum scour depth is weekly affected by the spacing ratio after over 6 moreover the trend allows determining a minimum value of maximum scour depth at the spacing ratio of 5 the largest value of maximum scour depth appears at the spacing ratio of 4 when it comes to the first and second arrangements note that the quantity of the third arrangement is more or less 1 7 times that of the first arrangement indicating that the impact of one usaf in the upstream is significant than that of two usaf in the upstream as the flow accelerates after pass the upstream usaf and amplifies the shear stress around two downstream usaf while the flow comes from the middle of two upstream usaf will not allow strongly modify the flow field around one downstream usaf even at the smallest spacing ratio in terms of the second arrangement the maximum scour depth reduces as the increase of spacing ratio altogether the recommendation for tri usaf arrangement could be the first and third arrangement with the spacing ratio of 5 as a matter of fact only a 15 angle of attack is considered in this study so that it is too early to confirm the effect of this factor nevertheless this analysis shows evidence that the angle of attack has a certain effect and should be taken into account while addressing the scouring issue 5 5 the effect of froude number on maximum scour depth for the sake of computational effort this parametric analysis is only made for the third arrangement fig 19 shows the effect of the froude number on the maximum scour depth regarding the third arrangement with different spacing ratios in general the maximum scour depth increases as the froude number increasing no matter which spacing ratio is the trend is likely to be a straight line with the same slope provided that the froude number is over 0 101 for the conditions having a spacing ratio less than 6 furthermore the highest maximum scour depth always attributes to the smallest spacing ratio for this reason this kind of situation must be avoided in reality in the case of a low froude number less than 0 101 broadly speaking there is no significant difference of maximum scour depth observed among different spacing ratios except for the case r3g4u in which the value is much larger than the other three conditions fig 20 illustrates the morphological feature of each case at different froude numbers it worth mentioning that only some representative results involving the smallest spacing ratio are presented here overall both the deposition height and scour depth increases with the increases of the froude number the maximum value of which is 0 25 m and 0 97 m respectively however considerable deposition is distributed in downstream of each usaf at the lowest froude number while the largest value of deposition height appears in the upstream of each usaf concerning a higher froude number the scour holes residing in the middle of two downstream usaf are enlarging and emerging as the froude number increases in the light of a higher froude number one of the peculiarities is the scour hole appearing around two sides of each usaf with large extension which can be interpreted as the mechanism inducing scour at the edge of scour protection structure around a monopile also the range of edge scour at downstream is larger than that of upstream because of the velocity acceleration besides the place far away from the tri usaf witness the scouring phenomenon probably due to the turbulence induced by tri usaf remaining the impact 6 summary and conclusions this study is a preliminary attempt to investigate the local scour characteristics of a complex tri usaf with several types of arrangements in the sandy seabed under the action of the steady current using the cfd modeling approach based on the computational results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 unlike monousaf the flow field around tri usaf seems complicated due to the impact exerted by additional structures which result in velocity acceleration although the physical mechanism leading to local scour around tri usaf is also justified by vortex system and streamline contraction besides the possible interpretation related to piles is definitely different from that of tri usaf due to specific components on the other hand the q criterion has been successfully applied to reproduce the three dimensional horseshoe vortex and wake vortices 2 time evolution of maximum scour hole regarding tri usaf is rather distinctive compared with that of monousaf in which the trend can be practically fitted using an exponential function some sub stages appear in three main developing stages in spite of qualitative similarity the time evolution of the maximum scour depth varies from arrangements and spacing ratio from a quantitative point of view 3 the first and third arrangement of tri usaf with a spacing ratio of 5 is recommended since the minimum value of the maximum scour depth is found the impact of one usaf in the upstream is significant than that of two usaf in the upstream the analysis shows a piece of evidence that angle of attack has certain effects on the scouring process but further study requires to be performed with respect to unresolved issues as only a 15 angle of attack is considered in this work 4 the scouring process strongly relates to the froude number in general the maximum scour depth and scour range increase with the increases of froude number at a low froude number less than 0 101 no significant difference of maximum scour depth is observed among different spacing ratios except for the case with the smallest spacing ratio in terms of the higher froude number the highest maximum scour depth always happens to the smallest spacing ratio thereby it should be avoided in reality credit authorship contribution statement qi yang conceptualization numerical methodology cfd calculations writing original draft writing review editing

20470,the complex offshore foundation is required to adapt to the extreme marine climate such as tripile tripod pile group foundations for this reason it is of great importance to consider an advanced tri usaf analogous to tripile since previous studies only take into account monousaf in which scouring tests of a usaf were performed and influences of steady currents waves as well as the combination of waves and currents were evaluated in this work a series of scouring tests were conducted computationally by using a vof method to capture the sharp interface and finite volume finite difference method to solve rans equations combined with sediment transport equations in order to explore the characteristics of local scour around a tri usaf with different arrangements in sand seabed under steady current state the three dimensional scour model was established and validated against available experimental data reported in the literature and own measured data furthermore parametric analysis was performed regarding the influence of spacing ratio and froude number the predicted results imply that flow field and scour characteristics involving a tri usaf are more complicated than those of monousaf and the impact of the neighbouring structure is interpreted differently compared with piles as tri usaf possesses several specific components keywords tri usaf local scour arrangement spacing ratio froude number steady current cfd 1 introduction monopile is one of the most commonly used offshore foundations over the last several decades 81 of offshore wind turbines in europe are supported by monopile at the end of 2019 with the rapid expansion of offshore wind farms across the world several types of offshore foundations have to be created for application in distinctive offshore environments for instance gravity based foundation bucket foundation jacket foundation semi submersible floating platform foundation etc have been successfully installed to support offshore structures in different regions in particular suction bucket foundation or suction anchor foundation has gradually been an alternative of monopile since the early 1980s attributing to its numerous advantages simplicity easy installation low noise and high loading capacity one of its most notable features is that the bucket foundation can be directly inserted into the seafloor through a driving force induced by the difference of pressure inside and outside of the bucket with a suction pump attached at the top of the bucket as a result the time request for foundation installation and corresponding cost might be reduced to a large extent it is already proved that a novel umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf designed by the authors group has the potential capability to prevent scouring issues as shown in fig 1 the maximum equilibrium scour depth for the usaf is rather double that of a conventional suction anchor foundation subjected to the actions of combined waves and currents yang et al 2020 apart from this the usaf has extra peculiarities such as higher bearing performance due to its specific component more detailed information associated with the usaf can be referred to ref liu and li 2014 li et al 2014 2015 however in light of the increasing of the complicated loads in the upper part of the wind turbine monopile or monobucket foundation may not be properly suitable in this situation given that either pile group foundations or tripiles and tripods were proposed to resolve this problem as they convert the external overturning moments into mostly axial tension or compression loads which are exerted on the top of each pile or bucket note that tripile is essentially different from tripod foundation since the former carries a tripod crosspiece at the water surface to support the wind turbine whereas the latter consists of three steel tubes welded together at an angle of 120 to form a tripod carrying a precisely centred central tube in which the tower is installed more recently a tri pod suction bucket foundation has been successfully applied in south korea ryu et al 2017 in spite of the aforementioned key features that the suction bucket foundation has the scouring issue requires to be considered carefully regarding offshore foundation design and management like conventional monopile as a shallow foundation the suction bucket foundation is more susceptible to the local scour compared with monopile it is reported that most of the piers in the river and offshore foundations in the offshore region become unstable or even collapse due to the unexpected large scour depth and width around the structures exposed to the steady currents or waves especially for the extreme climate condition such as floods tidal storms therefore the studies focused on the local sour around a pier or monopile have been increased exponentially and the mechanisms influencing factors on scouring process prediction formula of maximum scour depth have been investigated sumer and fredsøe 1992 sumer and fredsøe 2001a 2001b boon et al 2004 whitehouse et al 2006 whitehouse et al 2008 nielsen et al 2013 qi and gao 2014 petersen et al 2015 larsen et al 2017 schendel et al 2018 song et al 2019 actually three basic physical mechanisms are acceptable with respect to the formation of local scour around a pile namely horseshoe vortex in front of the pile streamline contraction along the sides and wake vortices behind the pile the flow structure around a single usaf is described in fig 2 the bed shear stress has to be amplified arising from the above mentioned actions which in turn leads to sediment erosion at the vicinity of the pile a detailed analysis of the vortex system and the scouring mechanism was performed by niedoroda and dalton 1982 in addition to monopile the studies on local scour around a variety of suction bucket foundations were also conducted by some researchers stroescu et al 2016 shin et al 2017 yu et al 2016 2019 2020 2019 yang et al 2020 yao et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 due to the fact that the interaction and interference of the flow and sediment transport procedure around tripiles tripods group piles are more complicated compared with that of monopile or monobucket the scouring issue regarding those foundations has been received much attention one of the early experimental explorations on the scour around a pile group with various arrangements was made by hannah 1978 and he established a correlation between scour depth and pile spacing ratio hereafter salim and jones 1996 carried out a series of scouring tests to investigate the scour around pile group subjected to the current and they elucidated that the scour depth reduces with the increase of pile spacing ratio bayram and larson 2000 found the wave induced scour depth around pile groups in a real field is mainly dependent on the kc number keulegan carpenter number and also has a strong relationship between sediment number and pile reynolds number but kc number has a minor influence on scour width the observed trend is similar to the one reported by sumer and fredsøe 1998 lança et al 2013 conducted large quantities of long duration scouring tests for a pile group with the purpose of exploring the effect of pile spacing pile columns and attack angle on the sour evolution and maximum equilibrium scour depth two formulas for calculating the group pile factor were suggested diwedar 2013 claimed that the scour depth and length are increased after the pile spacing becomes large for all kinds of pile arrangements including tandem side by side and triangular configurations which is contrary to the previous findings the scour depth for any pile group case is larger than the single pile condition moreover a physically based formula allowing to predict the scour depth and length was proposed and validated against measurement evidence but the application of the equation is applicable for limited specific conditions ma et al 2018 carried out a set of laboratory scouring tests for examining the time development of scour depth around a dumbbell shaped pile group under unidirectional and tidal flows the observations are in accordance with those of sumer and fredsøe 2002 in which local scour around each pile and global scour around the pile group occur in both unidirectional and tidal flow conditions but the maximum scour depth resides at the central part of the upstream pile group for unidirectional flow whereas the location of maximum scour depth occurs at both central part of upstream and downstream pile group amini et al 2012 proposed an empirical equation for predicting the scour depth of a group of piles based on the experimental measurements considering various parameters pile spacing pile arrangements submergence ratio influencing scour characteristics it was evident that the predicted values reasonably match with the observed data yang et al 2020 conducted a number of experiments to explore the scour profiles around the group of piles with four kinds of arrangements namely tandem two piles square 2 2 piles rectangular 2 3 piles and staggered piles the influence of froude number and pile spacing on the scour properties was further investigated it is suggested that the maximum equilibrium scour depth decreases with the increase of pile spacing and the scour depth in the rear pile is less than that of the front pile the effect of pile spacing on the scour around pile group is more significant for a larger froude number the correlations between those two factors froude number and pile spacing concerned and the scour quantities scour area and volume were also given in their work in recent years with the development of supercomputer and numerical algorithms numerical models have been considerably improved and widely applied to various engineering applications many studies were already performed using numerical simulations to explore the scouring process around complex offshore foundations vasquez and walsh 2009 studied the local scour around a complex pier made of a large cap and 10 piles under the tidal flow by using numerical methods the predicted results show a qualitative agreement with the available measured data reported in the literature however their field observations have limited to only one kind of pile arrangement abdeldayem et al 2011 conducted scouring tests for a group of piles with a variety of arrangements and spacing ratios by employing ssiim cfd code the numerical results show that the spacing ratio has a significant influence on scour depth for a side by side configuration while negligible effect regarding a tandem arrangement with respect to the multiple columns and rows the scour depth decreases with the increase of the spacing ratio furthermore each pile of the group tends to behave like a single pile when the spacing ratio in ranges from 7 7 to 10 3 which is in accordance with the previously measured data salim and jones 1996 hamidi and siadatmousavi 2018 also found that the scour depth is increasing with the spacing ratio for a side by side two piles arrangement which is consistent with the observations of hannah 1978 they further investigated the impact of the angle of attack on the scour depth for a staggered arrangement the predicted trend is qualitatively the same as experimental data hannah 1978 but the scour depth at front of piles was underestimated whereas overestimated between the piles kim et al 2014 numerically investigated the local scour around two tandem and side by side piles under a clear water regime by using les methods coupled with a sediment transport model and morphodynamic model the results show that the local scour profiles are similar to that of a single pile for side by side arrangement when the pile spacing ratio is greater than 2 5 while the scour depth in front of the pile is less than that of a single pile when the pile spacing ratio is smaller than 3 75 in general the maximum scour depth increases with the distance decreasing in terms of tandem configuration the front pile has a strong effect on weakening the horseshoe vortex at the vicinity of the rear pile resulting in a lower value of scour depth and sediment accumulation at the nose of the rear pile when the pile spacing ratio is less than 3 75 in contrast the larger scour depth is detected around the rear pile when the pile spacing ratio is larger than 3 75 which implies the influence of the front pile will be reduced with the distance between each pile increasing interestingly the maximum scour depth increases with the distance until the peak value is reached and then decreases again with the purpose of clarifying the mechanism of local scour around three adjacent piles exposed to steady current a series of cfd calculations were carried out by solving the rans equations with a closure rng k ε turbulence model incorporated with a sediment transport model zhang et al 2017 the predicted results elucidate that the scour evolution and scour morphological properties for a pile group are significantly different from those of monopile the effects of different configurations of piles and corresponding spacing among each pile on the scour characteristics were also examined ahmad et al 2018 investigated the scour around two adjacent piles in a side by side arrangement under the wave action by using an open source cfd code called reef3d it was demonstrated that the scour depth increases with pile spacing ratio in the range of 0 0 3 and then decreases as distance increases for the spacing ratio ranging from 0 3 to 2 the scour depth was no longer changed once the spacing ratio is over 2 which is consistent with the measurements of sumer and fredsøe 1998 despite the fact that there are some contributions made on concerning the scour phenomenon of monopile monobucket and pile group including tripiles understanding of local scour around complex offshore foundations is far from complete and the studies on scouring issue with respect to an offshore foundation linked to multi bucket foundations are rarely found in the literature in order to fill the gap in the research this work is a preliminary attempt to investigate the scouring issue of the offshore foundation having multi suction buckets thereby tripile associated with usaf tri usaf is considered rather than more complex tri pod usaf as illuminated in fig 3 furthermore the effects of different foundation arrangements the spacing ratio between each usaf and froude number on the scour profiles are examined 2 numerical methodology in this work a commercial cfd package flow 3d v11 0 3 2013 was used to carry out numerical scouring tests by solving all governing equations using a finite volume finite difference approach in a fixed eulerian grid in order to accurately capture the free surface dynamics such as the water air interface the volume of fluid vof method was adopted one specific algorithm called favortm fractional area volume obstacle representation was employed to define the fractional face areas and fractional volumes of the cells which are open to fluid flow therefore wall boundaries and other solid components like offshore foundation were embedded in the orthogonal structured mesh and there was no need to optimize the mesh for adapting the surface of the complex geometry during the pre processing flow3d 2013 to achieve this algorithm all partial differential equations were multiplied by volume and area porosity functions the details of the cfd models have been described by hirt and sicilian 1985 1993 considering the numerical strategy an automatic time step adjustment was selected to ensure the stability and convergence of simulation the first order numerical scheme was adopted to discretize each term in the momentum equation generalized minimal residual gmres algorithm applied is aimed at iteratively solving the linear system of pressure equations derived from continuity equation of fluid due to fewer iterations needed to get converged in comparison to another two pressure solvers provided in cfd codes the default settings for each solver were maintained concerning the convergence criterion basically all cfd calculations were not stopped until the scour depth was kept unchanged in general most of the cfd calculations in this study required about 312 h cpu time using a computer with intel core i7 4790 cpu 3 60 ghz 3 60 ghz and 8 00 gb ram 2 1 mathematical model 2 1 1 mass conservation and rans equations the computations of fluid are based on mass conservation equation and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to evaluate the time averaged velocity and pressure fields in the three dimensional computational domain the governing equations for incompressible viscous fluid read as below 1 x i u i a i 0 2 u i t 1 v f u j a j u i x j 1 ρ p x i b i f i 3 f i 1 v f τ w i ρ x j a j ν ν t u i x j u j x i where v f is the volume fraction of the fluid in each cell a i is the fractional areas open to the flow b i is the body acceleration τ w i is the wall shear stress in the subscript directions f i is the viscous acceleration 2 1 2 turbulence model among several turbulence models available in flow 3d the rng k ε turbulence model has certain advantages of predicting the turbulent flow around an obstruction since the rng model allows systematically removing the smallest scales of turbulence and calculating their effect on the remaining flow scales as known the rng model is capable of well capture the flow field regarding extensive separations and recirculation thus the rng k ε turbulence model is selected here and the transport equations are as follows 4 k t 1 v f u j a j k x i p k b d i f f k ε 5 ε t 1 v f a j u j ε x i c 1 ε k p k c 3 b d i f f ε c 2 ε 2 k where p k is the production of turbulent kinetic energy b is the turbulence energy produced by the buoyancy force diff k and diff ε are the diffusion coefficient for turbulence kinetic energy and corresponding dissipation rate respectively c 1 c 2 c 3 are the non dimensional parameters defined by users 2 1 3 sediment transport model sediment transport is mainly dominated by the following four mechanisms namely entrainment suspended load transport bedload transport and deposition entrainment occurs once the bed shear stress is larger than the critical value it is the process that turbulent eddies remove the grains from the top of the packed sediment and carry them to suspend after that the flow carries the grains into a certain height above the packed bed which is known as suspended load transport bedload transport indicates the response of grains to the bed shear stress induced by the approaching fluid they tend to roll hop and slides along the packed bed due to the existence of gravity buoyancy and friction the suspended grains have to settle down resulting in deposition on the packed bed the sediment scour model assumes multiple non cohesive sediment grains with different properties including grain size mass density critical shear stress angle of repose and parameters for entrainment and transport the model estimates the motion of the sediments by predicting the erosion advection and deposition of the sediments the entrainment lift velocity of sediment is computed according to the reference mastbergen and van den berg 2003 6 u l i f t s α s n s d s 0 3 θ s θ c r s 1 5 g d s ρ s ρ f ρ f where the dimensionless parameter d s 7 d s d s ρ f ρ s ρ f g μ f 2 1 3

for all runs is 230 m in length 50 m in width and 25 m in height note that identifying the region of computational domain in which fully developed flow is reached indicating that the boundary layer occupies the entire flow depth in terms of free surface flows is a fundamental step to ensure the reliability of numerical model since the experimental data are usually measured in fully developed flow region in natural environments with alluvial and rough beds the development of the flow will definitely occur if there is enough field length thus the length of the computational domain requires to be long enough to achieve a fully developed flow state before the fluid approaching the structure due to no general criterion found in the open literature the evaluation of the development of the flow is done without the presence of a structure in the bed ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 and with the help of monitoring velocity turbulence quantities and stress profiles in the longitudinal direction a packed sediment bed composed of medium sand with a median diameter of 0 25 mm was created with a thickness of 11 12 m the front and behind of the sediment are the solid component baffle which cannot be eroded tri usaf model in stl format was imported into cfd codes the location of each usaf and the spacing ratio were modified by the translation tool to reach the required arrangements as shown in fig 4 the dimensions of the usaf used in experiments and cfd calculations are summarized in table 1 to reduce the computational effort a nested grid technique was applied to discretize the computational domain with a global cell size of 0 35 in which the extent of the local refinement around the suction anchor is 50 m 50 m and the size of the local grid is 0 17 as depicted in fig 4 the total number of cells in the grids is 14 6 million which not only reduces the number of units but also ensures the accuracy of the calculation it should be noted that the grid independent analysis has been done with three different mesh sizes namely the global grid 0 29 local grid 0 14 global grid 0 35 local grid 0 17 global grid 0 42 local grid 0 2 the second mesh configuration was selected because the solutions already reached grid convergence 2 3 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations proper boundary conditions need to be given indeed a wrong boundary condition can lead to unexpected simulation aborting thus it is of great importance to pay much attention to boundary conditions in this exploration boundary conditions applied in all simulations are demonstrated in fig 4 a specific velocity was attributed to the inlet the outflow was used to simulate the outlet where the gradient of each variable is zero even having the capability of helping reduce the reflection of flow and overcome the limitation of physical dimensions zhang et al 2017 therefore the adverse effect induced by the distance between structure and outlet boundary could be alleviated to large extent regardless of this advantage relatively long distance was still preferred in this study in order to avoid the influence the wall boundary was set at the bottom of the sediment which is equivalent to a no slip condition symmetry was distributed to the rest of the domain boundaries including the two sides and the top of the domain 3 experimental methods 3 1 experimental setup the souring tests were conducted in a wave flume fig 5 a at the lab of the coastal engineering environment ocean university of china the linear wave was generated by a piston type wave generator equipped at the end of the flume and a wave absorption with porous materials was positioned at the other end allowing to reduce any reflections that might occur during tests the dimension of the flume is 0 5 m in width 0 7 m in height and 14 m a sand basin of 0 6 m in thickness 2 5 m in length and 0 5 m in width was located in the central part of the flume a simple self design circular current system realized by a two phase pump was applied into wave flume with the purpose of evaluating the scouring profiles around the usaf exposed to the wave current actions on the other hand the measured data were made use of verifying the cfd model throughout the whole test an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv current meter was installed 5 m away from the usaf and 0 05 m above the sand bed to monitor the bottom velocity of the incoming current for the sake of determining the wave height period and other wave parameters in the flume a capacitive voltage wave height meter wg 55 was installed at the sides of the flume an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter equipped on the top of the flume was used to measure the scour depth along measuring lines and the whole topography 3 2 test conditions first of all a steel usaf plus a tube with a diameter d p of 0 1 the diameter in a real situation is 4 m thereby d p 4 40 explained below m was mounted in the middle part of the flume along its longitudinal axis to function as an anchor foundation then the sand was laid down to support the structure and to function as the eroding material in fact the usaf is initially designed for a specific region yellow river estuary where the typical seabed is mainly composed of silt and clay yang and liu 2018 due to the complex characteristics of those fine particles pure silt and sand were simply mixed as the testing sediment bed the sediment particle size is between 0 005 and 1 mm and the median diameter of the sand grains d s is 0 257 mm according to the similarity of gravity geometry and resistance sha 1963 the flow conditions imposed in experiments were obtained based on the actual environment in that region the flow velocity is 1 2 m s and the water depth is 15 m with a scale of 1 40 therefore the water depth h was maintained at 0 375 15 40 m for a steady current depth averaged velocity u and critical shields number θ cr are 0 189 1 2 40 m s and 0 0408 3 3 test procedure regarding this small scale test the maximum equilibrium scour depth was anticipated to be small therefore the initial condition of the sediment bed had to be kept fine enough to get rid of its influence on the final observations each run began with the levelling and flattening of the sand bed after which water was slowly added until the required water depth was reached afterwards the current generator was switched on five surveying lines were conducted at intervals of 2 h and the distance between the measuring points on the lines was 1 cm as illustrated in fig 5b when the last two successive runs reach similar scour depth the current generator was stopped and the water was slowly drained by a pump plus siphoning until the scour hole could be observed clearly topographical measurements of the scour hole were realized through an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter in a total station with a grid of 0 01 m 0 01 m fig 5b and the morphological profiles of the scour hole were acquired through a camera fig 6 4 validation of scouring model verification of the cfd model is of great value for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of further application so that this process has to become necessary for all numerical simulations making a comparison of predicted results and experimental data or analytical values has been widely used to validate the cfd model concerning the scouring issue in this study the measured data made by roulund et al 2005 was first considered to approach this goal although only a cylindrical pile was regarded as a test structure in their scouring experiments the flow field around the pile could be validated also one simple test condition is as follows water depth is 0 54 m bulk velocity is 0 326 m s and a pile mounted in a rigid bed with a diameter of 0 536 m the other condition concerning scouring has the following parameters water depth is 0 4 m bulk velocity is 0 46 m s pile diameter is 1 m the median diameter of sediment is 0 26 mm with a critical shields number of 0 0405 the comparison between the horizontal distribution of the current velocity calculated by the present model and the data from their test is illustrated in fig 7 a it is clear that the streamwise velocity in the upstream of the pile predicted by the present model is smaller than the experimental data whereas the calculated velocity for the downstream side is larger than the measurement additionally it is also shown that the present model performed well in capturing the vertical velocity in the upstream side of the single pile while the obvious deviation for the downstream of the pile can be observed fig 7b the probable reason might be the large pressure gradient and vortices that occur in those regions resulting in a strong turbulent flow which is difficult to be accurately predicted by the eddy viscosity turbulence model even though there are some discrepancies between the predictions and the experimental data the velocity distribution is basically the same the time development curve of scour depth is also compared between measurement and cfd calculation as shown in fig 7c overall the numerical solution is in agreement with the experimental data the dimensionless scour depth s max d p gradually increases exponentially over time for both methods although the scour depth predicted by the present model is lower than that of the experiment to further verify the scour model for the usaf structure the scour development curve over time for the measuring point data x 0 08 y 0 08 and the scour depth of line y4 fig 5b measured in our experiment were considered as a reference to validate the cfd calculations as shown in fig 8 the numerical result shows that the time required to reach the scouring balance is lower than that of the scouring test fig 8a the equilibrium time predicted by the current model is 16 h while the measured one is 18 h the possible reason why the numerical simulation seemly produces a faster scour might be the scour process is totally continuous during the calculation as interpreted by roulund et al 2005 a steady state solver was adopted in their simulations where intrinsic unsteadiness of scouring phenomenon has not been accounted for resulting in the deviation of equilibrium time since transient solver was already utilized here another reason probably lies in the source of uncertainty of numerical modelling approach such as the turbulence model in this work the rng k ε turbulence model was applied to resolve turbulence quantities but it is still a linear eddy viscosity based model despite it has some advantages regarding adverse pressure gradient flow and curvature streamline flow compared with the standard k ε model it is evident that the trend for the scour depth is similar between cfd and experiment however between 4 h and 14 h the predicted scour depth is smaller than the experimental data and the maximum difference is 25 9 as can be seen from fig 8b the scour characteristics along this measuring line are fundamentally similar for most of the positions regardless of the predicted distribution slightly shifted towards the streamwise direction with a distance of 0 04 m the above analysis demonstrates that the predicted results are in fairly good agreement with the experimental evidence which suggests that the current model is reasonable and reliable thus it should be concluded that the present model has the capability to capture the flow field around the usaf and can be used for further investigations 5 results and discussion the main objective of this study is to investigate the scour characteristics around the tri usaf with respect to the different arrangements it should be noted that the scaling issue of laboratory tests and cfd calculations has not been accounted for in this section for this reason particle size water depth and velocity used here are irrelevant to those involved in experiments which are simply decided on the grounds of the climate in the yellow river estuary region as listed in table 2 a series of cfd calculations were performed in which three types of configurations varying with spacing ratio are considered the first arrangement is composed of three usaf where two usaf symmetrically distribute in front of another obviously the geometry of the whole tri usaf is an equilateral triangle in the second scenario one usaf resides in front of another two but the angle of attack denoting the angle between flow direction and symmetric line of tri usaf is 15 in the last configuration one usaf is located in front of another two with zero angle of attack the spacing ratios g d p of each arrangement are 4 5 6 7 each test is named by the composition of rgu for instance r1 indicates the first type of arrangement g4 represents the spacing ratio is 4 u05 denotes the velocity is 0 5 m s corresponding to the froude number of 0 0505 the sediment embedded in each case is made up of uniformly graded medium sands with a median diameter of 0 25 mm the froude number is changed from 0 0505 to 0 1515 corresponding to the bulk velocity 0 5 m s 1 5 m s besides the other property of sand and flow conditions used in the cfd calculations as well as the maximum scour depth of each run are also given in table 2 5 1 flow field around monousaf and tri usaf before analyzing the scour characteristics understanding the flow structure at the vicinity of the offshore foundation is of great value since the modification of the flow field after passing the obstruction changes the bed shear stress which in turn probably leads to the movement of sand as mentioned before three mechanisms relating to the local scour around monousaf are similar to those of monopile namely horseshoe vortex streamline contraction and wake vortices the velocity fields of monousaf and tri usaf at the end of the calculation time predicted by the current model are depicted in fig 9 undoubtedly the flow has reached a fully developed condition before attaching the structure because the domain length in upstream is long enough the fully developed boundary layer above the sediment associated with a strong velocity gradient can be clearly detected in fig 9a b which is known as the main factor for inducing the horseshoe vortex the wake region is also captured behind the monousaf as can be seen from fig 9a b the horseshoe vortex occurs in front of the monousaf near the seabed and the streamline contraction with accelerating velocity appears at two sides of the monousaf under the combination of those actions local scour around the monousaf is gradually starting developing and finally tending to be equilibrium fig 9b also suggests that the horseshoe vortex is somewhat weaker than streamline contraction as well as wake vortices for the suction foundation like monousaf as a consequence the scour holes are mainly formed at the two sides and downstream of the structure which is consistent with the observations of yu et al 2019 indeed this phenomenon is different from scouring evolution around a monopile since the maximum scour depth always happens in the front of the monopile due to strong horseshoe vortex action as reported by unger and hager 2007 the horseshoe vortex can only be developed into a full system provided that the scour hole is intensified in upstream of the pile therefore the skirt part of the suction foundation and even the branches on the monousaf can protect the offshore structure from scouring problems to a large degree compared with the monopile generally the maximum scour depth for a monopile when it comes to structure design can be reached several times its diameter in the case of the extreme marine state whereas the maximum scour depth for the monousaf is remarkably reduced in the light of tri usaf the situation is very like to the individual usaf as shown in fig 9c d for the sake of brevity only the results with respect to case r3g4u1 present here observation of velocity fields is a typical way to recognize vortex system and accelerating velocity filed around each usaf alternatively vortex structure can be easily visualized based on several criteria in this study the q criterion is selected in which a vortex is defined as a connected fluid region with a positive second invariant of the velocity gradient basically the q criterion indicates the local balance between shear strain rate and vorticity magnitude defining vortices as areas where the vorticity magnitude is larger compared with the magnitude of rate of strain on the grounds of this criterion fig 10 illustrates the visualization of three dimensional vortices structure made up by the u shaped necklace like vortex folding around each usaf and lee wake vortices appearing at the downstream also indicating that the wake vortices behind each usaf play a major role due to the fact that the existence of skirt and branches regarding usaf resulting in the smallest spacing ratio of 4 the impact induced by the upstream usaf on the downstream one is not expected to be as remarkable as the situation of the pile group in which for instance the separated boundary layer around the upstream pile could be either directly enclose to the behind one or attach the front surface of the downstream one yang et al 2018 nevertheless the flow field of tri usaf appears still more complicated than that of monousaf after the flow passes through the upstream usaf the streamwise velocity at the two sides of downstream usaf is significantly accelerated those impacts exerted by the neighbouring structure on the rests are accounted for while processing the numerical results 5 2 temporal development of maximum scour depth fig 11 shows the development of scour holes around the tri usaf with time variations regarding the case r3g4u1 which is similar to that of monousaf but the impacts of extra structures appearing in tri usaf at the initial stage of scouring a series of small scour holes occur at the locations between two anchor branches subsequently the small scour holes gradually become larger and then some of them unify to be an entire hole not only the scour is deepening but the range of the scour hole is extending specifically the scour holes residing in the middle of the two downstream usaf tend to be emerged and overlapped the scour depth regarding the two downstream usaf is deeper than that of upstream one probably due to the combined action of velocity acceleration and wake vortices induced by the upstream usaf finally all of the scour holes achieve the largest scour depth and the scouring process is in a typical equilibrium state the maximum equilibrium scour depth is 0 129dp which occurs between two anchor branches close to the skirt in downstream on the other hand the sand deposition usually appears at the upstream of each usaf on the surface of anchor branches and skirt because of the interaction among horseshoe vortex buoyancy force and gravity force the maximum deposition height is 0 041dp occurring on the surface of the anchor branch and skirt in the front of the upstream usaf figs 12 14 illustrate the time evolution of the maximum scour depth regarding all arrangements varying with the spacing ratio at the velocity of 1 m s froude number 0 101 overall one of the peculiar features is that the curve of maximum scour depth development with respect to tri usaf appears rather distinctive arising from the extra structures compared with that of monousaf in which the shape can be practically fitted using an exponential function however at the initial 100 s the development curve of monousaf and tri usaf coincides three stages like monopile could be roughly detected namely quick scouring slow rate scouring and equilibrium scouring stages although some sub stages appear in the main stage in terms of tri usaf scouring process additionally the equilibrium time for all cases is around 1800 s excluding cases r1g6u1 r1g7u1 r3g6u1 r3g7u1 as anticipated the maximum scour depth for tri usaf at any arrangement and spacing ratio is larger than that of monousaf 0 0613dp regardless of some cases having not reached an equilibrium state as for the first and third arrangements with zero attack angle the maximum scour depth tends to enlarge at a similar scouring rate after 1800 s in the case of spacing ratio higher than 6 the shape of the curves is qualitatively the same as each other except for the case in which the spacing ratio is 4 the difference of arrangements between the second and third is a result of the angle of attack qualitatively speaking the time development curve of maximum scour depth for the second arrangement has negligible difference among each spacing ratio irrespective of the maximum scour depth slightly change after 850 s concerning the spacing ratio of 7 interestingly the developing process of the maximum scour depth between 650 s and 1700 s for the smallest spacing ratio regarding the third arrangement seems considerably strange where the scouring rate changes from quasi equilibrium state to be nearly the same as the initial stage before real equilibrium condition approaching which has never been found in scouring phenomenon regarding pile foundations in spite of those similarities the time evolution of the maximum scour depth varies from arrangements and spacing ratio from a quantitative point of view 5 3 morphological characteristics to observe the predicted scour shape scour range and scour depth figs 15 17 demonstrate the morphological characteristics of tri usaf involving three types of arrangements with different spacing ratios for the froude number of 0 101 in terms of the first arrangement as shown in fig 15 the sediment always deposits on the surface of the anchor branch and skirt of each usaf whereas the scour holes appear between two branches distributed around sides and behind each usaf the morphological profile presents a typically symmetrical distribution the largest deposition 0 223 m occurs in the downstream usaf at the smallest spacing ratio and the corresponding position is gradually transferred upstream as the spacing ratio increases additionally scour holes residing in the middle of two upstream usaf interact with each other which disappears when the spacing ratio becomes large instead the deepest scour depth appears in the case of a spacing ratio of 7 about 0 364 m regarding the second and third arrangements in which the difference arising from the angle of attack is focused the scour characteristics of these arrangements involving different spacing ratios are depicted in figs 16 17 in spite of this they can still be explained using analogous mechanisms since the angle of attack is small both largest deposition height and scour depth occur in the case of the smallest spacing ratio compared with the previous arrangement the site related to the largest deposition is a little different and the scour range between two anchor branches distributed around sides of usaf seems extended along the longitudinal direction of the anchor branch as expected the scour profile is not symmetrically distributed anymore regarding the second arrangement 5 4 the effect of spacing ratio on maximum scour depth fig 18 demonstrates the impact of the spacing ratio on the maximum scour depth with respect to three arrangements obviously the dependence of the spacing ratio on the maximum scour depth regarding the first and third arrangement is similar regardless of the quantities the maximum scour depth is decreased remarkably from the spacing ratio of 4 5 it seems that the maximum scour depth is weekly affected by the spacing ratio after over 6 moreover the trend allows determining a minimum value of maximum scour depth at the spacing ratio of 5 the largest value of maximum scour depth appears at the spacing ratio of 4 when it comes to the first and second arrangements note that the quantity of the third arrangement is more or less 1 7 times that of the first arrangement indicating that the impact of one usaf in the upstream is significant than that of two usaf in the upstream as the flow accelerates after pass the upstream usaf and amplifies the shear stress around two downstream usaf while the flow comes from the middle of two upstream usaf will not allow strongly modify the flow field around one downstream usaf even at the smallest spacing ratio in terms of the second arrangement the maximum scour depth reduces as the increase of spacing ratio altogether the recommendation for tri usaf arrangement could be the first and third arrangement with the spacing ratio of 5 as a matter of fact only a 15 angle of attack is considered in this study so that it is too early to confirm the effect of this factor nevertheless this analysis shows evidence that the angle of attack has a certain effect and should be taken into account while addressing the scouring issue 5 5 the effect of froude number on maximum scour depth for the sake of computational effort this parametric analysis is only made for the third arrangement fig 19 shows the effect of the froude number on the maximum scour depth regarding the third arrangement with different spacing ratios in general the maximum scour depth increases as the froude number increasing no matter which spacing ratio is the trend is likely to be a straight line with the same slope provided that the froude number is over 0 101 for the conditions having a spacing ratio less than 6 furthermore the highest maximum scour depth always attributes to the smallest spacing ratio for this reason this kind of situation must be avoided in reality in the case of a low froude number less than 0 101 broadly speaking there is no significant difference of maximum scour depth observed among different spacing ratios except for the case r3g4u in which the value is much larger than the other three conditions fig 20 illustrates the morphological feature of each case at different froude numbers it worth mentioning that only some representative results involving the smallest spacing ratio are presented here overall both the deposition height and scour depth increases with the increases of the froude number the maximum value of which is 0 25 m and 0 97 m respectively however considerable deposition is distributed in downstream of each usaf at the lowest froude number while the largest value of deposition height appears in the upstream of each usaf concerning a higher froude number the scour holes residing in the middle of two downstream usaf are enlarging and emerging as the froude number increases in the light of a higher froude number one of the peculiarities is the scour hole appearing around two sides of each usaf with large extension which can be interpreted as the mechanism inducing scour at the edge of scour protection structure around a monopile also the range of edge scour at downstream is larger than that of upstream because of the velocity acceleration besides the place far away from the tri usaf witness the scouring phenomenon probably due to the turbulence induced by tri usaf remaining the impact 6 summary and conclusions this study is a preliminary attempt to investigate the local scour characteristics of a complex tri usaf with several types of arrangements in the sandy seabed under the action of the steady current using the cfd modeling approach based on the computational results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 unlike monousaf the flow field around tri usaf seems complicated due to the impact exerted by additional structures which result in velocity acceleration although the physical mechanism leading to local scour around tri usaf is also justified by vortex system and streamline contraction besides the possible interpretation related to piles is definitely different from that of tri usaf due to specific components on the other hand the q criterion has been successfully applied to reproduce the three dimensional horseshoe vortex and wake vortices 2 time evolution of maximum scour hole regarding tri usaf is rather distinctive compared with that of monousaf in which the trend can be practically fitted using an exponential function some sub stages appear in three main developing stages in spite of qualitative similarity the time evolution of the maximum scour depth varies from arrangements and spacing ratio from a quantitative point of view 3 the first and third arrangement of tri usaf with a spacing ratio of 5 is recommended since the minimum value of the maximum scour depth is found the impact of one usaf in the upstream is significant than that of two usaf in the upstream the analysis shows a piece of evidence that angle of attack has certain effects on the scouring process but further study requires to be performed with respect to unresolved issues as only a 15 angle of attack is considered in this work 4 the scouring process strongly relates to the froude number in general the maximum scour depth and scour range increase with the increases of froude number at a low froude number less than 0 101 no significant difference of maximum scour depth is observed among different spacing ratios except for the case with the smallest spacing ratio in terms of the higher froude number the highest maximum scour depth always happens to the smallest spacing ratio thereby it should be avoided in reality credit authorship contribution statement qi yang conceptualization numerical methodology cfd calculations writing original draft writing review editing

20471,chemical cargoes are of extremely high purity and could be contaminative reactive or incompatible with each other delivering the cargo in a condition that is as pure as possible at the loading port constitutes the main goal of chemical cargo transportation after discharging a cargo it is absolutely critical to make the tanks free of all possible contaminants and make them ready for the next cargo to be loaded despite tank cleaning procedures and contaminant detection methods costly cargo contamination may still be encountered due to dirty remained ship s tanks in this study a comprehensive risk assessment is carried out in order to develop risk prevention strategies by increasing the efficiency of tank cleaning operations a dirty tank model is constructed with a bayesian network to obtain factors causing dirty tank and investigate them with their causal relationships due to insufficient data for the study expert opinions are used as a mandatory data source utilising fuzzy set theory the root causes related to the dirty tank are identified following comprehensive reasoning inquiries performed with those experts the results provide effective information for developing appropriate risk strategies and tailoring them depending on the different conditions related to the tank cleaning processes keywords bayesian network chemical cargo contamination dirty tank fuzzy set theory risk analysis tank cleaning process 1 introduction tank cleaning operations are generally defined as a mandatory operation of a chemical tanker to prepare the cargo tanks for switching from one cargo grade to another within the shortest possible time frame and using minimal resources the primary objective of the tank cleaning operation is purification of cargo containment which includes cargo tanks piping and pumping systems due to the huge assortment of petroleum products and chemicals it is occasional to consecutively store compatible or same cargo in the same tank in terms of chemical properties it is much more likely that a ship would carry very different cargoes in the same tank in each time for this reason it is a critical issue to eliminate the risk of blending the cargoes that might be contaminative reactive and incompatible with each other when mixing incompatible cargoes exothermic toxic and even explosive reactions may occur apart from the possible consequences in terms of safety any presence of previous cargo even in very small amounts is an unacceptable condition in the realm of cargo tank cleanliness and might lead to cargo contamination and correspondingly major losses it is the main goal of the chemical cargo transportation industry to ensure that the cargo is delivered in as pure and safe a form as it was when it was taken on at the loading port the presence of any water cleaning agent or previous cargo residue is perceived as the leading factor in cargo contamination due to the highly sensitive quality parameters of the chemical cargoes carried on board senol et al 2015 in that respect purification of cargo tanks colloquially known as tank cleaning is an extremely important operation in terms of the commercial performance of a chemical tanker it is crucial to state that each dirty tank does not automatically lead to cargo contamination as there exist some traditional preventive measures employed in the industry after the tank cleaning process such as wall wash survey techniques and the first foot sampling method a wall wash survey is employed to assess the cleanliness of the tank bulkhead surface however as the technique is performed manually by an operator it allows for the drawing of samples from only points that can be reached by the operator which are generally roughly 2 m vertical height on the bulkhead the average height of a chemical cargo tank is almost 7 m and even a properly performed wall wash survey would never reveal the tank s true condition and state of cleanliness the first foot sampling method is another contaminant detecting method in which approximately 30 cm 1 imperial foot of cargo is loaded to ship s tanks using its own piping system in a standard cargo loading manner following the first foot cargo loading samples are taken from cargo tanks and sent to a laboratory for analysis these methods may suffice as preventative measures against cargo contamination risks but in the case of any contaminant detection the tanker is required to pay compensation and re clean the tanks this obviously leads to time loss at best and a consequently decrease in commercial performance in 2016 swedish club which is a protection and indemnity p i insurance organisation declared a cargo contamination case in which a tanker loaded 600 tonnes of gasoil for first foot sampling during the laboratory analysis the cargo was found to be contaminated due to the tanker s dirty tanks and lines afterward the tanker was rejected from the terminal and had difficulties with disposing of the contaminated cargo with compensation of 600 tonnes of gasoil 2016a it is obvious that a solution which will radically reduce the risk of dirty tanks would be much more effective than the risk reduction measures that are currently employed for that reason reduction of dirty tank risk by preventing its root causes is assessed as a more efficient solution than the measures currently taken swedish club which has insured a total of 2247 ships corresponding to 86 million gross tonnage 2019 reported that cargo related claims are the most costly type of tanker claims for their company 2016b between 2002 and 2011 cargo related claims were found to have the most costly claim rate by 34 compared to the other tanker claims and it is emphasized that the most important reason for cargo related claims is inadequate tank cleaning in chemical tankers 2012 between 2019 and 2020 skuld which is another p i club reported an expenditure of 76 million for cargo related claims incurred this constitutes the highest claim type by 31 in terms of cost 2020 in the case of cargo contamination caused by the tankers commercial losses are usually recovered by the p i club of the tanker however the claims in question would lead to a much higher insurance premium for the management company and are a key factor affecting the commercial performance of a chemical tanker it is also obvious that chemical tankers that experienced cargo contamination would have difficulties in finding new cargo for transportation due to their abovementioned negative reputation on their ongoing voyages schuurmans 1978 proposed a solution for controlling the discharge of tank wash water in which he focused on the prevention of chemical sea pollution similarly ueda 1991 conducted research lasting one year on chemical tankers and as a result proposed a study to determine the minimum required amount of washing water to avoid any cargo residue in the tanks and pollution at sea later on ueda et al 1996 proposed a calculation method for determining the amount of average washing water arslan 2009 using the analytical hierarchy process ahp presented a generic risk analysis approach focused on operational safety for loading discharging inerting sampling gas freeing and tank cleaning operations that are deemed safety related critical operations in chemical tankers akyuz and celik 2015 conducted an empirical human reliability analysis for the tank cleaning operation to enhance operational reliability by integrating ahp to the human error assessment and reduction technique heart approach senol et al 2015 conducted a fuzzy fault tree analysis ffta of chemical cargo contamination including basic events of tank cleaning operations for preventing cargo contamination related commercial losses another safety related study sakar and zorba 2017 constructed a fuzzy bayesian network fbn structure for revealing the relationships between fire and explosion incidents that might be encountered during tank cleaning operations onboard tankers şanlıer 2018 pointed out the increase in the chemical tanker fleet between 1996 and 2016 drawing attention to the effects of pollution in wash water on aquatic life panaitescu et al 2018 conducted a limited study in which some factors affecting the optimisation of tank cleaning operations are determined so as to achieve effective operations with minimal costs as is seen there are unique studies in the literature dealing with safer operations and minimizing environmental pollution by focusing on tank washing operations onboard chemical tankers the tank cleaning operation is of great importance for the chemical cargo transportation industry in terms of its commercial aspects but apart from safety and marine pollution to our knowledge no study in the literature offers a solution to the problem of dirty tanks the large scale financial losses as a result of related cargo contamination show that the industry is in dire need of a systematic solution that will reduce the risk of the dirty tanks in line with this objective this study develops a comprehensive risk assessment model for dirty tank risk onboard chemical tankers factors and root causes that may affect the performance of the tank cleaning operation are revealed by using the fbn also influential variables based on their probabilistic dependencies on the dirty tank risk are shown and in this way it is aimed to propose a methodological solution to reduce the risk of a dirty tank 2 literature review this section includes a detailed literature review on the principles of bayesian network bn the scope of its application in diverse industries and its integration with the fuzzy approach 2 1 bayesian network the main purpose of risk analysis focused research is to develop a series of managerial strategies to mitigate and even prevent probable risks obviously a decision making process for risk controlling without addressing any conditional events affecting the related risks would be highly deficient fenton and neil 2018 therefore for a comprehensive risk investigation the influential conditions associated with the risky event are to be considered with their causes and their multi states bns enable the execution of a systematic investigation and are able to make quantification of risk by considering the occurrence of events with their multi states events revealed by the causal investigations are the variables represented by nodes in the network and relationships between variables are shown with arrows in the network structure most of the bns are presented as a directed acyclic graph dag that does not include any cycles between the variables operational principles of the bn are based on bayesian theory the theory is centred on humankind s tendency to change their initial beliefs about certain events when related new events appear based on conditional probabilities garvey et al 2015 in other words bayesian theory provides a conditional and comprehensive investigation of events which is expressed as follows 1 p b a p a b p b p a where p a and p b represent the marginal prior probabilities of events a and b without any preliminary observations and p a b is the occurrence probability of event a which caused by event b in other words the conditional probability of event a on the condition of the event b and p b a is the occurrence probability of the event b occur due to the event a thus bayes theory explored by thomas bayes in the 18th century provides probabilistic inferences about events in a causal relationship through these backward inquiries that can be made from conclusion to reason bayesian theory is sometimes referred to as inverse probability kerkering 2003 these diagnostic inferences provide reliable interpretations about the main causes of the events bobbio et al 2001 a bn analysis considers a certain event comprehensively together with other multi state events that it is in relation with in a graphical representation with the concepts of causality and probability bayesian computations make strong inferences related to occurrence of the events even from limited data steyvers et al 2003 and bns are seen as an extension of one of the earliest methods for knowledge representation and manipulation kjærulff and madsen 2013 while performing the probabilistic inferences about certain events within the dag the most important principle is that the only probability changes taken into account are those affected by their parents not other events thus events are independent of other events given their parents formulated in eq 2 2 p x i x 1 x 2 x i 1 p x i p a r e n t s x i another important inference of bns is that the probability of certain events occurring together is questioned eq 3 is used for the inference regarding the joint probability calculations this equation also shows that each questioned variable depends only on its parents 3 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a r e n t s x i the bn method which can perform considerable significant inferences for risk analysis through the bayes theory it is based on is used in many industries for different problems on causal examinations of diseases and treatment methods constantinou et al 2016 van der gaag et al 2002 investigation of maritime accidents afenyo et al 2017 chen et al 2015 hänninen et al 2014 hänninen and kujala 2012

environmental pollution orun et al 2018 tang et al 2016 and the nuclear sector oh and lee 2020 zhao et al 2020 the bn method is widely used also in the maritime transportation domain for such as accident analysis risk analysis reliability analysis resilience assessment and safety management purposes sakar and zorba 2017 proposed a model to find out the probabilistic relationship between fire and explosion that might be encountered during tank cleaning operations by using the fbn approach sakar et al 2020 analysed cargo liquefaction accidents that lead to the capsizing of ships where they employed interpretive structure modelling ism for identification of risk factors and fbn for quantification of the related factors ugurlu et al 2020 constructed a bn integrated with the chi square method where they analysed 226 accidents of fishing vessels that occurred between 2009 and 2018 for identifying the effects of root causes and developing preventive measures fan et al 2020 put forward a maritime accident analysis model integrated with the human factor phenomenon by using a data driven bn approach jing and lu 2020 conducted a study to facilitate probability predictions for piracy activity in southeast asia where they established a probabilistic relation between influencing factors and piracy by utilising bn baksh et al 2018 proposed a risk assessment model for maritime transportation in arctic waters by employing bn where they applied the model to a case study of an oil tanker they revealed the highest risk level of collision grounding and flooding is obtained for the east siberian sea on the other hand a reliability analysis was conducted by using bn to predict the failure rate failure probability and the average period of failure for floating offshore wind turbines li et al 2020 similarly ling et al 2017 proposed a dynamic evaluation model for the logical structure of warship reliability based on numerical simulations and bn sarwar et al 2018 provided an object oriented bn based model for resilience assessment of an offshore power management system where probable failure scenarios were identified and the resilience is considered as a function of restoration absorptive capability system adaptability and anticipated reactions hänninen et al 2014 developed a bn based safety management tool to identify the actual status of the vessels navigating within finnish waters by considering their traffic accident involvements violations reported by vessel traffic service centres and deficiencies detected in port state control inspections in this study a comprehensive risk analysis is aimed at the contamination of chemical cargo tanks despite cleaning processes having been conducted through the advanced ability of the bn analysis for approaching to events causally with the field experts and identifying the main root causes in the occurrence of certain events effective variables in tank cleaning are revealed and important suggestions for risk management of the cleaning processes of tanks have been presented 2 2 fuzzy approach in bayesian network the basic parameters of bns are the probability values that represent the effects of the considered events in the network to each other statistical probability data which enables quantitative inferences with bayes theory are obtained through historical data or experimental observations however when the probabilistic data about the events are unavailable or sparse expert judgments are seen as a valuable option for the data source morris et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the quality and validity of the expert judgments can be questioned but this will nevertheless be the chosen approach in the absence of other data nordgård and sand 2010 and in the literature there are many bn studies analysed using expert judgments aliabadi et al 2020 cheng et al 2019 laitila 2013 qiao et al 2020 ren et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 therefore linguistic expressions such as very low low medium high and very high commonly used with expert judgments are used to determine the probability of occurrence of the events discussed in bns already risk assessments are often considered linguistically in terms of the exact numerical expressions according to the experts zadeh 1975 transformed linguistic expressions presented with words and sentences that are considered unrigorous and qualitative into mathematical data sets with fuzzy theory thereby he paved the way in dealing with humanistic systems mathematically by developing an approximate calculus of linguistic variables the fuzzy set theory provides realistic results in the modelling of real world problems especially with the linguistic expressions which are digitized in the fuzzy set theory through membership functions sari and kahraman 2015 a fuzzy set s is defined by a set 4 s x μ s x x s μ s x 0 1 where μ s x is a function called as membership function it specifies the grade or degree to which any element x in s the definition associates with each element x in s a real number μ s x in the interval 0 1 which is assigned to x larger values of μ s r indicate higher degrees of membership bojadziev and bojadziev 2007 kaufmann and gupta 1988 while membership functions that characterize fuzzy sets can be two dimensional type 1 as shown above or three dimensional type 2 related to the degree of modelling the uncertainty kahraman et al 2014 fuzzy numbers have various forms such as triangular trapezoidal and l r type fuzzy numbers li et al 2019 type 1 triangular fuzzy numbers which provide more convenient reference function processing and easier algebraic operations li et al 2019 are used in this study accepting that the represented uncertainty level is sufficient a type 1 triangular fuzzy number is denoted simply as l m u l denotes the smallest possible value u denotes the largest possible value and m is the most possible value a triangular fuzzy number with membership function μ s r is defined by eq 5 5 μ s x x l m l f o r l x m x u m u f o r m x u 0 o t h e r w i s e where a l 1 m 1 u 1 and b l 2 m 2 u 2 represent two triangular fuzzy numbers arithmetic operations between them are given in eq 6 6 a b l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 a b l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 a b l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 a b l 1 u 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 l 2 the fuzzy numbers used to digitize the linguistic probabilistic expressions need to be defuzzified to resolve the ambiguity for transforming the fuzzy number a l m u to a crisp probability value a we use the mean area method with eq 7 7 a l 2 m u 4 fuzzy logic certainly provides the opportunity to use vague linguistic expressions in human judgments in numerical analysis in an acceptable manner this has encouraged the use of expert judgments through fuzzy logic in many areas where statistical data on the probability of the occurrence of events are not available but where risk analyses are indispensable for developing convenient risk prevention and mitigation strategies 3 methodology for risk analysis the proposed methodology for the risk analysis of the chemical cargo tank cleaning process basically includes the investigation of the tank cleaning operation expert elicitation for the bn configuration of the bn and network analysis the methodology is summarized in fig 1 3 1 investigation of tank cleaning operation in order to analyse the tank cleaning process from the risk perspective the fundamentals about the tank cleaning operations and risk situation relating the process are first defined comprehensively tank contamination literature field experts and regulations and instructions are considered to provide a detail understanding about the tank cleaning operations tank cleaning operations of chemical tankers are defined as the process of making all the cargo tanks suitable for the subsequent cargo by completely removing the discharged cargo and seawater detergent steam and water components stemming from washing some cargoes carried onboard chemical tankers can be cleaned without any washing process for example cargoes with a vapor pressure of 5 kpa and above at 20 c can be removed from the tank by only ventilation without any washing process imo 2017 this special condition applies to a very limited number of cargoes and the majority of chemical cargoes transported require diverse washing processes the processes related to the purification of cargoes requiring a washing process were evaluated in this study in the case of loading the same or a compatible cargo in the same tank subsequently tank cleaning is theoretically not required but today the charterers usually prefer the tanks to be completely cleaned even in such an event in addition the cargoes to be transported consecutively in the same tank are rarely identical or compatible for this reason it is essential for the commercial performance of the tankers to plan the washing procedure that may be required after each cargo discharge and to perform it effectively with the correct steps of the process there exist many factors influencing an effective tank cleaning operation the most general but correct definition of that is made by the sinner circle theory which was put forward by chemical engineer herbert sinner 1959 for an effective chemical washing factors that can have an effect on any kind of washing process are determined to be temperature chemical action time and mechanical force chemical tanker tank cleaning processes are designed by considering these four factors although it is possible to obtain clean tanks in many different ways the acceptable one is to obtain a clean tank at the end of an effective process by using resources and especially time at the optimum level which depends on the efficiency of planning and utilised equipment efficiency in planning and equipment can be defined as other most important factors tank cleaning guides tcgs provided for tanker operators include miracle 2010 dr verwey s 2015 milbros 2021 and others produced by major oil companies and chemical providers some experienced tanker owners also offer their in house guides and methods regardless of the providers all guides aim is to successfully complete the tank cleaning operations with maximum efficiency and minimum time and energy tank cleaning procedures are determined by considering the specs of tank coating and are based on the discharged cargo and that to be loaded all guides are designed based on determining the procedure by intersecting the names or predefined united nations un number of the previous and the next cargo from readily prepared tables in the description of each cleaning procedure different process steps are described based on the type of tank coating which is the materials applied to the inner surface of tank bulkheads principally coatings are divided into three types stainless steel epoxy and zinc these are applied so that the cargoes with different chemical properties do not interact with the bulkhead material the material chosen is based on factors such as application cost efficiency in the tank cleaning process maintenance cost durability lifespan and cargo variety permitted for transportation özsever et al 2020 the tank cleaning process can generally be described in 7 steps as given below for certain cargoes one or more of these steps may not be included in the procedures in tcgs step 1 pre wash with seawater pre wash is not a mandatory step for all kinds of cargoes except for pollution category x type cargoes the purpose of this step is to remove the majority of the cargo if it has the potential to be a pollutant in the sea after being discharged seawater is applied using the portable or fixed tank cleaning machines cms of the tanker it is prohibited to discharge the main wash water of relevant cargoes into the sea unless a pre wash has been done water temperature and adjacent tank temperature are critical factors for a successful pre wash step 2 main wash with seawater this is defined as a more detailed and longer version of the pre wash seawater is applied to the tanks with a recommended 8 10 bar pressure using portable or fixed cms water temperature varies from ambient to 85 c depending on the cargo specs provided by tcgs step 3 chemical wash usually performed after step 2 when the main wash is not sufficient to remove cargo residue some special tank cleaning agents such as emulsifier saponifier and combinators might be used with washing water these depend on the requirements mostly depending upon water solubility of the washing procedure highlighted in tcgs step 4 rinsing with fresh water after step 3 fresh water is applied to tanks with cms to remove all kinds of chemicals remaining either from cargo or from cleaning agents step 5 draining the tank the wash water evacuation process which should be carried out from the beginning of the cleaning operation continues at this stage until all the liquid in the tank is drained step 6 drying the tank after draining the tank the ventilation process is employed to remove a considerable amount of humidity and to provide a gas atmosphere which allows for tank entry by the employees step 7 mopping and drying the final step when whole mopping and drying operations are conducted by taking care of hazards about enclosed space entry the arrangement of the tank cms the structural arrangement of the tanks and the cargo pump and piping arrangement are important factors in the successful conducting of tank cleaning procedures a ship s ability to perform this cleaning routine effectively is key to its competitiveness since cargo owners insist on shipowners demonstrating their vessels ability to minimize cargo contamination to perform a risk analysis with respect to the dirty tank the elements constituting the risk should be determined and evaluated comprehensively in the complex environment of the dirty tank there are various types of contamination including residue of cargo salt water and cleaning agents in this study a bn analysis supported by expert judgments and the fuzzy approach is used to determine the reliability of the tank cleaning processes therefore the top event of the bn is defined as the tank remaining dirty after the cleaning process and the proposed bn is named the dirty tank model with the proposed methodology the main causes of the dirtiness and the relationships between these causes are considered together with their situational differences in this way both qualitative and quantitative terms can be explained regarding the important events that cause contamination of the tank through cleaning processes carried out with mechanical and operational systems supported by crew members the aim is to fully understand the reasons for a tank to remain dirty which may occur despite a careful cleaning process causing a substantial amount of cost for the shipping companies the results of network analysis would assist the operators in identifying important activities and crucial processes and in turn support them in the effective allocation of appropriate measures within the scope of the methodology the use of expert judgments which is one of the most remarkable components of this risk analysis the network configuration that describes the qualitative formation of the network and its quantitative structuring which offers the numerical analysis of the network and finally the comprehensive network analysis are presented 3 2 expert elicitation for the bayesian network in the case of insufficient historical data to elicit meaningful statistical inferences about the variables of the network network related information is acquired from the experts experts must have sufficient experience and knowledge about tank cleaning and contamination and be adequately observant to consider the events from the perspective of risk and probability to provide data about the analysis therefore it is recommended to specify the experts with risk analysis experience a group assessment procedure was used for the purpose of overcoming the difficulties in elicitation of judgments such as determining the many variables and parameters of the bn by the experts and for better control of their reasoning approaches and consistencies regarding the events discussed as a result the elicitation the experts judgments for the bn was performed with group interviews to control the experts sentiments about the queries and the overall study in determining the experts within the scope of the study it is crucial to ensure that linguistic and personal issues and employment or commercial considerations do not impede experts expressions during the evaluation experts should be able to highlight the elements they believe in and their contentions should only be for the data to reflect the real world expert judgments may include various biases and may not be properly calibrated unless necessary precautions are taken by the analyst before the elicitation process van der gaag et al 2002 for this reason the communication between the experts and the analyst also must be strong because the study is not limited to questions and answers or multiple choice evaluations experts judgments on causality and probabilities should be able to change direction and deepen as necessary through interactive exchanges between themselves and with the analysts experts are required to submit a consensus output with each inquiry process regarding the network yaşlı 2020 the optimum number of experts in the group is suggested to be between 3 and 5 for an efficient elicitation process clemen and winkler 1999 in this study three anonymous field experts consisting of a chemical tanker company deck inspector a master and a chief officer who have significant on duty service of 10 years 15 years and 3 years respectively and experiences on chemical tanker operations were consulted by submitting a consensus output for the whole network structure the importance of the descriptive information about risk and probability identification and the value of inferences for the study was represented to the experts shephard and kirkwood 1994 in addition to being used their judgments as the main data source for the analysis it also should be mentioned that there is no concept of right or wrong for the questioned issue only experts beliefs about the events are tried to be revealed renooij 2001 yaşlı 2020 unless the necessary precautions are taken experts assessments may reflect a variety of biases and may not be calibrated appropriately and easily van der gaag et al 2002 therefore it should be ensured that experts are free of any biased statements they may be in and that they have correct views about the reason and necessity for the study and the causality and probability bases on which the bn rests 3 3 bayesian network configuration a bn configuration has both qualitative and quantitative structures in a bn while the qualitative structure presents the causal network the quantitative structure gives the parameters of the network for the analysis 3 3 1 qualitative structure of bayesian network bns are dags that represent the occurrence of certain events together with their causality relations in a bn an arrow from event a to event b means that event a affects our belief about the event b events in the network are in a chain relationship that affects each a common effect relationship arising from multiple reasons or a common cause relationship existing where multiple effects occur proposed directed graphs intuitively present causal information about events kjærulff and madsen 2013 steyvers et al 2003 with a properly constructed bn many analyses and inferences based on scientific foundations can be performed kjærulff and madsen 2013 structural relationships within bns are based on the principles of dependence and independence while events that are connected by arrows are declared to be dependent on each other events that are not in common connection with each other and are not in the same lineage are considered to be either completely or conditional independent of each other the independence of events can be proven when the observation of two individual events does not offer any inference for each other on the other hand conditional independence is a fundamental element that bns use through bayesian theory and if the dependencies are constructed in such a way that the resulting graph is acyclic then it is assumed that the designer of the network has implicitly assumed conditional independence among certain variables garvey et al 2015 the bn configuration within the scope of the study is set to reveal the effective building blocks in the occurrence of events that cause the contamination of the tank remaining after the washing process assigned experts were guided for building the network by asking them the relevant questions and explaining the assumptions that are encoded in the model finally the variables together with their relationships with other variables are determined in a structured fashion langseth and portinale 2007 for example if the occurrence of an x event in the network is caused by certain states of events a and b then event x is reflected as the child variable and events a and b as the parent variables as given in fig 2 these events a b and x and the cause effect relationships indicated by arrows are identified through causal inquiries directed to the group of experts such as why the event x effect occurs what conditions are necessary for the occurrence of the event x or how to prevent this event x experts do the causal questioning together and verbally according to their knowledge and experience and provide a consensual answer after a period of discussion under the control of analysts it was found that the most effective way to reveal the qualitative structure of the bn to experts was to form group sessions where the consensus judgments are presented by the experts interactively so as to account for the experts considerations about the queries the first stage of network configuration is defining the top event which refers to the main event to be considered in the bn the top event should be defined comprehensively in a consensual manner with field experts also benefitting from the related literature and regulations and instructions then the intermediate events and root causes are defined together with their multi states which reflect the dynamics of the analysis by making causal inquiries about the top event the number of layers reflected on the network as intermediate events and the root causes are determined by the collaboration of the experts and analysts according to the nature of the events and the limits of the analysis specifying the root causes enables the identification of the most fundamental causes of the event under investigation dealing with these causes will generally prevent the top event from occurring the first step in the configuring of the bn is to determine all variables of the network together with their multi states after the construction and definition of the bn it is recommended to verify the network with the subjective opinions of different experts not involved in the network s construction phase the graph of the bn presenting the variables and the relationships between these variables is the basis of the analysis so a network validated by different experts is more likely to reflect the real situation and that the network will likewise be robust enough to enable further scientific analysis 3 3 2 quantitative structure of the bayesian network the quantitative structuring of bns is the determination of the network s parameters which include the prior probability distributions of the events according to their different statements and the conditional probability values that express the relationships between events for which depends on its parents a and b are shown in the template given in fig 3 for determination of the occurrence probability of the event x in positive state the prior probabilities of the parent nodes and the conditional probabilities of the child node should be calculated prior probabilities are defined as a provisional belief about the uncertainty of some certain event upon experience or data gained to date constantinou et al 2016 while the prior probabilities of the variables represent the prior information of the network they also provide an important data source for making crucial inferences related to the network via sensitivity analysis baksh et al 2018 hänninen and kujala 2014 kabir et al 2016 zarei et al 2017 the prior probabilities of the event a shown in fig 3 without any parents with two states a and a will present the probability distribution associated with the multi states of event a and provide important findings for the causal inference of the network conditional probabilities are the probability of an event given the occurrence of an influencing event jones et al 2010 in other words they reflect the relationships between variables in bns all other variables except root cause have conditional probability tables cpts the conditional probability values which are obtained from the experts are used with the information obtained from the prior probabilities of root causes to update the probabilities of the upper level events in the network all conditional probabilities of the event x which depends on its parents a and b are shown in the template given in fig 3 due to the lack of reliable statistical data to determine the probability values the fuzzy approach is utilised to perform mathematical operations on the linguistic expressions of experts linguistic probability expressions presented to the experts within the scope of the study and their related triangular fuzzy numbers are as given in table 1 the language of the maritime sector has been used in determining the linguistic probability terms so that experts could easily make their evaluations and infer the probability expressions related to events correctly the membership functions of the fuzzy numbers and their corresponding linguistic probability expressions are shown in fig 4 3 4 network analysis bn modelling has been expressed as a simple mathematical formula for calculating conditional and marginal probabilities of a random event jones et al 2010 while these calculations present forward and backward elicitation about the events within the network determining the effects of root causes on the occurrence of the top event and the effects of the small changes in the model s local parameters or evidence on any target node in the network is also possible with bn zhang et al 2019 forward elicitation is the determination of the probabilities of the events occurring under primary conditions they offer valuable causal inferences for the occurrence of the events based on the prior knowledge through to propagation of the bn the occurrence probability of each event in the network depending on the status of their parents is calculated based on the bn s basic calculation principles eq 2 and eq 3 and they present an important data source for further elicitation of the bn the basic principles of the bayes calculations are presented in fig 3 within the scope of this study the probabilities of the nodes of the dirty tank model are estimated with the forward elicitations backward elicitation is used to obtain an accurate probability distribution of any root cause when the top event occurs aliabadi et al 2020 it presents the posterior probabilities of the events and includes more information than the events prior probabilities posterior probabilities are calculated based on eq 1 which defines the bayes theory and they can reduce the uncertainty in the relationship between the network variables backward elicitation is also called diagnostic inferences bobbio et al 2001 and abductive reasoning kjærulff and madsen 2013 according to the network shown in fig 3 the backward elicitation is to find out the responsible event a or b given the occurrence of the event within the scope of the study the effects of the root causes on the variables which cause the tank to be dirty are shown with backward elicitations within the proposed bn forward and backward elicitations are considered the propagation of evidence to see the effects of the variables on the specific parameters of the network jones et al 2010 after all of this to deduce the most meaningful inference about the proposed network the reaction of the network to variations in variables is performed this is also known as the sensitivity analysis this is basically accomplished through the determination of the ratio of variation rov values for the root causes rov values calculated via the information obtained from the forward and backward elicitation about some specific variable in the network provide important comparisons among the variables instead of relying on merely prior or posterior probabilities the most influential causes related to the specific evidence about the network are defined with the rov values zarei et al 2017 where x i represents a specific event it is calculated as given in eq 8 8 r o v x i p o s t e r i o r p r o b x i p r i o r p r o b x i p r i o r p r o b x i 4 risk analysis for dirty tank within the scope of this study the fbn method is employed to determine the root causes of the dirty cargo tanks after the cleaning process and to develop effective prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk of the top event due to the lack of historical data to propose and analyse the network three field experts were consulted they were requested to present compromised outputs by sharing opinions under the control of the analysts and be flexible enough about their judgments and be open to interactive discussion to reach a consensus 4 1 bayesian network configuration in this paper the network configuration and the updating analysis are performed by using genie 4 0 which was developed by the decision system laboratory university of pittsburgh https www bayesfusion com genie the bn of this study is configurated with the top event of dirty tank that corresponds to the probabilistic assessment of whether the tanks are dirty regardless of the amount and type of contaminant which could be previous cargo cleaning agent water or salt originated from the main wash water as a result of the elicitation process with reasoning approach position of cm recessed tank structure planning performance attention of operator operational failure programming performance and technical knowledge have been determined as the root causes of the dirty tank network the proposed network presented to the field experts differed from that given to the consulted experts for verification in order to enhance the reliability of the network after accounting for their suggestions and the new consensus processes the network reached its final form as shown in fig 5 all nodes for the dirty tank network are defined as boolean variables and fuzzy expressions are preferred for the states of these nodes to facilitate the cognitive thinking processes in determining network parameters for example while the high effective state and the low complicated state represent the positive outcomes of the nodes of position of cm and recessed tank structure the low effective state and the high complicated state depict the negative outcomes of the specified nodes respectively after visualising the model nodes and the arcs experts specify the numeric values related to root causes and the nodes interconnections they used the linguistic probability expressions presented in table 1 to determine these basic parameters of the proposed bn at this point relying on the data from the group consensus is the compulsory choice to perform the analysis the prior probabilities of the root causes obtained from the experts under the control of analysts are shown in table 2 after defuzzification for the fuzzy numbers corresponding to linguistic probability assignments to the nodes to meet the requirement that the sum of probability of the nodes in various states is to be 1 we conducted normalization on exact probabilities of the nodes cpts of all nodes given their influencing parents excluding root causes are similarly determined and as an example cpts of the nodes of cargo residue and monitoring performance are presented in table 3 and table 4 respectively 4 2 network analysis and results considering all of the probabilities obtained through the experts forward elicitation is performed to reveal the causal inferences about the dirty tank according to primary conditions related to the root causes the occurrence probability of dirty tank is estimated to be 12 as shown in fig 6 after the first stage of the computations obtained results are discussed with the consulted field experts and the outcomes are found reasonable regardless of considering the amount and type of the residue as seen in fig 6 cargo residue ca residue salt residue and water residue are different types of tank contamination that will be named various residues within this study the dirty tank is connected to various residues with or logic in other words if any residue remains in the cargo tank the dirty tank is considered to have occurred regardless of the residue s type and amount for a deeper analysis about the effect of the dirty tank on all influencing variables in the model diagnostic inferences are made by employing backward elicitation obtained the posterior probabilities through new knowledge about the nodes of dirty tank and various residues present an insight into the root causes that may be responsible should a residue remain while fig 6 presents the prior probabilities without any observations of the network variables fig 7 depicts the posterior probabilities after observing that the tank is dirty additionally to specify the effects of the root causes on the existence of the specific residues despite the cleaning processes multiple backward elicitations are also performed finally the probabilities obtained by the propagation of the dirty tank model are used to deduce important information on risk mitigation and preventative strategies concerning tank contamination in this regard to find the root causes that may be responsible for the residues in the tank the rov values eq 8 of the root causes are compared to each other as in fig 8 it is possible to understand from fig 8 the operational failure has the most effective root cause for being of the tank dirty as more specifically it has the highest influence on the existence of salt and water residue although the effect of the recessed tank structure is minimal in the implication of the dirty tank general diagnostics it can be seen that the effect is quite high in the presence of cargo residue and ca residue similarly although the root cause of programming performance does not have a high impact under the general view of dirty tank evidence it appears to have a significant effect on other sources of residues except for the node of water residue in this case the effects of both the contamination of the tank regardless of amount or type of any residue and the effects of the root causes on the presence of different residues can be inferred by considering the rov values of the root causes after specifying the effects of the root causes on specific conditions observing the sensitivity of the top event is also reasonable for valuable inference about the study to analyse the impact of causal factors of the dirty tank node we utilised the tornado diagrams of the genie and just assigned the related variable as a target node the tornado diagram which is shown in fig 9 offers the impact of the causes on the dirty tank node basically the length of the bars can be interpreted as a measurement of the effects of the causes under the variation of probability of the dirty tank by 10 as can be seen from fig 9 the nodes of the cargo residue cleaning agent residue salt residue water residue washing performance discharge performance drying performance operational performance and steam source are the most leading causes of dirty tank 5 conclusion with the dirty tank model critical qualitative and quantitative findings related to the important factors affecting tank contamination have been revealed the most influential causes for the tank contamination have been identified concerning the tank operations carried out together with the mechanically and manually operated processes although different root causes due to different residues come to the forefront in terms of contamination of the tank it is assessed that operational failure is the most important root cause of the tank contamination since a significant part of the cleaning operation is carried out manually unlike the technical knowledge or attention of operator operational failure refers to overconfidence underestimating the tasks of operation lack of information specific to the operation lack of situational awareness incorrect decisions and failure to put theoretical information into practice in this sense based on the interviews with the field experts it is considered that beyond the standard training the continuous training and evaluation programs to be implemented for the staff involved in the cleaning operations would be an effective measure in reducing the risk of dirty cargo tanks moreover it is thought that the competence required for the relevant operations cannot be achieved only with theoretical or computer based simulator training instead conducting applied training in environments where the real operational environment is better simulated would produce more effective results it is necessary to systematically assess and evaluate the practical training and practical capabilities of the personnel in the process of being employed as trainees and to proactively understand the results obtained for risk reducing purposes international organisations rule makers and other safety related advising non governmental organisations are expected to declare new and purposeful training assessment and evaluation policies on the other hand it has been concluded that the attention of operator which is also a root cause associated with operators is a factor based on psychological or other non intervening factors working hours resting periods age etc independent of reliability culture and training based on the flexibility of the operational schedule well organized working hours and rest periods would be effective in reducing the risk of the dirty tank however attention of operator could be accepted as an assumption that must be considered inevitable consequently the bn enables to achieve of critical findings by performing a sensitivity analysis on changes of their probability values employing causal and diagnostic inferences throughout the network to reduce the occurrence probability of any top event or undesired node of the network the bn provides systematic support to minimize the effects of causation factors for a cost effective management approach similarly where some factors cannot be minimized in terms of time and cost bn allows operators to determine and control other causes for risk mitigation in order to make further sense of these findings a future study is planned that reveals a cost benefit analysis to reduce the risk of dirty tanks depending on the type and quantity of contaminants credit authorship contribution statement yunus emre senol investigation resources data curation

20471,chemical cargoes are of extremely high purity and could be contaminative reactive or incompatible with each other delivering the cargo in a condition that is as pure as possible at the loading port constitutes the main goal of chemical cargo transportation after discharging a cargo it is absolutely critical to make the tanks free of all possible contaminants and make them ready for the next cargo to be loaded despite tank cleaning procedures and contaminant detection methods costly cargo contamination may still be encountered due to dirty remained ship s tanks in this study a comprehensive risk assessment is carried out in order to develop risk prevention strategies by increasing the efficiency of tank cleaning operations a dirty tank model is constructed with a bayesian network to obtain factors causing dirty tank and investigate them with their causal relationships due to insufficient data for the study expert opinions are used as a mandatory data source utilising fuzzy set theory the root causes related to the dirty tank are identified following comprehensive reasoning inquiries performed with those experts the results provide effective information for developing appropriate risk strategies and tailoring them depending on the different conditions related to the tank cleaning processes keywords bayesian network chemical cargo contamination dirty tank fuzzy set theory risk analysis tank cleaning process 1 introduction tank cleaning operations are generally defined as a mandatory operation of a chemical tanker to prepare the cargo tanks for switching from one cargo grade to another within the shortest possible time frame and using minimal resources the primary objective of the tank cleaning operation is purification of cargo containment which includes cargo tanks piping and pumping systems due to the huge assortment of petroleum products and chemicals it is occasional to consecutively store compatible or same cargo in the same tank in terms of chemical properties it is much more likely that a ship would carry very different cargoes in the same tank in each time for this reason it is a critical issue to eliminate the risk of blending the cargoes that might be contaminative reactive and incompatible with each other when mixing incompatible cargoes exothermic toxic and even explosive reactions may occur apart from the possible consequences in terms of safety any presence of previous cargo even in very small amounts is an unacceptable condition in the realm of cargo tank cleanliness and might lead to cargo contamination and correspondingly major losses it is the main goal of the chemical cargo transportation industry to ensure that the cargo is delivered in as pure and safe a form as it was when it was taken on at the loading port the presence of any water cleaning agent or previous cargo residue is perceived as the leading factor in cargo contamination due to the highly sensitive quality parameters of the chemical cargoes carried on board senol et al 2015 in that respect purification of cargo tanks colloquially known as tank cleaning is an extremely important operation in terms of the commercial performance of a chemical tanker it is crucial to state that each dirty tank does not automatically lead to cargo contamination as there exist some traditional preventive measures employed in the industry after the tank cleaning process such as wall wash survey techniques and the first foot sampling method a wall wash survey is employed to assess the cleanliness of the tank bulkhead surface however as the technique is performed manually by an operator it allows for the drawing of samples from only points that can be reached by the operator which are generally roughly 2 m vertical height on the bulkhead the average height of a chemical cargo tank is almost 7 m and even a properly performed wall wash survey would never reveal the tank s true condition and state of cleanliness the first foot sampling method is another contaminant detecting method in which approximately 30 cm 1 imperial foot of cargo is loaded to ship s tanks using its own piping system in a standard cargo loading manner following the first foot cargo loading samples are taken from cargo tanks and sent to a laboratory for analysis these methods may suffice as preventative measures against cargo contamination risks but in the case of any contaminant detection the tanker is required to pay compensation and re clean the tanks this obviously leads to time loss at best and a consequently decrease in commercial performance in 2016 swedish club which is a protection and indemnity p i insurance organisation declared a cargo contamination case in which a tanker loaded 600 tonnes of gasoil for first foot sampling during the laboratory analysis the cargo was found to be contaminated due to the tanker s dirty tanks and lines afterward the tanker was rejected from the terminal and had difficulties with disposing of the contaminated cargo with compensation of 600 tonnes of gasoil 2016a it is obvious that a solution which will radically reduce the risk of dirty tanks would be much more effective than the risk reduction measures that are currently employed for that reason reduction of dirty tank risk by preventing its root causes is assessed as a more efficient solution than the measures currently taken swedish club which has insured a total of 2247 ships corresponding to 86 million gross tonnage 2019 reported that cargo related claims are the most costly type of tanker claims for their company 2016b between 2002 and 2011 cargo related claims were found to have the most costly claim rate by 34 compared to the other tanker claims and it is emphasized that the most important reason for cargo related claims is inadequate tank cleaning in chemical tankers 2012 between 2019 and 2020 skuld which is another p i club reported an expenditure of 76 million for cargo related claims incurred this constitutes the highest claim type by 31 in terms of cost 2020 in the case of cargo contamination caused by the tankers commercial losses are usually recovered by the p i club of the tanker however the claims in question would lead to a much higher insurance premium for the management company and are a key factor affecting the commercial performance of a chemical tanker it is also obvious that chemical tankers that experienced cargo contamination would have difficulties in finding new cargo for transportation due to their abovementioned negative reputation on their ongoing voyages schuurmans 1978 proposed a solution for controlling the discharge of tank wash water in which he focused on the prevention of chemical sea pollution similarly ueda 1991 conducted research lasting one year on chemical tankers and as a result proposed a study to determine the minimum required amount of washing water to avoid any cargo residue in the tanks and pollution at sea later on ueda et al 1996 proposed a calculation method for determining the amount of average washing water arslan 2009 using the analytical hierarchy process ahp presented a generic risk analysis approach focused on operational safety for loading discharging inerting sampling gas freeing and tank cleaning operations that are deemed safety related critical operations in chemical tankers akyuz and celik 2015 conducted an empirical human reliability analysis for the tank cleaning operation to enhance operational reliability by integrating ahp to the human error assessment and reduction technique heart approach senol et al 2015 conducted a fuzzy fault tree analysis ffta of chemical cargo contamination including basic events of tank cleaning operations for preventing cargo contamination related commercial losses another safety related study sakar and zorba 2017 constructed a fuzzy bayesian network fbn structure for revealing the relationships between fire and explosion incidents that might be encountered during tank cleaning operations onboard tankers şanlıer 2018 pointed out the increase in the chemical tanker fleet between 1996 and 2016 drawing attention to the effects of pollution in wash water on aquatic life panaitescu et al 2018 conducted a limited study in which some factors affecting the optimisation of tank cleaning operations are determined so as to achieve effective operations with minimal costs as is seen there are unique studies in the literature dealing with safer operations and minimizing environmental pollution by focusing on tank washing operations onboard chemical tankers the tank cleaning operation is of great importance for the chemical cargo transportation industry in terms of its commercial aspects but apart from safety and marine pollution to our knowledge no study in the literature offers a solution to the problem of dirty tanks the large scale financial losses as a result of related cargo contamination show that the industry is in dire need of a systematic solution that will reduce the risk of the dirty tanks in line with this objective this study develops a comprehensive risk assessment model for dirty tank risk onboard chemical tankers factors and root causes that may affect the performance of the tank cleaning operation are revealed by using the fbn also influential variables based on their probabilistic dependencies on the dirty tank risk are shown and in this way it is aimed to propose a methodological solution to reduce the risk of a dirty tank 2 literature review this section includes a detailed literature review on the principles of bayesian network bn the scope of its application in diverse industries and its integration with the fuzzy approach 2 1 bayesian network the main purpose of risk analysis focused research is to develop a series of managerial strategies to mitigate and even prevent probable risks obviously a decision making process for risk controlling without addressing any conditional events affecting the related risks would be highly deficient fenton and neil 2018 therefore for a comprehensive risk investigation the influential conditions associated with the risky event are to be considered with their causes and their multi states bns enable the execution of a systematic investigation and are able to make quantification of risk by considering the occurrence of events with their multi states events revealed by the causal investigations are the variables represented by nodes in the network and relationships between variables are shown with arrows in the network structure most of the bns are presented as a directed acyclic graph dag that does not include any cycles between the variables operational principles of the bn are based on bayesian theory the theory is centred on humankind s tendency to change their initial beliefs about certain events when related new events appear based on conditional probabilities garvey et al 2015 in other words bayesian theory provides a conditional and comprehensive investigation of events which is expressed as follows 1 p b a p a b p b p a where p a and p b represent the marginal prior probabilities of events a and b without any preliminary observations and p a b is the occurrence probability of event a which caused by event b in other words the conditional probability of event a on the condition of the event b and p b a is the occurrence probability of the event b occur due to the event a thus bayes theory explored by thomas bayes in the 18th century provides probabilistic inferences about events in a causal relationship through these backward inquiries that can be made from conclusion to reason bayesian theory is sometimes referred to as inverse probability kerkering 2003 these diagnostic inferences provide reliable interpretations about the main causes of the events bobbio et al 2001 a bn analysis considers a certain event comprehensively together with other multi state events that it is in relation with in a graphical representation with the concepts of causality and probability bayesian computations make strong inferences related to occurrence of the events even from limited data steyvers et al 2003 and bns are seen as an extension of one of the earliest methods for knowledge representation and manipulation kjærulff and madsen 2013 while performing the probabilistic inferences about certain events within the dag the most important principle is that the only probability changes taken into account are those affected by their parents not other events thus events are independent of other events given their parents formulated in eq 2 2 p x i x 1 x 2 x i 1 p x i p a r e n t s x i another important inference of bns is that the probability of certain events occurring together is questioned eq 3 is used for the inference regarding the joint probability calculations this equation also shows that each questioned variable depends only on its parents 3 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a r e n t s x i the bn method which can perform considerable significant inferences for risk analysis through the bayes theory it is based on is used in many industries for different problems on causal examinations of diseases and treatment methods constantinou et al 2016 van der gaag et al 2002 investigation of maritime accidents afenyo et al 2017 chen et al 2015 hänninen et al 2014 hänninen and kujala 2012 qiao et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 safety analysis of superstructures in the construction sector zhang et al 2014 occupational safety garcía herrero et al 2012 yaşlı and bolat 2020 prevention of environmental pollution orun et al 2018 tang et al 2016 and the nuclear sector oh and lee 2020 zhao et al 2020 the bn method is widely used also in the maritime transportation domain for such as accident analysis risk analysis reliability analysis resilience assessment and safety management purposes sakar and zorba 2017 proposed a model to find out the probabilistic relationship between fire and explosion that might be encountered during tank cleaning operations by using the fbn approach sakar et al 2020 analysed cargo liquefaction accidents that lead to the capsizing of ships where they employed interpretive structure modelling ism for identification of risk factors and fbn for quantification of the related factors ugurlu et al 2020 constructed a bn integrated with the chi square method where they analysed 226 accidents of fishing vessels that occurred between 2009 and 2018 for identifying the effects of root causes and developing preventive measures fan et al 2020 put forward a maritime accident analysis model integrated with the human factor phenomenon by using a data driven bn approach jing and lu 2020 conducted a study to facilitate probability predictions for piracy activity in southeast asia where they established a probabilistic relation between influencing factors and piracy by utilising bn baksh et al 2018 proposed a risk assessment model for maritime transportation in arctic waters by employing bn where they applied the model to a case study of an oil tanker they revealed the highest risk level of collision grounding and flooding is obtained for the east siberian sea on the other hand a reliability analysis was conducted by using bn to predict the failure rate failure probability and the average period of failure for floating offshore wind turbines li et al 2020 similarly ling et al 2017 proposed a dynamic evaluation model for the logical structure of warship reliability based on numerical simulations and bn sarwar et al 2018 provided an object oriented bn based model for resilience assessment of an offshore power management system where probable failure scenarios were identified and the resilience is considered as a function of restoration absorptive capability system adaptability and anticipated reactions hänninen et al 2014 developed a bn based safety management tool to identify the actual status of the vessels navigating within finnish waters by considering their traffic accident involvements violations reported by vessel traffic service centres and deficiencies detected in port state control inspections in this study a comprehensive risk analysis is aimed at the contamination of chemical cargo tanks despite cleaning processes having been conducted through the advanced ability of the bn analysis for approaching to events causally with the field experts and identifying the main root causes in the occurrence of certain events effective variables in tank cleaning are revealed and important suggestions for risk management of the cleaning processes of tanks have been presented 2 2 fuzzy approach in bayesian network the basic parameters of bns are the probability values that represent the effects of the considered events in the network to each other statistical probability data which enables quantitative inferences with bayes theory are obtained through historical data or experimental observations however when the probabilistic data about the events are unavailable or sparse expert judgments are seen as a valuable option for the data source morris et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the quality and validity of the expert judgments can be questioned but this will nevertheless be the chosen approach in the absence of other data nordgård and sand 2010 and in the literature there are many bn studies analysed using expert judgments aliabadi et al 2020 cheng et al 2019 laitila 2013 qiao et al 2020 ren et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 therefore linguistic expressions such as very low low medium high and very high commonly used with expert judgments are used to determine the probability of occurrence of the events discussed in bns already risk assessments are often considered linguistically in terms of the exact numerical expressions according to the experts zadeh 1975 transformed linguistic expressions presented with words and sentences that are considered unrigorous and qualitative into mathematical data sets with fuzzy theory thereby he paved the way in dealing with humanistic systems mathematically by developing an approximate calculus of linguistic variables the fuzzy set theory provides realistic results in the modelling of real world problems especially with the linguistic expressions which are digitized in the fuzzy set theory through membership functions sari and kahraman 2015 a fuzzy set s is defined by a set 4 s x μ s x x s μ s x 0 1 where μ s x is a function called as membership function it specifies the grade or degree to which any element x in s the definition associates with each element x in s a real number μ s x in the interval 0 1 which is assigned to x larger values of μ s r indicate higher degrees of membership bojadziev and bojadziev 2007 kaufmann and gupta 1988 while membership functions that characterize fuzzy sets can be two dimensional type 1 as shown above or three dimensional type 2 related to the degree of modelling the uncertainty kahraman et al 2014 fuzzy numbers have various forms such as triangular trapezoidal and l r type fuzzy numbers li et al 2019 type 1 triangular fuzzy numbers which provide more convenient reference function processing and easier algebraic operations li et al 2019 are used in this study accepting that the represented uncertainty level is sufficient a type 1 triangular fuzzy number is denoted simply as l m u l denotes the smallest possible value u denotes the largest possible value and m is the most possible value a triangular fuzzy number with membership function μ s r is defined by eq 5 5 μ s x x l m l f o r l x m x u m u f o r m x u 0 o t h e r w i s e where a l 1 m 1 u 1 and b l 2 m 2 u 2 represent two triangular fuzzy numbers arithmetic operations between them are given in eq 6 6 a b l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 a b l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 a b l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 a b l 1 u 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 l 2 the fuzzy numbers used to digitize the linguistic probabilistic expressions need to be defuzzified to resolve the ambiguity for transforming the fuzzy number a l m u to a crisp probability value a we use the mean area method with eq 7 7 a l 2 m u 4 fuzzy logic certainly provides the opportunity to use vague linguistic expressions in human judgments in numerical analysis in an acceptable manner this has encouraged the use of expert judgments through fuzzy logic in many areas where statistical data on the probability of the occurrence of events are not available but where risk analyses are indispensable for developing convenient risk prevention and mitigation strategies 3 methodology for risk analysis the proposed methodology for the risk analysis of the chemical cargo tank cleaning process basically includes the investigation of the tank cleaning operation expert elicitation for the bn configuration of the bn and network analysis the methodology is summarized in fig 1 3 1 investigation of tank cleaning operation in order to analyse the tank cleaning process from the risk perspective the fundamentals about the tank cleaning operations and risk situation relating the process are first defined comprehensively tank contamination literature field experts and regulations and instructions are considered to provide a detail understanding about the tank cleaning operations tank cleaning operations of chemical tankers are defined as the process of making all the cargo tanks suitable for the subsequent cargo by completely removing the discharged cargo and seawater detergent steam and water components stemming from washing some cargoes carried onboard chemical tankers can be cleaned without any washing process for example cargoes with a vapor pressure of 5 kpa and above at 20 c can be removed from the tank by only ventilation without any washing process imo 2017 this special condition applies to a very limited number of cargoes and the majority of chemical cargoes transported require diverse washing processes the processes related to the purification of cargoes requiring a washing process were evaluated in this study in the case of loading the same or a compatible cargo in the same tank subsequently tank cleaning is theoretically not required but today the charterers usually prefer the tanks to be completely cleaned even in such an event in addition the cargoes to be transported consecutively in the same tank are rarely identical or compatible for this reason it is essential for the commercial performance of the tankers to plan the washing procedure that may be required after each cargo discharge and to perform it effectively with the correct steps of the process there exist many factors influencing an effective tank cleaning operation the most general but correct definition of that is made by the sinner circle theory which was put forward by chemical engineer herbert sinner 1959 for an effective chemical washing factors that can have an effect on any kind of washing process are determined to be temperature chemical action time and mechanical force chemical tanker tank cleaning processes are designed by considering these four factors although it is possible to obtain clean tanks in many different ways the acceptable one is to obtain a clean tank at the end of an effective process by using resources and especially time at the optimum level which depends on the efficiency of planning and utilised equipment efficiency in planning and equipment can be defined as other most important factors tank cleaning guides tcgs provided for tanker operators include miracle 2010 dr verwey s 2015 milbros 2021 and others produced by major oil companies and chemical providers some experienced tanker owners also offer their in house guides and methods regardless of the providers all guides aim is to successfully complete the tank cleaning operations with maximum efficiency and minimum time and energy tank cleaning procedures are determined by considering the specs of tank coating and are based on the discharged cargo and that to be loaded all guides are designed based on determining the procedure by intersecting the names or predefined united nations un number of the previous and the next cargo from readily prepared tables in the description of each cleaning procedure different process steps are described based on the type of tank coating which is the materials applied to the inner surface of tank bulkheads principally coatings are divided into three types stainless steel epoxy and zinc these are applied so that the cargoes with different chemical properties do not interact with the bulkhead material the material chosen is based on factors such as application cost efficiency in the tank cleaning process maintenance cost durability lifespan and cargo variety permitted for transportation özsever et al 2020 the tank cleaning process can generally be described in 7 steps as given below for certain cargoes one or more of these steps may not be included in the procedures in tcgs step 1 pre wash with seawater pre wash is not a mandatory step for all kinds of cargoes except for pollution category x type cargoes the purpose of this step is to remove the majority of the cargo if it has the potential to be a pollutant in the sea after being discharged seawater is applied using the portable or fixed tank cleaning machines cms of the tanker it is prohibited to discharge the main wash water of relevant cargoes into the sea unless a pre wash has been done water temperature and adjacent tank temperature are critical factors for a successful pre wash step 2 main wash with seawater this is defined as a more detailed and longer version of the pre wash seawater is applied to the tanks with a recommended 8 10 bar pressure using portable or fixed cms water temperature varies from ambient to 85 c depending on the cargo specs provided by tcgs step 3 chemical wash usually performed after step 2 when the main wash is not sufficient to remove cargo residue some special tank cleaning agents such as emulsifier saponifier and combinators might be used with washing water these depend on the requirements mostly depending upon water solubility of the washing procedure highlighted in tcgs step 4 rinsing with fresh water after step 3 fresh water is applied to tanks with cms to remove all kinds of chemicals remaining either from cargo or from cleaning agents step 5 draining the tank the wash water evacuation process which should be carried out from the beginning of the cleaning operation continues at this stage until all the liquid in the tank is drained step 6 drying the tank after draining the tank the ventilation process is employed to remove a considerable amount of humidity and to provide a gas atmosphere which allows for tank entry by the employees step 7 mopping and drying the final step when whole mopping and drying operations are conducted by taking care of hazards about enclosed space entry the arrangement of the tank cms the structural arrangement of the tanks and the cargo pump and piping arrangement are important factors in the successful conducting of tank cleaning procedures a ship s ability to perform this cleaning routine effectively is key to its competitiveness since cargo owners insist on shipowners demonstrating their vessels ability to minimize cargo contamination to perform a risk analysis with respect to the dirty tank the elements constituting the risk should be determined and evaluated comprehensively in the complex environment of the dirty tank there are various types of contamination including residue of cargo salt water and cleaning agents in this study a bn analysis supported by expert judgments and the fuzzy approach is used to determine the reliability of the tank cleaning processes therefore the top event of the bn is defined as the tank remaining dirty after the cleaning process and the proposed bn is named the dirty tank model with the proposed methodology the main causes of the dirtiness and the relationships between these causes are considered together with their situational differences in this way both qualitative and quantitative terms can be explained regarding the important events that cause contamination of the tank through cleaning processes carried out with mechanical and operational systems supported by crew members the aim is to fully understand the reasons for a tank to remain dirty which may occur despite a careful cleaning process causing a substantial amount of cost for the shipping companies the results of network analysis would assist the operators in identifying important activities and crucial processes and in turn support them in the effective allocation of appropriate measures within the scope of the methodology the use of expert judgments which is one of the most remarkable components of this risk analysis the network configuration that describes the qualitative formation of the network and its quantitative structuring which offers the numerical analysis of the network and finally the comprehensive network analysis are presented 3 2 expert elicitation for the bayesian network in the case of insufficient historical data to elicit meaningful statistical inferences about the variables of the network network related information is acquired from the experts experts must have sufficient experience and knowledge about tank cleaning and contamination and be adequately observant to consider the events from the perspective of risk and probability to provide data about the analysis therefore it is recommended to specify the experts with risk analysis experience a group assessment procedure was used for the purpose of overcoming the difficulties in elicitation of judgments such as determining the many variables and parameters of the bn by the experts and for better control of their reasoning approaches and consistencies regarding the events discussed as a result the elicitation the experts judgments for the bn was performed with group interviews to control the experts sentiments about the queries and the overall study in determining the experts within the scope of the study it is crucial to ensure that linguistic and personal issues and employment or commercial considerations do not impede experts expressions during the evaluation experts should be able to highlight the elements they believe in and their contentions should only be for the data to reflect the real world expert judgments may include various biases and may not be properly calibrated unless necessary precautions are taken by the analyst before the elicitation process van der gaag et al 2002 for this reason the communication between the experts and the analyst also must be strong because the study is not limited to questions and answers or multiple choice evaluations experts judgments on causality and probabilities should be able to change direction and deepen as necessary through interactive exchanges between themselves and with the analysts experts are required to submit a consensus output with each inquiry process regarding the network yaşlı 2020 the optimum number of experts in the group is suggested to be between 3 and 5 for an efficient elicitation process clemen and winkler 1999 in this study three anonymous field experts consisting of a chemical tanker company deck inspector a master and a chief officer who have significant on duty service of 10 years 15 years and 3 years respectively and experiences on chemical tanker operations were consulted by submitting a consensus output for the whole network structure the importance of the descriptive information about risk and probability identification and the value of inferences for the study was represented to the experts shephard and kirkwood 1994 in addition to being used their judgments as the main data source for the analysis it also should be mentioned that there is no concept of right or wrong for the questioned issue only experts beliefs about the events are tried to be revealed renooij 2001 yaşlı 2020 unless the necessary precautions are taken experts assessments may reflect a variety of biases and may not be calibrated appropriately and easily van der gaag et al 2002 therefore it should be ensured that experts are free of any biased statements they may be in and that they have correct views about the reason and necessity for the study and the causality and probability bases on which the bn rests 3 3 bayesian network configuration a bn configuration has both qualitative and quantitative structures in a bn while the qualitative structure presents the causal network the quantitative structure gives the parameters of the network for the analysis 3 3 1 qualitative structure of bayesian network bns are dags that represent the occurrence of certain events together with their causality relations in a bn an arrow from event a to event b means that event a affects our belief about the event b events in the network are in a chain relationship that affects each a common effect relationship arising from multiple reasons or a common cause relationship existing where multiple effects occur proposed directed graphs intuitively present causal information about events kjærulff and madsen 2013 steyvers et al 2003 with a properly constructed bn many analyses and inferences based on scientific foundations can be performed kjærulff and madsen 2013 structural relationships within bns are based on the principles of dependence and independence while events that are connected by arrows are declared to be dependent on each other events that are not in common connection with each other and are not in the same lineage are considered to be either completely or conditional independent of each other the independence of events can be proven when the observation of two individual events does not offer any inference for each other on the other hand conditional independence is a fundamental element that bns use through bayesian theory and if the dependencies are constructed in such a way that the resulting graph is acyclic then it is assumed that the designer of the network has implicitly assumed conditional independence among certain variables garvey et al 2015 the bn configuration within the scope of the study is set to reveal the effective building blocks in the occurrence of events that cause the contamination of the tank remaining after the washing process assigned experts were guided for building the network by asking them the relevant questions and explaining the assumptions that are encoded in the model finally the variables together with their relationships with other variables are determined in a structured fashion langseth and portinale 2007 for example if the occurrence of an x event in the network is caused by certain states of events a and b then event x is reflected as the child variable and events a and b as the parent variables as given in fig 2 these events a b and x and the cause effect relationships indicated by arrows are identified through causal inquiries directed to the group of experts such as why the event x effect occurs what conditions are necessary for the occurrence of the event x or how to prevent this event x experts do the causal questioning together and verbally according to their knowledge and experience and provide a consensual answer after a period of discussion under the control of analysts it was found that the most effective way to reveal the qualitative structure of the bn to experts was to form group sessions where the consensus judgments are presented by the experts interactively so as to account for the experts considerations about the queries the first stage of network configuration is defining the top event which refers to the main event to be considered in the bn the top event should be defined comprehensively in a consensual manner with field experts also benefitting from the related literature and regulations and instructions then the intermediate events and root causes are defined together with their multi states which reflect the dynamics of the analysis by making causal inquiries about the top event the number of layers reflected on the network as intermediate events and the root causes are determined by the collaboration of the experts and analysts according to the nature of the events and the limits of the analysis specifying the root causes enables the identification of the most fundamental causes of the event under investigation dealing with these causes will generally prevent the top event from occurring the first step in the configuring of the bn is to determine all variables of the network together with their multi states after the construction and definition of the bn it is recommended to verify the network with the subjective opinions of different experts not involved in the network s construction phase the graph of the bn presenting the variables and the relationships between these variables is the basis of the analysis so a network validated by different experts is more likely to reflect the real situation and that the network will likewise be robust enough to enable further scientific analysis 3 3 2 quantitative structure of the bayesian network the quantitative structuring of bns is the determination of the network s parameters which include the prior probability distributions of the events according to their different statements and the conditional probability values that express the relationships between events for which depends on its parents a and b are shown in the template given in fig 3 for determination of the occurrence probability of the event x in positive state the prior probabilities of the parent nodes and the conditional probabilities of the child node should be calculated prior probabilities are defined as a provisional belief about the uncertainty of some certain event upon experience or data gained to date constantinou et al 2016 while the prior probabilities of the variables represent the prior information of the network they also provide an important data source for making crucial inferences related to the network via sensitivity analysis baksh et al 2018 hänninen and kujala 2014 kabir et al 2016 zarei et al 2017 the prior probabilities of the event a shown in fig 3 without any parents with two states a and a will present the probability distribution associated with the multi states of event a and provide important findings for the causal inference of the network conditional probabilities are the probability of an event given the occurrence of an influencing event jones et al 2010 in other words they reflect the relationships between variables in bns all other variables except root cause have conditional probability tables cpts the conditional probability values which are obtained from the experts are used with the information obtained from the prior probabilities of root causes to update the probabilities of the upper level events in the network all conditional probabilities of the event x which depends on its parents a and b are shown in the template given in fig 3 due to the lack of reliable statistical data to determine the probability values the fuzzy approach is utilised to perform mathematical operations on the linguistic expressions of experts linguistic probability expressions presented to the experts within the scope of the study and their related triangular fuzzy numbers are as given in table 1 the language of the maritime sector has been used in determining the linguistic probability terms so that experts could easily make their evaluations and infer the probability expressions related to events correctly the membership functions of the fuzzy numbers and their corresponding linguistic probability expressions are shown in fig 4 3 4 network analysis bn modelling has been expressed as a simple mathematical formula for calculating conditional and marginal probabilities of a random event jones et al 2010 while these calculations present forward and backward elicitation about the events within the network determining the effects of root causes on the occurrence of the top event and the effects of the small changes in the model s local parameters or evidence on any target node in the network is also possible with bn zhang et al 2019 forward elicitation is the determination of the probabilities of the events occurring under primary conditions they offer valuable causal inferences for the occurrence of the events based on the prior knowledge through to propagation of the bn the occurrence probability of each event in the network depending on the status of their parents is calculated based on the bn s basic calculation principles eq 2 and eq 3 and they present an important data source for further elicitation of the bn the basic principles of the bayes calculations are presented in fig 3 within the scope of this study the probabilities of the nodes of the dirty tank model are estimated with the forward elicitations backward elicitation is used to obtain an accurate probability distribution of any root cause when the top event occurs aliabadi et al 2020 it presents the posterior probabilities of the events and includes more information than the events prior probabilities posterior probabilities are calculated based on eq 1 which defines the bayes theory and they can reduce the uncertainty in the relationship between the network variables backward elicitation is also called diagnostic inferences bobbio et al 2001 and abductive reasoning kjærulff and madsen 2013 according to the network shown in fig 3 the backward elicitation is to find out the responsible event a or b given the occurrence of the event within the scope of the study the effects of the root causes on the variables which cause the tank to be dirty are shown with backward elicitations within the proposed bn forward and backward elicitations are considered the propagation of evidence to see the effects of the variables on the specific parameters of the network jones et al 2010 after all of this to deduce the most meaningful inference about the proposed network the reaction of the network to variations in variables is performed this is also known as the sensitivity analysis this is basically accomplished through the determination of the ratio of variation rov values for the root causes rov values calculated via the information obtained from the forward and backward elicitation about some specific variable in the network provide important comparisons among the variables instead of relying on merely prior or posterior probabilities the most influential causes related to the specific evidence about the network are defined with the rov values zarei et al 2017 where x i represents a specific event it is calculated as given in eq 8 8 r o v x i p o s t e r i o r p r o b x i p r i o r p r o b x i p r i o r p r o b x i 4 risk analysis for dirty tank within the scope of this study the fbn method is employed to determine the root causes of the dirty cargo tanks after the cleaning process and to develop effective prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk of the top event due to the lack of historical data to propose and analyse the network three field experts were consulted they were requested to present compromised outputs by sharing opinions under the control of the analysts and be flexible enough about their judgments and be open to interactive discussion to reach a consensus 4 1 bayesian network configuration in this paper the network configuration and the updating analysis are performed by using genie 4 0 which was developed by the decision system laboratory university of pittsburgh https www bayesfusion com genie the bn of this study is configurated with the top event of dirty tank that corresponds to the probabilistic assessment of whether the tanks are dirty regardless of the amount and type of contaminant which could be previous cargo cleaning agent water or salt originated from the main wash water as a result of the elicitation process with reasoning approach position of cm recessed tank structure planning performance attention of operator operational failure programming performance and technical knowledge have been determined as the root causes of the dirty tank network the proposed network presented to the field experts differed from that given to the consulted experts for verification in order to enhance the reliability of the network after accounting for their suggestions and the new consensus processes the network reached its final form as shown in fig 5 all nodes for the dirty tank network are defined as boolean variables and fuzzy expressions are preferred for the states of these nodes to facilitate the cognitive thinking processes in determining network parameters for example while the high effective state and the low complicated state represent the positive outcomes of the nodes of position of cm and recessed tank structure the low effective state and the high complicated state depict the negative outcomes of the specified nodes respectively after visualising the model nodes and the arcs experts specify the numeric values related to root causes and the nodes interconnections they used the linguistic probability expressions presented in table 1 to determine these basic parameters of the proposed bn at this point relying on the data from the group consensus is the compulsory choice to perform the analysis the prior probabilities of the root causes obtained from the experts under the control of analysts are shown in table 2 after defuzzification for the fuzzy numbers corresponding to linguistic probability assignments to the nodes to meet the requirement that the sum of probability of the nodes in various states is to be 1 we conducted normalization on exact probabilities of the nodes cpts of all nodes given their influencing parents excluding root causes are similarly determined and as an example cpts of the nodes of cargo residue and monitoring performance are presented in table 3 and table 4 respectively 4 2 network analysis and results considering all of the probabilities obtained through the experts forward elicitation is performed to reveal the causal inferences about the dirty tank according to primary conditions related to the root causes the occurrence probability of dirty tank is estimated to be 12 as shown in fig 6 after the first stage of the computations obtained results are discussed with the consulted field experts and the outcomes are found reasonable regardless of considering the amount and type of the residue as seen in fig 6 cargo residue ca residue salt residue and water residue are different types of tank contamination that will be named various residues within this study the dirty tank is connected to various residues with or logic in other words if any residue remains in the cargo tank the dirty tank is considered to have occurred regardless of the residue s type and amount for a deeper analysis about the effect of the dirty tank on all influencing variables in the model diagnostic inferences are made by employing backward elicitation obtained the posterior probabilities through new knowledge about the nodes of dirty tank and various residues present an insight into the root causes that may be responsible should a residue remain while fig 6 presents the prior probabilities without any observations of the network variables fig 7 depicts the posterior probabilities after observing that the tank is dirty additionally to specify the effects of the root causes on the existence of the specific residues despite the cleaning processes multiple backward elicitations are also performed finally the probabilities obtained by the propagation of the dirty tank model are used to deduce important information on risk mitigation and preventative strategies concerning tank contamination in this regard to find the root causes that may be responsible for the residues in the tank the rov values eq 8 of the root causes are compared to each other as in fig 8 it is possible to understand from fig 8 the operational failure has the most effective root cause for being of the tank dirty as more specifically it has the highest influence on the existence of salt and water residue although the effect of the recessed tank structure is minimal in the implication of the dirty tank general diagnostics it can be seen that the effect is quite high in the presence of cargo residue and ca residue similarly although the root cause of programming performance does not have a high impact under the general view of dirty tank evidence it appears to have a significant effect on other sources of residues except for the node of water residue in this case the effects of both the contamination of the tank regardless of amount or type of any residue and the effects of the root causes on the presence of different residues can be inferred by considering the rov values of the root causes after specifying the effects of the root causes on specific conditions observing the sensitivity of the top event is also reasonable for valuable inference about the study to analyse the impact of causal factors of the dirty tank node we utilised the tornado diagrams of the genie and just assigned the related variable as a target node the tornado diagram which is shown in fig 9 offers the impact of the causes on the dirty tank node basically the length of the bars can be interpreted as a measurement of the effects of the causes under the variation of probability of the dirty tank by 10 as can be seen from fig 9 the nodes of the cargo residue cleaning agent residue salt residue water residue washing performance discharge performance drying performance operational performance and steam source are the most leading causes of dirty tank 5 conclusion with the dirty tank model critical qualitative and quantitative findings related to the important factors affecting tank contamination have been revealed the most influential causes for the tank contamination have been identified concerning the tank operations carried out together with the mechanically and manually operated processes although different root causes due to different residues come to the forefront in terms of contamination of the tank it is assessed that operational failure is the most important root cause of the tank contamination since a significant part of the cleaning operation is carried out manually unlike the technical knowledge or attention of operator operational failure refers to overconfidence underestimating the tasks of operation lack of information specific to the operation lack of situational awareness incorrect decisions and failure to put theoretical information into practice in this sense based on the interviews with the field experts it is considered that beyond the standard training the continuous training and evaluation programs to be implemented for the staff involved in the cleaning operations would be an effective measure in reducing the risk of dirty cargo tanks moreover it is thought that the competence required for the relevant operations cannot be achieved only with theoretical or computer based simulator training instead conducting applied training in environments where the real operational environment is better simulated would produce more effective results it is necessary to systematically assess and evaluate the practical training and practical capabilities of the personnel in the process of being employed as trainees and to proactively understand the results obtained for risk reducing purposes international organisations rule makers and other safety related advising non governmental organisations are expected to declare new and purposeful training assessment and evaluation policies on the other hand it has been concluded that the attention of operator which is also a root cause associated with operators is a factor based on psychological or other non intervening factors working hours resting periods age etc independent of reliability culture and training based on the flexibility of the operational schedule well organized working hours and rest periods would be effective in reducing the risk of the dirty tank however attention of operator could be accepted as an assumption that must be considered inevitable consequently the bn enables to achieve of critical findings by performing a sensitivity analysis on changes of their probability values employing causal and diagnostic inferences throughout the network to reduce the occurrence probability of any top event or undesired node of the network the bn provides systematic support to minimize the effects of causation factors for a cost effective management approach similarly where some factors cannot be minimized in terms of time and cost bn allows operators to determine and control other causes for risk mitigation in order to make further sense of these findings a future study is planned that reveals a cost benefit analysis to reduce the risk of dirty tanks depending on the type and quantity of contaminants credit authorship contribution statement yunus emre senol investigation resources data curation

20472,the design and implementation of a cathodic protection system for offshore steel monopiles used to support wind turbines are required to protect them from corrosion this paper uses the recommended practice dnvgl rp b401 cathodic protection design to demonstrate the step by step sacrificial anode cathodic protection system design of an offshore monopile located off the coast of massachusetts it compares the requirements for coated and uncoated structures and discusses the other factors that need to be taken into consideration keywords corrosion cathodic protection sacrificial anode offshore wind monopile 1 introduction offshore wind structures are designed to harvest the renewable energy of the more stable and high velocity winds found over the oceans these structures are supported by several foundation types depending on the water depth and seabed type these include monopile jacket and gravity jensen 2017 steel monopile foundations are the most common fixed foundation type for water depths up to 40 m steelwind nordenham 2020 they are exposed to harsh marine conditions and must be designed to withstand both the physical and corrosive nature of the marine environment adedipe et al 2016 momber et al 2015 price and figueira 2017 the purpose of this paper is to make comparisons between coated and uncoated structures and to provide discussions with respect to anode size placement and allowances that are required for location and other factors by applying the dnvgl rp b401 recommended practice for sacrificial anode cathodic protection design to the external surface of a notional structure to be placed in 40 m water depth off the coast of massachusetts corrosion is a significant problem for offshore monopiles since it may compromise the structural integrity by reducing the thickness of structural components and also lead to corrosion fatigue and microbially induced corrosion jensen 2017 price and figueira 2017 the severity of corrosion is determined by the ambient conditions of the surrounding waters which includes temperature salinity dissolved oxygen ph marine growth tides currents and wave actions the methods available to mitigate corrosion on offshore monopiles include corrosion allowance cathodic protection and coating systems jensen 2017 lichtenstein 2015 momber 2011 munger and vincent 2014 corrosion allowance is implemented in the design for all metal structures where other corrosion protection systems are not available cathodic protection is the main method used for structures and components below mean water line mwl protective coatings are required for atmospheric splash and tidal zones however they are optional for the submerged surfaces price and figueira 2017 therefore all towers and transition pieces tp are coated but majority of the monopiles are uncoated lichtenstein 2015 mathiesen et al 2016 osvoll et al 2015 coating systems are designed to prevent corrosion due to their barrier inhibitive or galvanic effect momber and marquardt 2018 price and figueira 2017 sørensen et al 2009 barrier coatings are used for the submerged steel of monopiles and mitigate corrosion by preventing water and oxygen from reaching the steel surface from the medium weinell et al 2017 inhibitive coatings promote passivation of the metal surface and generate protective layers they are used as a primer coating since the reaction with the steel surface is required galvanic coatings use metals or metal alloys that are more active in the galvanic series such as zinc and aluminum syrek gerstenkorn et al 2019 they are only used as primer coating since they need to be in contact with the steel surface the design of coatings systems to be used for offshore structures is outlined in en iso 12944 iso 20340 and norsok m 501 standards monopile structures experience both external and internal corrosion the external corrosion of monopiles is similar to corrosion experienced on other offshore structures however the dynamic loading created by the wind turbines make them prone to corrosion fatigue adedipe et al 2016 jensen 2017 the internal surfaces of monopiles are also in contact with seawater and also require a method for corrosion control it was initially proposed that these sealed structures would be isolated from air and therefore once the oxygen is depleted corrosion would not be a problem dnv 2014 practical experience however has shown that these structures are not airtight and according to dnvgl rp 0416 recommended practice the internal corrosion problems of monopiles may be resolved with either a coating system a corrosion allowance a cp system or a hybrid system which includes two or more systems the use of sacrificial anodes for the internal surfaces of the submerged zone has been reported to increase the acidification of the enclosed water delwiche and lydon 2018 maher and swain 2019 stein t et al 2015 tavares et al 2015 it was found that when internal surfaces of monopiles were retrofitted with sacrificial aluminum anode cathodic protection systems the change in hydrogen concentration was insignificant however hydrogen sulfide levels increased delwiche et al 2017 delwiche and lydon 2018 delwiche and tavares 2017 mathiesen et al 2016 if sacrificial anode cp is the method to be utilized for the internal surfaces a daily 5 seawater exchange is required by adjusting the seals around j tubes delwiche and tavares 2017 larsen 2017 dnvgl rp b401 specified that the same current densities should be utilized for both external and internal cp system designs however krebs 2018 ran a pilot study that found significantly lower current requirements for the internal surfaces initial current density 0 050 a m2 mean current density 0 015 a m2 and final current density 0 050 a m2 cathodic protection cp is required for corrosion control of the immersed portion of the steel monopiles used to support the offshore wind turbines the design and application of corrosion control methods are detailed by several standards and guidelines including bs en iso 12473 2017 nace sp0176 2007 sg vgb baw s 021 04 2018 07 en and dnvgl rp b401 their purpose is to provide guidance for a robust and reliable design and prevent the implementation of faulty designs which may lead to additional costs for maintenance and repair and reduced service life mathiesen et al 2016 momber 2011 the application of the dnvgl rp b401 recommended practice to a sacrificial aluminum anode cp system design for a mono bucket sarhadi et al 2018 and monopile offshore wind support structures kirchgeorg et al 2018 osvoll et al 2015 has been investigated osvoll et al 2015 concluded that high number of galvanic anodes required to protect an uncoated offshore monopile will interfere with each other and cause under protection when they are stacked on the tp the alternative is to apply coatings to the structure to reduce the current demand sarhadi et al 2018 reported that a category iii coating system would result in an 80 reduction in long slender stand off anode aluminum anode mass osvoll et al 2015 however found only a 63 reduction in long slender stand off aluminum anode mass with category iii coating system kirchgeorg et al 2018 estimated a 55 reduction in anode mass without specifying an anode and a coating type the methods used to obtain these values were not fully presented in the publications and therefore the discrepancies in the percent reduction of anode mass are hard to explain the overall conclusions would appear to favor the use of cp in conjunction with a coating system 2 dnvgl rp b401 method the inputs and calculations that are required by the recommended practice are as follows surface area of the structure uncoated or coated steel environment cathodic protection current demand net anode mass anode resistance the minimum number of anodes total current output based on the number and type size of anodes to be installed fig 1 the structure chosen for this design is taken from the draft construction and operations plan of vineyard wind epsilon associates inc 2020 there are no specifications for corrosion control presented in this document 2 1 structure and environmental conditions the monopile dimensions are as follows 10 m outer diameter 70 100 mm wall thickness a total length of 85 5 m 45 m buried in the sediment 40 m in the seawater column and 0 5 m above the mean water line mwl epsilon associates inc 2020 the monopile is conductively connected to the tower by a transition piece tp this extends from just below sea level through the intertidal zone and splash zone and is electrically grounded to the monopile for corrosion control calculations it is assumed to be an extension of the monopile fig 2 the structures will be placed 24 km off the coast of massachusetts and the south of martha s vineyard it is reported that the bottom water temperature usually varies between 6 and 12 c richaud et al 2016 the salinity ranges between 31 and 33 6 g kg or parts per thousand ppt and dissolved oxygen changes between 7 5 and 10 5 mg l the semidiurnal tides have a 12 4 h period with 35 40 cm amplitude these generate tidal currents between the order of 0 1 1 2 m s the significant wave heights range from 0 5 to 2 5 m with peak periods of 5 10 s boem 2012 according to vgb baw s 021 04 2018 07 en the accepted design life for these structures is 25 years due to the structural health at the splash and tidal zone this zone is usually occupied by the tp and experiences high corrosion rates due to intermittent wetting and drying cycles high abrasion forces and high oxygen concentration cp systems are ineffective at mitigating corrosion in this zone due to the lack of continuous seawater immersion the methods preferred for corrosion prevention at this zone are coating systems and corrosion allowance the most common coating types applied to tp are barrier coatings the design life of these coatings is between 15 and 20 years at the splash zone dnvgl 2016 the design life of the monopile will be assumed to be 25 years for the cathodic protection design detailed in this paper 3 results 3 1 surface area calculations the external surface area was first calculated for the splash submerged and buried zones table 1 3 2 cathodic protection current demand the cathodic protection current demand is determined by multiplying the surface area of steel to be protected by the recommended initial mean and final current densities required to polarize and maintain the steel at a potential more negative than 0 8 v reference ag agcl seawater electrode table 2 if the steel is coated then the current demand will be reduced and this is calculated using a coating breakdown factor table 3 the mean current demand known as the steady state current demand is used to determine the mass of anodes required to protect the structure for its design life the initial current demands are used to promote rapid calcareous deposit formation to reduce the overall current demand of the structure during its design life final current demands are used when the formed calcareous deposit and attached fouling are partly removed by either natural events like waves currents hurricanes storms etc or cleaning actions for inspection repair and maintenance therefore both initial and final current demands are used to determine the maximum current output required from the anodes for initial polarization and end of life protection the formula for the current demand dnvgl 2017 is 1 i c a c i c f c where ic a is current demand ac m2 is individual surface area ic a m2 is relevant current density and fc is coating breakdown factor the recommended design current densities for uncoated steel are a function of seawater temperature and depth these are provided in table a 1 and table a 2 dnvgl 2017 the seawater temperature at this location is temperate the initial mean and final design current densities for uncoated steel between 7 and 11 c water temperatures are presented in table 2 the recommended design current density for surfaces buried in the sediment is 0 020 a m2 dnvgl 2017 the application of coatings in combination with cp will cause a reduction in current demand coatings according to dnvgl rp b401 are defined by the following three categories category i requires one layer of epoxy coating with a minimum coating thickness of 20 μm dft category ii requires one or more layers of marine paint coating with a minimum coating thickness of 250 μm dft category iii requires two or more layers of marine paint coating with a minimum coating thickness of 350 μm dft the reduction in current is found by calculating a coating breakdown factor the coating breakdown factor for uncoated surfaces is equal to one and therefore there is no reduction in current the coating breakdown factor for coated surfaces is found by applying the constants presented in table 3 to the formula for initial mean and final current demands the coating breakdown factor for the initial current demand for coated surfaces dnvgl 2017 is 2 f c a b t where a and b are constants table 3 depending on the coating category and t is the coating age in years if fc equals one the coating system does not contribute to reducing current at all whereas zero means the steel structure is completely insulated the mean and final coating breakdown factors dnvgl 2017 are calculated as 3 f c m a b t f 2 4 f c f a b t f where tf is the design life of cp if either value is more than one fcf should be equal to one and fcm dnvgl 2017 may be calculated as 5 f c m 1 1 a 2 2 b t f the coating breakdown factors for categories i ii and iii coatings and a 25 year design life are shown in table 4 the theoretical current demand for individual zones of the monopile can then be calculated for the uncoated and coated conditions table 5 the total current demand for the monopile is the sum of the individual zones table 6 according to dnvgl rp b401 all coating categories will cause a significant reduction in initial cathodic current requirements however the method developed to calculate the coating breakdown factor provides a little allowance for the mean and final current demands for a category i coating the application of category ii and category iii coatings will result in a significant reduction in cathodic current demand 3 3 anode mass the total anode mass required for the design life of the structure dnvgl 2017 is calculated as follows 6 m a i c m t f 8760 ε u where ε is the anode electrochemical capacity ah kg and u is the utilization factor aluminum anodes are the preferred choice song et al 2018 due to their higher electrochemical capacity and lower weight 2700 kg m3 dnvgl rp b401 recommends using 2000 ah kg for electrochemical capacity for aluminum anodes since short term experiments by manufacturers might report higher due to relatively high anodic current densities the utilization factor for a long slender stand off is 0 9 and for a long flush mounted anode is 0 85 the total anode mass kg for different conditions is calculated from mean current demand since both initial and final current demands do not reflect the constant state the calculated mass for aluminum anodes is shown in table 7 according to the dnvgl guide a category ii or iii coating is required to provide significant savings in the anode mass required for the design life the required anode mass alters with both the anode type and coating categories the system with long slender stand off anodes will provide a 25 year corrosion protection with less anode mass however these may add to wave loading of the structure coated structures will also require reduced anode mass however uncertainties due to coating damages during construction inspection and cleaning operations as well as damages from the environment may alter the electrical insulation of coatings these factors need to be considered for a robust cp design wyatt 1982 3 4 anode number calculations the number of anodes required must satisfy three requirements the mass required to provide the cp current for the design life icm the current required for initial ia tot i and final ia tot f current demand these are calculated as follows dnvgl 2017 7 c a t o t n c a i c m t f 8760 8 i a t o t i n i a i i c i 9 i a t o t f n i a f i c f where n is the number of anodes to be used and ca is the individual anode current capacity ah ca tot is the total anode current capacity icm ici icf are the mean initial and final current demands of a cp unit iai and iaf are the initial and final current output for the individual anodes the anode current capacity is the product of net mass per anode kg anode current capacity ah kg and utilization factor the anode dimensions need to be designed so that the number of anodes required to supply the current demand for the design life also provides the current output requirements for initial and final polarization 3 5 anode current output the anode current output must be sufficient to provide the initial and final current demands the individual anode current output is calculated using ohm s law 10 i δ e r a where δe is the potential difference reference ag agcl seawater between the steel structure protection potential 0 8 v and the anode close circuit potential 1 05 v and ra is the calculated anode resistance the 0 8 v reference ag agcl seawater is considered the minimum design protective potential for carbon and low alloy steels the 0 9 to 1 05 v reference ag agcl seawater is the appropriate design protection potentials for the service life of the steel structures however more positive potentials towards 0 8 v reference ag agcl seawater are expected close to the service life of the structure dnvgl 2017 the anode resistance is found by a formula that has been developed for different anode geometries and seawater resistance table 8 the geometry of a stand off anode normally assumes trapezoidal dimensions due to the methods by which they are cast into molds the apparent radius r is calculated by taking the square root of the cross sectional area divided by pi this value in addition to anode length and seawater resistance are combined into a formula by which the anode resistance can be found the resistance for a flush mounted anode is found by dividing the seawater resistance by the arithmetic mean of anode length and width the seawater resistance at this location was obtained graphically using the dnvgl practice the lowest seawater salinity and temperature recorded in this area are 31 ppt and 6 c richaud et al 2016 these will provide a seawater resistivity of 0 30 ω m table 8 two anode geometries were chosen from cathwell and deepwater inventory of anodes and were used for this design long slender stand off and long flush mounted anodes cathwell n d deepwater n d the initial and final resistance of individual anodes are functions of the dimensions the final dimensions are calculated by assuming a volume change related to the final mass of an anode eq 11 dnvgl 2017 11 m a f m a i 1 u where maf and mai final and initial mass and u is the utilization factor the final volume can be found by dividing the final mass by the specific density of the anode for long and short slender stand off and long flush mounted anodes the final length is assumed to be 10 shorter than the original length the radius of the final shapes is calculated assuming that the long and short slender stand off anode is a cylinder and the long flush mounted anode is a semi cylinder table 8 3 6 coated structures the application of category i ii or iii coatings will change the initial mean and final current demands table 6 the anode dimensions and numbers must provide sufficient anode mass to supply the number of amp hours required to supply the mean current for the design life and to provide the final current demand as calculated using the coating breakdown factors an iteration process was performed that satisfy eqs 7 9 for stand off anodes for each design to optimize anode dimensions and numbers for the uncoated and coated categories table 9 the total anode mass was calculated from the required number of anodes to provide the current demand the greater of initial or final times the individual anode mass and also as the anode mass required to provide the mean current demand for the design life of the structure according to dnvgl the mass of anodes required to provide the maximum current needs to be equal or greater than the mass required for the design life 4 discussion the design and installation of cp systems on offshore monopiles are critical to their long term integrity the application of dnvgl rp b401 recommended practice to the design of a cathodic protection system for a notional offshore monopile provided an opportunity to calculate the differences in anode mass and number for an uncoated and coated structure the sacrificial anode cp system was designed for 25 years by utilizing two types of aluminum anodes long slender stand off and flush mounted the required long slender stand off anode mass to protect the uncoated monopile was approximately 18 tonnes whereas it would be reduced to 15 8 and 5 5 tonnes for the monopile coated with category i ii and iii coatings respectively the required long slender flush mounted anode mass to protect the uncoated monopile was approximately 19 tonnes whereas it would be reduced to 16 9 and 6 tonnes with category i ii and iii coatings respectively the required mass for the long slender stand off anodes was less compared to the flush mounted anodes therefore the cp system was designed by utilizing the long slender stand off anodes the anode numbers for an uncoated and a coated structure were calculated by optimizing the anode dimensions to satisfy the anode mass balance between the design life and max current output according to the anode dimensions reported in table 8 the required number of long slender stand off anodes to provide 25 years cathodic protection was 85 for uncoated monopile it would be 107 88 and 45 for monopile with category i ii and iii coatings respectively it is important to distribute the anodes in a manner that ensures all parts of the structure receive protection practically this may be difficult and some structures will only receive protection from anodes attached to the tp due to considerations during installation lichtenstein 2015 mathiesen et al 2016 osvoll et al 2015 this may be problematic due to interference between anodes positioned on a limited surface area for example there needs to be approximately six layers on the tp to place 85 anodes calculated for an uncoated monopile this would be reduced to three layers to accommodate 45 anodes when category iii coating is applied the grounding issues occurring between the tp and the monopile and the distances between these anodes and the part of the structure that requires protection may raise concerns during design electricity leaving the anode through seawater to protect the steel experiences ir drop this creates potential gradients and at some distance from the anode the polarization potentials will no longer be sufficient to prevent corrosion wyatt et al 2020 have highlighted that the poor distribution may cause a reduction in current output from anodes when they are placed in close vicinity and it results in under protected surfaces due to neglecting the anode current and potential attenuation anode locations and related polarization potentials may be modeled with numerical methods to examine the design of the cp system jensen 2017 osvoll et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2018 for example the comparison of anode resistance to ground values calculated by recommended formulae and by simulation was studied to provide more robust cp design baynham and froome 2018 these approaches can be very valuable to the future optimization of cathodic protection design however the models may need to be verified with the field data the calculations showed that according to the dnvgl recommended practice there is little benefit to applying a category i coating the coating breakdown factors provided by dnvgl demonstrated that category ii and category iii coatings reduced both the total current demand and total anode mass required for protection the required long slender stand off aluminum anode mass was reduced approximately by 55 and 70 with incorporation of category ii and iii coating systems to cp system design respectively sarhadi et al 2018 and osvoll et al 2015 reported 80 and 63 reduction in long slender stand off anode aluminum anode mass with category iii coating system respectively kirchgeorg et al 2018 estimated 55 decrease in anode mass with coatings there are several challenges in applying the coating breakdown factor to the real life design the first is that the coating categories are related to coating thickness and not coating type or product secondly there is a lack of scientific data that quantifies the interaction between coatings and cathodic protection systems in offshore environments over a long term immersion thirdly cathodic protection may lead to cathodic disbondment of the coating iso 15711 2003 finally sacrificial anodes applied to coated structures will undergo little corrosion in the early design of the systems and may foul according to swain and patrick maxwell 1990 fouling on anodes altered the current output and efficiency when connected to uncoated carbon steel blackwood et al 2010 found that fouled aluminum and zinc anodes remained active when connected to stainless steel however in these experiments the driving potential between the anodes and stainless steel was greater than that between anodes and carbon steel and they do not report on the anode efficiency the design current densities obtained from dnvgl rp b401 are useful to initiate a cathodic protection design process however they may be insufficient to provide full protection wyatt et al 2020 they have argued that the recommended practices are drafted for offshore deepwater conditions and they do not reflect the impact of observed nearshore high seawater velocities oxygen concentrations and temperatures for example they provide theoretical calculations that show the cp current density for carbon steels increasing from 80 to 239 ma m2 for water velocities increasing from zero to 4 m s at 7 c temperature and 7 ppm oxygen concentration they also predict that it will increase from 91 to 131 ma m2 when oxygen concentrations increase from 7 to 10 ppm at 0 3 m s flowrates and 7 c temperature wyatt et al 2020 the ambient wave energy will also impact cp current demand in line with these findings dnvgl rp 0416 2016 recommends that the initial design current densities for external surfaces be increased by 50 to compensate for changes in seawater wyatt et al 2020 concluded that this is too conservative and a more realistic approach should be taken by utilizing metocean data and added that the upcoming iso dis 24656 standard on cathodic protection of offshore wind structures is expected to address some of these concerns the location and conditions that are encountered in the areas where the monopiles will be located must therefore be considered as additional factors determining cp current demand the data for marine growth rates at specific sites are required for a robust cp design marine organisms may reduce the required current density by preventing the diffusion of oxygen from seawater to the metal surface edyvean et al 1992 heavy growth may also lower the water velocities in the vicinity of the structure laque 1975 marine growth will however increase wave loading and fatigue and may also create an anaerobic environment where microbially induced corrosion will become a concern permeh et al 2020 corrosion fatigue may become a problem in areas of the structure where there are stress concentrations such as welds or insufficient cathodic protection adedipe et al 2016 jacob and mehmanparast 2021 price and figueira 2017 there have been no reported problems of biofouling of offshore oil and gas platforms causing problems to the cp systems reducing the amount of aluminum discharged from sacrificial anodes may also be important from an environmental perspective the number of sacrificial anode cp systems associated with offshore wind structures has also raised environmental concerns with respect to emissions of aluminum from anodes on marine life bell et al 2020 caplat et al 2020 kirchgeorg et al 2018 reese et al 2020 aluminum is typically found at a concentration of 0 5 0 68 μg l in coastal waters the martha s vineyard offshore wind farm has been permitted for 100 structures assuming the anode mass required for protecting uncoated structure calculated from dnvgl rp b401 is about 18 tonnes per structure and the design life is 25 years then an average of 72 tonnes of aluminum will be emitted from the entire wind farm every year the monopile coated with category iii coating will reduce the emissions to 22 tonnes of aluminum 5 conclusion the step by step implementation of the dnvgl rp b401 recommended practice to design a sacrificial anode cp design for a notional offshore wind monopile foundation deployed at martha s vineyard provides a base line of values with respect to anode dimensions numbers and mass required to protect an offshore monopile in uncoated and coated condition the calculations show that the application of a category ii or iii coating system offers significant benefit in the reduction of cathodic current demand and sacrificial anodes mass required to protect the structure this will reduce the mass and cost of anodes reduce aluminum emissions and may enable and more acceptable distribution of anodes to ensure that cp current is supplied over greater distance due to reduced ir drop it appears that the data and methods available to design corrosion control systems for the offshore steel monopiles require further refinement considerations must be given to the corrosivity of the environment in which they are operating the interactions between different zones the synergistic effects of coating systems and how best to place and distribute the anodes there may also be benefit to consider the use of impressed current anode systems that could be designed with sufficient driving potential to ensure polarization of the monopiles at greater distances from the transition piece where the anodes are mounted credit authorship contribution statement caglar erdogan writing original draft visualization writing reviewing and

20472,the design and implementation of a cathodic protection system for offshore steel monopiles used to support wind turbines are required to protect them from corrosion this paper uses the recommended practice dnvgl rp b401 cathodic protection design to demonstrate the step by step sacrificial anode cathodic protection system design of an offshore monopile located off the coast of

respect to anode size placement and allowances that are required for location and other factors by applying the dnvgl rp b401 recommended practice for sacrificial anode cathodic protection design to the external surface of a notional structure to be placed in 40 m water depth off the coast of massachusetts corrosion is a significant problem for offshore monopiles since it may compromise the

they are only used as primer coating since they need to be in contact with the steel surface the design of coatings systems to be used for offshore structures is outlined in en iso 12944 iso 20340 and norsok m 501 standards monopile structures experience both external and internal corrosion the external corrosion of monopiles is similar to corrosion experienced on other offshore structures however the dynamic loading created by the wind turbines make them prone to corrosion fatigue adedipe et al 2016 jensen 2017 the internal surfaces of monopiles are also in contact with seawater and also require a method for corrosion control it was initially proposed that these sealed structures would be isolated from air and therefore once the oxygen is depleted corrosion would not be a problem dnv 2014 practical experience however has shown that these structures are not airtight and according to dnvgl rp 0416 recommended practice the internal corrosion problems of monopiles may be resolved with either a coating system a corrosion allowance a cp system or a hybrid system which includes two or more systems the use of sacrificial anodes for the internal surfaces of the submerged zone has been reported to increase the acidification of the enclosed water delwiche and lydon 2018 maher and swain 2019 stein t et al 2015 tavares et al 2015 it was found that when internal surfaces of monopiles were retrofitted with sacrificial aluminum anode cathodic protection systems the change in hydrogen concentration was insignificant however hydrogen sulfide levels increased delwiche et al 2017 delwiche and lydon 2018 delwiche and tavares 2017 mathiesen et al 2016 if sacrificial anode cp is the method to be utilized for the internal surfaces a daily 5 seawater exchange is required by adjusting the seals around j tubes delwiche and tavares 2017 larsen 2017 dnvgl rp b401 specified that the same current densities should be utilized for both external and internal cp system designs however krebs 2018 ran a pilot study that found significantly lower current requirements for the internal surfaces initial current density 0 050 a m2 mean current density 0 015 a m2 and final current density 0 050 a m2 cathodic protection cp is required for corrosion control of the immersed portion of the steel monopiles used to support the offshore wind turbines the design and application of corrosion control methods are detailed by several standards and guidelines including bs en iso 12473 2017 nace sp0176 2007 sg vgb baw s 021 04 2018 07 en and dnvgl rp b401 their purpose is to provide guidance for a robust and reliable design and prevent the implementation of faulty designs which may lead to additional costs for maintenance and repair and reduced service life mathiesen et al 2016 momber 2011 the application of the dnvgl rp b401 recommended practice to a sacrificial aluminum anode cp system design for a mono bucket sarhadi et al 2018 and monopile offshore wind support structures kirchgeorg et al 2018 osvoll et al 2015 has been investigated osvoll et al 2015 concluded that high number of galvanic anodes required to protect an uncoated offshore monopile will interfere with each other and cause under protection when they are stacked on the tp the alternative is to apply coatings to the structure to reduce the current demand sarhadi et al 2018 reported that a category iii coating system would result in an 80 reduction in long slender stand off anode aluminum anode mass osvoll et al 2015 however found only a 63 reduction in long slender stand off aluminum anode mass with category iii coating system kirchgeorg et al 2018 estimated a 55 reduction in anode mass without specifying an anode and a coating type the methods used to obtain these values were not fully presented in the publications and therefore the discrepancies in the percent reduction of anode mass are hard to explain the overall conclusions would appear to favor the use of cp in conjunction with a coating system 2 dnvgl rp b401 method the inputs and calculations that are required by the recommended practice are as follows surface area of the structure uncoated or coated steel environment cathodic protection current demand net anode mass anode resistance the minimum number of anodes total current output based on the number and type size of anodes to be installed fig 1 the structure chosen for this design is taken from the draft construction and operations plan of vineyard wind epsilon associates inc 2020 there are no specifications for corrosion control presented in this document 2 1 structure and environmental conditions the monopile dimensions are as follows 10 m outer diameter 70 100 mm wall thickness a total length of 85 5 m 45 m buried in the sediment 40 m in the seawater column and 0 5 m above the mean water line mwl epsilon associates inc 2020 the monopile is conductively connected to the tower by a transition piece tp this extends from just below sea level through the intertidal zone and splash zone and is electrically grounded to the monopile for corrosion control calculations it is assumed to be an extension of the monopile fig 2 the structures will be placed 24 km off the coast of massachusetts and the south of martha s vineyard it is reported that the bottom water temperature usually varies between 6 and 12 c richaud et al 2016 the salinity ranges between 31 and 33 6 g kg or parts per thousand ppt and dissolved oxygen changes between 7 5 and 10 5 mg l the semidiurnal tides have a 12 4 h period with 35 40 cm amplitude these generate tidal currents between the order of 0 1 1 2 m s the significant wave heights range from 0 5 to 2 5 m with peak periods of 5 10 s boem 2012 according to vgb baw s 021 04 2018 07 en the accepted design life for these structures is 25 years due to the structural health at the splash and tidal zone this zone is usually occupied by the tp and experiences high corrosion rates due to intermittent wetting and drying cycles high abrasion forces and high oxygen concentration cp systems are ineffective at mitigating corrosion in this zone due to the lack of continuous seawater immersion the methods preferred for corrosion prevention at this zone are coating systems and corrosion allowance the most common coating types applied to tp are barrier coatings the design life of these coatings is between 15 and 20 years at the splash zone dnvgl 2016 the design life of the monopile will be assumed to be 25 years for the cathodic protection design detailed in this paper 3 results 3 1 surface area calculations the external surface area was first calculated for the splash submerged and buried zones table 1 3 2 cathodic protection current demand the cathodic protection current demand is determined by multiplying the surface area of steel to be protected by the recommended initial mean and final current densities required to polarize and maintain the steel at a potential more negative than 0 8 v reference ag agcl seawater electrode table 2 if the steel is coated then the current demand will be reduced and this is calculated using a coating breakdown factor table 3 the mean current demand known as the steady state current demand is used to determine the mass of anodes required to protect the structure for its design life the initial current demands are used to promote rapid calcareous deposit formation to reduce the overall current demand of the structure during its design life final current demands are used when the formed calcareous deposit and attached fouling are partly removed by either natural events like waves currents hurricanes storms etc or cleaning actions for inspection repair and maintenance therefore both initial and final current demands are used to determine the maximum current output required from the anodes for initial polarization and end of life protection the formula for the current demand dnvgl 2017 is 1 i c a c i c f c where ic a is current demand ac m2 is individual surface area ic a m2 is relevant current density and fc is coating breakdown factor the recommended design current densities for uncoated steel are a function of seawater temperature and depth these are provided in table a 1 and table a 2 dnvgl 2017 the seawater temperature at this location is temperate the initial mean and final design current densities for uncoated steel between 7 and 11 c water temperatures are presented in table 2 the recommended design current density for surfaces buried in the sediment is 0 020 a m2 dnvgl 2017 the application of coatings in combination with cp will cause a reduction in current demand coatings according to dnvgl rp b401 are defined by the following three categories category i requires one layer of epoxy coating with a minimum coating thickness of 20 μm dft category ii requires one or more layers of marine paint coating with a minimum coating thickness of 250 μm dft category iii requires two or more layers of marine paint coating with a minimum coating thickness of 350 μm dft the reduction in current is found by calculating a coating breakdown factor the coating breakdown factor for uncoated surfaces is equal to one and therefore there is no reduction in current the coating breakdown factor for coated surfaces is found by applying the constants presented in table 3 to the formula for initial mean and final current demands the coating breakdown factor for the initial current demand for coated surfaces dnvgl 2017 is 2 f c a b t where a and b are constants table 3 depending on the coating category and t is the coating age in years if fc equals one the coating system does not contribute to reducing current at all whereas zero means the steel structure is completely insulated the mean and final coating breakdown factors dnvgl 2017 are calculated as 3 f c m a b t f 2 4 f c f a b t f where tf is the design life of cp if either value is more than one fcf should be equal to one and fcm dnvgl 2017 may be calculated as 5 f c m 1 1 a 2 2 b t f the coating breakdown factors for categories i ii and iii coatings and a 25 year design life are shown in table 4 the theoretical current demand for individual zones of the monopile can then be calculated for the uncoated and coated conditions table 5 the total current demand for the monopile is the sum of the individual zones table 6 according to dnvgl rp b401 all coating categories will cause a significant reduction in initial cathodic current requirements however the method developed to calculate the coating breakdown factor provides a little allowance for the mean and final current demands for a category i coating the application of category ii and category iii coatings will result in a significant reduction in cathodic current demand 3 3 anode mass the total anode mass required for the design life of the structure dnvgl 2017 is calculated as follows 6 m a i c m t f 8760 ε u where ε is the anode electrochemical capacity ah kg and u is the utilization factor aluminum anodes are the preferred choice song et al 2018 due to their higher electrochemical capacity and lower weight 2700 kg m3 dnvgl rp b401 recommends using 2000 ah kg for electrochemical capacity for aluminum anodes since short term experiments by manufacturers might report higher due to relatively high anodic current densities the utilization factor for a long slender stand off is 0 9 and for a long flush mounted anode is 0 85 the total anode mass kg for different conditions is calculated from mean current demand since both initial and final current demands do not reflect the constant state the calculated mass for aluminum anodes is shown in table 7 according to the dnvgl guide a category ii or iii coating is required to provide significant savings in the anode mass required for the design life the required anode mass alters with both the anode type and coating categories the system with long slender stand off anodes will provide a 25 year corrosion protection with less anode mass however these may add to wave loading of the structure coated structures will also require reduced anode mass however uncertainties due to coating damages during construction inspection and cleaning operations as well as damages from the environment may alter the electrical insulation of coatings these factors need to be considered for a robust cp design wyatt 1982 3 4 anode number calculations the number of anodes required must satisfy three requirements the mass required to provide the cp current for the design life icm the current required for initial ia tot i and final ia tot f current demand these are calculated as follows dnvgl 2017 7 c a t o t n c a i c m t f 8760 8 i a t o t i n i a i i c i 9 i a t o t f n i a f i c f where n is the number of anodes to be used and ca is the individual anode current capacity ah ca tot is the total anode current capacity icm ici icf are the mean initial and final current demands of a cp unit iai and iaf are the initial and final current output for the individual anodes the anode current capacity is the product of net mass per anode kg anode current capacity ah kg and utilization factor the anode dimensions need to be designed so that the number of anodes required to supply the current demand for the design life also provides the current output requirements for initial and final polarization 3 5 anode current output the anode current output must be sufficient to provide the initial and final current demands the individual anode current output is calculated using ohm s law 10 i δ e r a where δe is the potential difference reference ag agcl seawater between the steel structure protection potential 0 8 v and the anode close circuit potential 1 05 v and ra is the calculated anode resistance the 0 8 v reference ag agcl seawater is considered the minimum design protective potential for carbon and low alloy steels the 0 9 to 1 05 v reference ag agcl seawater is the appropriate design protection potentials for the service life of the steel structures however more positive potentials towards 0 8 v reference ag agcl seawater are expected close to the service life of the structure dnvgl 2017 the anode resistance is found by a formula that has been developed for different anode geometries and seawater resistance table 8 the geometry of a stand off anode normally assumes trapezoidal dimensions due to the methods by which they are cast into molds the apparent radius r is calculated by taking the square root of the cross sectional area divided by pi this value in addition to anode length and seawater resistance are combined into a formula by which the anode resistance can be found the resistance for a flush mounted anode is found by dividing the seawater resistance by the arithmetic mean of anode length and width the seawater resistance at this location was obtained graphically using the dnvgl practice the lowest seawater salinity and temperature recorded in this area are 31 ppt and 6 c richaud et al 2016 these will provide a seawater resistivity of 0 30 ω m table 8 two anode geometries were chosen from cathwell and deepwater inventory of anodes and were used for this design long slender stand off and long flush mounted anodes cathwell n d deepwater n d the initial and final resistance of individual anodes are functions of the dimensions the final dimensions are calculated by assuming a volume change related to the final mass of an anode eq 11 dnvgl 2017 11 m a f m a i 1 u where maf and mai final and initial mass and u is the utilization factor the final volume can be found by dividing the final mass by the specific density of the anode for long and short slender stand off and long flush mounted anodes the final length is assumed to be 10 shorter than the original length the radius of the final shapes is calculated assuming that the long and short slender stand off anode is a cylinder and the long flush mounted anode is a semi cylinder table 8 3 6 coated structures the application of category i ii or iii coatings will change the initial mean and final current demands table 6 the anode dimensions and numbers must provide sufficient anode mass to supply the number of amp hours required to supply the mean current for the design life and to provide the final current demand as calculated using the coating breakdown factors an iteration process was performed that satisfy eqs 7 9 for stand off anodes for each design to optimize anode dimensions and numbers for the uncoated and coated categories table 9 the total anode mass was calculated from the required number of anodes to provide the current demand the greater of initial or final times the individual anode mass and also as the anode mass required to provide the mean current demand for the design life of the structure according to dnvgl the mass of anodes required to provide the maximum current needs to be equal or greater than the mass required for the design life 4 discussion the design and installation of cp systems on offshore monopiles are critical to their long term integrity the application of dnvgl rp b401 recommended practice to the design of a cathodic protection system for a notional offshore monopile provided an opportunity to calculate the differences in anode mass and number for an uncoated and coated structure the sacrificial anode cp system was designed for 25 years by utilizing two types of aluminum anodes long slender stand off and flush mounted the required long slender stand off anode mass to protect the uncoated monopile was approximately 18 tonnes whereas it would be reduced to 15 8 and 5 5 tonnes for the monopile coated with category i ii and iii coatings respectively the required long slender flush mounted anode mass to protect the uncoated monopile was approximately 19 tonnes whereas it would be reduced to 16 9 and 6 tonnes with category i ii and iii coatings respectively the required mass for the long slender stand off anodes was less compared to the flush mounted anodes therefore the cp system was designed by utilizing the long slender stand off anodes the anode numbers for an uncoated and a coated structure were calculated by optimizing the anode dimensions to satisfy the anode mass balance between the design life and max current output according to the anode dimensions reported in table 8 the required number of long slender stand off anodes to provide 25 years cathodic protection was 85 for uncoated monopile it would be 107 88 and 45 for monopile with category i ii and iii coatings respectively it is important to distribute the anodes in a manner that ensures all parts of the structure receive protection practically this may be difficult and some structures will only receive protection from anodes attached to the tp due to considerations during installation lichtenstein 2015 mathiesen et al 2016 osvoll et al 2015 this may be problematic due to interference between anodes positioned on a limited surface area for example there needs to be approximately six layers on the tp to place 85 anodes calculated for an uncoated monopile this would be reduced to three layers to accommodate 45 anodes when category iii coating is applied the grounding issues occurring between the tp and the monopile and the distances between these anodes and the part of the structure that requires protection may raise concerns during design electricity leaving the anode through seawater to protect the steel experiences ir drop this creates potential gradients and at some distance from the anode the polarization potentials will no longer be sufficient to prevent corrosion wyatt et al 2020 have highlighted that the poor distribution may cause a reduction in current output from anodes when they are placed in close vicinity and it results in under protected surfaces due to neglecting the anode current and potential attenuation anode locations and related polarization potentials may be modeled with numerical methods to examine the design of the cp system jensen 2017 osvoll et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2018 for example the comparison of anode resistance to ground values calculated by recommended formulae and by simulation was studied to provide more robust cp design baynham and froome 2018 these approaches can be very valuable to the future optimization of cathodic protection design however the models may need to be verified with the field data the calculations showed that according to the dnvgl recommended practice there is little benefit to applying a category i coating the coating breakdown factors provided by dnvgl demonstrated that category ii and category iii coatings reduced both the total current demand and total anode mass required for protection the required long slender stand off aluminum anode mass was reduced approximately by 55 and 70 with incorporation of category ii and iii coating systems to cp system design respectively sarhadi et al 2018 and osvoll et al 2015 reported 80 and 63 reduction in long slender stand off anode aluminum anode mass with category iii coating system respectively kirchgeorg et al 2018 estimated 55 decrease in anode mass with coatings there are several challenges in applying the coating breakdown factor to the real life design the first is that the coating categories are related to coating thickness and not coating type or product secondly there is a lack of scientific data that quantifies the interaction between coatings and cathodic protection systems in offshore environments over a long term immersion thirdly cathodic protection may lead to cathodic disbondment of the coating iso 15711 2003 finally sacrificial anodes applied to coated structures will undergo little corrosion in the early design of the systems and may foul according to swain and patrick maxwell 1990 fouling on anodes altered the current output and efficiency when connected to uncoated carbon steel blackwood et al 2010 found that fouled aluminum and zinc anodes remained active when connected to stainless steel however in these experiments the driving potential between the anodes and stainless steel was greater than that between anodes and carbon steel and they do not report on the anode efficiency the design current densities obtained from dnvgl rp b401 are useful to initiate a cathodic protection design process however they may be insufficient to provide full protection wyatt et al 2020 they have argued that the recommended practices are drafted for offshore deepwater conditions and they do not reflect the impact of observed nearshore high seawater velocities oxygen concentrations and temperatures for example they provide theoretical calculations that show the cp current density for carbon steels increasing from 80 to 239 ma m2 for water velocities increasing from zero to 4 m s at 7 c temperature and 7 ppm oxygen concentration they also predict that it will increase from 91 to 131 ma m2 when oxygen concentrations increase from 7 to 10 ppm at 0 3 m s flowrates and 7 c temperature wyatt et al 2020 the ambient wave energy will also impact cp current demand in line with these findings dnvgl rp 0416 2016 recommends that the initial design current densities for external surfaces be increased by 50 to compensate for changes in seawater wyatt et al 2020 concluded that this is too conservative and a more realistic approach should be taken by utilizing metocean data and added that the upcoming iso dis 24656 standard on cathodic protection of offshore wind structures is expected to address some of these concerns the location and conditions that are encountered in the areas where the monopiles will be located must therefore be considered as additional factors determining cp current demand the data for marine growth rates at specific sites are required for a robust cp design marine organisms may reduce the required current density by preventing the diffusion of oxygen from seawater to the metal surface edyvean et al 1992 heavy growth may also lower the water velocities in the vicinity of the structure laque 1975 marine growth will however increase wave loading and fatigue and may also create an anaerobic environment where microbially induced corrosion will become a concern permeh et al 2020 corrosion fatigue may become a problem in areas of the structure where there are stress concentrations such as welds or insufficient cathodic protection adedipe et al 2016 jacob and mehmanparast 2021 price and figueira 2017 there have been no reported problems of biofouling of offshore oil and gas platforms causing problems to the cp systems reducing the amount of aluminum discharged from sacrificial anodes may also be important from an environmental perspective the number of sacrificial anode cp systems associated with offshore wind structures has also raised environmental concerns with respect to emissions of aluminum from anodes on marine life bell et al 2020 caplat et al 2020 kirchgeorg et al 2018 reese et al 2020 aluminum is typically found at a concentration of 0 5 0 68 μg l in coastal waters the martha s vineyard offshore wind farm has been permitted for 100 structures assuming the anode mass required for protecting uncoated structure calculated from dnvgl rp b401 is about 18 tonnes per structure and the design life is 25 years then an average of 72 tonnes of aluminum will be emitted from the entire wind farm every year the monopile coated with category iii coating will reduce the emissions to 22 tonnes of aluminum 5 conclusion the step by step implementation of the dnvgl rp b401 recommended practice to design a sacrificial anode cp design for a notional offshore wind monopile foundation deployed at martha s vineyard provides a base line of values with respect to anode dimensions numbers and mass required to protect an offshore monopile in uncoated and coated condition the calculations show that the application of a category ii or iii coating system offers significant benefit in the reduction of cathodic current demand and sacrificial anodes mass required to protect the structure this will reduce the mass and cost of anodes reduce aluminum emissions and may enable and more acceptable distribution of anodes to ensure that cp current is supplied over greater distance due to reduced ir drop it appears that the data and methods available to design corrosion control systems for the offshore steel monopiles require further refinement considerations must be given to the corrosivity of the environment in which they are operating the interactions between different zones the synergistic effects of coating systems and how best to place and distribute the anodes there may also be benefit to consider the use of impressed current anode systems that could be designed with sufficient driving potential to ensure polarization of the monopiles at greater distances from the transition piece where the anodes are mounted credit authorship contribution statement caglar erdogan writing original draft visualization writing reviewing and

20473,with the environmental deterioration and people s increasing attention to its protection it is urgent to save energy and reduce emissions from ships reducing ships drag and using a biomimetic propulsion device as the alternative power to drive them is an effective solution in this paper a ship propulsion unit composed of movable flapping foils is proposed the flapping foils make a reciprocating treading motion in water to generate power to propel and heave ships by heaving ships out of the water the drag of the hull is eliminated which considerably reduces energy consumption by controlling the attack angle of flapping foils in groups a good motion control performance can be obtained compared with hydrofoil ships the propulsion unit can heave the ship out of the water at a

pte effective power of the ship kw 1 introduction generally ships mainly use diesel engines as power plants which consume a large quantity of fossil fuel imo 2019 imo 2014 the exhaust gas emitted by ships increases the risk of human diseases and causes soil acidification aksoyoglu et al 2016 which could seriously damage the ecological environment chen et al 2019 shi et al 2020 researchers are now trying to find the best solution to reduce emissions and save energy in the shipping industry speed reduction is one of the solutions proposed by imo international maritime organization taskar and andersen 2020 investigate fuel savings on speed reduction and prove that reduction brings energy saving to pool the full potential however more vessels will be built to maintain the total transport capacity lindstad et al 2011 and the reduction goes against the demand for global logistics reducing ships drag is an effective way to reduce emissions sindagi et al 2020 presented the current research scenario and showed that drag reduction can effectively reduce energy consumption air lubrication is one of the techniques of drag reduction zhang et al 2018 hao et al 2019 when air is pressed into the ship s bottom the frictional resistance between the hull and the water will decrease matveev et al 2009 kumagai et al 2015 bio inspired drag reduction is another optimum solution to save energy dang et al 2019 drag reduction with micro grooved surfaces inspired by sharkskin is a hot topic fu et al 2017 dengke et al 2018 luo 2015 luo et al 2016 gillcrist et al 1989 made experiments on drag reduction and noise reduction of a marine craft with micro grooved coatings and proved it can lead to energy saving among these approaches however the most efficient and promising should be the technique to heave the hull out of the water faltinsen 2006 compared with traditional displacement ships the hydrofoil ships are characteristic by less resistance since the hull can be elevated above the water by the lift of foils which the wet surface area wave resistance and viscous force will be attenuated dramatically liu et al 2019 najafi and hashemi 2019 but hydrofoil ships need a fast speed to achieve foilborne condition recently researchers have focused their attention on flapping foil which originates from biomimetic propulsion as an alternative way to extract power from flowing fluid karbasian and esfahani 2017 mannam et al 2017 wu et al 2020 reviewed the fluid dynamics of flapping foils and showed that compared with conventional propellers flapping foils can be a promising system with better propulsion efficiency and energy extraction from ship motion outfitting the ship with foils as wave propulsion is called wavefoils which convert the vertical motion in waves into propulsive thrust filippas et al 2018 koutsogiannakis et al 2019 bøckmann and steen 2014 2016 performed experimental investigations on the performance of fixed wavefoils and concluded that they can be acted as a major or auxiliary driving force of the ship xiao and zhu 2014 presented an overview of the investigations on the oscillating foil energy converters and provided a summary of available knowledge and the application of bio inspired foil belibassakis and filippas 2015 investigated the energy extraction by flapping foils and showed that flapping foil can be exploited to extract energy from sea waves for augmenting marine propulsion in rough seas to ascertain the free running response of wave propelled boats bowker et al 2020 presented a numerical model and experimental results from a prototype wave propelled boat with forward and aft flapping foils which provide valuable insight and design tools for the development of wave propelled boats all the studies showed that foils can be a promising device to extract power from the water in nature the maneuvering forces of birds and fishes are generated by the flapping motion of their foil shaped wings fins or tails which produce thrust through direct conversion from fluid flow to propulsive energy junzhi et al 2009 kumar and shin 2019 the propulsion device with flapping foils achieves low energy consumption moreira et al 2020 qing et al 2014 rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 boudreau et al 2020 compared with conventional rotary turbines the flapping foils offer obvious advantages in efficiency economy and energy saving young et al 2014 nowadays flapping foils are mainly used as power units for underwater vehicles scaradozzi et al 2017 and thruster to augment ship propulsion in waves filippas and belibassakis 2014 filippas et al 2020 bøckmann and steen 2016 in this paper the flapping foils are used as the main power of the ship and the hull is heaved out of the water by the water treading of flapping foils to reduce the drag both the lift and the drag of the flapping foils are utilized as the propelling force and lift for the ship which hydrofoil ships can t the layout of this paper is as follows section 2 presents a brief introduction and section 3 carries out the modeling in section 4 the ship s motion control is investigated and then drag reduction compared with displacement ship is presented in section 5 finally the conclusion is presented in the last section 2 introduction of the propulsion unit this propulsion unit is inspired by the tail of a dolphin which enables the dolphin to swim quickly and to jump out of the water in this paper 12 flapping foils are used to make a motion similar to the tail of the dolphin to realize the actuating and lifting of the ship 2 1 the propulsion unit fig 1 is a prototype of the propulsion unit which is mainly composed of flywheel 1 the crankshaft 2 the connecting rod 3 the thrust rod 4 and the flapping foil 5 the flywheel can be driven by a motor the connecting rod connects the crankshaft and the thrust rod and the connecting rod converts the torque from the crankshaft into the force to pull or push the thrust rod up and down the lower end of each thrust rod connects two flapping foils and the attack angle of each flapping foil can be adjusted by the control system separately the size of the attack angle is determined by the desired lift and propulsion 2 2 ships with the propulsion unit fig 2 shows a ship with the proposed propulsion unit 12 flapping foils are arranged on the ship s bottom by thrust rods the flapping foils perform the reciprocating motion of water treading in sequence the attack angle of flapping foils is adjusted by the control system when the flapping foil moves up and down in the water the system controls the sway and roll of the ship by adjusting the attack angle difference between the left side and the right side flapping foils the ship s pitch by adjusting the attack angle difference between the fore and aft flapping foils the heave and surge motion by adjusting the attack angle of all flapping foils 2 3 the layout of roller fig 3 shows the installation of the rollers and in subplot a the upper and lower rollers are installed between the hull and the thrust rod as shown in subplot b the rollers are mounted around the surface of the thrust rod for better force transmission the thrust rod transfers the force produced by the flapping foils to the hull via the rollers and the rollers reduce the friction of the thrust rod 2 4 working stroke of the flapping foil as shown in fig 4 the motion of flapping foil consists of an upstroke and a downstroke in the downstroke the flapping foil can produce lift and propelling force for the ship while in the upstroke the flapping foil can only generate propelling force but not lift the attack angle of the flapping foil in the downstroke should be large enough to produce sufficient lift to heave the ship in the upstroke the attack angle of flapping foil is reduced or may be changed to zero depending on the desired ship speed 2 5 working mechanism and moving speed of flapping foils in fig 5 a and b the flywheel was driven by the driver and rotates with angular velocity ω r and l are the length of the crank arm and the length of connecting rod f z and f x are the heave force and propelling force generated on the flapping foil the attack angle α in subplot a is larger than that in subplot b because increasing the attack angle in the downstroke can produce greater heave force for the ship v is the incoming flow velocity of the flapping foils v f and u are the vertical and horizontal components of v v f and u are caused by the movement of the flapping foils and the ship as shown in fig 5c

was eliminated which endows the ship with a good performance of energy saving the sway equation shows that the ship is able to move laterally by adjusting the heel angle ϕ which the traditional underactuated ships can not for the heave motion equation the flapping foils have a large action area and large drag in the vertical direction which makes the heave motion of the ship stable the traditional displacement ship has a roll restoring moment and the lifting of the hull has a destabilizing effect on the roll restoring moment of the ship however after the hull is lifted out the ship is no longer affected by the disturbance of the waves in the rolling motion equation the flapping foils have roll damping and able to provide an active anti rolling moment in the pitch motion equation flapping foils have pitch damping and able to provide anti pitch control moment from the yaw motion equation the yaw motion was controlled by adjusting the difference of propelling force generated between the port side and starboard of the ship and the steering gear also makes the ship have a steering ability after the above analysis the state space representation 32 of the ship with flapping

p q r t is the state variable matrix and y is the output the stability of the system can be checked by computing the eigenvalues of matrix a a necessary condition for stability is that the eigenvalues of a lie in the left half plane fossen 2011 4 the ship s motion control the force produced by the flapping foils can be controlled by its attack angle as shown in fig 11 the 12 flapping foils are divided into 4 groups i ii iii iv and the attack angle for the four groups are α i α ii α iii and α iv the motion sway roll pitch and yaw of the ship is controlled by adjusting the difference of the attack angle between different groups the flapping foils move up and down in the water with a changing speed to obtain a stable heave force the attack angle of the flapping foils needs to be adjusted according to the incoming flow velocity vector of the flapping foils fig 12 shows the changing attack angle of flapping foils in which v f and u are the speed of the flapping foil and the ship speed respectively as shown in fig 12 when the ship speed u is not zero the attack angle of the flapping foil needs to be corrected by arctan u v f 4 1 the ship s motion control in equation 32 the input and output are u ω α i α ii α iii α iv δ t and ν u v w p q r t here the motion of the ship and its attitude were controlled by adjusting the input variables of the system in equation 32 fig 13 is the block diagram of dynamic control in fig 13 the output is fed back to the summing point where it is compared with the reference input the error signal is used as the control input for the corresponding control blocks in the control system and the control blocks send commands to the actuators of the control system the control blocks include surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw control block and the actuators include flywheel driver attack angle actuator i ii iii iv and the steering gear the input matrix and the output matrix of the whole system are u ref v ref z ref ϕ ref ө ref ψ ref t and u v z ϕ θ ψ t and the pid controller is applied to the 6 motion control blocks fig 14 is the block diagram of the anti rolling control although the ship lost its roll restoring moment after being lifted there is damping on the rolling of the ship caused by the drag of flapping foils and the flapping foils are able to generate active anti rolling torque the rolling motion of the ship can be controlled by adjusting the attack angle difference between the flapping foils of the left side groups i iii and the right side groups ii iv f zi αi is the function to calculate heave force which is defined by equation 17 x zlf and x zrf are the moment arm of anti rolling k f d ϕ dt is obtained from equation 28 d 2 u dt 2 means take the second derivative of the input signal ϕ ref and ϕ are the reference input and the actual heeling angle of the ship same as the rolling control the motion of the ship in surge sway heave pitch and yaw also are controlled by adjusting the attack angle of the flapping foils and the attack angle of the rudder by controlling the difference of attack angle among groups i iii and ii iv the ship s sway and yaw motion can be controlled and by controlling the difference of attack angle among groups i ii and iii iv the ship s pitch motion can be controlled by controlling the attack angle of all flapping foil groups i ii iii iv the ship s surge and heave motion can be controlled 4 2 surge motion the ship motion equation 31 is used to simulate the motion control of the ship the target ship refers to the main dimensions of free surface piercing hydrofoil ship of the monohull type van walree 1999 the parameters are shown in table 2 when flapping foil moves to the top and bottom point the propelling force generated by flapping foil is zero so the propelling force generated by one flapping foil is sinusoidal impulse the total propelling force for the ship is the superposition of propelling forces generated by all the flapping foils therefore by reasonably setting the angle between the crank arms of all flapping foils the fluctuation of the total propelling force can be reduced as shown in fig 15 the red and the blue curve are the propelling force generated by two rows of the flapping foils with a 180 angle difference between their crank arms and the green curve is the total propelling force obtained by the ship so it s better to divide 360 equally by all crank angles fig 16 shows the surge motion of the ship subplot a b and c are the longitudinal displacement velocity and acceleration of the ship respectively since the total propelling force of the ship is composed of pulse propelling forces from the flapping foils the ship speed in subplot b shows fluctuations while subplot c shows that the acceleration of the ship fluctuates 4 3 the heave motion the actual heave height of the ship is compared with the reference value to form a feedback control and the roll motion was controlled by adjusting the difference of attack angle between the flapping foils of the left side groups and the right side groups in fig 17 subplot a and b are the heave motion of the ship without and with feedback control respectively with the feedback control the heave motion of the ship stabilizes gradually after 5 s of fluctuation while the heave motion of the ship without feedback control in subplot a continuously fluctuates 4 4 the rolling motion the actual heeling angle is fed back to the controller to form the feedback control without the feedback control of the rolling motion the ship is unstable and it will capsize once it is disturbed in fig 18 subplot a shows the disturbance encountered by the ship the subplot b and c are the ship motion without and with feedback control respectively in subplot b the ship s heeling angle gradually increases after the disturbance and in subplot c the ship stabilizes after the disturbance 4 5 coupled motion the control of the ship s rolling motion heave motion and surge motion all require adjusting the attack angle so there is a coupled motion in fig 19 a rolling disturbance is applied to the ship to check the influence of the rolling motion control on the ship s heave and surge motion subplot a shows that the ship is subjected to a disturbance of 3000n during the 2 3 s the subplots b c and d show the ship s rolling acceleration rolling velocity and rolling angle under the disturbance subplot e and f show the influence of disturbance on the heave height and longitudinal speed it can be seen from subplot e and f that when the attack angle of the flapping foils is adjusted to control the rolling motion the ship s heave and surge motion will also be affected therefore since the motion of each ship s degree of freedom needs to be controlled by the attack angle of the flapping foils there is a coupling among the motion of each degree of freedom that should be considered 5 comparison 5 1 energy saving compared with displacement ship the required effective power for the ship with flapping foil can be calculated by equation 33 33 p f e r t u p h e a v e r f r r x f d u p h e a v e where u is the ship speed r t r f and r r are the total resistance friction resistance and residual resistance of the hull respectively x f is the drag of flapping foils and d is the drag of thrust rods p heave represents the power to heave the ship when the ship achieves foilborne condition the drag produced by the hull is eliminated and the required effective power for the ship can be obtained as 34 34 p f e x f d u p h e a v e the ship is heaved by 12 flapping foils and the instantaneous power generated by one flapping foil to heave the ship can be obtained as 35 35 p h f f z v f ρ v 2 a h sin 2 α v f here v f and f z are the vertical velocity of flapping foil and the heave force generated by the flapping foil f z is defined by equation 17 then the required power for heaving the ship out of the water by flapping foils can be obtained as equation 36 36 p h e a v e i 1 12 p f h i by substituting equations 19 26 and 36 into 34 we get the required effective power for the ship with proposed flapping foils to sail at foilborne condition 37 p f e x f u p h e a

c f c r where c f c r and s are the coefficient of friction coefficient of residual resistance and the wetted surface area respectively then we obtain equation 39 which p fe and p te are the effective power for the ship with the proposed propulsion unit and the traditional displacement ship respectively 39 p f e i 1 12 p f h i 6 ρ s c c d u 3 cos α 6 ρ s c c d v f 2 cos α d u p t e 1 2 ρ u 3 s c f

ships can be expressed as au 3 and the effective power of a ship actuated by the proposed propulsion unit can be expressed as k bu 3 cu where k represents the power required to heave the hull out of the water and bu 3 cu is the power consumption caused by the resistance of the flapping foils and thrust rods in the water a b c and k can be obtained as 40 40 a 1 2 ρ s c f c r b 6 ρ s c c d cos α c

ship with the proposed propulsion unit is less than that of the traditional displacement ship and the power difference increases as the speed increases m is a critical point for the ship actuated by flapping foils to save energy and the ship s performance of energy saving can be improved by reducing the value of u 1 the m point is movable by reducing the value of k which can be led by the lightweight design of the ship and the shape optimization of the flapping foil once the hull is lifted out of the water the effective power of the ship actuated by the flapping foil increases with the speed slower than that of the traditional displacement ship if the ship speed is lower than u 1 the ship with flapping foils is no longer energy saving therefore hullborne or semi foilborn should be adopted when the ship speed is lower than u 1 and foilborne condition should be achieved when the speed is higher than u 1 to achieve maximum energy saving 5 2 compared with hydrofoil ships fig 21 shows the hydrodynamics between the flapping foil of the proposed propulsion unit and the foil of the hydrofoil ship the lift and drag of flapping foils were used to propel and heave the ship where the drag of the hydrofoil can t be utilized furthermore hydrofoil ships require high speed to achieve foilborne condition in contrast ships equipped with the proposed propulsion unit can achieve it at

experiments on drag reduction and noise reduction of a marine craft with micro grooved coatings and proved it can lead to energy saving among these approaches however the most efficient and promising should be the technique to heave the hull out of the water faltinsen 2006 compared with traditional displacement ships the hydrofoil ships are characteristic by less resistance since the hull can be elevated above the water by the lift of foils which the wet surface area wave resistance and viscous force will be attenuated dramatically liu et al 2019 najafi and hashemi 2019 but hydrofoil ships need a fast speed to achieve foilborne condition recently researchers have focused their attention on flapping foil which originates from biomimetic propulsion as an alternative way to extract power from flowing fluid karbasian and esfahani 2017 mannam et al 2017 wu et al 2020 reviewed the fluid dynamics of flapping foils and showed that compared with conventional propellers flapping foils can be a promising system with better propulsion efficiency and energy extraction from ship motion outfitting the ship with foils as wave propulsion is called wavefoils which convert the vertical motion in waves into propulsive thrust filippas et al 2018 koutsogiannakis et al 2019 bøckmann and steen 2014 2016 performed experimental investigations on the performance of fixed wavefoils and concluded that they can be acted as a major or auxiliary driving force of the ship xiao and zhu 2014 presented an overview of the investigations on the oscillating foil energy converters and provided a summary of available knowledge and the application of bio inspired foil belibassakis and filippas 2015 investigated the energy extraction by flapping foils and showed that flapping foil can be exploited to

experimental results from a prototype wave propelled boat with forward and aft flapping foils which provide valuable insight and design tools for the development of wave propelled boats all the studies showed that foils can be a promising device to extract power from the water in nature the maneuvering forces of birds and fishes are generated by the flapping motion of their foil shaped wings fins or tails which produce thrust through direct conversion from fluid flow to propulsive energy junzhi et al 2009 kumar and shin 2019 the propulsion device with flapping foils achieves low energy

filippas and belibassakis 2014 filippas et al 2020 bøckmann and steen 2016 in this paper the flapping foils are used as the main power of the ship and the hull is heaved out of the water by the water treading of flapping foils to reduce the drag both the lift and the drag of the flapping foils are utilized as the propelling force and lift for the ship which hydrofoil ships can t the layout of this paper is as follows section 2 presents a brief introduction and section 3 carries out the modeling in section 4 the ship s motion control is investigated and then drag reduction compared with displacement ship is presented in section 5 finally the conclusion is presented in the last section 2 introduction of the propulsion unit this propulsion unit is inspired by the tail of a dolphin which enables the dolphin to swim quickly and to jump out of the water in this paper 12 flapping foils are used to make a motion similar to the tail of the dolphin to realize the actuating and lifting of the ship 2 1 the propulsion unit fig 1 is a prototype of the propulsion unit which is mainly composed of flywheel 1 the crankshaft 2 the connecting rod 3 the thrust rod 4 and the flapping foil 5 the flywheel can be driven by a motor the connecting rod connects the crankshaft and the thrust rod and the connecting rod converts the torque from the crankshaft into the force to pull or push the thrust rod up and down the lower end of each thrust rod connects two flapping foils and the attack angle of each flapping foil can be adjusted by the control system separately the size of the attack angle is determined by the desired lift and propulsion 2 2 ships with the propulsion unit fig 2 shows a ship with the proposed propulsion unit 12 flapping foils are arranged on the ship s bottom by thrust rods the flapping foils perform the reciprocating motion of water treading in sequence the attack angle of flapping foils is adjusted by the control system when the flapping foil moves up and down in the water the system controls the sway and roll of the ship by adjusting the attack angle difference between the left side and the right side flapping foils the ship s pitch by adjusting the attack angle difference between the fore and aft flapping foils the heave and surge motion by adjusting the attack angle of all flapping foils 2 3 the layout of roller fig 3 shows the installation of the rollers and in subplot a the upper and lower rollers are installed between the hull and the thrust rod as shown in subplot b the rollers are mounted around the surface of the thrust rod for better force transmission the thrust rod transfers the force produced by the flapping foils to the hull via the rollers and the rollers reduce the friction of the thrust rod 2 4 working stroke of the flapping foil as shown in fig 4 the motion of flapping foil consists of an upstroke and a downstroke in the downstroke the flapping foil can produce lift and propelling force for the ship while in the upstroke the flapping foil can only generate propelling force but not lift the attack angle of the flapping foil in the downstroke should be large enough to produce sufficient lift to heave the ship in the upstroke the attack angle of flapping foil is reduced or may be changed to zero depending on the desired ship speed 2 5 working mechanism and moving speed of flapping foils in fig 5 a and b the flywheel was driven by the driver and rotates with angular velocity ω r and l are the length of the crank arm and the length of connecting rod f z and f x are the heave force and propelling force generated on the flapping foil the attack angle α in subplot a is larger than that in subplot b because increasing the attack angle in the downstroke can produce greater heave force for the ship v is the incoming flow velocity of the flapping foils v f and u are the vertical and horizontal components of v v f and u are caused by the movement of the flapping foils and the ship as shown in fig 5c

divided into 4 groups i ii iii iv and the attack angle for the four groups are α i α ii α iii and α iv the motion sway roll pitch and yaw of the ship is controlled by adjusting the difference of the attack angle between different groups the flapping foils move up and down in the water with a changing speed to obtain a stable heave force the attack angle of the flapping foils needs to be adjusted according to the incoming flow velocity vector of the flapping foils fig 12 shows the changing attack angle of flapping foils in which v f and u are the speed of the flapping foil and the ship speed respectively as shown in fig 12 when the ship speed u is not zero the attack angle of the flapping foil needs to be corrected by arctan u v f 4 1 the ship s motion control in equation 32 the input and output are u ω α i α ii α iii α iv δ t and ν u v w p q r t here the motion of the ship and its attitude were controlled by adjusting the input variables of the system in equation 32 fig 13 is the block diagram of dynamic control in fig 13 the output is fed back to the summing point where it is compared with the reference input the error signal is used as the control input for the corresponding control blocks in the control system and the control blocks send commands to the actuators of the control system the control blocks include surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw control block and the actuators include flywheel driver attack angle actuator i ii iii iv and the steering gear the input matrix and the output matrix of the whole system are u ref v ref z ref ϕ ref ө ref ψ ref t and u v z ϕ θ ψ t and the pid controller is applied to the 6 motion control blocks fig 14 is the block diagram of the anti rolling control although the ship lost its roll restoring moment after being lifted there is damping on the rolling of the ship caused by the drag of flapping foils and the flapping foils are able to generate active anti rolling torque the rolling motion of the ship can be controlled by adjusting the attack angle difference between the flapping foils of the left side groups i iii and the right side groups ii iv f zi αi is the function to calculate heave force which is defined by equation 17 x zlf and x zrf are the moment arm of anti rolling k f d ϕ dt is obtained from equation 28 d 2 u dt 2 means take the second derivative of the input signal ϕ ref and ϕ are the reference input and the actual heeling angle of the ship same as the rolling control the motion of the ship in surge sway heave pitch and yaw also are controlled by adjusting the attack angle of the flapping foils and the attack angle of the rudder by controlling the difference of attack angle among groups i iii and ii iv the ship s sway and yaw motion can be controlled and by controlling the difference of attack angle among groups i ii and iii iv the ship s pitch motion can be controlled by controlling the attack angle of all flapping foil groups i ii iii iv the ship s surge and heave motion can be controlled 4 2 surge motion the ship motion equation 31 is used to simulate the motion control of the ship the target ship refers to the main dimensions of free surface piercing hydrofoil ship of the monohull type van walree 1999 the parameters are shown in table 2 when flapping foil moves to the top and bottom point the propelling force generated by flapping foil is zero so the propelling force generated by one flapping foil is sinusoidal impulse the total propelling force for the ship is the superposition of propelling forces generated by all the flapping foils therefore by reasonably setting the angle between the crank arms of all flapping foils the fluctuation of the total propelling force can be reduced as shown in fig 15 the red and the blue curve are the propelling force generated by two rows of the flapping foils with a 180 angle difference between their crank arms and the green curve is the total propelling force obtained by the ship so it s better to divide 360 equally by all crank angles fig 16 shows the surge motion of the ship subplot a b and c are the longitudinal displacement velocity and acceleration of the ship respectively since the total propelling force of the ship is composed of pulse propelling forces from the flapping foils the ship speed in subplot b shows fluctuations while subplot c shows that the acceleration of the ship fluctuates 4 3 the heave motion the actual heave height of the ship is compared with the reference value to form a feedback control and the roll motion was controlled by adjusting the difference of attack angle between the flapping foils of the left side groups and the right side groups in fig 17 subplot a and b are the heave motion of the ship without and with feedback control respectively with the feedback control the heave motion of the ship stabilizes gradually after 5 s of fluctuation while the heave motion of the ship without feedback control in subplot a continuously fluctuates 4 4 the rolling motion the actual heeling angle is fed back to the controller to form the feedback control without the feedback control of the rolling motion the ship is unstable and it will capsize once it is disturbed in fig 18 subplot a shows the disturbance encountered by the ship the subplot b and c are the ship motion without and with feedback control respectively in subplot b the ship s heeling angle gradually increases after the disturbance and in subplot c the ship stabilizes after the disturbance 4 5 coupled motion the control of the ship s rolling motion heave motion and surge motion all require adjusting the attack angle so there is a coupled motion in fig 19 a rolling disturbance is applied to the ship to check the influence of the rolling motion control on the ship s heave and surge motion subplot a shows that the ship is subjected to a disturbance of 3000n during the 2 3 s the subplots b c and d show the ship s rolling acceleration rolling velocity and rolling angle under the disturbance subplot e and f show the influence of disturbance on the heave height and longitudinal speed it can be seen from subplot e and f that when the attack angle of the flapping foils is adjusted to control the rolling motion the ship s heave and surge motion will also be affected therefore since the motion of each ship s degree of freedom needs to be controlled by the attack angle of the flapping foils there is a coupling among the motion of each degree of freedom that should be considered 5 comparison 5 1 energy saving compared with displacement ship the required effective power for the ship with flapping foil can be calculated by equation 33 33 p f e r t u p h e a v e r f r r x f d u p h e a v e where u is the ship speed r t r f and r r are the total resistance friction resistance and residual resistance of the hull respectively x f is the drag of flapping foils and d is the drag of thrust rods p heave represents the power to heave the ship when the ship achieves foilborne condition the drag produced by the hull is eliminated and the required effective power for the ship can be obtained as 34 34 p f e x f d u p h e a v e the ship is heaved by 12 flapping foils and the instantaneous power generated by one flapping foil to heave the ship can be obtained as 35 35 p h f f z v f ρ v 2 a h sin 2 α v f here v f and f z are the vertical velocity of flapping foil and the heave force generated by the flapping foil f z is defined by equation 17 then the required power for heaving the ship out of the water by flapping foils can be obtained as equation 36 36 p h e a v e i 1 12 p f h i by substituting equations 19 26 and 36 into 34 we get the required effective power for the ship with proposed flapping foils to sail at foilborne condition 37 p f e x f u p h e a v e 6 ρ s c c d v f 2 u 2 cos α d u i 1 12 p f h i for the traditional displacement ship the required effective power for the ship can be calculated by equation 38 38 p t e r t u r f r r u 1 2 ρ u 3 s c f c r where c f c r and s are the coefficient of friction coefficient of residual resistance and the wetted surface area respectively then we obtain equation 39 which p fe and p te are the effective power for the ship with the proposed propulsion unit and the traditional displacement ship respectively 39 p f e i 1 12 p f h i 6 ρ s c c d u 3 cos α 6 ρ s c c d v f 2 cos α d u p t e 1 2 ρ u 3 s c f c r fig 20 shows the curve of the effective power of the ship with the proposed propulsion unit and the traditional displacement ship in equation 39 the effective power of traditional displacement ships can be expressed as au 3 and the effective power of a ship actuated by the proposed propulsion unit can be expressed as k bu 3 cu where k represents the power required to heave the hull out of the water and bu 3 cu is the power consumption caused by the resistance of the flapping foils and thrust rods in the water a b c and k can be obtained as 40 40 a 1 2 ρ s c f c r b 6 ρ s c c d cos α c 6 ρ s c c d v f 2 cos α d k i 1 12 p f h i in fig 20 m is the intersection of the two curves and its corresponding ship speed is u 1 when ship speed exceeds u 1 the effective power consumed by the ship with the proposed propulsion unit is less than that of the traditional displacement ship and the power difference increases as the speed increases m is a critical point for the ship actuated by flapping foils to save energy and the ship s performance of energy saving can be improved by reducing the value of u 1 the m point is movable by reducing the value of k which can be led by the lightweight design of the ship and the shape optimization of the flapping foil once the hull is lifted out of the water the effective power of the ship actuated by the flapping foil increases with the speed slower than that of the traditional displacement ship if the ship speed is lower than u 1 the ship with flapping foils is no longer energy saving therefore hullborne or semi foilborn should be adopted when the ship speed is lower than u 1 and foilborne condition should be achieved when the speed is higher than u 1 to achieve maximum energy saving 5 2 compared with hydrofoil ships fig 21 shows the hydrodynamics between the flapping foil of the proposed propulsion unit and the foil of the hydrofoil ship the lift and drag of flapping foils were used to propel and heave the ship where the drag of the hydrofoil can t be utilized furthermore hydrofoil ships require high speed to achieve foilborne condition in contrast ships equipped with the proposed propulsion unit can achieve it at low speed 6 conclusion the main contribution in this paper is summarized in three parts firstly a biomimetic propulsion unit composed by movable flapping foils is proposed the flapping foils perform reciprocating treading motion in the water and both the lift and drag component of resultant force generated by the foils are utilized to propel and heave the ship secondly the motion equation of the ship with the biomimetic propulsion unit is derived thirdly the control method of the ship s motion is analyzed and the superiority of the proposed propulsion unit is analyzed 1 after the hull is heaved out of the water with the flapping foil the friction resistance and the residuary resistance of the hull are eliminated which realizes drag reduction 2 both the lift and drag component of resultant force generated by flapping foils was utilized to propel and heave the ship while the hydrofoil ships can t utilize the drag component of hydrofoil 3 compared with traditional underactuated ships the ship can be actuated in the motion of 6 freedom of degree by the proposed propulsion unit and it can realize the attitude control of the ship credit authorship contribution statement yiping

20474,lifting line analyses of propellers and horizontal axis turbines require the axial and circumferential velocities induced by the helicoidal vorticity shed from the blades these velocities can be found from the analytic solution for a helical vortex of constant radius and pitch due to kawada and hardin this solution however involves infinite series of products of bessel functions and their derivatives whose evaluation is computationally intensive partly because the number of terms required for a specified accuracy increases without bound as the vortex is approached we compare three closed form approximations to the kawada hardin equations the first due to kawada and rediscovered by lerbs involves asymptotic expansions for large pitch whereas the second is a more general approximation derived by wrench and subsequently by okulov the last uses additional terms found by okulov the three have comparable evaluation times but the third is more accurate the accuracy of the approximations is assessed for n equispaced and identical helical vortices where n is the number of blades we provide for the first time approximate remainders for the kawada hardin equations which allow an assessment of the number of terms in the series required to achieve a specified accuracy as a test case for assessing the calculations of induced velocity we consider the design of a hydrokinetic turbine blade to avoid cavitation at two different operating conditions with different vortex pitch the use of the approximated induced velocities is compared to prandtl s well known tip loss factor near the hub and tip the blade shape is altered considerably by the induced velocities and the method used to calculate them keywords horizontal axis turbine propeller lifting line blade element analysis induced velocities 1 introduction the simplest computational model for propellers and horizontal axis turbines treats the blades as lifting lines lls axial and circumferential velocities are induced along them by the trailing vorticity as in the well known ll theory of aircraft wings eg prandtl 1923 these velocities contribute to the total velocity which determines the lift and drag on the blade elements comprising the blades and lls blade element modelling is described for propellers by kerwin and hadler 2010 and epps 2017 for hydrokinetic turbines by abutunis et al 2019 and by hansen 2015 for wind turbines it is further assumed that the blades are geometrically identical and equispaced this rarely stated assumption is important for the analysis to follow typically the number of blade elements n b e is between 20 and 30 and approximately n b e 2 determinations of the induced velocities are required for every iteration of these essentially iterative methods the need for an accurate and fast determination of the induced velocities is clear the only simplification available at this point is the close relationship between the two velocity components which are normally determined in combination in a blade element formulation trailing line vortices are shed from the junctions of contiguous elements because they leave the blades with a circumferential as well as an axial velocity the vortices must be helical they either expand turbines or contract propellers as they move downstream and their pitch may change no general equation is available for the velocities induced by helical vortices of varying geometry so it is necessary either to use the equations described below for helical vortices of constant radius and pitch or use a free wake method to determine the velocities numerically eg chreim et al 2018 free wake modelling has its own pitfalls for example wood 2018 showed that the commonly used straight segment model of free wake vortices can lead to large errors in the induced velocities if the junctions of contiguous segments are aligned with the point at which the velocity is required however the free wake is modelled the equations we investigate here can be used as test cases as was done by chreim et al 2018 for this purpose accuracy is more important than evaluation time blade element methods match the change in axial and angular momentum in the annular streamtube containing the elements to their lift and drag by the ll approximation these forces are determined by the velocities at the element whereas the momentum change depends on the streamtune averaged velocities the ratio of the streamtube average induced velocities to those at the blades is called the tip loss factor and is usually approximated by prandtl s f p e g hansen 2015 f p is the same for both velocity components and is zero at the blade tips implying no tip loading it is derived in glauert 1935 by approximating the wake as a sequence of two dimensional equispaced vortex sheets and so is inherently more limited than assuming the wake comprises helical vortices of constant pitch and radius the direct calculation of induced velocities from these helical vortices is an alternative to using f p and allows for situations where f p is not accurate or applicable these include 1 turbines at low tip speed ratio λ the ratio of the circumferential velocity of the blade tips to the wind or water speed wood et al 2016 2 rotors where the vortex pitch varies significantly across the rotor causing the circumferential induced velocity to differ from the axial velocity wood et al 2016 3 a shrouded propeller or turbine with finite loading at the tips vaz et al 2020 4 blades that are swept in the plane of rotation or curved in the axial direction e g li et al 2020 which allow the bound vorticity to influence the velocities at the blades 5 unequally loaded blades as a result of differences in blade shape individual pitch action yaw or wind shear whatever the cause the bound vorticity also influences the velocities at the blades wood 2016 the exact equations for the velocities induced by helical vortices of constant pitch and radius contain infinite series of products of modified bessel functions whose evaluation can be computationally demanding the objective of this paper is to develop and evaluate alternative and supplementary methods for the accurate and fast computation of the induced velocities specifically the aims are to assess the accuracy of three different closed form approximations for the induced velocities the first is given by kawada 1939 and was rediscovered by lerbs 1952 the second due to wrench 1957 will be shown to be equivalent to that of okulov 2004 as used by wood et al 2016 thirdly we combine the wrench and okulov approximations with the additional terms given in okulov and sørensen 2020 all three approximations are significantly faster to evaluate than the exact equations but have never been assessed comparatively use these approximations to develop analytic remainder terms to allow evaluation of the exact series to a finite number of terms with arbitrary accuracy to our knowledge no previous derivation of remainders or estimation of the required number of terms has been made the assessment is done for equispaced helical vortices of varying number and pitch explore the singular behaviour as the point at which the velocities are required approaches the vortex usually by increasing n b e in this case the exact solution becomes particularly challenging as the number of terms required for a given accuracy increases without limit okulov and sørensen 2020 unify the treatment of induced velocities across the related disciplines of propeller and turbine research wind turbine researchers have paid little or no attention to the work of kawada and wrench propeller researchers often cite kawada 1936 but the important work of kawada 1939 has been universally ignored undertake a blade element design of a hydrokinetic turbine hkt to avoid cavitation as a test case requiring accurate estimates of the induced velocities in section 2 we develop the three approximations and remainders and comment on their history section 3 has two parts the first describes and discusses the numerical experiments to assess the accuracy of the approximations and remainders the second develops a blade element analysis of a hkt to demonstrate the value of the direct calculation of induced velocities and to study the effects of the accuracy of their determination the final section contains the conclusions 2 the equations for the induced velocities 2 1 the exact equations we use cylindrical polar co ordinates x r θ where x is in the axial or streamwise direction r is the radius and θ is the circumferential angle the respective velocity components are u v w a semi infinite single n 1 helical vortex of constant pitch p defined by d x d θ p for any point on the vortex begins at 0 t 0 the vortex radius remains t u at any point 0 r θ along the plane defined by the lls is given by 1 u γ 4 π p γ t 2 π p 2 s 1 u γ t 2 π p 2 s 1 for r t and γ t 2 π p 2 s 3 for r t where 2 s 1 m 1 m k m m t p i m m r p cos m θ and 3 s 3 m 1 m i m m t p k m m r p cos m θ γ is the vortex strength and u is the average axial velocity within the helicoid i m and k m are modified bessel functions in standard notation m denotes the order and the prime a derivative with respect to the argument note that the determination of u and w at x 0 from a vortex also starting at x 0 implies that the blades are straight and lie along the r axis this restriction will be assumed to apply throughout the following analysis kawada 1936 originally derived the equations for u and w but this major contribution was long forgotten at least by the wind turbine community the full equations for u v and w are due to hardin 1982 who was unaware of kawada s contribution the notations s 1 and s 3 are taken from hardin 1982 the similar series s 2 was used to find the radial velocity which we do not consider some of the history of these equations is related by fukumuto et al 2015 and 2017 who proposed calling them the kawada hardin kh equations helical symmetry requires p u w r and so the calculation of w say is straightforward once u has been found for the remainder of this paper therefore we consider only u in eq 1 the calculation of u poses no computational challenges so we concentrate on methods to evaluate s 1 and s 3 to determine u u u as pointed out by epps 2017 eqs 2 and 3 become singular as δ r r t 0 at any p the velocity field has a component proportional to 1 δ r due to the swirl associated with the circulation γ of the proximate vortex thus the singularity must be independent of n there is a further finite binormal component due to the vortex curvature which also depends on p eg section 7 1 of batchelor 1967 the singularity influences u and w for small δ r at all values of p when summed over n identical and equispaced blades s 1 and s 3 reduce to equation 13 of kawada 1939 4 s 1 n m 1 m n k m n m n t p i m n m n r p and 5 s 3 n m 1 m n i m n m n t p k m n m n r p along the ll as a consequence of the 2 π n periodicity of the flow which occurs only for equispaced identical blades this simplification called kawada cancellation by fukumuto et al 2015 is the mechanism by which the flow becomes circumferentially uniform as n increases 1 1 kawada assumed light loading in determining p see the equation on his page 5 the analysis is not restricted by this assumption and we discuss appropriate values of p in section 3 of the cases listed in the introduction where prandtl s f p cannot be used cancellation applies to all but the last 5 at first sight cancellation makes the direct solution of 4 and 5 attractive because a significant fraction n 1 n of the terms drop out as we shall show however the series can still be slow to converge and normally i m n m n t p and k m n m n t p must be evaluated as i m n 1 m n t p i m n 1 m n t p 2 and k m n 1 m n t p k m n 1 m n t p 2 respectively in practice the sums are evaluated to a finite m but it is not known what value of m will give a required precision in the next three subsections we describe the three approximations to s 1 and s 3 that we are aware of and use them to devise remainder terms to add to 4 and 5 when summed from m 1 to m after determining m to achieve a specified accuracy in deriving the special case of eqs 4 and 5 from 2 and 3 respectively we made no change to the notation s 1 and s 3 because we modify the notation for other purposes below from here on any reference to s 1 is to the definition in 4 and similarly for s 3 and 5 2 2 kawada s asymptotic equations using the large order m n expansion of i m n and k m n given for example by equations 9 7 7 9 7 10 of abramowitz and stegun 1964 and appendix b of okulov 2004 kawada 1939 determined the asymptotic expressions for s 1 and s 3 his equation 20 can be rewritten as 6 s 1 k a n u k 1 u k b k log 1 u k 1 u k for r t and 7 s 3 k a n u k 1 b k log 1 1 u k 1 for r t in 6 and 8 8 a p 2 t c t c r where c t 1 t p 2 and c r 1 r p 2 u k c r 1 c t 1 c r 1 c t 1 n 2 exp c r c t n and b k 1 2 t p 1 1 t p 2 3 2 these equations were also derived by lerbs 1952 who was apparently unaware of kawada s 1939 work mathematica was used to find the dominant term in 7 for points near the vortex i e as δ r r t 0 the result is 9 s 1 k s 3 k p 2 c t δ r as δ r 0 which is independent of n and valid for all values of p for example as p 0 u asymptotically approaches the swirl velocity u γ 2 π δ r and as p u 0 equation 19 of kawada 1939 gives the summands used to obtain 6 and 7 by summing over m 1 an alternative evaluation of the series in 4 and 5 is to sum the terms explicitly for m 1 m and estimate the remaining terms for m 1 using the asymptotic results we note that the convergence of 4 and 5 is always monotonic thus for example 10 s 1 m 1 m s 1 m n r 1 m n where s 1 m is the summand in eq 4 and r m n is the analytic remainder which will always have the same sign as the sum using mathematica to evaluate kawada s equation 19 over m m 1 gives 11 r 1 k m a n u k 1 u k b k u k m 1 2 f 1 1 m 1 m 2 u k u k m for r t and 12 r 3 k m a n u k 1 b k u k m 1 2 f 1 1 m 1 m 2 1 u k u k m for r t 2 f 1 is the hypergeometric function described in chapter 15 of abramowitz and stegun 1964 and chapter 15 of dlmf 2020 eqs 11 and 12 should be the most accurate remainders for all three approximations for large m 2 f 1 has an asymptotic form leading to more approximate versions of the remainders 13 r 1 k m a n u k 1 u k b k m 1 1 u k 1 u k u k m for r t and 14 r 3 k m a n u k 1 b k m 1 1 1 u k 1 u k m for r t it is also straightforward to evaluate 2 f 1 when m 0 to check the consistency of r 1 k 0 s 1 k and r 3 k 0 s 3 k there is no corresponding check on r 1 k 0 and r 3 k 0 but note that the inconsistency occurs only in the term containing b k 2 3 wrench s asymptotic equations wrench 1957 used the more accurate asymptotic formula of lehmer 1944 for i m n and then found the corresponding expansion for k m n he derived equations that are conveniently reproduced as equation 2 6d of epps 2017 15 s 1 w a n u w 1 u w b log 1 u w 1 u w for r t and 16 s 3 w a n u w 1 b log 1 1 u w 1 for t r in 15 and 16 17 b 1 24 9 t p 2 2 c t 3 3 r p 2 2 c r 3 and u w t c r 1 r c t 1 exp c r c t n for points near the vortex i e as δ r 0 the leading order term is identical to eq 9 wrench 1957 did not provide the series summed to obtain 15 and 16 so we assume that the appropriate reminder terms r 1 w m and r 3 w m would be eqs 11 and 12 with b k and u k replaced by b and u w respectively r 1 w m and r 3 w m are assumed to be given by a similar alteration to eqs 13 and 14 we show below that eqs 11 14 with u w and b are dominated by the first term in the square brackets for the ranges of n r t and p that were investigated this allows a direct estimate of m for a given tolerance ϵ 18 m log ϵ 1 u w a n log u w 1 for r t and 19 m log ϵ u w 1 a n log u w otherwise rather than requiring a root finding algorithm to solve the original implicit equations mathematica s expansion in δ r of the terms involving u w in 18 has the leading term of 20 r p 2 r 2 p 2 p 2 r 2 p 2 r 2 log 2 δ r p 2 r 2 p 2 r 2 p p 2 r 2 p 3 n δ r 1 as δ r 0 showing the unboundedness of m and its dependence on n 2 4 okulov s approximate equations okulov 2004 derived new approximations for the velocities induced by a single helical vortex for the computation of the induced velocities wood et al 2016 applied kawada cancellation to okulov s equations to obtain general forms that have significant similarities with the previous equations 21 s 1 o a n u o 1 u o b log 1 u o 1 u o for r t and 22 s 3 o a n u o 1 b log 1 1 u o 1 for r t the only difference from wrench s equations is in u o given by 23 u o r c t 1 t c r 1 exp c r c t n when the typographical errors in equation 18 of wood et al 2016 are removed it is an easy matter to show that u o from eq 23 is equal to u w from 17 thus okulov s approximations for the induced velocities are equivalent to wrench s when we undertook the analysis described in wood et al 2016 we were aware of wrench 1957 but did not think to apply the results to wind turbine analysis okulov 2004 developed extra terms to add to eqs 21 and 22 to improve their accuracy these are detailed for n 1 in the appendix of okulov and sørensen 2020 where they are called remainder terms which conflicts with the use of the term here we will denote them as additional terms a 1 and a 3 and follow the recommendation of okulov and sørensen 2020 to use only the first term from their equation a6a 24 a 1 n 2 k n n t p i n n r p a u w n b 2 and from a6b 25 a 3 n 2 i n n t p k n n r p a n b 2 u w the first term in 24 and 25 is clearly the first term in 4 and 5 respectively and okulov s approximations can viewed as remainder terms in the present sense for m 1 since we have shown the equivalence of okulov s 21 and 22 and wrench s 15 and 16 we now alter the definition of s 1 o and s 3 o to include a 1 and a 3 added to eqs 21 and 22 respectively in other words we use okulov s approximations in the form s 1 0 a 1 and s 3 0 a 3 3 results 3 1 induced velocities for n equispaced identical vortices for any n the most important physical parameters for the induced velocities are the pitch p and δ r the distance from the vortex to the point at which the velocities are required this is usually the centre of a blade element so the minimum δ r 1 2 n b e when normalized by the blade radius for horizontal axis turbines wood et al 2016 show that p 2 3 λ where p is made non dimensional using the blade tip radius λ is the tip speed ratio defined as the circumferential velocity of the blade tips divided by the wind or water speed most commercial wind turbines operate at λ 7 8 so p 0 1 the hydrokinetic turbine of abutunis et al 2019 had its maximum power coefficient at λ 4 5 corresponding to p 0 15 in their exposition of ll analysis for propellers chreim et al 2018 varied p between 0 17 and 1 7 epps 2017 fig 4a gives 0 16 p 0 24 for his propeller modelling for our example calculations of the induced velocity we use p 1 and 0 1 r 1 and 2 n 8 to study the effects of varying the number of blades see fig 2 in practice there appear to be no problems in determining p for a blade element calculation for example wood et al 2016 took p to be the ratio of blade element torque to thrust whereas epps 2017 assumed the line vortices followed the direction of the total velocity at the blade element the two definitions are equivalent in the absence of drag the latter definition is used below in the example blade element design of a hydrokinetic turbine blade for which p 0 2 we start with general observations about the accuracy of induced velocity calculations and the behaviour as the vortex is approached and then consider the use of remainders to estimate the required value of m for a desired accuracy the different methods of determining m are then examined to maximize the trade off between accuracy and computational time for the rest of this subsection only p is non dimensionalized by r fig 1 shows s 1 for r p 1 and n 2 4 8 evaluated from eq 10 after numerically solving eq 11 to estimate m for an accuracy of 10 6 the smallest δ r 0 01 corresponds to n b e 50 if the blade elements were equally spaced and the hub radius is small in our experience this value of n b e is higher of than most of those used in most blade element calculations table 1 lists the results for m from 11 or 12 s 1 from eq 10 and s 3 evaluated in the same way as s 1 to show the close similarity of their behaviour and the three approximations to these sums the time taken to determine m by matlab s root finder fzero from either 11 or 12 and then s 1 and s 3 for the values of t in table 1 was about 2200 times the time to determine s 1 o and s 3 o for the same values for the values in table 2 the ratios were around 1500 calculating m from equation 13 or 14 which again requires root finding but no special functions reduced these ratios to 200 and 60 respectively the approximate explicit solution for m given by eqs 18 and 19 reduced the ratios to 180 and 40 respectively all three methods for determining m gave the same values when n was reduced to 2 the required m nearly doubled for all entries in the two tables showing that the computational cost of accurate evaluations of the kawada hardin equations increases as n decreases in line with the scaling of 1 n from eq 20 the accuracy of the approximations decreases slightly with decreasing n for example in comparison to the entry in table 1 for t 1 01 changing only n to 2 gave s 1 34 9963 from eq 10 whereas s 1 o 34 9972 without showing the results when n was increased to 8 m decreased in line with the 1 n scaling the 1 δ r scaling is consistent with the decrease in m when δ r increases from 0 01 to 0 02 for both s 1 and s 3 in table 1 and the decrease for s 3 in table 2 the solid line in fig 1 is the asymptotic form of s 1 from eq 9 s 1 becomes independent of n as δ r 0 although not shown s 3 has the same behaviour the value p 1 in fig 1 and table 1 was chosen because it gives the highest error in the approximations of kawada wrench and okulov shown in that order in the last three columns of table 1 there is a uniform increase in accuracy from kawada to wrench to okulov this was found to be true for all tested cases for 0 1 p 1 and 2 n 8 results for s 3 only for p 0 1 are shown in table 2 all three approximations have become more accurate and there is nothing to chose at this level of accuracy between wrench s and okulov s generally a decrease in p makes all calculations of s 1 and s 3 less computationally intensive and increases the accuracy of the kawada approximation which table 1 shows is inaccurate at p 1 this finding agrees with wrench 1957 fig 2 shows the typical behaviour of the remainder terms in particular the remainder always improves the accuracy of the sum and the simple first term in the remainder equation is as accurate as the full equation note that it is the use of the first term only that leads to explicit equations for m 3 2 induced velocities for hydrokinetic turbine design we present the results for a blade element momentum theory bemt analysis of a hkt to investigate the direct calculation of the induced velocities and the effects of their accuracy the blades are assumed to be straight and radial so the induced velocities are due entirely to the trailing vorticity for n b e elements and n equispaced identical blades there are n b e 1 sets of n identical equispaced vortices contributing to the induced velocities at the centre of each element helical symmetry in the form p u w r for each set of n equispaced vortices reduces the computational burden but the total induced u and w may receive contributions from all trailing vortices which destroys the principle of blade element independence this principle is usually invoked in any development of the theory to justify for example the sequential and local solving of the bemt equations element by element blade element independence can be partly restored using the wake model of wood et al 2016 and epps 2017 whereby two vortices trail from top of all elements except the outer one one with p and γ of the element and the other with p and γ of the element above and similarly for the bottom of all elements except that at the hub this makes u for the streamtube intersecting each set of n elements depend only on p for those elements but u can still be influenced by all trailing vortices in addition if p varies across the rotor u and w are not simply related the present results were obtained by calculating all induced velocities at each iteration after solving the blade element equations using the old values for all elements since the previous subsection demonstrated the relative inaccuracy of kawada s approximations we used only wrench s and okulov s these will be compared to the standard prandtl tip loss factor f p from here on all velocities are non dimensionalized by v 0 and all lengths by the blade tip radius r to start we generalize the definitions of u the induced velocity at the blade and u the streamtube average in eq 1 to include the effects of all trailing vortices and define w and w similarly we need their ratios 26 f u u u u u u and f w w w w w w most implementations of blade element analysis assume in effect f p f u f w where f p f p t i p f p h u b which are given by 27 f p t i p 2 π cos 1 exp n 1 r 2 r sin ϕ and 28 f p h u b 2 π cos 1 exp n r r h 2 r h sin ϕ where r h is the hub radius and ϕ is the angle between the velocity at the element and the plane of rotation e g hansen 2015 the inclusion of f u and f w in bemt is straightforward as recently described by vaz et al 2020 the vortex strength γ is given by 29 γ 1 2 w c c l 1 c d c l tan ϕ where w 1 a 2 λ 2 r 2 1 a 2 is the total velocity at the element we substituted a u to make our notation conventional and a w λ r c is the element chord and c l and c d are its lift and drag coefficients respectively for further details the reader is referred to vaz et al 2020 cavitation on hkt blades may damage the blades and decrease turbine efficiency and should be avoided silva et al 2017 maximized the power output to give the optimum total velocity at the rotor the optimum chord for each blade section was determined by 30 c o p t 8 π r a 1 a f u n c n w 2 where c n is the axial component of the force on the element due to its lift and drag to avoid cavitation silva et al 2017 is used the criterion that w v c a v where the latter is given by 31 v c a v p a t m ρ g r h r p v 1 2 ρ c p m i n where g 9 81 m s is the gravitational acceleration and r is the blade tip radius c p m i n is the minimum pressure coefficient on the element and cavitation is assumed to occur first when a blade is vertically upwards the remaining undefined symbols are listed in table 3 along with the values used the cavitation correction is implemented by replacing w in the bemt analysis by w c a v 1 f s v c a v where f s 0 1 is an arbitrary safety factor replacing w by w c a v increases c which reduces the pressure on the blade for blade sections where the criterion is satisfied it is easy to find the ratio between the corrected and uncorrected c eq 30 becomes 32 c o p t c a v 8 π r a 1 a f u n c n 1 f s v c a v 2 dividing eqs 30 and 32 results in 33 c o p t c a v c o p t w 2 w c a v 2 so the term w 2 w c a v 2 can be applied to correct the optimum chord distribution to avoid cavitation the tangential induction factor a o p t as a function of a o p t is found using conservation of energy resulting in vaz et al 2020 34 a o p t a o p t 1 a o p t f u λ 2 r 2 we present first the optimization of blade design without considering cavitation at two values of λ after which c is manipulated to avoid cavitation at the higher λ the effect of f p f u f w f u a and f w a on the hkt simulated by vaz and wood 2018 is investigated for λ 3 56 and 7 33 here f u and f w are determined using wrench s equations and f u a and f w a with okulov s additional terms a 1 and a 3 from eqs 24 and 25 table 3 documents the design parameters of the turbine table 4 lists the optimum blade shape in the absence of cavitation and the distribution of the minimal pressure coefficient c p m i n for n b e 60 a single hydrofoil the naca65 3 618 was used for the whole the blade and we assume that all elements have an angle of attack that gives the maximum lift to drag ratio fig 3a depicts the vortex strength for λ 7 33 okulov s additional terms cause a slight difference in γ from wrench s approximation when eq 29 was used for both this is not surprising as p 0 09 at the blade tip fig 3b for this value table 2 implies that the additional terms are small the difference is reflected in the optimized c fig 4a near the blade tip and root the chord follows the difference in the finite blade functions in fig 4b the functions give a slightly increased chord at the blade tip compared to f p a bigger difference is observed near the root modifying the geometry and altering the cavitation condition for the lower tip speed ratio λ 3 56 the vortex strength increases fig 5a as does p fig 5b this modifies c along the blade fig 6a leading to a significant differences near the root and tip in fig 6b this was expected as wood et al 2016 document the increasing differences between f p and f u and f w as λ decreased near the root f w and f w a exceed one we are undecided as to the physical significance of this result but fortunately it does not have a big influence on the optimized c the results for c modified to avoid cavitation using f u a and f w a are shown in fig 7 increased c at the blade tip decreases the relative velocity w keeping it always below v c a v as demonstrated in fig 7b avoiding cavitation changes the vortex strength at the blade tip fig 8a implying a change to f u and f w as in fig 8b this change does not alter f p which is not directly sensitive to variations in γ and so would always give c 0 at the blade tip this shows the value of calculating the induced velocities using wrench s and okulov s approximations it is worth noting that the increase in c at the tip caused by the use of f u and f w and by the need to avoid cavitation has the practical benefit of giving a blade shape that is easier to manufacture to high tolerance especially when the hkt is small 4 conclusions this paper considers the accuracy of estimating the induced velocities for a lifting line representation of propellers or horizontal axis turbines it is assumed that the blades are straight identical and equispaced so the velocities are due entirely to the trailing helical vortices we consider the following methods to compute these velocities prandtl s tip loss factor analytical solutions for vortices of constant pitch and radius and approximations to the analytical solutions we demonstrated that the first method is not as accurate as the third for the design of a hydrokinetic turbine blade especially to avoid cavitation an alternative to these methods is a free wake computational modelling of the contracting or expanding trailing helical vortices which allows for variable vortex pitch and radius a free wake model can be tested for accuracy using the present analysis the analytic solution gives the velocities in terms infinite series of products of modified bessel functions and their derivatives these series can be slow to converge and therefore computationally demanding making it highly desirable to have accurate and simpler approximations we initially analysed three approximations to the sums the first due to kawada 1939 the second to wrench 1957 and okulov 2004 as developed by wood et al 2016 and thirdly by using the additional terms of okulov and sørensen 2020 in agreement with the findings of wrench 1957 the kawada approximations are always less accurate than the wrench alternatives which have very similar execution times okulov s original approximations were shown to be the same as wrench s his additional terms eqs 24 and 25 improve the accuracy especially for pitch values close to one all approximations become more accurate as pitch decreases to evaluate the bessel function series we considered explicit summing the first m terms and then adding remainders derived from the approximations for m 1 as far as we know this approach has not been investigated previously the most demanding situation for numerical accuracy is when the point at which the velocities are required r approaches a vortex at t the induced velocities become dominated by the swirl velocity of the vortex and easy to compute in the limit r t 0 in contrast okulov and sørensen 2020 showed that the number of terms that must be evaluated in the series increases without bound we developed implicit equations to determine m for a specified accuracy explicit estimates derived from them 18 and 19 were found to be just as accurate and much faster to determine for the range of parameters that we investigated they show the unboundedness of m for a required accuracy in that m 1 r t it was also found that the required m is inversely proportional to the number of blades n this is a consequence of kawada cancellation the removal of all terms in the bessel function series whose index is not a multiple of n the numerical experiments were consistent with the explicit estimates of m finally we hope that this consideration of the variety of methods used to calculate the induced velocities by researchers in propellers and turbines will encourage the further

20474,lifting line analyses of propellers and horizontal axis turbines require the axial and circumferential velocities induced by the helicoidal vorticity shed from the blades these velocities can be found from the analytic solution for a helical vortex of constant radius and pitch due to kawada and hardin this solution however involves infinite series of products of bessel functions and their derivatives whose evaluation is computationally intensive partly because the number of terms required for a specified accuracy increases without bound as the vortex is approached we compare three closed form approximations to the kawada hardin equations the first due to kawada and rediscovered by lerbs involves asymptotic expansions for large pitch whereas the second is a more general approximation derived by wrench and subsequently by okulov the last uses additional terms found by okulov the three have comparable evaluation times but the third is more accurate the accuracy of the approximations is assessed for n equispaced and identical helical vortices where n is the number of blades we provide for the first time approximate remainders for the kawada hardin equations which allow an assessment of the number of terms in the series required to achieve a specified accuracy as a test case for assessing the calculations of induced velocity we consider the design of a hydrokinetic turbine blade to avoid cavitation at two different operating conditions with different vortex pitch the use of the approximated induced velocities is compared to prandtl s well known tip loss factor near the hub and tip the blade shape is altered considerably by the induced velocities and the method used to calculate them keywords horizontal axis turbine propeller lifting line blade element analysis induced velocities 1 introduction the simplest computational model for propellers and horizontal axis turbines treats the blades as lifting lines lls axial and circumferential velocities are induced along them by the trailing vorticity as in the well known ll theory of aircraft wings eg prandtl 1923 these velocities contribute to the total velocity which determines the lift and drag on the blade elements comprising the blades and lls blade element modelling is described for propellers by kerwin and hadler 2010 and epps 2017 for hydrokinetic turbines by abutunis et al 2019 and by hansen 2015 for wind turbines it is further assumed that the blades are geometrically identical and equispaced this rarely stated assumption is important for the analysis to follow typically the number of blade elements n b e is between 20 and 30 and approximately n b e 2 determinations of the induced velocities are required for every iteration of these essentially iterative methods the need for an accurate and fast determination of the induced velocities is clear the only simplification available at this point is the close relationship between the two velocity components which are normally determined in combination in a blade element formulation trailing line vortices are shed from the junctions of contiguous elements because they leave the blades with a circumferential as well as an axial velocity the vortices must be helical they either expand turbines or contract propellers as they move downstream and their pitch may change no general equation is available for the velocities induced by helical vortices of varying geometry so it is necessary either to use the equations described below for helical vortices of constant radius and pitch or use a free wake method to determine the velocities numerically eg chreim et al 2018 free wake modelling has its own pitfalls for example wood 2018 showed that the commonly used straight segment model of free wake vortices can lead to large errors in the induced velocities if the junctions of contiguous segments are aligned with the point at which the velocity is required however the free wake is modelled the equations we investigate here can be used as test cases as was done by chreim et al 2018 for this purpose accuracy is more important than evaluation time blade element methods match the change in axial and angular momentum in the annular streamtube containing the elements to their lift and drag by the ll approximation these forces are determined by the velocities at the element whereas the momentum change depends on the streamtune averaged velocities the ratio of the streamtube average induced velocities to those at the blades is called the tip loss factor and is usually approximated by prandtl s f p e g hansen 2015 f p is the same for both velocity components and is zero at the blade tips implying no tip loading it is derived in glauert 1935 by approximating the wake as a sequence of two dimensional equispaced vortex sheets and so is inherently more limited than assuming the wake comprises helical vortices of constant pitch and radius the direct calculation of induced velocities from these helical vortices is an alternative to using f p and allows for situations where f p is not accurate or applicable these include 1 turbines at low tip speed ratio λ the ratio of the circumferential velocity of the blade tips to the wind or water speed wood et al 2016 2 rotors where the vortex pitch varies significantly across the rotor causing the circumferential induced velocity to differ from the axial velocity wood et al 2016 3 a shrouded propeller or turbine with finite loading at the tips vaz et al 2020 4 blades that are swept in the plane of rotation or curved in the axial direction e g li et al 2020 which allow the bound vorticity to influence the velocities at the blades 5 unequally loaded blades as a result of differences in blade shape individual pitch action yaw or wind shear whatever the cause the bound vorticity also influences the velocities at the blades wood 2016 the exact equations for the velocities induced by helical vortices of constant pitch and radius contain infinite series of products of modified bessel functions whose evaluation can be computationally demanding the objective of this paper is to develop and evaluate alternative and supplementary methods for the accurate and fast computation of the induced velocities specifically the aims are to assess the accuracy of three different closed form approximations for the induced velocities the first is given by kawada 1939 and was rediscovered by lerbs 1952 the second due to wrench 1957 will be shown to be equivalent to that of okulov 2004 as used by wood et al 2016 thirdly we combine the wrench and okulov approximations with the additional terms given in okulov and sørensen 2020 all three approximations are significantly faster to evaluate than the exact equations but have never been assessed comparatively use these approximations to develop analytic remainder terms to allow evaluation of the exact series to a finite number of terms with arbitrary accuracy to our knowledge no previous derivation of remainders or estimation of the required number of terms has been made the assessment is done for equispaced helical vortices of varying number and pitch explore the singular behaviour as the point at which the velocities are required approaches the vortex usually by increasing n b e in this case the exact solution becomes particularly challenging as the number of terms required for a given accuracy increases without limit okulov and sørensen 2020 unify the treatment of induced velocities across the related disciplines of propeller and turbine research wind turbine researchers have paid little or no attention to the work of kawada and wrench propeller researchers often cite kawada 1936 but the important work of kawada 1939 has been universally ignored undertake a blade element design of a hydrokinetic turbine hkt to avoid cavitation as a test case requiring accurate estimates of the induced velocities in section 2 we develop the three approximations and remainders and comment on their history section 3 has two parts the first describes and discusses the numerical experiments to assess the accuracy of the approximations and remainders the second develops a blade element analysis of a hkt to demonstrate the value of the direct calculation of induced velocities and to study the effects of the accuracy of their determination the final section contains the conclusions 2 the equations for the induced velocities 2 1 the exact equations we use cylindrical polar co ordinates x r θ where x is in the axial or streamwise direction r is the radius and θ is the circumferential angle the respective velocity components are u v w a semi infinite single n 1 helical vortex of constant pitch p defined by d x d θ p for any point on the vortex begins at 0 t 0 the vortex radius remains t u at any point 0 r θ along the plane defined by the lls is given by 1 u γ 4 π p γ t 2 π p 2 s 1 u γ t 2 π p 2 s 1 for r t and γ t 2 π p 2 s 3 for r t where 2 s 1 m 1 m k m m t p i m m r p cos m θ and 3 s 3 m 1 m i m m t p k m m r p cos m θ γ is the vortex strength and u is the average axial velocity within the helicoid i m and k m are modified bessel functions in standard notation m denotes the order and the prime a derivative with respect to the argument note that the determination of u and w at x 0 from a vortex also starting at x 0 implies that the blades are straight and lie along the r axis this restriction will be assumed to apply throughout the following analysis kawada 1936 originally derived the equations for u and w but this major contribution was long forgotten at least by the wind turbine community the full equations for u v and w are due to hardin 1982 who was unaware of kawada s contribution the notations s 1 and s 3 are taken from hardin 1982 the similar series s 2 was used to find the radial velocity which we do not consider some of the history of these equations is related by fukumuto et al 2015 and 2017 who proposed calling them the kawada hardin kh equations helical symmetry requires p u w r and so the calculation of w say is straightforward once u has been found for the remainder of this paper therefore we consider only u in eq 1 the calculation of u poses no computational challenges so we concentrate on methods to evaluate s 1 and s 3 to determine u u u as pointed out by epps 2017 eqs 2 and 3 become singular as δ r r t 0 at any p the velocity field has a component proportional to 1 δ r due to the swirl associated with the circulation γ of the proximate vortex thus the singularity must be independent of n there is a further finite binormal component due to the vortex curvature which also depends on p eg section 7 1 of batchelor 1967 the singularity influences u and w for small δ r at all values of p when summed over n identical and equispaced blades s 1 and s 3 reduce to equation 13 of kawada 1939 4 s 1 n m 1 m n k m n m n t p i m n m n r p and 5 s 3 n m 1 m n i m n m n t p k m n m n r p along the ll as a consequence of the 2 π n periodicity of the flow which occurs only for equispaced identical blades this simplification called kawada cancellation by fukumuto et al 2015 is the mechanism by which the flow becomes circumferentially uniform as n increases 1 1 kawada assumed light loading in determining p see the equation on his page 5 the analysis is not restricted by this assumption and we discuss appropriate values of p in section 3 of the cases listed in the introduction where prandtl s f p cannot be used cancellation applies to all but the last 5 at first sight cancellation makes the direct solution of 4 and 5 attractive because a significant fraction n 1 n of the terms drop out as we shall show however the series can still be slow to converge and normally i m n m n t p and k m n m n t p must be evaluated as i m n 1 m n t p i m n 1 m n t p 2 and k m n 1 m n t p k m n 1 m n t p 2 respectively in practice the sums are evaluated to a finite m but it is not known what value of m will give a required precision in the next three subsections we describe the three approximations to s 1 and s 3 that we are aware of and use them to devise remainder terms to add to 4 and 5 when summed from m 1 to m after determining m to achieve a specified accuracy in deriving the special case of eqs 4 and 5 from 2 and 3 respectively we made no change to the notation s 1 and s 3 because we modify the notation for other purposes below from here on any reference to s 1 is to the definition in 4 and similarly for s 3 and 5 2 2 kawada s asymptotic equations using the large order m n expansion of i m n and k m n given for example by equations 9 7 7 9 7 10 of abramowitz and stegun 1964 and appendix b of okulov 2004 kawada 1939 determined the asymptotic expressions for s 1 and s 3 his equation 20 can be rewritten as 6 s 1 k a n u k 1 u k b k log 1 u k 1 u k for r t and 7 s 3 k a n u k 1 b k log 1 1 u k 1 for r t in 6 and 8 8 a p 2 t c t c r where c t 1 t p 2 and c r 1 r p 2 u k c r 1 c t 1 c r 1 c t 1 n 2 exp c r c t n and b k 1 2 t p 1 1 t p 2 3 2 these equations were also derived by lerbs 1952 who was apparently unaware of kawada s 1939 work mathematica was used to find the dominant term in 7 for points near the vortex i e as δ r r t 0 the result is 9 s 1 k s 3 k p 2 c t δ r as δ r 0 which is independent of n and valid for all values of p for example as p 0 u asymptotically approaches the swirl velocity u γ 2 π δ r and as p u 0 equation 19 of kawada 1939 gives the summands used to obtain 6 and 7 by summing over m 1 an alternative evaluation of the series in 4 and 5 is to sum the terms explicitly for m 1 m and estimate the remaining terms for m 1 using the asymptotic results we note that the convergence of 4 and 5 is always monotonic thus for example 10 s 1 m 1 m s 1 m n r 1 m n where s 1 m is the summand in eq 4 and r m n is the analytic remainder which will always have the same sign as the sum using mathematica to evaluate kawada s equation 19 over m m 1 gives 11 r 1 k m a n u k 1 u k b k u k m 1 2 f 1 1 m 1 m 2 u k u k m for r t and 12 r 3 k m a n u k 1 b k u k m 1 2 f 1 1 m 1 m 2 1 u k u k m for r t 2 f 1 is the hypergeometric function described in chapter 15 of abramowitz and stegun 1964 and chapter 15 of dlmf 2020 eqs 11 and 12 should be the most accurate remainders for all three approximations for large m 2 f 1 has an asymptotic form leading to more approximate versions of the remainders 13 r 1 k m a n u k 1 u k b k m 1 1 u k 1 u k u k m for r t and 14 r 3 k m a n u k 1 b k m 1 1 1 u k 1 u k m for r t it is also straightforward to evaluate 2 f 1 when m 0 to check the consistency of r 1 k 0 s 1 k and r 3 k 0 s 3 k there is no corresponding check on r 1 k 0 and r 3 k 0 but note that the inconsistency occurs only in the term containing b k 2 3 wrench s asymptotic equations wrench 1957 used the more accurate asymptotic formula of lehmer 1944 for i m n and then found the corresponding expansion for k m n he derived equations that are conveniently reproduced as equation 2 6d of epps 2017 15 s 1 w a n u w 1 u w b log 1 u w 1 u w for r t and 16 s 3 w a n u w 1 b log 1 1 u w 1 for t r in 15 and 16 17 b 1 24 9 t p 2 2 c t 3 3 r p 2 2 c r 3 and u w t c r 1 r c t 1 exp c r c t n for points near the vortex i e as δ r 0 the leading order term is identical to eq 9 wrench 1957 did not provide the series summed to obtain 15 and 16 so we assume that the appropriate reminder terms r 1 w m and r 3 w m would be eqs 11 and 12 with b k and u k replaced by b and u w respectively r 1 w m and r 3 w m are assumed to be given by a similar alteration to eqs 13 and 14 we show below that eqs 11 14 with u w and b are dominated by the first term in the square brackets for the ranges of n r t and p that were investigated this allows a direct estimate of m for a given tolerance ϵ 18 m log ϵ 1 u w a n log u w 1 for r t and 19 m log ϵ u w 1 a n log u w otherwise rather than requiring a root finding algorithm to solve the original implicit equations mathematica s expansion in δ r of the terms involving u w in 18 has the leading term of 20 r p 2 r 2 p 2 p 2 r 2 p 2 r 2 log 2 δ r p 2 r 2 p 2 r 2 p p 2 r 2 p 3 n δ r 1 as δ r 0 showing the unboundedness of m and its dependence on n 2 4 okulov s approximate equations okulov 2004 derived new approximations for the velocities induced by a single helical vortex for the computation of the induced velocities wood et al 2016 applied kawada cancellation to okulov s equations to obtain general forms that have significant similarities with the previous equations 21 s 1 o a n u o 1 u o b log 1 u o 1 u o for r t and 22 s 3 o a n u o 1 b log 1 1 u o 1 for r t the only difference from wrench s equations is in u o given by 23 u o r c t 1 t c r 1 exp c r c t n when the typographical errors in equation 18 of wood et al 2016 are removed it is an easy matter to show that u o from eq 23 is equal to u w from 17 thus okulov s approximations for the induced velocities are equivalent to wrench s when we undertook the analysis described in wood et al 2016 we were aware of wrench 1957 but did not think to apply the results to wind turbine analysis okulov 2004 developed extra terms to add to eqs 21 and 22 to improve their accuracy these are detailed for n 1 in the appendix of okulov and sørensen 2020 where they are called remainder terms which conflicts with the use of the term here we will denote them as additional terms a 1 and a 3 and follow the recommendation of okulov and sørensen 2020 to use only the first term from their equation a6a 24 a 1 n 2 k n n t p i n n r p a u w n b 2 and from a6b 25 a 3 n 2 i n n t p k n n r p a n b 2 u w the first term in 24 and 25 is clearly the first term in 4 and 5 respectively and okulov s approximations can viewed as remainder terms in the present sense for m 1 since we have shown the equivalence of okulov s 21 and 22 and wrench s 15 and 16 we now alter the definition of s 1 o and s 3 o to include a 1 and a 3 added to eqs 21 and 22 respectively in other words we use okulov s approximations in the form s 1 0 a 1 and s 3 0 a 3 3 results 3 1 induced velocities for n equispaced identical vortices for any n the most important physical parameters for the induced velocities are the pitch p and δ r the distance from the vortex to the point at which the velocities are required this is usually the centre of a blade element so the minimum δ r 1 2 n b e when normalized by the blade radius for horizontal axis turbines wood et al 2016 show that p 2 3 λ where p is made non dimensional using the blade tip radius λ is the tip speed ratio defined as the circumferential velocity of the blade tips divided by the wind or water speed most commercial wind turbines operate at λ 7 8 so p 0 1 the hydrokinetic turbine of abutunis et al 2019 had its maximum power coefficient at λ 4 5 corresponding to p 0 15 in their exposition of ll analysis for propellers chreim et al 2018 varied p between 0 17 and 1 7 epps 2017 fig 4a gives 0 16 p 0 24 for his propeller modelling for our example calculations of the induced velocity we use p 1 and 0 1 r 1 and 2 n 8 to study the effects of varying the number of blades see fig 2 in practice there appear to be no problems in determining p for a blade element calculation for example wood et al 2016 took p to be the ratio of blade element torque to thrust whereas epps 2017 assumed the line vortices followed the direction of the total velocity at the blade element the two definitions are equivalent in the absence of drag the latter definition is used below in the example blade element design of a hydrokinetic turbine blade for which p 0 2 we start with general observations about the accuracy of induced velocity calculations and the behaviour as the vortex is approached and then consider the use of remainders to estimate the required value of m for a desired accuracy the different methods of determining m are then examined to maximize the trade off between accuracy and computational time for the rest of this subsection only p is non dimensionalized by r fig 1 shows s 1 for r p 1 and n 2 4 8 evaluated from eq 10 after numerically solving eq 11 to estimate m for an accuracy of 10 6 the smallest δ r 0 01 corresponds to n b e 50 if the blade elements were equally spaced and the hub radius is small in our experience this value of n b e is higher of than most of those used in most blade element calculations table 1 lists the results for m from 11 or 12 s 1 from eq 10 and s 3 evaluated in the same way as s 1 to show the close similarity of their behaviour and the three approximations to these sums the time taken to determine m by matlab s root finder fzero from either 11 or 12 and then s 1 and s 3 for the values of t in table 1 was about 2200 times the time to determine s 1 o and s 3 o for the same values for the values in table 2 the ratios were around 1500 calculating m from equation 13 or 14 which again requires root finding but no special functions reduced these ratios to 200 and 60 respectively the approximate explicit solution for m given by eqs 18 and 19 reduced the ratios to 180 and 40 respectively all three methods for determining m gave the same values when n was reduced to 2 the required m nearly doubled for all entries in the two tables showing that the computational cost of accurate evaluations of the kawada hardin equations increases as n decreases in line with the scaling of 1 n from eq 20 the accuracy of the approximations decreases slightly with decreasing n for example in comparison to the entry in table 1 for t 1 01 changing only n to 2 gave s 1 34 9963 from eq 10 whereas s 1 o 34 9972 without showing the results when n was increased to 8 m decreased in line with the 1 n scaling the 1 δ r scaling is consistent with the decrease in m when δ r increases from 0 01 to 0 02 for both s 1 and s 3 in table 1 and the decrease for s 3 in table 2 the solid line in fig 1 is the asymptotic form of s 1 from eq 9 s 1 becomes independent of n as δ r 0 although not shown s 3 has the same behaviour the value p 1 in fig 1 and table 1 was chosen because it gives the highest error in the approximations of kawada wrench and okulov shown in that order in the last three columns of table 1 there is a uniform increase in accuracy from kawada to wrench to okulov this was found to be true for all tested cases for 0 1 p 1 and 2 n 8 results for s 3 only for p 0 1 are shown in table 2 all three approximations have become more accurate and there is nothing to chose at this level of accuracy between wrench s and okulov s generally a decrease in p makes all calculations of s 1 and s 3 less computationally intensive and increases the accuracy of the kawada approximation which table 1 shows is inaccurate at p 1 this finding agrees with wrench 1957 fig 2 shows the typical behaviour of the remainder terms in particular the remainder always improves the accuracy of the sum and the simple first term in the remainder equation is as accurate as the full equation note that it is the use of the first term only that leads to explicit equations for m 3 2 induced velocities for hydrokinetic turbine design we present the results for a blade element momentum theory bemt analysis of a hkt to investigate the direct calculation of the induced velocities and the effects of their accuracy the blades are assumed to be straight and radial so the induced velocities are due entirely to the trailing vorticity for n b e elements and n equispaced identical blades there are n b e 1 sets of n identical equispaced vortices contributing to the induced velocities at the centre of each element helical symmetry in the form p u w r for each set of n equispaced vortices reduces the computational burden but the total induced u and w may receive contributions from all trailing vortices which destroys the principle of blade element independence this principle is usually invoked in any development of the theory to justify for example the sequential and local solving of the bemt equations element by element blade element independence can be partly restored using the wake model of wood et al 2016 and epps 2017 whereby two vortices trail from top of all elements except the outer one one with p and γ of the element and the other with p and γ of the element above and similarly for the bottom of all elements except that at the hub this makes u for the streamtube intersecting each set of n elements depend only on p for those elements but u can still be influenced by all trailing vortices in addition if p varies across the rotor u and w are not simply related the present results were obtained by calculating all induced velocities at each iteration after solving the blade element equations using the old values for all elements since the previous subsection demonstrated the relative inaccuracy of kawada s approximations we used only wrench s and okulov s these will be compared to the standard prandtl tip loss factor f p from here on all velocities are non dimensionalized by v 0 and all lengths by the blade tip radius r to start we generalize the definitions of u the induced velocity at the blade and u the streamtube average in eq 1 to include the effects of all trailing vortices and define w and w similarly we need their ratios 26 f u u u u u u and f w w w w w w most implementations of blade element analysis assume in effect f p f u f w where f p f p t i p f p h u b which are given by 27 f p t i p 2 π cos 1 exp n 1 r 2 r sin ϕ and 28 f p h u b 2 π cos 1 exp n r r h 2 r h sin ϕ where r h is the hub radius and ϕ is the angle between the velocity at the element and the plane of rotation e g hansen 2015 the inclusion of f u and f w in bemt is straightforward as recently described by vaz et al 2020 the vortex strength γ is given by 29 γ 1 2 w c c l 1 c d c l tan ϕ where w 1 a 2 λ 2 r 2 1 a 2 is the total velocity at the element we substituted a u to make our notation conventional and a w λ r c is the element chord and c l and c d are its lift and drag coefficients respectively for further details the reader is referred to vaz et al 2020 cavitation on hkt blades may damage the blades and decrease turbine efficiency and should be avoided silva et al 2017 maximized the power output to give the optimum total velocity at the rotor the optimum chord for each blade section was determined by 30 c o p t 8 π r a 1 a f u n c n w 2 where c n is the axial component of the force on the element due to its lift and drag to avoid cavitation silva et al 2017 is used the criterion that w v c a v where the latter is given by 31 v c a v p a t m ρ g r h r p v 1 2 ρ c p m i n where g 9 81 m s is the gravitational acceleration and r is the blade tip radius c p m i n is the minimum pressure coefficient on the element and cavitation is assumed to occur first when a blade is vertically upwards the remaining undefined symbols are listed in table 3 along with the values used the cavitation correction is implemented by replacing w in the bemt analysis by w c a v 1 f s v c a v where f s 0 1 is an arbitrary safety factor replacing w by w c a v increases c which reduces the pressure on the blade for blade sections where the criterion is satisfied it is easy to find the ratio between the corrected and uncorrected c eq 30 becomes 32 c o p t c a v 8 π r a 1 a f u n c n 1 f s v c a v 2 dividing eqs 30 and 32 results in 33 c o p t c a v c o p t w 2 w c a v 2 so the term w 2 w c a v 2 can be applied to correct the optimum chord distribution to avoid cavitation the tangential induction factor a o p t as a function of a o p t is found using conservation of energy resulting in vaz et al 2020 34 a o p t a o p t 1 a o p t f u λ 2 r 2 we present first the optimization of blade design without considering cavitation at two values of λ after which c is manipulated to avoid cavitation at the higher λ the effect of f p f u f w f u a and f w a on the hkt simulated by vaz and wood 2018 is investigated for λ 3 56 and 7 33 here f u and f w are determined using wrench s equations and f u a and f w a with okulov s additional terms a 1 and a 3 from eqs 24 and 25 table 3 documents the design parameters of the turbine table 4 lists the optimum blade shape in the absence of cavitation and the distribution of the minimal pressure coefficient c p m i n for n b e 60 a single hydrofoil the naca65 3 618 was used for the whole the blade and we assume that all elements have an angle of attack that gives the maximum lift to drag ratio fig 3a depicts the vortex strength for λ 7 33 okulov s additional terms cause a slight difference in γ from wrench s approximation when eq 29 was used for both this is not surprising as p 0 09 at the blade tip fig 3b for this value table 2 implies that the additional terms are small the difference is reflected in the optimized c fig 4a near the blade tip and root the chord follows the difference in the finite blade functions in fig 4b the functions give a slightly increased chord at the blade tip compared to f p a bigger difference is observed near the root modifying the geometry and altering the cavitation condition for the lower tip speed ratio λ 3 56 the vortex strength increases fig 5a as does p fig 5b this modifies c along the blade fig 6a leading to a significant differences near the root and tip in fig 6b this was expected as wood et al 2016 document the increasing differences between f p and f u and f w as λ decreased near the root f w and f w a exceed one we are undecided as to the physical significance of this result but fortunately it does not have a big influence on the optimized c the results for c modified to avoid cavitation using f u a and f w a are shown in fig 7 increased c at the blade tip decreases the relative velocity w keeping it always below v c a v as demonstrated in fig 7b avoiding cavitation changes the vortex strength at the blade tip fig 8a implying a change to f u and f w as in fig 8b this change does not alter f p which is not directly sensitive to variations in γ and so would always give c 0 at the blade tip this shows the value of calculating the induced velocities using wrench s and okulov s approximations it is worth noting that the increase in c at the tip caused by the use of f u and f w and by the need to avoid cavitation has the practical benefit of giving a blade shape that is easier to manufacture to high tolerance especially when the hkt is small 4 conclusions this paper considers the accuracy of estimating the induced velocities for a lifting line representation of propellers or horizontal axis turbines it is assumed that the blades are straight identical and equispaced so the velocities are due entirely to the trailing helical vortices we consider the following methods to compute these velocities prandtl s tip loss factor analytical solutions for vortices of constant pitch and radius and approximations to the analytical solutions we demonstrated that the first method is not as accurate as the third for the design of a hydrokinetic turbine blade especially to avoid cavitation an alternative to these methods is a free wake computational modelling of the contracting or expanding trailing helical vortices which allows for variable vortex pitch and radius a free wake model can be tested for accuracy using the present analysis the analytic solution gives the velocities in terms infinite series of products of modified bessel functions and their derivatives these series can be slow to converge and therefore computationally demanding making it highly desirable to have accurate and simpler approximations we initially analysed three approximations to the sums the first due to kawada 1939 the second to wrench 1957 and okulov 2004 as developed by wood et al 2016 and thirdly by using the additional terms of okulov and sørensen 2020 in agreement with the findings of wrench 1957 the kawada approximations are always less accurate than the wrench alternatives which have very similar execution times okulov s original approximations were shown to be the same as wrench s his additional terms eqs 24 and 25 improve the accuracy especially for pitch values close to one all approximations become more accurate as pitch decreases to evaluate the bessel function series we considered explicit summing the first m terms and then adding remainders derived from the approximations for m 1 as far as we know this approach has not been investigated previously the most demanding situation for numerical accuracy is when the point at which the velocities are required r approaches a vortex at t the induced velocities become dominated by the swirl velocity of the vortex and easy to compute in the limit r t 0 in contrast okulov and sørensen 2020 showed that the number of terms that must be evaluated in the series increases without bound we developed implicit equations to determine m for a specified accuracy explicit estimates derived from them 18 and 19 were found to be just as accurate and much faster to determine for the range of parameters that we investigated they show the unboundedness of m for a required accuracy in that m 1 r t it was also found that the required m is inversely proportional to the number of blades n this is a consequence of kawada cancellation the removal of all terms in the bessel function series whose index is not a multiple of n the numerical experiments were consistent with the explicit estimates of m finally we hope that this consideration of the variety of methods used to calculate the induced velocities by researchers in propellers and turbines will encourage the further
