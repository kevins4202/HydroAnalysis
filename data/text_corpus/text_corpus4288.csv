accurately predict dredger productivity by using model stacked generalization in the absence of mud concentration data first eliminate abnormal construction data and ℓ 2 norm normalization and log smooth transformation are then performed on the data second spearman s rank correlation coefficient method is used to extract features five machine learning models namely lasso elastic net enet gradient boosting decision tree gbdt extreme gradient boosting xgboost and light gradient boosting machine lightgbm were introduced to predict dredger productivity based on these five models a stacked generalization model was applied the results show that the goodness of fit r 2 of the stacked generalization model for productivity prediction is 0 9281 which is higher than the accuracy of the other algorithms investigated and the optimization effect is obvious keywords cutter suction dredger data mining machine learning productivity prediction 1 introduction dredging works refer to earth and stone works implemented for the purpose of widening and deepening water areas using dredging boats or other machines and artificial underwater excavation erftemeijer and lewis 2006 at present dredging projects mainly occur for the construction and maintenance of coastal and inland waterways flood control and dredging of rivers the protection of the hydrological environment coastline protection artificial islands and marine resource development platform construction and other tasks the cutter suction dredger is one of many dredging ships and has the advantages of a high construction efficiency low cost wide adaptability to different dredging soils strong manoeuvrability suitable digging depth and good environmental protection baptist et al 2019 according to a report by the international association of dredging companies iadc the global dredging market was worth 10 7 billion yuan 14 2 billion in 2011 with the largest industries in china europe the middle east and latin american accounting for 29 percent 13 percent 11 percent and 10 percent of this total respectively global annual dredging turnover 5 1 billion euros 5 62 billion us increased 6 percent between 2017 and 2018 paarlberg et al 2015 capital infrastructure projects accounted for 48 percent of the annual turnover with most of the work was done in asia followed by that in the middle east europe central and south america and africa iadc 2018 with the continuous expansion of the global dredging market and scientific and technological progress and industrial transformation the global dredging industry has entered a new era of digitalization networking and information sharing for intelligent dredging dredging productivity prediction is very important for controlling dredging costs and optimizing dredging operations determining how to improve the dredging efficiency and increase the dredging output has always been a research focus in the industry and dredging productivity predictions can be used in advance to plan the construction strategy shorten the construction period and reduce the construction cost however the actual construction environment of dredgers is complex and there are many influential factors wu et al 2019a rojas sola and de la morena de la fuente 2018 at present the prediction of productivity in the industry generally involves adopting prediction methods based on semi empirical formulas that is the production process of dredgers is modelled and simulated according to previous construction experience and many activity parameters are added in the process of model fitting to fit the actual production movements of dredgers this method adopts a serial calculation mode and requires manual inputs of many parameters notably the calculation time is long the precision is relatively low and the calculation method requires mud concentration data if mud concentration data are not available the productivity of the dredger cannot be calculated in many cases the construction environment of dredgers is so bad that it is difficult to ensure the healthy operation of mud concentration meters at all times if a mud concentration meter fails the productivity cannot be predicted which will seriously affect the operation of the dredger with the advent of intelligent dredging an increasing number of new technologies are being used to improve the dredging efficiency in recent years many researchers have studied how to predict dredger productivity from different perspectives in dredging automation construction tang et al tang et al 2008 2009 tang and wang 2008 designed a self dredging operation system including an expert system that can achieve the on line optimization and fault diagnosis of dredging operations and a layered monitoring scheme for cutter suction dredgers this approach can optimize the dredging system and ensure the smooth operation of the dredging process however the system has a high sensor precision demands and it is difficult for an ordinary sensor to achieve the desired effect wei et al 2019 presented a reinforcement learning approach for intelligent decision making for cutter suction dredge which can gain the experience of human operators from historical data and can outperform the experienced human operator with respect to the production taking account of various operational constraints yue et al 2015 established a quantitative classification model of dredging materials under complex conditions by using rough set theory and conditional entropy and they calculated the weights of the conditional attributes of dredging materials and established a production efficiency prediction model for dredgers however the prediction model was semi empirical and the dredging efficiency is greatly affected by different dredging materials tian et al tian et al 2005 developed a set of computer aided decision systems for cutter suction dredgers that can adjust the relevant construction operations according to different soil parameters and improve dredging productivity however the prediction accuracy of dredger productivity with this method is not high and needs to be improved in terms of dredger productivity prediction yang et al yang and changyun wei 2015 used a bp neural network algorithm to predict the productivity of dredgers because the three characteristic parameters selected were all based on previous construction experience and the selected model was not the optimal model the prediction effect was not ideal bai et al 2019 used data mining technology to predict the productivity of dredgers and achieved good results but the degree of refinement of data processing was insufficient the r 2 score of the xgboost model which displayed the highest prediction accuracy of all the models considered in the paper was 0 75 which indicates that the prediction accuracy of this method still has for improvement in terms of productivity prediction in other areas schabowicz et al schabowicz and hola 2007 the excavator productivity is predicted by using the excavator bucket capacity transport capacity road type and output transport distance as input parameters of the neural network tarek et al zayed and mahmoud 2014 developed a prediction model of horizontal directional drilling productivity suitable for clay rock and sand using neural fuzzy nf method but the model in this field are restricted in applicability due to too few soil types arash et al ebrahimabadi et al 2015 used artificial neural network to predict cutting performance of roadheader and verified the method from tabas coal mine the largest and the only fully mechanized coal mine in iran lv et al lü et al 2011 used a bp neural network to productivity quantitative prediction of coalbed methane wells the method has high accuracy and reliability in the matching prediction of gas production of different types and different time resolutions and as the abnormal value in the gas production data decreases its accuracy continues to improve with the development of artificial intelligence various machine learning algorithms and data mining technologies have been widely used to predict productivity wang et al 2020 oral et al 2012 lópez martín et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 heravi and eslamdoost 2015 gelmereanu et al 2014 therefore this paper proposes an accurate method for predicting dredger productivity based on a model stacked generalization algorithm this method not only greatly improves the prediction accuracy of dredger productivity but also solves the problem of dredger productivity prediction requiring mud concentration data thereby improving dredger productivity prediction and providing generalization for future dredging vessels the second part of the paper mainly introduces the data source used the chang lion 10 construction technology for cutter suction dredgers and the mainstream productivity forecasting methods used in the industry the third part of the paper mainly introduces the use of data mining technology for data feature screening and cleaning in the fourth part five machine learning algorithms are introduced and a model stacking method is proposed the fifth part summarizes the work of this paper and the prospects for future research 2 dredging construction and the productivity of the cutter suction dredger in the actual operation of dredgers operators will determine the depth and speed of reamers according to the soil characteristics and engineering practice and then choose the appropriate forward moving distance for the trolley and moving speed according to different reamer depths based on the mud concentration this kind of operation method mainly depends on the selection of parameters based on experience construction will be affected if the productivity is unable to be accurately predicted in a reasonable time because the construction personnel perform operations mainly according to the index of productivity to judge the current mining state the problem studied in this paper is related to quickly and accurately predicting dredger productivity to assist construction personnel and to ensure that the productivity of the dredger can still be predicted when damages occurs to mud concentration meter is damaged 2 1 construction technology of the cutter suction dredger cutter suction dredgers are generally composed of hulls main diesel engines auxiliary diesel engine generator systems steel pile positioning systems trolley step systems winch traverse systems reamer lifting systems reamer cutting systems mud conveying systems and comprehensive operation control systems reamer cutting systems and mud conveying systems are the two most important parts of dredgers and their energy consumption accounts for approximately 90 of the total energy consumption of dredging systems and determines the output and safety stability of the whole ship min et al 2018 therefore their respective performance and matching optimization degree determine the overall performance of the dredger fig 1 displays the chang lion 10 cutter suction dredger which is a type of non self propelled dredging ship the cutter suction dredger reamer cutting system is mainly composed of the front end device reamer reamer transmission shaft dredger baffle dredger suction port and underwater pipeline the cutter system produces a mud and water mixture that is collected through the suction port and drainage pipeline after cutting mud sand or rock underwater the cutting movement of the cutter suction dredger is presented in fig 2 li et al 2018 the main pile can slide back and forth in the centre of the hull and the secondary pile is installed in the centre position of the stern for adjustment and auxiliary positioning generally a cutter suction dredger uses a steel pile or three cable guide barrel as the swing centre and the left and right anchors drive the dredger to swing laterally for dredging the hydraulic cylinder pushes the trolley a certain distance to complete dredging in one foot segments when the cutter suction dredger swings to the side then the reamer head swings the dredge to the other side of the dredge to complete dredging in the next one foot segment the dredger moves horizontally to the centerline of the groove lifts the bridge frame tightens the transverse cable at both ends puts down the auxiliary pile lifts the main pile and pulls the trolley into the initial position when the trolley makes a complete journey the main pile is inserted into the river bottom and the auxiliary pile is listed when starting a trolley movement chen and miedema 2015 helmons et al 2016 in addition the operation of the dredger should consider the following factors ① the angle formed by the hull and the centerline of the groove should not exceed 40 when the cutter suction dredger swings from side to side ② construction must be adjusted when the dredger s maximum excavation width is less than the designed excavation width and ③ the side anchor should be moved when the angle between the side anchor and the centerline of the groove is greater than 40 in dredger construction 2 2 productivity calculation of a cutter suction dredger at present predictions of productivity are mainly based on the deduction of a semi empirical formula the minimum critical velocity value maximum damping value of the pipeline speed of the mud pump and power of the corresponding driving equipment are determined according to the dredging soil quality and mud delivery row spacing mud concentrations are generally based on experience under different construction conditions the corresponding pipeline dredge pump model is established and the pipeline characteristic curve is fit for different concentrations and mud pump characteristic curves after calculating the pipeline and mud pump properties productivity can be estimated from the characteristic curves for different concentrations this method has two disadvantages ① productivity prediction based on a semi empirical formula requires very high quality input data and the calculation will be inaccurate if important data are missing in some key steps ② in practice many parameters in the formula need to be adjusted which is difficult and the fault tolerance rate is subsequently low in reality the construction environment of dredgers is often poor and the sensor lifetime is often short the current productivity prediction system based on a semi empirical calculation formula cannot be used when mud concentration meters are damaged or data cannot be transmitted in a timely manner the method proposed in this paper can be used to predict productivity even when mud concentration meter data are not available and the prediction accuracy of this method is much higher than that of the current productivity prediction methods being used 3 data processing and model selection this chapter mainly includes data cleaning and feature selection operations specifically the data are deleted non construction points or abnormal points and normalized and smoothed and the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is used to select features and reduce the data dimension the technical framework of the article is shown in fig 3 3 1 data cleaning this paper first conducts a preliminary analysis of the construction data which are the construction data from the chang lion 10 cutter suction dredger in block 3 of lianyungang port jiangsu province china on june 23 2018 the construction data include 29 160 data sets rows with 239 dimensions columns from 8 27 15 25 bjt on the studied day in this case study 80 of the data is randomly selected as the training set which is used to train the machine learning model and the rest 20 of the data is utilized as the testing set which is utilized as the evaluation for the model performance because if the productivity values are 0 the dredger has not started the excavation construction so all rows with productivity values of 0 are deleted the monitoring data structure of chang lion 10 is shown in table 1 since the features in the data set have different dimensions and orders of magnitude and their levels vary greatly the role of features with high values in the comprehensive analysis will be highlighted and the role of features with low values will be relatively weakened if the original feature values are directly used for analysis kou et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to process the original feature data to ensure the reliability of the results 1 normalized vector x x x 2 euclidean ℓ 2 norm x 2 x 1 2 x 2 2 x m 2 after the normalization of the ℓ 2 norm the characteristic data for each dimension are distributed on a hypersphere with radius 1 which eliminates the influence of data units on the prediction results wu et al 2019b the processing diagram is shown in fig 4 for the linear model the target value of the normal distribution is required to play the maximum role so the target value is log transformed and the other characteristic data are smoothed by the least square method to approach a normal distribution wood et al 2017 lai et al 2013 3 2 feature selection in the current calculation of dredging construction output productivity target m 3 h was obtained by the product of mud volume concentration f21 and mud flow f20 m 3 h 2 p c q where p productivity m 3 h c mud volume concentration q mud flow m 3 h because there was a direct mathematical conversion relationship between the flow and the flow velocities f165 m s the flow velocities be calculated by the flow in the actual construction of the cutter suction dredger 3 q v a where v the flow velocities m s a pipeline cross sectional area m 2 similarly the soil density f23 kg m 3 water density f22 kg m 3 mud density f164 kg m 3 and mud concentration of the cutter suction dredger have a direct mathematical conversion relationship in actual construction the mud density was obtained from mud concentration 4 c ρ m u d ρ w a t e r ρ s o i l ρ w a t e r 5 p ρ m u d ρ w a t e r ρ s o i l ρ w a t e r v a where ρ m u d mud density kg m 3 ρ w a t e r water density kg m 3 ρ s o i l soil density kg m 3 therefore these feature data need to be manually deleted to prevent the final prediction result from being affected before feature selection to study the correlations of the data distributions of the f21 f164 f20 f165 and target in detail psionic comparative analysis was performed as shown in fig 5 the figures a and b showed that the mud concentration and density were linearly related to productivity respectively and figure c also showed strongly linear correlation between the mud concentration and density it could be seen from figures d and e that the flow and flow velocities had no obvious rules with productivity but from figure f showed that the flow and flow velocities were directly proportional the spearman s rank correlation coefficient method with non parametric properties was introduced to select the features with strong relevance to the target list and remove the irrelevant features croux and dehon 2010 the process can be expressed by 6 ρ i 1 n r i r s i s i 1 n r i r i 1 n s i s 2 where r i and s i influence the order rank of the positions of samples r and s are the mean values of the previous parameters and n is the sample number ρ is the correlation coefficient between different characteristics and ρ 1 1 in this case 1 indicates that there is a complete positive linear correlation between the two characteristics and 1 means that there is a complete negative linear correlation between the two characteristics additionally the greater the ρ value is the higher the similarity between the two signals and vice versa according to bai bai et al 2019 selecting about 9 feature vectors could take into account the prediction speed and prediction accuracy at the same time so we selected the feature vectors whose absolute value of correlation coefficients with productivity is exceeding 0 1 overall 10 features vectors were selected as shown in fig 6 the numbers shown in the boxes in the figure are the correlation coefficients with horizontal and vertical coordinates red colours denote a positive correlation and the darker the colour is the greater the positive correlation degree blue colours denote a negative correlation and the darker the colour is the greater the negative correlation degree the location distribution of the selected feature vectors on the dredger are presented in fig 7 4 model application and ensemble in this paper five representative models are selected through comparative analysis to predict the data on this basis two model ensemble methods are proposed and applied to productivity forecasting and good results are obtained 4 1 model application 4 1 1 least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso the lasso method is a compression estimation duan et al 2016 the basic objective is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals under the constraint that the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients is less than a constant to produce some regression coefficients that are strictly equal to 0 and obtain an explainable model this approach is characterized by variable selection and complexity regularization while fitting a generalized linear model therefore lasso regression can be used to model and predict whether the dependent variable is continuous binary or multivariate discrete lasso adds the ℓ 1 penalty term in the ordinary linear model and the objective function of lasso estimation for the ordinary linear model is 7 β l asso min β 1 2 n i 1 n β t x i y i 2 λ j 1 m β where β is the coefficient of the independent variable n is the number of samples and m is the number of characteristics 4 1 2 elastic net enet elastic net enet is a linear regression model that uses the ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 norms in a priori regularization training hastie 2005 the sparse solution of lasso is easy to produce and some regular properties of ridge regression are also considered when selecting variables irrelevant variables are eliminated which solves the problem that the lasso method produces multiple solutions when the correlation between variables is large this approach performs well in dealing with the problem that multiple features are related to other features the objective function of enet is 8 β ˆ e l a s t i c n e t min β 1 2 n i 1 n β t x i y i 2 λ j 1 m β 2 λ j 1 m β 2 the formula shows that the penalty function of the projectile network is an exact convex linear combination of the ridge regression penalty function and the lasso penalty function therefore enet regression combines the advantages of lasso regression and ridge regression which not only achieves variable selection but also provides a good group effect 4 1 3 gradient boosting decision tree gbdt gbdt is a decision tree method used to achieve boosting friedman 2001 the main concept is that every model is constructed in the gradient descent direction of the loss function of the models built prior the current model the core objective is to use the negative gradient of the loss function as the current model value 9 r m i l y f x i f x i f x f m 1 x training set data t x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n x i χ r n y i ϒ r loss function l y f x the main advantages of bdt are as follows ① this approach can flexibly deal with various types of data including continuous values and discrete values ② some robust loss functions can be used which are very robust for outliers such as the huber loss function and quantile loss function and ③ with relatively few adjustment parameters the accuracy is high 4 1 4 extreme gradient boosting xgboost xgboost is essentially an improvement to the gbdt algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 the core objective is to add new trees and fit pseudo residuals to reduce the loss function the second order taylor expansion of the loss function during the fitting process enables leaf splitting optimization calculations based on the input data without selecting the specific form of the loss function this de coupling approach increases the applicability of xgboost in addition the regularization terms ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 are added to xgboost to control the complexity of the model which is conducive to preventing overfitting and improving the generalization ability of the model the objective function of xgboost consists of two parts the first part is the loss function in the gradient lifting algorithm and the second part is the regularization term the loss function is defined as 10 l φ i n l y i y ˆ i k ω f k where n is the sample number of the training function l is the loss of a single sample and ω is the regularization term which defines the complexity of the model 11 ω f γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 where γ and λ are manually set parameters ω is the vector formed by the values of all leaf nodes in the decision tree and t is the number of leaf nodes 4 1 5 lightgbm lgb lightgbm uses the histogram algorithm which divides the continuous floating point features into k discrete values and a histogram with a width of k is constructed to display the cumulative statistics for each discrete value in the training data set ma et al 2018 this approach has the prominent advantages of low memory consumption and low complexity in data separation because only the discrete value of the histogram is needed to find the optimal segmentation point in feature selection in addition lightgbm is optimized on the basis of the histogram algorithm and a leafwise algorithm with a depth limitation is used level wise data can split the leaves of the same layer at the same time which is ideal for multithread optimization and mitigates overfitting 4 2 model ensemble in this paper two ensemble processes involving five models are implemented to achieve high computational accuracy in the first method the predicted values of the model are weighted averages to increase the overall accuracy the second method involves dividing all the algorithm models into two layers the main idea is that after learning several basic features from the initial training data the prediction results are used as a new training set for additional learning 4 2 1 model average ma a weighted average ensemble of the above five models namely lasso enet gbdt xgboost and lightgbm was created to form a new combined model the weights were determined according to the root mean square error values based on cross validation as shown in table 2 in the practical application of the model the predicted values of several models are output after the weighted averages to obtain the predicted average value 4 2 2 model stacked generalization msg stacking is a hierarchical model integration framework healey et al 2018 naimi and balzer 2018 which combine different models together to produce a meta model with equal or better predictive performance than the constituent parts there are two kinds of models in a stacked generalization framework several base models xgboost lightgbm and gbdt in this study and one meta model lasso in this study given training data set d x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x m y m where y m is the target value and x m represents the feature vectors of the mth instance randomly split the data into k almost equal folds d 1 d 2 d k k 5 in this study define d j and d j d d j to be the validation and training sets for the jth fold of k fold cross validation given t different base model h t j which is trained by d j and predicts each x i in d j let z i t h t j x i donate the prediction of the base model on x i then we have z i z i 1 z i 2 z i t and the target value was y i at the end of the entire cross validation of each base models the data assembled from the outputs of the base models are d z i y i i 1 m which is training set of meta model the stacked generalization framework is shown in fig 8 4 3 multi model prediction and comparison 4 3 1 model parameters first the training data set is partitioned by five fold cross validation and the shuffle method is used to ensure the randomness of data cutting second a grid search is adopted for each model and the optimal super parameters of each model are selected the grid search is an exhaustive search in which the best performing parameters are selected and output as the final result by iteratively considering each possibility in the selection of all candidate parameters table 3 shows the main parameters of each model the parameter α in lasso represents the regular term coefficient of ℓ 1 the parameters α a b and ℓ 1 ratio a a b in enet and a and b represent the regularization coefficients of ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 respectively the parameters eta n estimators and max depth in xgboost and gbdt represent the length of each iteration the maximum number of decision trees and the maximum depth of a decision tree respectively the parameters eta n estimators max bin and num leaves represent the length of each iteration the maximum number of decision trees the maximum number of barrels to hold a value and the number of leaf nodes used to control the complexity of the tree model respectively 4 3 2 evaluation indices to quantitatively compare the prediction accuracy of each model three evaluation indices including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r 2 are introduced the time index is the cpu time s required to implement each algorithm 1 root mean square error rmse 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 2 mean absolute error mae 13 m a e 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i 3 goodness of fit r 2 14 r 2 1 i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 the mae can reveal the difference between predicted and real values the smaller the mae value is the higher the prediction accuracy rmse mainly measures the deviation between a predicted value and the real value which can reflect the accuracy of the prediction the smaller the rmse value is the higher the prediction accuracy however when a particularly large outlier appears in the data set the rmse cannot effectively reflect the real difference in the data the above two evaluation indexes can only evaluate results with the same dimension and it is difficult to evaluate values when the dimensions are different however r 2 can effectively reflect the differences between different models and r 2 0 1 the closer the r 2 score is to 1 the better the goodness of fit of the model the prediction results for seven algorithms based on productivity were compared with the productivity data from the corresponding test set to obtain the scores of each evaluation index as shown in table 4 according to table 4 the goodness of fit r 2 value of msg is 0 9281 which is the smallest value among all rmse and mae values however the maximum computational time was 131 166 s which was the longest of all the methods compared with the r 2 value of article bai et al 2019 which is 0 75 this paper has great optimization in accuracy msg is suitable for scenarios requiring high accuracy that are not limited by the calculation time although the accuracy of xgboost is not as good as that of msg the goodness of fit is as high as 0 9064 and the calculation time is only 6 273 s the computational speed of enet lasso and lightgbm was excellent but the computational accuracy was not as good as that of msg or xgboost the gbdt calculation accuracy was also good but the calculation speed was slow thus no single model had a clear advantage based on the calculation accuracy and speed to intuitively show the deviation degree of the predicted values from the target values for the seven algorithms and to determine the absolute error between the predicted values and the true values of the test set the absolute errors of the seven algorithm models are shown in fig 9 fig 15 15 absolute error e x x ˆ x x ˆ is the predicted value and x is the true value in this case study to analyse the importance of the selected feature vectors to the predicted target value the features were ranked in importance using the trained xgboost model which is presented in fig 16 from fig 16 it can be seen that f199 1 main pump discharge pressure f200 2 main pump discharge pressure and f201 vacuum of underwater dredger pump have higher importance scores compared with other feature vectors which also indicates that these three features have greater influence on the prediction of target value the importance scores of the remaining features were almost equivalent except that the importance scores of f100 were relatively low which indicated that the influences of these six features on target prediction were similarly in summary the msg and xgboost algorithms should be applied to dredger hourly productivity prediction in scenarios in which the mud concentration meter fails these algorithms are recommended for the following reasons 1 in the actual construction process the productivity tends to be calculated in real time with information from the mud concentration meter to assist operation personnel in monitoring mining conditions mud concentration meter damage will seriously affect the operation of a dredge and personnel decisions therefore since production monitoring must resume as quickly as possible the selection of algorithms must guarantee a certain level of accuracy and a fast operation speed the xgboost algorithm is recommended in such a case 2 in some common construction areas if there is a failure caused by mud concentration meters that cannot calculate productivity experienced operators can still rely on experience to perform operations for a given period of time in this case the computation time requirement is not strict but the accuracy of the algorithm prediction must be high so the msg algorithm is recommended 5 conclusions this paper mainly focuses on the problems that exist in the dredging industry such as the low precision of dredger productivity prediction and the extreme dependence of dredger productivity prediction on mud concentration data the machine learning algorithm is used to mine and analyse 29 160 sets of 239 dimensional construction data from the chang lion 10 cutter suction dredger in block 3 of lianyungang port jiangsu province china on june 23 2018 the specific steps are as follows 1 first feature cleaning and extraction were performed for the data and feature columns were reduced as much as possible on the basis of ensuring a full description of the target column to achieve feature dimensionality reduction additionally spearman s rank correlation coefficient method was used to analyse the feature categories that influenced productivity prediction 2 according to the problem to be solved the appropriate algorithm model was selected and the hyper parameters of each model were determined by grid search and verification processes the model evaluation criteria rmse mae and r 2 are introduced to evaluate and compare the algorithm models and to calculate the operation time of each model 3 according to the scores of each model based on the evaluation criteria the method was optimized by using a model ensemble mainly model averaging and stacking generalization methods were used the model averaging method uses a weighted average of the predicted values of the five selected algorithms based on their r 2 scores and then outputs the predicted values the model stacking generalization method uses gbdt lightgbm and xgboost as the base models of the first layer and lasso as the second layer meta model 4 based on the comprehensive evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each model and the actual construction situation of the dredger the xgboost model and msg model are recommended to be applied for productivity prediction on actual dredgers under different conditions by using a machine learning algorithm to mine and analyse the historical dredger data the modelling of the production process can be omitted compared with the present prediction method based on a semi empirical formula the proposed approach has great advantages first based on machine learning the productivity prediction accuracy is high second if slurry concentration meter damage were to occur or there was a lack of concentration data the current forecasting system would not be able to obtain productivity predictions however the proposed productivity prediction method based on machine learning can solve this problem at present ordinary data mining algorithms have been widely used in production practice in the field of dredging many scholars also used data mining methods to predict the productivity of dredgers however with the development of technology the accuracy of the algorithm itself is getting higher and higher the use of stacking generalization models can greatly improve the prediction accuracy of data mining algorithms for targets but this method has not been applied in the field of dredging the application of this paper proves that the prospect of this method is very broad if it is widely used in the prediction of dredging ship productivity it will greatly improve the current dredging construction efficiency and have a revolutionary impact on the industry after solving the problem of productivity prediction determining how to accurately predict each operation in near real time according to the construction requirements and objectives will be particularly prominent and solving this problem will be the focus of future work credit author statement bin wang software writing original draft preparation shi

dredging operations determining how to improve the dredging efficiency and increase the dredging output has always been a research focus in the industry and dredging productivity predictions can be used in advance to plan the construction strategy shorten the construction period and reduce the construction cost however the actual construction environment of dredgers is complex and there are many influential factors wu et al 2019a rojas sola and de la morena de la fuente 2018 at present the prediction of productivity in the industry generally involves adopting prediction methods based on semi empirical formulas that is the production process of dredgers is modelled and simulated according to previous construction experience and many activity parameters are added in the process of model fitting to fit the actual production movements of dredgers this method adopts a serial calculation mode and requires manual inputs of many parameters notably the calculation time is long the precision is relatively low and the calculation method requires mud concentration data if mud concentration data are not available the productivity of the dredger cannot be calculated in many cases the construction environment of dredgers is so bad that it is difficult to ensure the healthy operation of mud concentration meters at all times if a mud concentration meter fails the productivity cannot be predicted which will seriously affect the operation of the dredger with the advent of intelligent dredging an increasing number of new technologies are being used to improve the dredging efficiency in recent years many researchers have studied how to predict dredger productivity from different perspectives in dredging automation construction tang et al tang et al 2008 2009 tang and wang 2008 designed a self dredging operation system including an expert system that can achieve the on line optimization and fault diagnosis of dredging operations and a layered monitoring scheme for cutter suction dredgers this approach can optimize the dredging system and ensure the smooth operation of the dredging process however the system has a high sensor precision demands and it is difficult for an ordinary sensor to achieve the desired effect wei et al 2019 presented a reinforcement learning approach for intelligent decision making for cutter suction dredge which can gain the experience of human operators from historical data and can outperform the experienced human operator with respect to the production taking account of various operational constraints yue et al 2015 established a quantitative classification model of dredging materials under complex conditions by using rough set theory and conditional entropy and they calculated the weights of the conditional attributes of dredging materials and established a production efficiency prediction model for dredgers however the prediction model was semi empirical and the dredging efficiency is greatly affected by different dredging materials tian et al tian et al 2005 developed a set of computer aided decision systems for cutter suction dredgers that can adjust the relevant construction operations according to different soil parameters and improve dredging productivity however the prediction accuracy of dredger productivity with this method is not high and needs to be improved in terms of dredger productivity prediction yang et al yang and changyun wei 2015 used a bp neural network algorithm to predict the productivity of dredgers because the three characteristic parameters selected were all based on previous construction experience and the selected model was not the optimal model the prediction effect was not ideal bai et al 2019 used data mining technology to predict the productivity of dredgers and achieved good results but the degree of refinement of data processing was insufficient the r 2 score of the xgboost model which displayed the highest prediction accuracy of all the models considered in the paper was 0 75 which indicates that the prediction accuracy of this method still has for improvement in terms of productivity prediction in other areas schabowicz et al schabowicz and hola 2007 the excavator productivity is predicted by using the excavator bucket capacity transport capacity road type and output transport distance as input parameters of the neural network tarek et al zayed and mahmoud 2014 developed a prediction model of horizontal directional drilling productivity suitable for clay rock and sand using neural fuzzy nf method but the model in this field are restricted in applicability due to too few soil types arash et al ebrahimabadi et al 2015 used artificial neural network to predict cutting performance of roadheader and verified the method from tabas coal mine the largest and the only fully mechanized coal mine in iran lv et al lü et al 2011 used a bp neural network to productivity quantitative prediction of coalbed methane wells the method has high accuracy and reliability in the matching prediction of gas production of different types and different time resolutions and as the abnormal value in the gas production data decreases its accuracy continues to improve with the development of artificial intelligence various machine learning algorithms and data mining technologies have been widely used to predict productivity wang et al 2020 oral et al 2012 lópez martín et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 heravi and eslamdoost 2015 gelmereanu et al 2014 therefore this paper proposes an accurate method for predicting dredger productivity based on a model stacked generalization algorithm this method not only greatly improves the prediction accuracy of dredger productivity but also solves the problem of dredger productivity prediction requiring mud concentration data thereby improving dredger productivity prediction and providing generalization for future dredging vessels the second part of the paper mainly introduces the data source used the chang lion 10 construction technology for cutter suction dredgers and the mainstream productivity forecasting methods used in the industry the third part of the paper mainly introduces the use of data mining technology for data feature screening and cleaning in the fourth part five machine learning algorithms are introduced and a model stacking method is proposed the fifth part summarizes the work of this paper and the prospects for future research 2 dredging construction and the productivity of the cutter suction dredger in the actual operation of dredgers operators will determine the depth and speed of reamers according to the soil characteristics and engineering practice and then choose the appropriate forward moving distance for the trolley and moving speed according to different reamer depths based on the mud concentration this kind of operation method mainly depends on the selection of parameters based on experience construction will be affected if the productivity is unable to be accurately predicted in a reasonable time because the construction personnel perform operations mainly according to the index of productivity to judge the current mining state the problem studied in this paper is related to quickly and accurately predicting dredger productivity to assist construction personnel and to ensure that the productivity of the dredger can still be predicted when damages occurs to mud concentration meter is damaged 2 1 construction technology of the cutter suction dredger cutter suction dredgers are generally composed of hulls main diesel engines auxiliary diesel engine generator systems steel pile positioning systems trolley step systems winch traverse systems reamer lifting systems reamer cutting systems mud conveying systems and comprehensive operation control systems reamer cutting systems and mud conveying systems are the two most important parts of dredgers and their energy consumption accounts for approximately 90 of the total energy consumption of dredging systems and determines the output and safety stability of the whole ship min et al 2018 therefore their respective performance and matching optimization degree determine the overall performance of the dredger fig 1 displays the chang lion 10 cutter suction dredger which is a type of non self propelled dredging ship the cutter suction dredger reamer cutting system is mainly composed of the front end device reamer reamer transmission shaft dredger baffle dredger suction port and underwater pipeline the cutter system produces a mud and water mixture that is collected through the suction port and drainage pipeline after cutting mud sand or rock underwater the cutting movement of the cutter suction dredger is presented in fig 2 li et al 2018 the main pile can slide back and forth in the centre of the hull and the secondary pile is installed in the centre position of the stern for adjustment and auxiliary positioning generally a cutter suction dredger uses a steel pile or three cable guide barrel as the swing centre and the left and right anchors drive the dredger to swing laterally for dredging the hydraulic cylinder pushes the trolley a certain distance to complete dredging in one foot segments when the cutter suction dredger swings to the side then the reamer head swings the dredge to the other side of the dredge to complete dredging in the next one foot segment the dredger moves horizontally to the centerline of the groove lifts the bridge frame tightens the transverse cable at both ends puts down the auxiliary pile lifts the main pile and pulls the trolley into the initial position when the trolley makes a complete journey the main pile is inserted into the river bottom and the auxiliary pile is listed when starting a trolley movement chen and miedema 2015 helmons et al 2016 in addition the operation of the dredger should consider the following factors ① the angle formed by the hull and the centerline of the groove should not exceed 40 when the cutter suction dredger swings from side to side ② construction must be adjusted when the dredger s maximum excavation width is less than the designed excavation width and ③ the side anchor should be moved when the angle between the side anchor and the centerline of the groove is greater than 40 in dredger construction 2 2 productivity calculation of a cutter suction dredger at present predictions of productivity are mainly based on the deduction of a semi empirical formula the minimum critical velocity value maximum damping value of the pipeline speed of the mud pump and power of the corresponding driving equipment are determined according to the dredging soil quality and mud delivery row spacing mud concentrations are generally based on experience under different construction conditions the corresponding pipeline dredge pump model is established and the pipeline characteristic curve is fit for different concentrations and mud pump characteristic curves after calculating the pipeline and mud pump properties productivity can be estimated from the characteristic curves for different concentrations this method has two disadvantages ① productivity prediction based on a semi empirical formula requires very high quality input data and the calculation will be inaccurate if important data are missing in some key steps ② in practice many parameters in the formula need to be adjusted which is difficult and the fault tolerance rate is subsequently low in reality the construction environment of dredgers is often poor and the sensor lifetime is often short the current productivity prediction system based on a semi empirical calculation formula cannot be used when mud concentration meters are damaged or data cannot be transmitted in a timely manner the method proposed in this paper can be used to predict productivity even when mud concentration meter data are not available and the prediction accuracy of this method is much higher than that of the current productivity prediction methods being used 3 data processing and model selection this chapter mainly includes data cleaning and feature selection operations specifically the data are deleted non construction points or abnormal points and normalized and smoothed and the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is used to select features and reduce the data dimension the technical framework of the article is shown in fig 3 3 1 data cleaning this paper first conducts a preliminary analysis of the construction data which are the construction data from the chang lion 10 cutter suction dredger in block 3 of lianyungang port jiangsu province china on june 23 2018 the construction data include 29 160 data sets rows with 239 dimensions columns from 8 27 15 25 bjt on the studied day in this case study 80 of the data is randomly selected as the training set which is used to train the machine learning model and the rest 20 of the data is utilized as the testing set which is utilized as the evaluation for the model performance because if the productivity values are 0 the dredger has not started the excavation construction so all rows with productivity values of 0 are deleted the monitoring data structure of chang lion 10 is shown in table 1 since the features in the data set have different dimensions and orders of magnitude and their levels vary greatly the role of features with high values in the comprehensive analysis will be highlighted and the role of features with low values will be relatively weakened if the original feature values are directly used for analysis kou et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to process the original feature data to ensure the reliability of the results 1 normalized vector x x x 2 euclidean ℓ 2 norm x 2 x 1 2 x 2 2 x m 2 after the normalization of the ℓ 2 norm the characteristic data for each dimension are distributed on a hypersphere with radius 1 which eliminates the influence of data units on the prediction results wu et al 2019b the processing diagram is shown in fig 4 for the linear model the target value of the normal distribution is required to play the maximum role so the target value is log transformed and the other characteristic data are smoothed by the least square method to approach a normal distribution wood et al 2017 lai et al 2013 3 2 feature selection in the current calculation of dredging construction output productivity target m 3 h was obtained by the product of mud volume concentration f21 and mud flow f20 m 3 h 2 p c q where p productivity m 3 h c mud volume concentration q mud flow m 3 h because there was a direct mathematical conversion relationship between the flow and the flow velocities f165 m s the flow velocities be calculated by the flow in the actual construction of the cutter suction dredger 3 q v a where v the flow velocities m s a pipeline cross sectional area m 2 similarly the soil density f23 kg m 3 water density f22 kg m 3 mud density f164 kg m 3 and mud concentration of the cutter suction dredger have a direct mathematical conversion relationship in actual construction the mud density was obtained from mud concentration 4 c ρ m u d ρ w a t e r ρ s o i l ρ w a t e r 5 p ρ m u d ρ w a t e r ρ s o i l ρ w a t e r v a where ρ m u d mud density kg m 3 ρ w a t e r water density kg m 3 ρ s o i l soil density kg m 3 therefore these feature data need to be manually deleted to prevent the final prediction result from being affected before feature selection to study the correlations of the data distributions of the f21 f164 f20 f165 and target in detail psionic comparative analysis was performed as shown in fig 5 the figures a and b showed that the mud concentration and density were linearly related to productivity respectively and figure c also showed strongly linear correlation between the mud concentration and density it could be seen from figures d and e that the flow and flow velocities had no obvious rules with productivity but from figure f showed that the flow and flow velocities were directly proportional the spearman s rank correlation coefficient method with non parametric properties was introduced to select the features with strong relevance to the target list and remove the irrelevant features croux and dehon 2010 the process can be expressed by 6 ρ i 1 n r i r s i s i 1 n r i r i 1 n s i s 2 where r i and s i influence the order rank of the positions of samples r and s are the mean values of the previous parameters and n is the sample number ρ is the correlation coefficient between different characteristics and ρ 1 1 in this case 1 indicates that there is a complete positive linear correlation between the two characteristics and 1 means that there is a complete negative linear correlation between the two characteristics additionally the greater the ρ value is the higher the similarity between the two signals and vice versa according to bai bai et al 2019 selecting about 9 feature vectors could take into account the prediction speed and prediction accuracy at the same time so we selected the feature vectors whose absolute value of correlation coefficients with productivity is exceeding 0 1 overall 10 features vectors were selected as shown in fig 6 the numbers shown in the boxes in the figure are the correlation coefficients with horizontal and vertical coordinates red colours denote a positive correlation and the darker the colour is the greater the positive correlation degree blue colours denote a negative correlation and the darker the colour is the greater the negative correlation degree the location distribution of the selected feature vectors on the dredger are presented in fig 7 4 model application and ensemble in this paper five representative models are selected through comparative analysis to predict the data on this basis two model ensemble methods are proposed and applied to productivity forecasting and good results are obtained 4 1 model application 4 1 1 least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso the lasso method is a compression estimation duan et al 2016 the basic objective is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals under the constraint that the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients is less than a constant to produce some regression coefficients that are strictly equal to 0 and obtain an explainable model this approach is characterized by variable selection and complexity regularization while fitting a generalized linear model therefore lasso regression can be used to model and predict whether the dependent variable is continuous binary or multivariate discrete lasso adds the ℓ 1 penalty term in the ordinary linear model and the objective function of lasso estimation for the ordinary linear model is 7 β l asso min β 1 2 n i 1 n β t x i y i 2 λ j 1 m β where β is the coefficient of the independent variable n is the number of samples and m is the number of characteristics 4 1 2 elastic net enet elastic net enet is a linear regression model that uses the ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 norms in a priori regularization training hastie 2005 the sparse solution of lasso is easy to produce and some regular properties of ridge regression are also considered when selecting variables irrelevant variables are eliminated which solves the problem that the lasso method produces multiple solutions when the correlation between variables is large this approach performs well in dealing with the problem that multiple features are related to other features the objective function of enet is 8 β ˆ e l a s t i c n e t min β 1 2 n i 1 n β t x i y i 2 λ j 1 m β 2 λ j 1 m β 2 the formula shows that the penalty function of the projectile network is an exact convex linear combination of the ridge regression penalty function and the lasso penalty function therefore enet regression combines the advantages of lasso regression and ridge regression which not only achieves variable selection but also provides a good group effect 4 1 3 gradient boosting decision tree gbdt gbdt is a decision tree method used to achieve boosting friedman 2001 the main concept is that every model is constructed in the gradient descent direction of the loss function of the models built prior the current model the core objective is to use the negative gradient of the loss function as the current model value 9 r m i l y f x i f x i f x f m 1 x training set data t x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n x i χ r n y i ϒ r loss function l y f x the main advantages of bdt are as follows ① this approach can flexibly deal with various types of data including continuous values and discrete values ② some robust loss functions can be used which are very robust for outliers such as the huber loss function and quantile loss function and ③ with relatively few adjustment parameters the accuracy is high 4 1 4 extreme gradient boosting xgboost xgboost is essentially an improvement to the gbdt algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 the core objective is to add new trees and fit pseudo residuals to reduce the loss function the second order taylor expansion of the loss function during the fitting process enables leaf splitting optimization calculations based on the input data without selecting the specific form of the loss function this de coupling approach increases the applicability of xgboost in addition the regularization terms ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 are added to xgboost to control the complexity of the model which is conducive to preventing overfitting and improving the generalization ability of the model the objective function of xgboost consists of two parts the first part is the loss function in the gradient lifting algorithm and the second part is the regularization term the loss function is defined as 10 l φ i n l y i y ˆ i k ω f k where n is the sample number of the training function l is the loss of a single sample and ω is the regularization term which defines the complexity of the model 11 ω f γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 where γ and λ are manually set parameters ω is the vector formed by the values of all leaf nodes in the decision tree and t is the number of leaf nodes 4 1 5 lightgbm lgb lightgbm uses the histogram algorithm which divides the continuous floating point features into k discrete values and a histogram with a width of k is constructed to display the cumulative statistics for each discrete value in the training data set ma et al 2018 this approach has the prominent advantages of low memory consumption and low complexity in data separation because only the discrete value of the histogram is needed to find the optimal segmentation point in feature selection in addition lightgbm is optimized on the basis of the histogram algorithm and a leafwise algorithm with a depth limitation is used level wise data can split the leaves of the same layer at the same time which is ideal for multithread optimization and mitigates overfitting 4 2 model ensemble in this paper two ensemble processes involving five models are implemented to achieve high computational accuracy in the first method the predicted values of the model are weighted averages to increase the overall accuracy the second method involves dividing all the algorithm models into two layers the main idea is that after learning several basic features from the initial training data the prediction results are used as a new training set for additional learning 4 2 1 model average ma a weighted average ensemble of the above five models namely lasso enet gbdt xgboost and lightgbm was created to form a new combined model the weights were determined according to the root mean square error values based on cross validation as shown in table 2 in the practical application of the model the predicted values of several models are output after the weighted averages to obtain the predicted average value 4 2 2 model stacked generalization msg stacking is a hierarchical model integration framework healey et al 2018 naimi and balzer 2018 which combine different models together to produce a meta model with equal or better predictive performance than the constituent parts there are two kinds of models in a stacked generalization framework several base models xgboost lightgbm and gbdt in this study and one meta model lasso in this study given training data set d x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x m y m where y m is the target value and x m represents the feature vectors of the mth instance randomly split the data into k almost equal folds d 1 d 2 d k k 5 in this study define d j and d j d d j to be the validation and training sets for the jth fold of k fold cross validation given t different base model h t j which is trained by d j and predicts each x i in d j let z i t h t j x i donate the prediction of the base model on x i then we have z i z i 1 z i 2 z i t and the target value was y i at the end of the entire cross validation of each base models the data assembled from the outputs of the base models are d z i y i i 1 m which is training set of meta model the stacked generalization framework is shown in fig 8 4 3 multi model prediction and comparison 4 3 1 model parameters first the training data set is partitioned by five fold cross validation and the shuffle method is used to ensure the randomness of data cutting second a grid search is adopted for each model and the optimal super parameters of each model are selected the grid search is an exhaustive search in which the best performing parameters are selected and output as the final result by iteratively considering each possibility in the selection of all candidate parameters table 3 shows the main parameters of each model the parameter α in lasso represents the regular term coefficient of ℓ 1 the parameters α a b and ℓ 1 ratio a a b in enet and a and b represent the regularization coefficients of ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 respectively the parameters eta n estimators and max depth in xgboost and gbdt represent the length of each iteration the maximum number of decision trees and the maximum depth of a decision tree respectively the parameters eta n estimators max bin and num leaves represent the length of each iteration the maximum number of decision trees the maximum number of barrels to hold a value and the number of leaf nodes used to control the complexity of the tree model respectively 4 3 2 evaluation indices to quantitatively compare the prediction accuracy of each model three evaluation indices including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r 2 are introduced the time index is the cpu time s required to implement each algorithm 1 root mean square error rmse 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 2 mean absolute error mae 13 m a e 1 n i 1 n y ˆ i y i 3 goodness of fit r 2 14 r 2 1 i 1 n y ˆ i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 the mae can reveal the difference between predicted and real values the smaller the mae value is the higher the prediction accuracy rmse mainly measures the deviation between a predicted value and the real value which can reflect the accuracy of the prediction the smaller the rmse value is the higher the prediction accuracy however when a particularly large outlier appears in the data set the rmse cannot effectively reflect the real difference in the data the above two evaluation indexes can only evaluate results with the same dimension and it is difficult to evaluate values when the dimensions are different however r 2 can effectively reflect the differences between different models and r 2 0 1 the closer the r 2 score is to 1 the better the goodness of fit of the model the prediction results for seven algorithms based on productivity were compared with the productivity data from the corresponding test set to obtain the scores of each evaluation index as shown in table 4 according to table 4 the goodness of fit r 2 value of msg is 0 9281 which is the smallest value among all rmse and mae values however the maximum computational time was 131 166 s which was the longest of all the methods compared with the r 2 value of article bai et al 2019 which is 0 75 this paper has great optimization in accuracy msg is suitable for scenarios requiring high accuracy that are not limited by the calculation time although the accuracy of xgboost is not as good as that of msg the goodness of fit is as high as 0 9064 and the calculation time is only 6 273 s the computational speed of enet lasso and lightgbm was excellent but the computational accuracy was not as good as that of msg or xgboost the gbdt calculation accuracy was also good but the calculation speed was slow thus no single model had a clear advantage based on the calculation accuracy and speed to intuitively show the deviation degree of the predicted values from the target values for the seven algorithms and to determine the absolute error between the predicted values and the true values of the test set the absolute errors of the seven algorithm models are shown in fig 9 fig 15 15 absolute error e x x ˆ x x ˆ is the predicted value and x is the true value in this case study to analyse the importance of the selected feature vectors to the predicted target value the features were ranked in importance using the trained xgboost model which is presented in fig 16 from fig 16 it can be seen that f199 1 main pump discharge pressure f200 2 main pump discharge pressure and f201 vacuum of underwater dredger pump have higher importance scores compared with other feature vectors which also indicates that these three features have greater influence on the prediction of target value the importance scores of the remaining features were almost equivalent except that the importance scores of f100 were relatively low which indicated that the influences of these six features on target prediction were similarly in summary the msg and xgboost algorithms should be applied to dredger hourly productivity prediction in scenarios in which the mud concentration meter fails these algorithms are recommended for the following reasons 1 in the actual construction process the productivity tends to be calculated in real time with information from the mud concentration meter to assist operation personnel in monitoring mining conditions mud concentration meter damage will seriously affect the operation of a dredge and personnel decisions therefore since production monitoring must resume as quickly as possible the selection of algorithms must guarantee a certain level of accuracy and a fast operation speed the xgboost algorithm is recommended in such a case 2 in some common construction areas if there is a failure caused by mud concentration meters that cannot calculate productivity experienced operators can still rely on experience to perform operations for a given period of time in this case the computation time requirement is not strict but the accuracy of the algorithm prediction must be high so the msg algorithm is recommended 5 conclusions this paper mainly focuses on the problems that exist in the dredging industry such as the low precision of dredger productivity prediction and the extreme dependence of dredger productivity prediction on mud concentration data the machine learning algorithm is used to mine and analyse 29 160 sets of 239 dimensional construction data from the chang lion 10 cutter suction dredger in block 3 of lianyungang port jiangsu province china on june 23 2018 the specific steps are as follows 1 first feature cleaning and extraction were performed for the data and feature columns were reduced as much as possible on the basis of ensuring a full description of the target column to achieve feature dimensionality reduction additionally spearman s rank correlation coefficient method was used to analyse the feature categories that influenced productivity prediction 2 according to the problem to be solved the appropriate algorithm model was selected and the hyper parameters of each model were determined by grid search and verification processes the model evaluation criteria rmse mae and r 2 are introduced to evaluate and compare the algorithm models and to calculate the operation time of each model 3 according to the scores of each model based on the evaluation criteria the method was optimized by using a model ensemble mainly model averaging and stacking generalization methods were used the model averaging method uses a weighted average of the predicted values of the five selected algorithms based on their r 2 scores and then outputs the predicted values the model stacking generalization method uses gbdt lightgbm and xgboost as the base models of the first layer and lasso as the second layer meta model 4 based on the comprehensive evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each model and the actual construction situation of the dredger the xgboost model and msg model are recommended to be applied for productivity prediction on actual dredgers under different conditions by using a machine learning algorithm to mine and analyse the historical dredger data the modelling of the production process can be omitted compared with the present prediction method based on a semi empirical formula the proposed approach has great advantages first based on machine learning the productivity prediction accuracy is high second if slurry concentration meter damage were to occur or there was a lack of concentration data the current forecasting system would not be able to obtain productivity predictions however the proposed productivity prediction method based on machine learning can solve this problem at present ordinary data mining algorithms have been widely used in production practice in the field of dredging many scholars also used data mining methods to predict the productivity of dredgers however with the development of technology the accuracy of the algorithm itself is getting higher and higher the use of stacking generalization models can greatly improve the prediction accuracy of data mining algorithms for targets but this method has not been applied in the field of dredging the application of this paper proves that the prospect of this method is very broad if it is widely used in the prediction of dredging ship productivity it will greatly improve the current dredging construction efficiency and have a revolutionary impact on the industry after solving the problem of productivity prediction determining how to accurately predict each operation in near real time according to the construction requirements and objectives will be particularly prominent and solving this problem will be the focus of future work credit author statement bin wang software writing original draft preparation shi

excitation frequency the porosity and permeability values of the bottom layer on the sloshing dynamics were analyzed with prominent results being reported smaller porosity ratios and permeability values of the porous bottom layer were found to offer an increased wave damping capability with dynamic pressure impact mitigating achieved from the porous material being attached on tank walls keywords interfacial sloshing wave porous bottom layer porosity ratio numerical simulation 1 introduction sloshing is the relative motion of a fluid within a partially filled tank undergoing a disturbance it is a phenomenon which is synonymous to various fields of study ranging from ocean engineering vibration control and the dynamic safety of structures its importance thus encompasses a wide range of applications in a number of sectors in ocean engineering sloshing behavior in partially filled tanks of vessels carrying a liquid cargo such as lng or petroleum is of importance to safe seakeeping sloshing loads on the tank walls can create damages to the structure and in extreme cases compound overturning moments that might affect the stability of the vessel at sea methods of reducing the impact of sloshing are increasingly becoming of interest for research xue and lin 2011 xue et al 2017 2019 yu et al 2020 porous materials or perforated structures may create complex flow phenomena such as jet flows through porous bodies nonlinear wave breaking and runups on sidewalls xue et al 2013 these phenomena are hard to study using experimental means hence the need for cfd modeling is important in such cases kuriakose 2014 in her study aimed at checking the structural stability of an lng tanker with different lng fills the study modeled a moss spherical lng tank and did studies on the critical slosh frequency effect on the dynamic stability of the tank sloshing effects on excited tanks containing liquids have been extensively studied experimentally and various experiments have been able to increase our understanding on the behaviour of a sloshing fluid brar and singh 2014 did an experimental and cfd study of sloshing in a tanker their study used an elliptical tank with various baffle configurations and focused mostly on fluid structure interaction and the optimal baffle configurations in mitigating hydrodynamic pressures exerted on the tank ahn et al 2012 studied the effect of density ratio of liquid and gas in sloshing experiment their experiment contained a liquid and a gas in a completely sealed tank to prevent gas loss their experiment showed that the sloshing impact varies as the density ratio is changed kim et al 2014 did comparative study on pressure sensors for sloshing experiment they used different types of pressure sensors such as a piezoresistive sensor piezoelectric sensor and integrated circuit piezoelectric sensor the comparative studies included the sensitivity of the sensor under various temperature conditions as well as for various test medium and presented their results statistically song and chang 2013 did an experimental study on ﬂow kinematics and impact pressure in liquid sloshing their studies main aim was to quantify the flow velocity and impact pressure the use of floating foams in mitigating sloshing in a rectangular liquid tank was investigated by zhang et al 2019 their experimental work showed that even a single layer of foam was effective in reducing sloshing due to energy dissipation ning et al 2019 in their experiment on using floating layers of foam for slosh mitigation showed that wave breaking in a rectangular tank can be suppressed by solid foam elements the porous medium is of interest to this study as its potential use in reducing sloshing and its effect on the interfacial wave evolution is an important investigation point of this research various studies have been done on porous materials being used for water filtration and purification purposes sri and na im 2019 the knowledge of the behaviour and interaction of the porous material can give a better understanding into how it could be potentially used as part of a slosh damping mechanism kartini and zahir 2019

and brinkman equations govern the flow inside and outside the porous medium respectively their model proved to be able to capture the interaction between fluid flow and porous media hibi and tomigashi 2015 studied numerical flow of a multiphase fluid flow over a porous domain this study coupled the navier stokes equation for flow in the fluid region with darcy s equation for flow in the porous region their method proved very efficient when comparing their results to experimental results previous studies have done well in improving the understanding of the fluid dynamics of a sloshing liquid it s interaction with structures and slosh damping via mostly non porous structures this study intends to broaden on this knowledge by studying the interaction of a sloshing fluid with a porous structure it further studies the multiphase behaviour of a layered fluid interacting with a porous structure in this study a coupling numerical model was developed to study interaction of the interfacial and free surface sloshing wave with a porous bottom layer in a partially filled rectangular tank in the present model the incompressible navier stokes equation and the brinkman s equation were employed to govern the fluid flow region and porous material layer region the effect of the excitation frequency the porosity and permeability values of the bottom layer on the sloshing dynamics were analyzed with prominent results being reported 2 mathematical model and numerical method 2 1 governing equation 2 1 1 fluid domain the fluid domain is governed by the incompressible navier stokes

activity of a species is described by its mole fraction and given by x i the expression can be written as 9 f i r t 1 x i x i z i f the friction of a mole of i is proportional to the difference in mass velocity between i and each species j in the mixture as well as the friction coefficient between i and j 10 f f r i c i j i ζ i j x j u r i u r j the friction coefficient is given by ζ i j for friction between species i and j with the mass species velocity been given by u r i with the driving forces been set to balance the friction forces acting on the species i and using a molar flux to eliminate u r i u r j and adding the convective term that is caused by the movement of the entire mixture the resulting fluxes are then used in the mass conservation equations the continuity equation for the mixture is then derived from the sum of all the mass fluxes and convective term as 11 t i m i c i i m i n i i m i r i 0 p pu 0 where n i and c i are the molar flux and total concentration of species i relative to the fixed coordinate system the conservation of mass of an individual chemical reaction ensures that the last term is equal to zero 2 2 numerical method in this study a famous comsol code based on the finite element method fem was employed to study the interaction of interfacial waves and porous bottom layer in a partially filled rectangular tank the fluid interface

enforced explicitly on the fem functions with appropriate selection of the function space the zero normal stress boundary condition on γ n is implicitly enforced through the variational form p1 p1 discretization which apply separate discretization for the velocity and pressure is done using the continuous piecewise linear elements for both variables further details on the comsol solver equations can be obtained from xue et al 2020 and the comsol users guide 2018 2 3 boundary conditions the model consists of solid walls and a free surface the wall boundary for the navier stokes equation is 19 u n 0 where n n x n y t is the boundary normal equation 19 is applied to the walls which are modeled with slip boundary condition the normal vector is dependent on the degrees of freedom of the moving mesh hence weak constraints are used to remedy constraining forces on the fluid equations and mesh weak constraints are used to enforce the slip boundary condition without a constraint force acting on the moving mesh equations 20 boundary weak constraints expression λ ˆ u n λ u ˆ n for some lagrange multiplier variable λ where λ ˆ and u ˆ denote test functions the fluid is free to move in the top boundary neglecting the stress in the surrounding environment the stress continuity equation on the free surface is given by 21 p i μ u t n p 0 n where p 0 is the surrounding constant pressure and μ is the viscosity of the fluid without loss of generality p 0 0 for this model 2 3 1 boundary condition for mesh to follow the fluid motion in relation to the mesh motion it is conventional in most cases to couple the mesh motion to the fluid motion normal to the surface the coupling is not done in the tangential direction as it will soon lead the solution to non convergence due to excessive deformation of the mesh the boundary condition for the mesh on the free surface is thus given by 22 x t y t t n u n where n is the boundary normal to x t y t t the velocity mesh for this boundary condition with the weak constraints activated the moving mesh interface adds the weak expression 23 mesh weak constraints expression λ ˆ x t y t t u n λ x ˆ y ˆ t n this is added to ensure that there are no constraint forces acting on the fluid equations the moving mesh is not constrained in the tangential direction on the side wall at the side to enable it to follow the motion of the fluid here again λ denotes some lagrange multiplier variable not the same as before and x ˆ y ˆ and λ ˆ denote test functions 2 4 surface tracking method 2 4 1 free surface tracking the free surface boundaries of the computational domain are moving and deformed with time as a result of the motion and physical parameters of the computational domain the motion of this free surface is tracked by a deformed moving mesh which moves in conformity with the deformation computation domain with a new mesh being generated for each configuration of the boundaries this technique of movement which is also referred to as the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is used to track the free surface of this model consider a mesh at time t n the velocity field is computed for the time t n 1 on this same mesh the new free surface is then computed with the lagrangian formula 24 x n 1 x n u t the partial differential equation governing the displacement field of the mesh is given by 25 d i v σ 0 the cauchy stress tensor is σ the mass of the fluid is considered in the domain and as such the mesh is considered as incompressible we consider a linear elasticity model given by the constitutive relation 26 σ c ε the constitutive matrix c is element dependent the constitutive matrix elements are also inversely proportional to the element size in order to solve the mesh equation eq 24 for free surface boundary conditions it is assumed that no fluid particle can cross the free surface this condition is expressed by setting the normal mesh velocity at the free surface equal to the normal fluid velocity 27 v v m e s h n 0 the fluid velocity is given by v is and n is the unit normal vector 2 4 2 interfacial surface tracking method the same principle based used to track the free surface based on the ale method described in sec 2 4 1 is also employed to track the interfacial surface 3 model verification and validation 3 1 mesh convergence analysis the model was developed with three different mesh parameters as described and labeled in table 1 as coarse normal and fine the tank setup for this case is as shown in fig 1 and the tank motion is given by 28 x t a c o s ω t where a 0 01m and ω 7 57rad s are the excitation amplitude and frequency respectively the normal mesh was compared to the coarse and fine mesh with the results as shown in fig 2 from the results it is seen that the coarse mesh has a larger result divergence from the normal mesh the normal mesh however has only a mild divergence form the fine mesh with results being very similar for saving computational time the normal mesh was used in this study 3 2 layered sloshing in a rectangular tank the layered fluid component of the model is validated by comparing the model results with experimental results from xue and zheng 2013 the setup of layered sloshing experiments is as shown in fig 1 the tank had a length of l 0 57m and density ρ 1 846 2 k g m 3 and ρ 2 1000 k g m 3 the height of the layers of fluid of density ρ 1 and ρ 2 is h ρ 1 0 05 m and h ρ 2 0 1 m respectively the motion of the tank is given by equation 28 where the excitation amplitude and frequency are given by a 0 01m and ω 7 57rad s the comparative results are as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 which depict the free surface time elevation and snapshots respectively contrasting the experimental results of xue and zheng 2013 against present numerical results a good agreement is seen between both results 3 3 porous medium flow the effectiveness of the implementation of darcy s law in this model for flow through a porous medium was ascertained by comparing the modeling procedure used with a benchmark case developed by elder 1967 on his study on transient convection in a porous media which is referred to as the elder problem voss and souza 1987 developed the problem as a variable density ground water problem in which fluid density is a function of salt concentration their developed case will be considered for comparison the setup consists of a concentrated fluid sipping through a porous subsurface the modeling results from the present model are compared with the results from elder problem as is shown in fig 5 and the variable density flow code sutra voss and souza 1987 as well as the seawat model developed by the us geological survey guo and langevin 2002 from the results and comparison in fig 5 it is seen that the implementation of porous flow is satisfactory in this present model 3 4 sloshing in a tank with porous baffle in order to compare the model with experimental data from kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 the porosity value ϕ which ranges from 0 to 1 is used for a case with a solid baffle the porosity ϕ 0 which means that a completely solid baffle exists with 0 pores for modeling a case without an internal baffle the porosity value of the baffle ϕ 1 which means that the baffle is 100 porous and as such there is no solid baffle and the model is reduced to a case for sloshing without baffles the permeability value in the model is set to create a constant high permeability so that only the porosity value ϕ which ranges from 0 to 1 affects the model s porosity and fluid conductivity these adjustments enabled the model to be compared with the parameters used in the experiment of kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 with tank setup with a horizontal baffle as shown in fig 6 the tank motion is as given by u u 0 cos ω t with the amplitude and frequency being 0 001 m s2 and 0 8872hz respectively fig 7 shows the comparison between results from fig 7 and present numerical results for various porosity ratios and fig 8 for various percentage porosity for the horizontal baffle it is seen in both cases that the numerical results compared well with the results from kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 4 non layered sloshing over a porous bottom in this section sloshing over porous bottom was simulated for a non layered fluid an over a large amplitude excitation of 0 01m and a frequency range varying from 2 3hz to 7 58hz the porosity and permeability of the bottom used in this study were ϕ 0 4 and permeability k 1e 7m2 respectively 4 1 model setup the tank setup consists of a rectangular tank with a porous bottom as shown in fig 9 the tank consists of a length l 0 57m with a porous bottom of height h0 0 005m and fluid height of h the wall boundary conditions of the tank consist of no slip walls the boundary between the porous layer and the fluid consists of a permeable boundary layer enabling interaction between the porous layer and the fluid the porous layer is saturated with fluid 1 prior to the commencement of the simulations 4 2 maximum wave height for various frequencies over porous bottom of varying fill levels over a 0 05m bottom sloshing cases were run for the tank setup described in fig 9 which consists of a rectangular tank with a porous domain attached to the bottom wall of the tank the tank walls were all impermeable frequency analysis was done for sloshing over a porous bottom with tank setup as shown in fig 9 four fill levels of a h 0 1m b h 0 05m c h 0 025m and d h 0 015m were considered for all fill levels it was observed that the free surface wave maximum values significantly exceeded the corresponding maximum internal wave values for the same fill level as is seen in fig 10 in fig 10 a and b after this peak value for further frequency ranges a lower peak wave height value is observed this is because for fill levels of a and b the frequency range in the study exceeds the resonance frequency values for such fill levels and thus a descending maximum wave height is observed until it reaches the peak or resonance frequency from which descending maximum peak wave height values are obtained in fig 10 c and d it is observed that at these fill levels the frequency range covered does not exceeded the peak frequency we thus see a constant increase in the maximum peak wave height as we progress higher on the frequency axis it was also observed that the maximum peak wave values for c and d were considerably smaller as compared to fill levels for a and b with d recording the least peak wave values 4 3 free surface wave time series and spectral analysis for various tanks fill levels free surface wave time series studies were conducted using excitation amplitude a 0 01m and three different excitation frequencies of 3 5rad s 5 38rad s and 7 57 rad s the study was carried out over a porous bottom with tank setup as described in fig 9 with four different tank fill levels of h 0 1m h 0 05m h 0 025m and h 0 015m the effect of the fill levels was compared for the various excitation frequencies considered the corresponding spectral analysis was also studied from the free surface time series plots of fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 it is observed that at the excitation frequency has an effect on the maximum free surface wave height with respect to the filling level in fig 11 a that the wave time series of h 0 1m had higher displacement form the steady free surface at the initial 2 s of the simulation compared to that of the other fill levels after which the wave time series of h 0 05m had higher upward displacement from the steady free surface in fig 12 it however is observed that at an excitation frequency of 5 38rad s for a fill level of h 0 1m had a significantly higher free surface displacement from the steady free surface in comparison to fill levels of h 0 05 h 0 025 and h 0 015m this could be attributed to the fact that at a fill level of h 0 1m the excitation frequency of 5 38rad s is closest to the natural frequency of the tank setup and fill level as the frequency is changed to 7 57rad s as is the case seen in fig 13 the free surface displacement for all fill levels is markedly lower in comparison to fig 12 it also is seen that at h 0 1m the free surface elevation is not extremely higher than for h 0 05 h 0 025 and h 0 015 as was the case observed in fig 11 when considering the fast fourier transforms fft for the various wave time series in figs 11 figs 12 and 13 it is observed that at the same excitation frequency the peak frequency from the fft values are similar irrespective of the filling level 4 4 velocity profile and flow pattern of the fluid and porous bottom interaction velocity profile screenshots were taken to show the distribution of the velocity field and the flow direction pattern from the screenshots interesting velocity patterns are observed near the bottom of the tank close to the porous bottom the porous bottom is seen to interact with the fluid by creating some turbulence and high velocity field pattern one reason could be that as the fluid sloshes fluid particles enter and exit the pores and due to the tiny volume of the pores as the fluid moves from a larger volume to a smaller volume and vice versa there is an increase and decrease in the flow velocity respectively which may be due to the volume of the pores the effect of the porous bottom thus creates an interesting flow patter which can be seen more so in fig 14 at screenshots for t 5 34s t 10 75s and t 25 57s at these time frames two distinct high velocity fields can be seen with one closer to the free surface and another one closer to the porous bottom vortex flow can be clearly seen at t 13 26s and t 25 57s in the porous layer domain it is observed that the flow velocity is very small as can be seen in fig 14 5 layered sloshing interaction with porous bottom 5 1 tank setup the tank setup consists of a rectangular tank of length l 0 57m with a porous bottom of height h0 0 015m and two layers of immiscible fluids labeled fluid 1 and fluid 2 of height h1 and h2 respectively as shown in fig 15 the wall boundary conditions of the tank consist of no slip walls the boundary between the porous layer and fluid 1 consists of a permeable wall enabling interaction between the porous layer and the fluid the porous layer is saturated with fluid 1 prior to the commencement of the simulations fluid 1 and fluid 2 are separated by a layer interface as shown in fig 15 which creates interfacial wave propagation between the two fluid layers during sloshing motion since the porous layer and fluid layer 2 are separated by fluid 1 their interaction is dependent on fluid 1 serving as an intermediary and thus the effect of fluid 1 as an interaction translator body will also be of keen interest during the analysis 5 2 maximum wave height for various frequencies over a layered porous bottom of varying inner layer fill levels over a 0 05m bottom in these analyses the tank setup described in fig 15 is considered the height of the porous bottom h0 is given as 0 015m the total fluid height of the tank above the porous bottom is given by h1 h2 0 15m three cases of analysis are considered with h1 0 1m h1 0 05 and h1 0 015m to observe the effect of the inner layer height and its interaction with the porous bottom layer on the interfacial wave free surface wave and dynamic fluid pressure on the tank wall over a frequency range the results are as shown in fig 16 and fig 17 in fig 16 a where h1 0 1m and h2 0 05m maximum free surface as well as interfacial height were observed for excitation frequency of 5 38rad s amongst the selected frequency values considered this may be due to the fact that this excitation frequency is closest to the natural frequency of the setup it is observed that the maximum wave height kept increasing as the excitation frequency increased until a descent of maximum values is observed once it exceeded 5 38rad s this is also the case seen in fig 16 b which gives the maximum dynamic pressure values for the studied frequency range for pressure gauge p1 and p2 with values of 253 pa and 170 4 pa however in fig 17 the fill levels are inversed in comparison to fig 16 with the values now being h1 0 05m and h2 0 1m in fig 17 a the curve maximum values for the free surface are similar to fig 16 a where as for the interfacial wave values of fig 16 a it is seen that the maximum displacement of the interfacial layer is lower in comparison to that seen for the interfacial wave values of fig 17 a in fig 17 b the maximum dynamic pressure impact is observed at a frequency of 4 28 rad s for pressure gauge p1 and at a frequency of 3 5rad s for p2 with pressure values of 101 pa and 36 6 pa respectively 5 3 effect of bottom porosity ratio and permeability value on interfacial and free surface wave permeability analysis were done for a permeability of k of the porous bottom ranging from 1e 1 to 1e 12 for thank setup shown in fig 2 fig 19 is a chart which shows permeability range for materials and specifies whether they fall under pervious semi pervious and impervious the porous bottom layer height was h0 0 015 the interfacial layer height h1 0 05m and the upper layer h2 0 02m with results as plotted in fig 18 the maximum values of the interfacial and free surface waves represented by η 1 max and η 2 max respectively in fig 18 a it is seen that for porosity ratio of ϕ 0 1 the maximum values of the interfacial and free surface waves plotted against permeability values are lowest in comparison to those of ϕ 0 4 ϕ 0 7 and ϕ 0 9 of fig 18 b c and d respectively the maximum wave values decrease as the permeability decreased for all values of porosity ratios studies as is seen in fig 18 a b c and d which represented porosity ratios of ϕ 0 1 ϕ 0 4 ϕ 0 7 and ϕ 0 9 respectively it is also observed for all porosity ratios that the maximum wave keeps decreasing till the permeability value reaches 1e 6 after which no significant change in the maximum wave height for both the free surface and interfacial wave is observed as is seen in fig 18 the maximum free surface an interfacial wave height is recorded at the lowest permeability value for all porosity ratio cases considered the porosity ratio as well as the permeability values is observed to affect the maximum wave height of both the free surface and interfacial wave i can be seen that at porosity ratio of ϕ 0 4 higher maximum wave values are observed especially for the free surface wave in comparison to the other porosity ratio values this effect could be due to the fact that the porosity creates voids which may slightly alter the total volume of fluid in the tank setup as the voids house an amount fluid in relation to the porosity ratio this in turn could have an effect on the natural frequency of the setup which will be affected by the alteration in the volume of fluid the porosity also inhibits the ease of motion of the fluid within the pores as the tank sloshes thus the impact of the fluid in the pores on sloshing and wave height will be dependent on the ease or difficulty at which it flows through the pores which is dependent on the porosity value 5 4 free surface and interfacial wave time series plot free surface and interfacial wave time series plots were generated for layered sloshing over a porous bottom with the corresponding power spectral analysis and compared to layered sloshing without a permeable bottom the setup of the tank is as given by fig 15 the fill level cases considered were fluid layer heights of h1 0 1m and h2 0 05m shown in fig 20 and the inverse to this of fluid layer heights of h1 0 05m and h2 0 1m as shown in fig 21 it was desired to see the effect of inverse layer fill levels on the tank setup while maintaining the same total fill level in fig 20 a it is observed that for the case with a porous bottom the interfacial wave displacement is less than or nearly only half the interfacial wave displacement for the case without a porous bottom as displayed in fig 20 b on the other hand the free surface wave for both cases with and without a porous bottom showed only slight or no distinct variations this same characteristic is also observed in fig 21 this showed that the porous bottom had a greater effect on the displacement of the interfacial wave when compared to its effect on the free surface wave displacement 5 5 velocity profile and flow pattern of the fluid and porous bottom interaction screen shots were taken of the layered sloshing over a porous bottom to observe the interaction of the various layers and velocity profile screen shots of the velocity profile and flow pattern are presented in fig 22 to show the interaction of the layers with the porous bottom and to observe possible effects of the porous bottom on the flow pattern the setup is as described by fig 15 the screen shots of fig 22 highlight an interesting velocity profile distribution there is a high velocity distribution in the fluid 1 region which emirates from a position close to the porous bottom in section 4 4 it was shown that the porous bottom had a greater impact or interaction with the interfacial layer by creating increases wave heights hence the screen shots also show that there is an interaction between the interfacial layer and the porous bottom which might create this higher velocity distribution in fluid 1 emanating close from the bottom as expected the flow velocity in the porous bottom is lower in comparisons to the regions of both layered fluids 6 sloshing control of layered fluid by use of a porous side wall buffer 6 1 tank setup a tank containing porous material paddings on its vertical walls by a porous buffer is setup as shown in fig 23 a wave probe is attached on the left tank wall to record interfacial and free surface wave displacement pressure sensors are placed along three sections of the porous wall buffer to measure the dynamic pressure exerted at different cross sections of the porous material as shown in fig 23 the tank is subjected to sloshing with an amplitude of 0 005m and an excitation frequency of 4 5rad s 6 2 effect of porous side wall buffer structure on dynamic pressure response dynamic pressure time series is recorded at pressure sensor along lines p1 p2 and p3 at sections a b and c along the porous material padding attached to the left tank wall as shown in fig 23 due to this setup pressure calculations along three sections a b and c are obtained for p1 p2 p3 and p4 described in fig 23 the pressure sensor recordings at p1 p2 p3 and p4 thus give pressure values recorded at p1a p1b and p1c for pressure sensor along line p1 where as they give p2a p2b and p2c for pressure sensor along line p2 and p3a p3b and p3c for pressure sensors along line p3 as well as for p4 at p4a p4b and p4c the recorded dynamic pressure values recorded at all pressure sensors are plotted in fig 24 the dynamic pressure plots in fig 24 show dynamic pressure time series at p1 p2 p3 and p4 along three section points of the porous material on the left tank wall from the recorded values it can be observed that slightly higher pressure values were recorded along sections a for all pressure probes meaning p1a p2a p3a and p4a recorded slightly higher pressure readings as compared to recordings along the c section that is p1c p2c p3c and p4c all recording lower values as can be seen in fig 24 this showed that the porous material used as a fluid motion buffer had an effect on slightly damping the dynamic pressure along the tank wall 6 3 effect of porous side wall buffer structure on wave time series interfacial and free surface wave time series are plotted for comparing cases with and without a porous layer wall their corresponding fft spectral analysis is also conducted to observe how the porous wall buffer affects the spectrum the plots are shown in fig 25 fig 26 fig 27 and fig 28 interfacial wave time series plots showed that the porous buffer padding on the tank walls had an effect on the interfacial and free surface wave this can be seen in the interfacial wave time series in figs 25 and 27 for sloshing at 4 5rad s and 6 5rad s respectively as well as in figs 26 and 28 which show the wave time series of the free surface for excitation frequencies of 4 5ra ds and 6 5rad s it is seen that the porous wall buffer reduced the sloshing wave displacement as there appears to be a higher wave displacement when the porous wall buffer layer for sloshing under the same conditions when the porous padding wall is absent from the setup this could be due to the fact that the porous wall buffer layer softens the impact of the fluid on the tank wall as it reduces the velocity of the fluid as it passes through this porous region this can be seen in the screen shots of the velocity profile in fig 29 the porous layer thus serves as a form of energy absorbing material that reduces the interfacial and free surface wave displacement as can be seen in the time series comparisons for tanks with and without a porous layer padded the power spectral analysis for interfacial and free surface wave show slight shift in peak frequency values for cases where a porous layer wall was used one such instance is in fig 25 which shows the spectral analysis for sloshing with and without a porous layer wall here it is seen that the case without a porous layer wall buffer the peak frequency was 7 12hz where as for the case without a porous layer wall the recorded frequency was 0 709hz this is a minimal difference but this trend is also observed in figs 26 figs 27 and 28 7 conclusion sloshing interaction between a permeable bottom and a single and layered fluid was modeled the porous bottom is seen to interact with the fluid by creating some turbulence and high velocity field patterns which may be associated to drag in the region of the fluid closest to the porous bottom it was observed that for higher porosity ratios of the bottom created an increase in the maximum interfacial and free surface wave values whereas at lower permeability values the bottom material it behaved like a non porous structure internal wave heights are more significantly affected by a porous bottom the effect of the porous bottom decreases with an increase in fill level of the tank the porous material also alters the natural frequency of the tank setup a lower porosity ratio ϕ of the porous bottom was observed to create lower interfacial and free surface wave displacements in the layered sloshing fluid maximum interfacial and free surface wave displacement was also observed to decrease with a decrease in permeability value k thus the effect of the porous material on damping sloshing waves was observed to be dependent on the porosity ratio and permeability value of the material the dynamic pressure damping of the porous material on the tank side walls was observed to be dependent on the position of the pressure sensor point along length the porous material with greatest dynamic pressure damping observed nearest to the tank wall credit authorship contribution

excitation frequency the porosity and permeability values of the bottom layer on the sloshing dynamics were analyzed with prominent results being reported smaller porosity ratios and permeability values of the porous bottom layer were found to offer an increased wave damping capability with dynamic pressure impact mitigating achieved from the porous material being attached on tank walls

disturbance it is a phenomenon which is synonymous to various fields of study ranging from ocean engineering vibration control and the dynamic safety of structures its importance thus encompasses a wide range of applications in a number of sectors in ocean engineering sloshing behavior in partially filled tanks of vessels carrying a liquid cargo such as lng or petroleum is of importance to safe seakeeping sloshing loads on the tank walls can create damages to the structure and in extreme cases compound overturning moments that might affect the stability of the vessel at sea methods of reducing the impact of sloshing are increasingly becoming of interest for research xue and lin 2011 xue et al 2017 2019 yu et al 2020 porous materials or perforated structures may create complex flow phenomena such as jet flows through porous bodies nonlinear wave breaking and runups on sidewalls xue et al 2013 these phenomena are hard to study using experimental means hence the need for cfd modeling is important in such cases kuriakose 2014 in her study aimed at checking the structural stability of an lng tanker with different lng fills the study modeled a moss spherical lng tank and did studies on the critical slosh frequency effect on the dynamic stability of the tank sloshing effects on excited tanks containing liquids have been extensively studied experimentally and various experiments have been able to increase our understanding on the behaviour of a sloshing fluid brar and singh 2014 did an experimental and cfd study of sloshing in a tanker their study used an elliptical tank with various baffle configurations and focused mostly on fluid structure interaction and the optimal baffle configurations in mitigating hydrodynamic pressures exerted on the tank ahn et al 2012 studied the effect of density ratio of liquid and gas in sloshing experiment their experiment contained a liquid and a gas in a completely sealed tank to prevent gas loss their experiment showed that the sloshing impact varies as the density ratio is changed kim et al 2014 did comparative study on pressure sensors for sloshing experiment they used different types of pressure sensors

well as for various test medium and presented their results statistically song and chang 2013 did an experimental study on ﬂow kinematics and impact pressure in liquid sloshing their studies main aim was to quantify the flow velocity and impact pressure the use of floating foams in mitigating sloshing in a rectangular liquid tank was investigated by zhang et al 2019 their experimental work showed that even a single layer of foam was effective in reducing sloshing due to energy dissipation ning et al 2019 in their experiment on using floating layers of foam for slosh mitigation showed that wave breaking in a rectangular tank can be suppressed by solid foam elements the porous medium is of interest to this study as its potential use in reducing sloshing and its effect on the interfacial wave evolution is an important investigation point of this research various studies have been done on porous materials being used for water filtration and purification purposes sri and na im 2019 the

parameters geometry and loading affected the deflection frequency curves on the nanoshells niordson and tvergaard 2019 studied size effects on porous metal a strain gradient plasticity theory with dissipative gradient effects is utilized to calculate size scale effect on void growth the interaction of multiphase fluids and porous materials is also a very important study area especially when it comes to the separation of fluids for various industrial as well as purification processes patel et al 2019 did studies on the effect of flow and fluid properties on the mobility of multiphase flow

peng et al 2017 studied free surface flow over a porous media with a variable porosity by using a multiphase sph method their model s effectiveness was proved by comparing results with other numerical and experimental data khayyer et al 2018 used an sph based method to develop a wave flume that has a porous media of varying porosity their study was compared to known benchmark tests for validation gui et al 2015 conducted studies using an incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph method to observe flow over and around a porous medium the accuracy of this model in modeling wave interaction with porous structures is then presented in their work pahar and dhar 2017 also did studies on numerical modeling of free surface flow over a porous media in their model the navier stokes and brinkman equations govern the flow inside and outside the porous medium respectively their model proved to be able to capture the interaction between fluid flow and porous media hibi and tomigashi 2015 studied numerical flow of a multiphase fluid flow over a porous domain this study coupled the navier stokes equation for flow in the fluid region with darcy s equation for flow in the porous region their method proved very efficient when comparing their results to experimental results previous studies have done well in improving the understanding of the fluid dynamics of a sloshing liquid it s interaction with structures and slosh damping via mostly non porous structures this study intends to broaden on this knowledge by studying the interaction of a sloshing fluid with a porous structure it further studies the multiphase behaviour of a layered fluid interacting with a porous structure in this study a coupling numerical model was developed to study interaction of the interfacial and free surface sloshing wave with a porous bottom layer in a partially filled rectangular tank in the present model the incompressible navier stokes equation and the brinkman s equation were employed to govern the fluid flow region and porous material layer region the effect of the excitation frequency the porosity and permeability values of the bottom layer on the sloshing dynamics were analyzed with prominent results being reported 2 mathematical model and numerical method 2 1 governing equation 2 1 1 fluid domain the fluid domain is governed by the incompressible navier stokes equation 1 ρ u t ρ u u p i μ u u t f 2 u 0 the velocity is represented by u the pressure given by p with the fluid density represented by ρ the dynamic viscosity and the body force are given by μ and f respectively with the diagonal matrix represented by i 2 1 2 porous domain the porous bottom layer domain is governed by the brinkman s equation which is an extension of darcy s law for situations of high velocity flow the momentum conservation equation in the brinkman model are given by 3 p i μ c 1 ε p u u t μ c k β f u q b r ε p 2 u f 0 4 p u q b r where i is the identity tensor and β f is

porosity reduce eq 3 to 6 p μ c k u μ ε p 2 u the left hand of eq 6 represents the pressure gradient and a constant viscosity is assumed in this equation a constant viscosity indicates that the simulation considers a constant or small temperature change to maintain the accuracy of the modelling results 2 1 3 mass transfer the driving force f for mass transfer is initiated by a gradient

activity of a species is described by its mole fraction and given by x i the expression can be written as 9 f i r t 1 x i x i z i f the friction of a mole of i is proportional to the difference in mass velocity between i and each species j in the mixture as well as the friction coefficient between i and j 10 f f r i c i j i ζ i j x j u r i u r j the friction coefficient is given by ζ i j for friction between species i and j with the mass species velocity been given by u r i with the driving forces been set to balance the friction forces acting on the species i and using a molar flux to eliminate u r i u r j and adding the convective term that is caused by the movement of the entire mixture the resulting fluxes are then used in the mass conservation equations the continuity equation for the mixture is then derived from the sum of all the mass fluxes and convective term as 11 t i m i c i i m i n i i m i r i 0 p pu 0 where n i and c i are the molar flux and total concentration of species i relative to the fixed coordinate system the conservation of mass of an individual chemical reaction ensures that the last term is equal to zero 2 2 numerical method in this study a famous comsol code based on the finite element method fem was employed to study the interaction of interfacial waves and porous bottom layer in a partially filled rectangular tank the fluid interface

enforced explicitly on the fem functions with appropriate selection of the function space the zero normal stress boundary condition on γ n is implicitly enforced through the variational form p1 p1 discretization which apply separate discretization for the velocity and pressure is done using the continuous piecewise linear elements for both variables further details on the comsol solver equations can be obtained from xue et al 2020 and the comsol users guide 2018 2 3 boundary conditions the model consists of solid walls and a free surface the wall boundary for the navier stokes equation is 19 u n 0 where n n x n y t is the boundary normal equation 19 is applied to the walls which are modeled with slip boundary condition the normal vector is dependent on the degrees of freedom of the moving mesh hence weak constraints are used to remedy constraining forces on the fluid equations and mesh weak constraints are used to enforce the slip boundary condition without a constraint force acting on the moving mesh equations 20 boundary weak constraints expression λ ˆ u n λ u ˆ n for some lagrange multiplier variable λ where λ ˆ and u ˆ denote test functions the fluid is free to move in the top boundary neglecting the stress in the surrounding environment the stress continuity equation on the free surface is given by 21 p i μ u t n p 0 n where p 0 is the surrounding constant pressure and μ is the viscosity of the fluid without loss of generality p 0 0 for this model 2 3 1 boundary condition for mesh to follow the fluid motion in relation to the mesh motion it is conventional in most cases to couple the mesh motion to the fluid motion normal to the surface the coupling is not done in the tangential direction as it will soon lead the solution to non convergence due to excessive deformation of the mesh the boundary condition for the mesh on the free surface is thus given by 22 x t y t t n u n where n is the boundary normal to x t y t t the velocity mesh for this boundary condition with the weak constraints activated the moving mesh interface adds the weak expression 23 mesh weak constraints expression λ ˆ x t y t t u n λ x ˆ y ˆ t n this is added to ensure that there are no constraint forces acting on the fluid equations the moving mesh is not constrained in the tangential direction on the side wall at the side to enable it to follow the motion of the fluid here again λ denotes some lagrange multiplier variable not the same as before and x ˆ y ˆ and λ ˆ denote test functions 2 4 surface tracking method 2 4 1 free surface tracking the free surface boundaries of the computational domain are moving and deformed with time as a result of the motion and physical parameters of the computational domain the motion of this free surface is tracked by a deformed moving mesh which moves in conformity with the deformation computation domain with a new mesh being generated for each configuration of the boundaries this technique of movement which is also referred to as the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is used to track the free surface of this model consider a mesh at time t n the velocity field is computed for the time t n 1 on this same mesh the new free surface is then computed with the lagrangian formula 24 x n 1 x n u t the partial differential equation governing the displacement field of the mesh is given by 25 d i v σ 0 the cauchy stress tensor is σ the mass of the fluid is considered in the domain and as such the mesh is considered as incompressible we consider a linear elasticity model given by the constitutive relation 26 σ c ε the constitutive matrix c is element dependent the constitutive matrix elements are also inversely proportional to the element size in order to solve the mesh equation eq 24 for free surface boundary conditions it is assumed that no fluid particle can cross the free surface this condition is expressed by setting the normal mesh velocity at the free surface equal to the normal fluid velocity 27 v v m e s h n 0 the fluid velocity is given by v is and n is the unit normal vector 2 4 2 interfacial surface tracking method the same principle based used to track the free surface based on the ale method described in sec 2 4 1 is also employed to track the interfacial surface 3 model verification and validation 3 1 mesh convergence analysis the model was developed with three different mesh parameters as described and labeled in table 1 as coarse normal and fine the tank setup for this case is as shown in fig 1 and the tank motion is given by 28 x t a c o s ω t where a 0 01m and ω 7 57rad s are the excitation amplitude and frequency respectively the normal mesh was compared to the coarse and fine mesh with the results as shown in fig 2 from the results it is seen that the coarse mesh has a larger result divergence from the normal mesh the normal mesh however has only a mild divergence form the fine mesh with results being very similar for saving computational time the normal mesh was used in this study 3 2 layered sloshing in a rectangular tank the layered fluid component of the model is validated by comparing the model results with experimental results from xue and zheng 2013 the setup of layered sloshing experiments is as shown in fig 1 the tank had a length of l 0 57m and density ρ 1 846 2 k g m 3 and ρ 2 1000 k g m 3 the height of the layers of fluid of density ρ 1 and ρ 2 is h ρ 1 0 05 m and h ρ 2 0 1 m respectively the motion of the tank is given by equation 28 where the excitation amplitude and frequency are given by a 0 01m and ω 7 57rad s the comparative results are as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 which depict the free surface time elevation and snapshots respectively contrasting the experimental results of xue and zheng 2013 against present numerical results a good agreement is seen between both results 3 3 porous medium flow the effectiveness of the implementation of darcy s law in this model for flow through a porous medium was ascertained by comparing the modeling procedure used with a benchmark case developed by elder 1967 on his study on transient convection in a porous media which is referred to as the elder problem voss and souza 1987 developed the problem as a variable density ground water problem in which fluid density is a function of salt concentration their developed case will be considered for comparison the setup consists of a concentrated fluid sipping through a porous subsurface the modeling results from the present model are compared with the results from elder problem as is shown in fig 5 and the variable density flow code sutra voss and souza 1987 as well as the seawat model developed by the us geological survey guo and langevin 2002 from the results and comparison in fig 5 it is seen that the implementation of porous flow is satisfactory in this present model 3 4 sloshing in a tank with porous baffle in order to compare the model with experimental data from kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 the porosity value ϕ which ranges from 0 to 1 is used for a case with a solid baffle the porosity ϕ 0 which means that a completely solid baffle exists with 0 pores for modeling a case without an internal baffle the porosity value of the baffle ϕ 1 which means that the baffle is 100 porous and as such there is no solid baffle and the model is reduced to a case for sloshing without baffles the permeability value in the model is set to create a constant high permeability so that only the porosity value ϕ which ranges from 0 to 1 affects the model s porosity and fluid conductivity these adjustments enabled the model to be compared with the parameters used in the experiment of kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 with tank setup with a horizontal baffle as shown in fig 6 the tank motion is as given by u u 0 cos ω t with the amplitude and frequency being 0 001 m s2 and 0 8872hz respectively fig 7 shows the comparison between results from fig 7 and present numerical results for various porosity ratios and fig 8 for various percentage porosity for the horizontal baffle it is seen in both cases that the numerical results compared well with the results from kumar and sinhamahapatra 2013 4 non layered sloshing over a porous bottom in this section sloshing over porous bottom was simulated for a non layered fluid an over a large amplitude excitation of 0 01m and a frequency range varying from 2 3hz to 7 58hz the porosity and permeability of the bottom used in this study were ϕ 0 4 and permeability k 1e 7m2 respectively 4 1 model setup the tank setup consists of a rectangular tank with a porous bottom as shown in fig 9 the tank consists of a length l 0 57m with a porous bottom of height h0 0 005m and fluid height of h the wall boundary conditions of the tank consist of no slip walls the boundary between the porous layer and the fluid consists of a permeable boundary layer enabling interaction between the porous layer and the fluid the porous layer is saturated with fluid 1 prior to the commencement of the simulations 4 2 maximum wave height for various frequencies over porous bottom of varying fill levels over a 0 05m bottom sloshing cases were run for the tank setup described in fig 9 which consists of a rectangular tank with a porous domain attached to the bottom wall of the tank the tank walls were all impermeable frequency analysis was done for sloshing over a porous bottom with tank setup as shown in fig 9 four fill levels of a h 0 1m b h 0 05m c h 0 025m and d h 0 015m were considered for all fill levels it was observed that the free surface wave maximum values significantly exceeded the corresponding maximum internal wave values for the same fill level as is seen in fig 10 in fig 10 a and b after this peak value for further frequency ranges a lower peak wave height value is observed this is because for fill levels of a and b the frequency range in the study exceeds the resonance frequency values for such fill levels and thus a descending maximum wave height is observed until it reaches the peak or resonance frequency from which descending maximum peak wave height values are obtained in fig 10 c and d it is observed that at these fill levels the frequency range covered does not exceeded the peak frequency we thus see a constant increase in the maximum peak wave height as we progress higher on the frequency axis it was also observed that the maximum peak wave values for c and d were considerably smaller as compared to fill levels for a and b with d recording the least peak wave values 4 3 free surface wave time series and spectral analysis for various tanks fill levels free surface wave time series studies were conducted using excitation amplitude a 0 01m and three different excitation frequencies of 3 5rad s 5 38rad s and 7 57 rad s the study was carried out over a porous bottom with tank setup as described in fig 9 with four different tank fill levels of h 0 1m h 0 05m h 0 025m and h 0 015m the effect of the fill levels was compared for the various excitation frequencies considered the corresponding spectral analysis was also studied from the free surface time series plots of fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 it is observed that at the excitation frequency has an effect on the maximum free surface wave height with respect to the filling level in fig 11 a that the wave time series of h 0 1m had higher displacement form the steady free surface at the initial 2 s of the simulation compared to that of the other fill levels after which the wave time series of h 0 05m had higher upward displacement from the steady free surface in fig 12 it however is observed that at an excitation frequency of 5 38rad s for a fill level of h 0 1m had a significantly higher free surface displacement from the steady free surface in comparison to fill levels of h 0 05 h 0 025 and h 0 015m this could be attributed to the fact that at a fill level of h 0 1m the excitation frequency of 5 38rad s is closest to the natural frequency of the tank setup and fill level as the frequency is changed to 7 57rad s as is the case seen in fig 13 the free surface displacement for all fill levels is markedly lower in comparison to fig 12 it also is seen that at h 0 1m the free surface elevation is not extremely higher than for h 0 05 h 0 025 and h 0 015 as was the case observed in fig 11 when considering the fast fourier transforms fft for the various wave time series in figs 11 figs 12 and 13 it is observed that at the same excitation frequency the peak frequency from the fft values are similar irrespective of the filling level 4 4 velocity profile and flow pattern of the fluid and porous bottom interaction velocity profile screenshots were taken to show the distribution of the velocity field and the flow direction pattern from the screenshots interesting velocity patterns are observed near the bottom of the tank close to the porous bottom the porous bottom is seen to interact with the fluid by creating some turbulence and high velocity field pattern one reason could be that as the fluid sloshes fluid particles enter and exit the pores and due to the tiny volume of the pores as the fluid moves from a larger volume to a smaller volume and vice versa there is an increase and decrease in the flow velocity respectively which may be due to the volume of the pores the effect of the porous bottom thus creates an interesting flow patter which can be seen more so in fig 14 at screenshots for t 5 34s t 10 75s and t 25 57s at these time frames two distinct high velocity fields can be seen with one closer to the free surface and another one closer to the porous bottom vortex flow can be clearly seen at t 13 26s and t 25 57s in the porous layer domain it is observed that the flow velocity is very small as can be seen in fig 14 5 layered sloshing interaction with porous bottom 5 1 tank setup the tank setup consists of a rectangular tank of length l 0 57m with a porous bottom of height h0 0 015m and two layers of immiscible fluids labeled fluid 1 and fluid 2 of height h1 and h2 respectively as shown in fig 15 the wall boundary conditions of the tank consist of no slip walls the boundary between the porous layer and fluid 1 consists of a permeable wall enabling interaction between the porous layer and the fluid the porous layer is saturated with fluid 1 prior to the commencement of the simulations fluid 1 and fluid 2 are separated by a layer interface as shown in fig 15 which creates interfacial wave propagation between the two fluid layers during sloshing motion since the porous layer and fluid layer 2 are separated by fluid 1 their interaction is dependent on fluid 1 serving as an intermediary and thus the effect of fluid 1 as an interaction translator body will also be of keen interest during the analysis 5 2 maximum wave height for various frequencies over a layered porous bottom of varying inner layer fill levels over a 0 05m bottom in these analyses the tank setup described in fig 15 is considered the height of the porous bottom h0 is given as 0 015m the total fluid height of the tank above the porous bottom is given by h1 h2 0 15m three cases of analysis are considered with h1 0 1m h1 0 05 and h1 0 015m to observe the effect of the inner layer height and its interaction with the porous bottom layer on the interfacial wave free surface wave and dynamic fluid pressure on the tank wall over a frequency range the results are as shown in fig 16 and fig 17 in fig 16 a where h1 0 1m and h2 0 05m maximum free surface as well as interfacial height were observed for excitation frequency of 5 38rad s amongst the selected frequency values considered this may be due to the fact that this excitation frequency is closest to the natural frequency of the setup it is observed that the maximum wave height kept increasing as the excitation frequency increased until a descent of maximum values is observed once it exceeded 5 38rad s this is also the case seen in fig 16 b which gives the maximum dynamic pressure values for the studied frequency range for pressure gauge p1 and p2 with values of 253 pa and 170 4 pa however in fig 17 the fill levels are inversed in comparison to fig 16 with the values now being h1 0 05m and h2 0 1m in fig 17 a the curve maximum values for the free surface are similar to fig 16 a where as for the interfacial wave values of fig 16 a it is seen that the maximum displacement of the interfacial layer is lower in comparison to that seen for the interfacial wave values of fig 17 a in fig 17 b the maximum dynamic pressure impact is observed at a frequency of 4 28 rad s for pressure gauge p1 and at a frequency of 3 5rad s for p2 with pressure values of 101 pa and 36 6 pa respectively 5 3 effect of bottom porosity ratio and permeability value on interfacial and free surface wave permeability analysis were done for a permeability of k of the porous bottom ranging from 1e 1 to 1e 12 for thank setup shown in fig 2 fig 19 is a chart which shows permeability range for materials and specifies whether they fall under pervious semi pervious and impervious the porous bottom layer height was h0 0 015 the interfacial layer height h1 0 05m and the upper layer h2 0 02m with results as plotted in fig 18 the maximum values of the interfacial and free surface waves represented by η 1 max and η 2 max respectively in fig 18 a it is seen that for porosity ratio of ϕ 0 1 the maximum values of the interfacial and free surface waves plotted against permeability values are lowest in comparison to those of ϕ 0 4 ϕ 0 7 and ϕ 0 9 of fig 18 b c and d respectively the maximum wave values decrease as the permeability decreased for all values of porosity ratios studies as is seen in fig 18 a b c and d which represented porosity ratios of ϕ 0 1 ϕ 0 4 ϕ 0 7 and ϕ 0 9 respectively it is also observed for all porosity ratios that the maximum wave keeps decreasing till the permeability value reaches 1e 6 after which no significant change in the maximum wave height for both the free surface and interfacial wave is observed as is seen in fig 18 the maximum free surface an interfacial wave height is recorded at the lowest permeability value for all porosity ratio cases considered the porosity ratio as well as the permeability values is observed to affect the maximum wave height of both the free surface and interfacial wave i can be seen that at porosity ratio of ϕ 0 4 higher maximum wave values are observed especially for the free surface wave in comparison to the other porosity ratio values this effect could be due to the fact that the porosity creates voids which may slightly alter the total volume of fluid in the tank setup as the voids house an amount fluid in relation to the porosity ratio this in turn could have an effect on the natural frequency of the setup which will be affected by the alteration in the volume of fluid the porosity also inhibits the ease of motion of the fluid within the pores as the tank sloshes thus the impact of the fluid in the pores on sloshing and wave height will be dependent on the ease or difficulty at which it flows through the pores which is dependent on the porosity value 5 4 free surface and interfacial wave time series plot free surface and interfacial wave time series plots were generated for layered sloshing over a porous bottom with the corresponding power spectral analysis and compared to layered sloshing without a permeable bottom the setup of the tank is as given by fig 15 the fill level cases considered were fluid layer heights of h1 0 1m and h2 0 05m shown in fig 20 and the inverse to this of fluid layer heights of h1 0 05m and h2 0 1m as shown in fig 21 it was desired to see the effect of inverse layer fill levels on the tank setup while maintaining the same total fill level in fig 20 a it is observed that for the case with a porous bottom the interfacial wave displacement is less than or nearly only half the interfacial wave displacement for the case without a porous bottom as displayed in fig 20 b on the other hand the free surface wave for both cases with and without a porous bottom showed only slight or no distinct variations this same characteristic is also observed in fig 21 this showed that the porous bottom had a greater effect on the displacement of the interfacial wave when compared to its effect on the free surface wave displacement 5 5 velocity profile and flow pattern of the fluid and porous bottom interaction screen shots were taken of the layered sloshing over a porous bottom to observe the interaction of the various layers and velocity profile screen shots of the velocity profile and flow pattern are presented in fig 22 to show the interaction of the layers with the porous bottom and to observe possible effects of the porous bottom on the flow pattern the setup is as described by fig 15 the screen shots of fig 22 highlight an interesting velocity profile distribution there is a high velocity distribution in the fluid 1 region which emirates from a position close to the porous bottom in section 4 4 it was shown that the porous bottom had a greater impact or interaction with the interfacial layer by creating increases wave heights hence the screen shots also show that there is an interaction between the interfacial layer and the porous bottom which might create this higher velocity distribution in fluid 1 emanating close from the bottom as expected the flow velocity in the porous bottom is lower in comparisons to the regions of both layered fluids 6 sloshing control of layered fluid by use of a porous side wall buffer 6 1 tank setup a tank containing porous material paddings on its vertical walls by a porous buffer is setup as shown in fig 23 a wave probe is attached on the left tank wall to record interfacial and free surface wave displacement pressure sensors are placed along three sections of the porous wall buffer to measure the dynamic pressure exerted at different cross sections of the porous material as shown in fig 23 the tank is subjected to sloshing with an amplitude of 0 005m and an excitation frequency of 4 5rad s 6 2 effect of porous side wall buffer structure on dynamic pressure response dynamic pressure time series is recorded at pressure sensor along lines p1 p2 and p3 at sections a b and c along the porous material padding attached to the left tank wall as shown in fig 23 due to this setup pressure calculations along three sections a b and c are obtained for p1 p2 p3 and p4 described in fig 23 the pressure sensor recordings at p1 p2 p3 and p4 thus give pressure values recorded at p1a p1b and p1c for pressure sensor along line p1 where as they give p2a p2b and p2c for pressure sensor along line p2 and p3a p3b and p3c for pressure sensors along line p3 as well as for p4 at p4a p4b and p4c the recorded dynamic pressure values recorded at all pressure sensors are plotted in fig 24 the dynamic pressure plots in fig 24 show dynamic pressure time series at p1 p2 p3 and p4 along three section points of the porous material on the left tank wall from the recorded values it can be observed that slightly higher pressure values were recorded along sections a for all pressure probes meaning p1a p2a p3a and p4a recorded slightly higher pressure readings as compared to recordings along the c section that is p1c p2c p3c and p4c all recording lower values as can be seen in fig 24 this showed that the porous material used as a fluid motion buffer had an effect on slightly damping the dynamic pressure along the tank wall 6 3 effect of porous side wall buffer structure on wave time series interfacial and free surface wave time series are plotted for comparing cases with and without a porous layer wall their corresponding fft spectral analysis is also conducted to observe how the porous wall buffer affects the spectrum the plots are shown in fig 25 fig 26 fig 27 and fig 28 interfacial wave time series plots showed that the porous buffer padding on the tank walls had an effect on the interfacial and free surface wave this can be seen in the interfacial wave time series in figs 25 and 27 for sloshing at 4 5rad s and 6 5rad s respectively as well as in figs 26 and 28 which show the wave time series of the free surface for excitation frequencies of 4 5ra ds and 6 5rad s it is seen that the porous wall buffer reduced the sloshing wave displacement as there appears to be a higher wave displacement when the porous wall buffer layer for sloshing under the same conditions when the porous padding wall is absent from the setup this could be due to the fact that the porous wall buffer layer softens the impact of the fluid on the tank wall as it reduces the velocity of the fluid as it passes through this porous region this can be seen in the screen shots of the velocity profile in fig 29 the porous layer thus serves as a form of energy absorbing material that reduces the interfacial and free surface wave displacement as can be seen in the time series comparisons for tanks with and without a porous layer padded the power spectral analysis for interfacial and free surface wave show slight shift in peak frequency values for cases where a porous layer wall was used one such instance is in fig 25 which shows the spectral analysis for sloshing with and without a porous layer wall here it is seen that the case without a porous layer wall buffer the peak frequency was 7 12hz where as for the case without a porous layer wall the recorded frequency was 0 709hz this is a minimal difference but this trend is also observed in figs 26 figs 27 and 28 7 conclusion sloshing interaction between a permeable bottom and a single and layered fluid was modeled the porous bottom is seen to interact with the fluid by creating some turbulence and high velocity field patterns which may be associated to drag in the region of the fluid closest to the porous bottom it was observed that for higher porosity ratios of the bottom created an increase in the maximum interfacial and free surface wave values whereas at lower permeability values the bottom material it behaved like a non porous structure internal wave heights are more significantly affected by a porous bottom the effect of the porous bottom decreases with an increase in fill level of the tank the porous material also alters the natural frequency of the tank setup a lower porosity ratio ϕ of the porous bottom was observed to create lower interfacial and free surface wave displacements in the layered sloshing fluid maximum interfacial and free surface wave displacement was also observed to decrease with a decrease in permeability value k thus the effect of the porous material on damping sloshing waves was observed to be dependent on the porosity ratio and permeability value of the material the dynamic pressure damping of the porous material on the tank side walls was observed to be dependent on the position of the pressure sensor point along length the porous material with greatest dynamic pressure damping observed nearest to the tank wall credit authorship contribution

angular positions performing sharp manoeuvres on the trajectory is handled by the optimum configuration of rotation angles along vertical longitudinal and transverse axes in the meantime it is necessary to keep the thrust drag and lift effects at proper values with this approach a mission scenario was set for auv to circumnavigate a marine vessel along its waterline within a particular margin the trajectory coordinates generated according to the determined scenario were converted to the ideal trajectory by cubic spline curve fitting method based on the determined trajectory a navigation plan consisting of linear distances and rotation angles was created for energy calculation in the following phase of the study in compliance with angular position information received from the navigation plan hydrodynamic impacts on the auv were obtained by computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis based on finite volume method fvm cfd analysis was run for calculating the hydrodynamic

missions and follow pre planned trajectories are considered a subtype of unmanned underwater vehicles uuv such as remote controlled vehicles rov sahoo et al 2019 the stability of the auvs and the control system design require the construction of an accurate mathematical model that includes kinematics and dynamics in 6 degrees of freedom fossen 1994 the identification of underwater vehicle hydrodynamic characteristics is essential for developing a compliant actuation system to perform a high precision manoeuvring motion developing appropriate motion control strategies for underwater robots that have inherent complex dynamics requires clearly revealing their hydrodynamic characteristics for the purpose of developing guidance and motion control strategies for auvs jagadeesh et al 2009 performed an experimental study for the axisymmetric underwater body which generates the results of hydrodynamic forces and moments at varying flow speeds and pitch angles recently computational fluid dynamics cfd tools are used to calculate the hydrodynamic parameters of bodies moving underwater with models created by fem finite element method or fvm finite volume method du et al 2014 wu et al 2014 when identifying the flow field and pressure distribution to find out the hydrodynamic parameters resulting forces and moments applying cfd provides an advantage of reducing time and cost in comparison with other approaches such as tank tests with constrained models and tests with free running models de barros and dantas 2012 javanmard 2013 and mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 have investigated the free surface effect on drag and lift coefficients of auv at varying depth values using k ε and shear stress transport sst model and linked the hydrodynamic coefficients to the submergence depth and auv speed salari and rava 2017 claimed that the hydrodynamic behaviour of the auv when moving near the water surface is different from that when moving at higher depths besides that the authors numerically studied the hydrodynamic coefficients over auv near the water surface with various turbulence models congruently amiri et al 2019 studied to estimate the function of the leeward vortical flow structure in the hydrodynamic characteristics of an underwater vehicle which is positioned shallow levels at a moderate drift angle li et al 2018 introduced a design of an autonomous underwater glider aug equipped with hydro wings generating wave motion induced thrust and the hydrodynamic behaviour of aug was investigated numerically by solving incompressible viscous navier stokes equations da silva costa et al 2019 analysed the torque effects of hull wake interaction on the manoeuvrability of an auv which is flatfish shaped mitra et al 2019 experimentally and numerically studied the effect of free stream turbulence on the hydrodynamics of auv hull form for different depths moreover mitra et al 2020 investigated hydrodynamic characteristics for various reynold numbers over sloped sea beds bao ji et al 2019 investigated the resistance performance and movement stability of open frame remotely operated vehicle with the propeller in motion using the steady state reynolds averaged navier stokes method for simulating the forces on another study of open frame auv hydrodynamics performed by tang et al 2009 the importance level of each hydrodynamic coefficient was investigated by analysing the relationship between hydrodynamic loads and motion variables besides all these numerical studies the proposed cfd method should be validated with existing experimental data tian et al 2019 together with hydrodynamic analysis in the evaluation of performance parameters of auv the usage of data derived from cfd results constitutes an important point evans and nahon 2004 besides that hydrodynamic analysis results may provide an additional contribution to the studies which investigate power consumption and energy efficiency of auvs carneiro et al 2019 sarkar et al 2016 yang et al 2019 zavari et al 2019 this work focusses on the estimation of a set of hydrodynamic responses and performance characteristics for demarine auv an autonomous underwater vehicle developed for surveying vessels and shallow water environment the unique contribution of this study to its counterparts is to obtain the operating parameters such as energy and power requirement battery current and navigation range based on the cfd data of an already running auv that was designed and manufactured to perform certain tasks the calculation domain was built as a virtual boundary where all of the flow related phenomena are actualized and studied numerically according to the proposed approach roll rotation was designated in the range of φ 30 moreover yaw rotation was set in the range of ψ 30 roll and yaw motions are illustrated in fig 1 2 auv modelling according to society of naval architects and marine engineers sname 1950 the six motion components of a marine vehicle are defined as surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw which are shown in table 1 and fig 2 2 1 kinematics of moving frames when defining the kinematics of auvs the motions along six degrees of freedom are determined according to two distinct references which are called body fixed frame and earth fixed frame body fixed frame is located at the centre of gravity of auv thus linear and angular velocity data are described according to body fixed frame on the other side position and orientation data are described according to the earth fixed frame caccia 2007 the vectors that express the motion through six axes are indicated in eqs 1 6 kaya and gören 2017 1 η 1 x y z t 2 η 2 ϕ θ ψ t 3 ν 1 u v w t 4 ν 2 p q r t 5 τ 1 x y z t 6 τ 2 k m n t here vector η is position and orientation coordinate of auv with respect to earth fixed coordinate system whereas vector υ is the velocity vector and each τ respectively represents external force vector and external moment vector that acts on auv body to obtain the kinematic expression of auv the formulation must be transformed from body fixed coordinate system to earth fixed coordinate system in particular euler angles φ θ ψ are significant due to their function of describing the orientation and defining the control parameters linear velocity transformation with respect to earth fixed frame is given in eq 7 ramesh et al

mission scenario the navigational scenario for the auv is based on the environmental geometry of the research boat deu 1 which is used in scientific studies of dokuz eylul university institute of marine science and technology in the scope of the scenario auv is requested to follow the water line 3 on the wetted surface of the floating marine vessel keeping 1 m distance within a margin of 150 mm the general view and technical specifications of deu 1 are presented in fig 3 and table 2 wl j indicates the set of lines on marine vessels that are parallel to the water surface when the vessel is afloat in a normal position xy coordinates of water line 3 were obtained from the half breadth distances of deu 1 as shown in table 3 3 2 auv trajectory for the wl3 obtained from table 3 the intervals of the xy coordinates are precisely divided by auxiliary stations and the curve fitting algorithm is aimed to give a more accurate result especially in critical regions where the radius of curve is low augmented xy coordinates were offset by 1 m to determine the points that auv should reach during the mission following this step the cubic spline curve fitting method was applied to determine the ideal trajectory of auv the reason for adopting cubic spline curve fitting is to handle slope changes smoothly which is not possible with lower order splines therewithal higher order splines are not preferred because of instabilities inherent in higher order polynomials chapra 2011 cubic spline curve fitting method is based on cubic spline interpolation which is a way of fitting respective polynomials in between each of the two points a third degree polynomial can be written as in eq 11 11 f i x a i x 3 b i x 2 c i x d i i 1 2 n here for n 1 data points and n intervals there are 4n unknown coefficients that needed to be evaluated by a set of 4n equations it is possible to reduce the number of equations in the solution set to n 1 by applying an approach which is based on observation that the second derivative within each interval is a straight line cheney and kincaid 2013 this observation can be proved by differentiating twice of eq 11 as in eq 12 and eq 13 12 f i x 3 a i x 2 2 b i x c i i 1 2 n 13 f i x 6 a i x 2 b i i 1 2 n the derivation from the mentioned approach gives the cubic equation for each interval as in eq 14 14 f i x f i x i 1 6 x i x i 1 x i x 3 f i x i 6 x i x i 1 x x i 1 3 f x i 1 x i x i 1 f x i 1 x i x i 1 6 x i x f x i x i x i 1 f x i x i x i 1 6 x x i 1 the unknowns which are the second derivatives at the end of each interval can be calculated using eq 15 15 x i x i 1 f x i 1 2 x i 1 x i 1 f x i x i 1 x i f x i 1 6 x i 1 x i f x i 1 f x i 6 x i x i 1 f x i 1 f x i considering the second derivatives at the end nodes equals zero if eq 15 is written for all interior nodes a solution set of n 1 equations with n 1 unknowns is obtained furthermore the system of equation set is tridiagonal thus the solution is simplified the system of equation forms as in eq 16 16 1 h 1 2 h 1 h 2 h 2 h n 2 2 h n 2 h n 1 h n 1 1 c 1 c 2 c n 1 c n 0 3 f x 3 x 2 f x 2 x 1 3 f x n x n 1 f x n 1 x n 2 0 here h i c i and f x i x j are identified as in eq 17 eq 18 and eq 19 respectively 17 h i x x i 1 x i i 1 2 n 18 c i c i 1 3 d i h i i 1 2 n 19 f x i x j f i f j x i x j i 1 2 n cubic spline curve fitting algorithm was computerized and run by java programming language the output of the cubic spline curve fitting algorithm is plotted as shown in fig 4 with the purpose of generating straight distance d k and yaw angle ψ k data sets which will be used as an input of motion induced energy requirement evaluation algorithm the ideal trajectory was degraded into broken line form the degraded trajectory was designed by plotting tangent lines through predetermined derivation points auv changes its angular position around z b axis at certain points where each tangent line passing through derivative point p x k y k intersects with the tangent line passing through the next derivative point p x k 1 y k 1 as it is seen in fig 5 the location and number of derivative points were optimized ensuring that the intersection points remain within the 150 mm trajectory margin from the designated tangent points p x k y k each slope β k was obtained by differentiating the cubic spline polynomial defined for the relevant interval the yaw angle ψ k data set that auv should perform at each intersection point was evaluated based on the difference of successive slopes formulated as in eq 20 eq 21 and eq 22 20 β k arctan d f k d x k k 1 2 m 21 ψ k β k 1 β k i 1 2 m 22 ψ k arctan d f k 1 d x k 1 arctan d f k d x k k 1 2 m the set of each straight distance d k along the trajectory was evaluated by eq 23 23 d k x k x k 1 cos β k k 1 2 m 3 3 energy modelling data sets ψ k and d k and which are obtained from eq 22 and eq 23 will be used as an input of the motion induced energy requirement evaluation algorithm the amount of energy that the auv will consume throughout the trajectory was expressed as the sum of the energies it consumes while performing the straight path navigation e klinear and yaw movements around the z b axis e kangular for ψ equals zero and corresponding drag force f ψ 0 obtained from hydrodynamic analysis result which can be seen in fig 19c e klinear is evaluated as in eq 24 24 e k l i n e a r f ψ 0 d k k 1 2 m for ψ k data and corresponding drag force f ψ k obtained from hydrodynamic analysis result which can be seen in fig 19c e kangular is evaluated as in eq 25 25 e k a n g u l a r f ψ k b a u v ψ k π 180 k 1 2 m here ψ k transformed into radian unit and f ψ k have an impact on auv as a force couple in which the width size of auv b auv is the perpendicular distance between the forces the total

p a v g e t o t a l δ t e t o t a l u σ k 1 m d k here the linear velocity of auv is expressed by u since auv has two horizontal thrusters the total power requirement is halved for each of the two thrusters and expressed with p t for identified p t if the operating voltage v and battery capacity c batt in terms of ampere hour are known total corresponding amperage draw i batt gives the discharge time of battery t batt as in eq 29 29 t b a t t c b a t t i b a t t navigation range l nav with respect to t batt and u is formulated as in eq 30 30 l n a v t b a t t u for various operating

by using the calculated power requirement information a detailed flow chart is presented in fig 6 which clarifies how the drag forces and geometric data obtained by the trajectory planning algorithm are utilized in the evaluation of energy requirement working parameters and performance parameters of the auv 4 hydrodynamic analysis 4 1 case study the cfd simulation was run on the first version of the demarine observer type auv prototype which is implemented in dokuz eylul university robotics laboratory for research in shallow water and observations on ship wetted surfaces demarine auv comprises of a main frame two vertical thrusters two horizontal thrusters a dry box with electronic hardware inside and a battery box as shown in fig 7 technical specifications of demarine auv are given in table 4 numerical results were presented with ansys fluent 19 1 commercial cfd software the following sections will include criteria such as the settings of the selected solver governing equations boundary conditions and mesh independence 4 2 flow model 4 2 1 governing equations the governing equations are continuity momentum and energy equations for specific boundary conditions of three dimensional time dependent incompressible fluids in underwater flow problems the continuity equation which ensures that the amount of substance entering the flow volume equals to the amount of substance at the outlet is defined as in eq 31 kim and park 2017 31 ρ t ρ u 0 here ρ and u represents the flow density and velocity respectively considering newton s second law the naiver stokes or momentum equation in the control volume can be written as in eq 32 tu et al 2018 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 32 ρ d u d t f p μ 2 u in the above equations p μ and f represent pressure fluid viscosity and body force respectively 4 2 2 turbulence modelling in engineering in the frame of nearly all practical applications flows are related to turbulence turbulence modelling has four main categories zero one and two equations models and stress transport models david c wilcox 2013 besides that turbulent flow calculations of cfd can be dealt with these models and simulations eddy viscosity models reynolds stress models large eddy simulations les direct numerical simulations dns panda 2019 speziale et al 1991 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 two equation models are used in common but recent approaches on turbulence modelling slide to reynolds stress models panda and warrior 2018 these models bring higher computational loads in contrast eddy viscosity models require less computational effort than reynolds stress models les and dns simulations da silva costa et al 2019 mishra and girimaji 2017 mitra et al 2019 in this study the realizable k ε model which is one of the eddy viscosity models was used as the turbulence model da silva costa et al 2017 this model is based on reynold averaged navier stokes rans approach that has been commonly adopted due to its scientifically proven abilities to be the most accurate approach to analyse the flow around the surface and underwater vehicles with less computational effort jagadeesh et al 2009 rattanasiri et al 2014 sarkar et al 1997 tang et al 2009 the realizable k ε model has two main differences from the standard k ε model in that it comprises alternative formulations for the turbulence viscosity and uses modified transport equations for the diffusion rate ε therewithal it has superiorities in terms of meeting certain mathematical constraints on reynolds stresses under turbulent flow conditions ansys fluent 2015 joung et al 2012 4 2 3 meshing and boundary conditions the flow domain was created as a symmetrical geometry which has a velocity input and atmospheric pressure output as shown in fig 8 mesh size and mesh form was adjusted to be finer in the areas close to critical points as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 boundary values configured before the initialization of the solver are shown in table 5 the cfd process flowchart is shown in fig 11 4 2 4 mesh independency within the scope of the analysis the mesh independency was calculated within the limits of sufficient accuracy by considering the calculation period the mesh independency analysis was realized for six mesh numbers in case of the 5 roll angle for the steady state phase of the model the study was carried out in different element numbers starting from 0 3 m elements until 3 m elements the non dimensional drag and lift coefficient used in the analysis can be defined as in eq 33 and eq 34 33 c d f x 1 2 ρ a u 2 34 c l f y 1 2 ρ a u 2 where a is the projection area of the auv c d and c l are drag and lift coefficients respectively as can be seen in fig 12 while the drag coefficient of auv shows irregular behaviour up to 0 75 m mesh number it was observed that after the convergence is achieved the results fit on a regular regime after convergence of mesh independency cfd analysis was carried out parametrically for the 2 m mesh number 4 2 5 numerical method validation validation is used to determine how accurately the modelled physical process works the confident use of numerical results is supplied by validation of the numerical models considering the numerical accuracy of the applied turbulence method validation is implemented in the underwater axisymmetric body named as afterbody 1 of jagadeesh et al 2009 afterbody 1 is an axisymmetric low drag body with a diameter of 0 14 m and the overall length of this body is 1 4 m in validation process the realizable k ε model is applied against experimental results with similar model domain setup of the current numerical analysis the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental values with acceptable errors validation results for the flow speed range of 0 4 1 4 m s are shown in fig 13 5 results and discussion corresponding slopes f k x k slope angles β k location of intersection nodes z k x z k y z k linear path distances d k and yaw angles ψ k with respect to derivation points p k were obtained as the output vectors of cubic spline curve fitting algorithm which was computerized and run with java as seen in table 6 at all intersection nodes z k maximum yaw angle value in ψ k data set resulting from trajectory planning reached up to ψ max 29 56 for this reason the hydrodynamic analysis settings were adjusted so that the φ and ψ angles were in the range of 0o 30 time dependent analysis was run for an angular rate around x b axis p 0 3 deg s and around zb axis r 0 3 deg s separately for roll and yaw rotations step times was adjusted to last at 10 s on the purpose of acquiring the angle range of 0o 30 on the time domain velocity distributions for roll angles of 5 10 15 20 25 30 around the auv inside the flow domain are illustrated as shown in fig 14 pressure distributions for roll angles of 5 10 15 20 25 30 around the auv inside the flow domain are illustrated as shown in fig 15 velocity distributions for yaw angles of 5 10 15 20 25 30 around the auv inside the flow domain are illustrated as shown in fig 16 pressure distributions for yaw angles of 5 10 15 20 25 30 around the auv inside the flow domain are illustrated as shown in fig 17 for roll rotation time and angular position dependent behaviour of hydrodynamic derivatives drag coefficients lift coefficients resulting forces and moments are given in fig 18 for yaw rotation time and angular position dependent behaviour of hydrodynamic derivatives drag coefficients lift coefficients resulting forces and moments are given in fig 19 as a result of the flow analysis carried out by the finite volume method it was observed that the magnitudes of drag coefficient c d and drag force f x have a slightly decreasing tendency the magnitudes of lift coefficient c l roll moment m x and lift force f y have a slightly increasing tendency in the change of roll angle between φ 0o 30 when the results are evaluated the alterations on the hydrodynamic parameters brought about by roll angle variations are negligibly low this is because the size of the projection area exposed to the flow of the auv is not dependent on the roll angle while the yaw angle was increasing from 0 to 30 degrees more distinct and significant changes were observed in the hydrodynamic derivatives with the increase in the yaw angle the magnitude of c d has an increasing tendency the magnitudes of f x and f y rise and c l changes in the 0 6 bandwidth m z increases during the yaw angle is between ψ 0o 15 remains around 1 5 nm during ψ 15o 23 and decreases during the during ψ 23o 30 presented cfd simulation results with different roll and yaw angles showed that the resistance effect created by the changes of yaw angle is far greater than the effect created by the roll angle for this reason the roll angle is not included in trajectory planning and energy calculation noticeable fluctuations in the early phases of the solution arise from the time dependent operation of the numerical solver the convergence time to the correct result lasts around 2 s cfd simulation was carried out using a 16 core dual processor unit with a processing capacity of 2 53 ghz the use of high capacity processors is known to enable more precise solutions by allowing to configure lower step size in the cfd solver setup therefore by using high processing capacity the initial state values of the time dependent solution can be obtained more accurately besides the simulation can be run in the range of 10 30 to eliminate inaccuracies that occur at the beginning phase of the 0o 30 degree range in the second half of the study f x ψ data set obtained from hydrodynamic analysis which can be seen in fig 19c d k and ψ k angle sets obtained from the trajectory planning phase which can be seen in table 6 constitute the input parameters for the motion induced energy requirement evaluation algorithm the energy modelling of the auv was computerized and run with matlab software outputs of f x ψ eklinear and ekangular are listed in table 7 here to avoid picking the incorrect value of fx ψ 0 inflicted from the initial phase instabilities of the computational solver the point where the trending line intersects the vertical axis was used as can be seen in fig 19c using the data in table 7 the total energy requirement for navigation from the beginning to the end of the trajectory calculated as etotal 1 78 kj considering the time of travel throughout the trajectory δt 18 17 s the need of average power is calculated as pavg 98 18 j s w which is halved by both horizontal thruster as p t 49 09 w in the process of development of demarine auv drive system it is planned to adopt bluerobotics t200 thrusters for performing of horizontal plane motions demarine auv currently supplies its power from 22 2 v 10 ah lithium polymer battery for identified p t and various operating voltages v corresponding rotation speed pwm amperage draw thrust force and efficiency values are received from bluerobotics t200 thruster s performance charts bluerobotics 2019 using the mentioned performance data the calculated discharge time of battery t batt and navigation range l nav are given in table 8 as can be seen in table 8 according to operating voltages ranging from 10 v to 20 v the discharge time of battery t batt and implicitly the duty period of auv vary from 1 03 h to 2 03 h the navigation range l nav 5 57 km 10 97 km and thrust efficiency η t 20 27 g w to 24 6 g w 6 conclusions the aim of this study was to determine the forces moments and hydrodynamic coefficients of an auv that travel at a constant speed in different angular positions in this way auv s energy consumption power requirements thrusters operating data navigational performance results could be evaluated it was revealed that the alterations in the yaw angle create significant changes in drag force lateral force and yaw moment this information will be used as a design and calculation criterion during the development of the propulsion systems of the related auv as it generates total and instantaneous power requirements during navigation and manoeuvring for this reason the determined resistance and moment values are necessary for obtaining actuator parameters that control yaw and roll positions the performance parameters based on the battery and thruster data provides optimum running configurations for auv to complete its mission in the frame of the following study using the obtained results it is planned to design and implement an adaptive controller architecture to adjust thruster parameters such as the rotational speed of propellers and angular positions of flaps in compliance with yaw and roll positions of

necessary to keep the thrust drag and lift effects at proper values with this approach a mission scenario was set for auv to circumnavigate a marine vessel along its waterline within a particular margin the trajectory coordinates generated according to the determined scenario were converted to the ideal trajectory by cubic spline curve fitting method based on the determined trajectory a navigation plan consisting of linear distances and rotation angles was created for energy calculation in the following phase of the study in compliance with angular position information received from the navigation plan hydrodynamic impacts on the auv were obtained by computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis based on finite volume method fvm cfd analysis was run for calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients total resistance and moments acting on auv based on roll and yaw angle variations the resulting hydrodynamic data was used to evaluate the energy requirement which provides performance parameters of auv navigating along its trajectory keywords auv trajectory planning auv operating parameters cfd curve fitting method 1 introduction auvs which can perform autonomous underwater missions and follow pre planned trajectories are considered a subtype of unmanned underwater vehicles uuv such as remote controlled vehicles rov sahoo et al 2019 the stability of the auvs and the control system design require the construction of an accurate mathematical model that includes kinematics and dynamics in 6 degrees of freedom fossen 1994 the identification of underwater vehicle hydrodynamic characteristics is essential for developing a compliant actuation system to perform a high precision manoeuvring motion developing appropriate motion control strategies for underwater robots that have inherent complex dynamics requires clearly revealing their hydrodynamic characteristics for the purpose of developing guidance and motion control strategies for auvs jagadeesh et al 2009 performed an experimental study for the axisymmetric underwater body which generates the results of hydrodynamic forces and moments at varying flow speeds and pitch angles recently computational fluid dynamics cfd tools are used to calculate the hydrodynamic parameters of bodies moving underwater with models created by fem finite element method or fvm finite volume method du et al 2014 wu et al 2014 when identifying the flow field and pressure distribution to find out the hydrodynamic parameters resulting forces and moments applying cfd provides an advantage of reducing time and cost in comparison with other approaches such as tank tests with constrained models and tests with free running models de barros and dantas 2012 javanmard 2013 and mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 have investigated the free surface effect on drag and lift coefficients of auv at varying depth values using k ε and shear stress transport sst model and linked the hydrodynamic coefficients to the submergence depth and auv speed salari and rava 2017 claimed that the hydrodynamic behaviour of the auv when moving near the water surface is different from that when moving at higher depths besides that the authors numerically studied the hydrodynamic coefficients over auv near the water surface with various turbulence models congruently amiri et al 2019 studied to estimate the function of the leeward vortical flow structure in the hydrodynamic characteristics of an underwater vehicle which is positioned shallow levels at a moderate drift angle li et al 2018 introduced a design of an autonomous underwater glider aug equipped with hydro wings generating wave motion induced thrust and the hydrodynamic behaviour of aug was investigated numerically by solving incompressible viscous navier stokes equations da silva costa et al 2019 analysed the torque effects of hull wake interaction on the manoeuvrability of an auv which is flatfish shaped mitra et al 2019 experimentally and numerically studied the effect of free stream turbulence on the hydrodynamics of auv hull form for different depths moreover mitra et al 2020 investigated hydrodynamic characteristics for various reynold numbers over sloped sea beds bao ji et al 2019 investigated the resistance performance and movement stability of open frame remotely operated vehicle with the propeller in motion using the steady state reynolds averaged navier stokes method for simulating the forces on another study of open frame auv hydrodynamics performed by tang et al 2009 the importance level of each hydrodynamic coefficient was investigated by analysing the relationship between hydrodynamic loads and motion variables besides all these numerical studies the proposed cfd method should be validated with existing experimental data tian et al 2019 together with hydrodynamic analysis in the evaluation of performance parameters of auv the usage of data derived from cfd results constitutes an important point evans and nahon 2004 besides that hydrodynamic analysis results may provide an additional contribution to the studies which investigate power consumption and energy efficiency of auvs carneiro et al 2019 sarkar et al 2016 yang et al 2019 zavari et al 2019 this work focusses on the estimation of a set of hydrodynamic responses and performance characteristics for demarine auv an autonomous underwater vehicle developed for surveying vessels and shallow water environment the unique contribution of this study to its counterparts is to obtain the operating parameters such as energy and power requirement battery current and navigation range based on the cfd data of an already running auv that was designed and manufactured to perform certain tasks the calculation domain was built as a virtual boundary where all of the flow related phenomena are actualized and studied numerically according to the proposed approach roll rotation was designated in the range of φ 30 moreover yaw rotation was set in the range of ψ 30 roll and yaw motions are illustrated in fig 1 2 auv modelling according to society of naval architects and marine engineers sname 1950 the six motion components of a marine vehicle are defined as surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw which are shown in table 1 and fig 2 2 1 kinematics of moving frames when defining the kinematics of auvs the motions along six degrees of freedom are determined according to two distinct references which are called body fixed frame and earth fixed frame body fixed frame is located at the centre of gravity of auv thus linear and angular velocity data are described according to body fixed frame on the other side position and orientation data are described according to the earth fixed frame caccia 2007 the vectors that express the motion through six axes are indicated in eqs 1 6 kaya and gören 2017 1 η 1 x y z t 2 η 2 ϕ θ ψ t 3 ν 1 u v w t 4 ν 2 p q r t 5 τ 1 x y z t 6 τ 2 k m n t here vector η is position and orientation coordinate of auv with respect to earth fixed coordinate system whereas vector υ is the velocity vector and each τ respectively represents external force vector and external moment vector that acts on auv body to obtain the kinematic expression of auv the formulation must be transformed from body fixed coordinate system to earth fixed coordinate system in particular euler angles φ θ ψ are significant due to their function of describing the orientation and defining the control parameters linear velocity transformation with respect to earth fixed frame is given in eq 7 ramesh et al

mission scenario the navigational scenario for the auv is based on the environmental geometry of the research boat deu 1 which is used in scientific studies of dokuz eylul university institute of marine science and technology in the scope of the scenario auv is requested to follow the water line 3 on the wetted surface of the floating marine vessel keeping 1 m distance within a margin of 150 mm the general view and technical specifications of deu 1 are presented in fig 3 and table 2 wl j indicates the set of lines on marine vessels that are parallel to the water surface when the vessel is afloat in a normal position xy coordinates of water line 3 were obtained from the half breadth distances of deu 1 as shown in table 3 3 2 auv trajectory for the wl3 obtained from table 3 the intervals of the xy coordinates are precisely divided by auxiliary stations and the curve fitting algorithm is aimed to give a more accurate result especially in critical regions where the radius of curve is low augmented xy coordinates were offset by 1 m to determine the points that auv should reach during the mission following this step the cubic spline curve fitting method was applied to determine the ideal trajectory of auv the reason for adopting cubic spline curve fitting is to handle slope changes smoothly which is not possible with lower order splines therewithal higher order splines are not preferred because of instabilities inherent in higher order polynomials chapra 2011 cubic spline curve fitting method is based on cubic spline interpolation which is a way of fitting respective polynomials in between each of the two points a third degree polynomial can be written as in eq 11 11 f i x a i x 3 b i x 2 c i x d i i 1 2 n here for n 1 data points and n intervals there are 4n unknown coefficients that needed to be evaluated by a set of 4n equations it is possible to reduce the number of equations in the solution set to n 1 by applying an approach which is based on observation that the second derivative within each interval is a straight line cheney and kincaid 2013 this observation can be proved by differentiating twice of eq 11 as in eq 12 and eq 13 12 f i x 3 a i x 2 2 b i x c i i 1 2 n 13 f i x 6 a i x 2 b i i 1 2 n the derivation from the mentioned approach gives the cubic equation for each interval as in eq 14 14 f i x f i x i 1 6 x i x i 1 x i x 3 f i x i 6 x i x i 1 x x i 1 3 f x i 1 x i x i 1 f x i 1 x i x i 1 6 x i x f x i x i x i 1 f x i x i x i 1 6 x x i 1 the unknowns which are the second derivatives at the end of each interval can be calculated using eq 15 15 x i x i 1 f x i 1 2 x i 1 x i 1 f x i x i 1 x i f x i 1 6 x i 1 x i f x i 1 f x i 6 x i x i 1 f x i 1 f x i considering the second derivatives at the end nodes equals zero if eq 15 is written for all interior nodes a solution set of n 1 equations with n 1 unknowns is obtained furthermore the system of equation set is tridiagonal thus the solution is simplified the system of equation forms as in eq 16 16 1 h 1 2 h 1 h 2 h 2 h n 2 2 h n 2 h n 1 h n 1 1 c 1 c 2 c n 1 c n 0 3 f x 3 x 2 f x 2 x 1 3 f x n x n 1 f x n 1 x n 2 0 here h i c i and f x i x j are identified as in eq 17 eq 18 and eq 19 respectively 17 h i x x i 1 x i i 1 2 n 18 c i c i 1 3 d i h i i 1 2 n 19 f x i x j f i f j x i x j i 1 2 n cubic spline curve fitting algorithm was computerized and run by java programming language the output of the cubic spline curve fitting algorithm is plotted as shown in fig 4 with the purpose of generating straight distance d k and yaw angle ψ k data sets which will be used as an input of motion induced energy requirement evaluation algorithm the ideal trajectory was degraded into broken line form the degraded trajectory was designed by plotting tangent lines through predetermined derivation points auv changes its angular position around z b axis at certain points where each tangent line passing through derivative point p x k y k intersects with the tangent line passing through the next derivative point p x k 1 y k 1 as it is seen in fig 5 the location and number of derivative points were optimized ensuring that the intersection points remain within the 150 mm trajectory margin from the designated tangent points p x k y k each slope β k was obtained by differentiating the cubic spline polynomial defined for the relevant interval the yaw angle ψ k data set that auv should perform at each intersection point was evaluated based on the difference of successive slopes formulated as in eq 20 eq 21 and eq 22 20 β k arctan d f k d x k k 1 2 m 21 ψ k β k 1 β k i 1 2 m 22 ψ k arctan d f k 1 d x k 1 arctan d f k d x k k 1 2 m the set of each straight distance d k along the trajectory was evaluated by eq 23 23 d k x k x k 1 cos β k k 1 2 m 3 3 energy modelling data sets ψ k and d k and which are obtained from eq 22 and eq 23 will be used as an input of the motion induced energy requirement evaluation algorithm the amount of energy that the auv will consume throughout the trajectory was expressed as the sum of the energies it consumes while performing the straight path navigation e klinear and yaw movements around the z b axis e kangular for ψ equals zero and corresponding drag force f ψ 0 obtained from hydrodynamic analysis result which can be seen in fig 19c e klinear is evaluated as in eq 24 24 e k l i n e a r f ψ 0 d k k 1 2 m for ψ k data and corresponding drag force f ψ k obtained from hydrodynamic analysis result which can be seen in fig 19c e kangular is evaluated as in eq 25 25 e k a n g u l a r f ψ k b a u v ψ k π 180 k 1 2 m here ψ k transformed into radian unit and f ψ k have an impact on auv as a force couple in which the width size of auv b auv is the perpendicular distance between the forces the total

p a v g e t o t a l δ t e t o t a l u σ k 1 m d k here the linear velocity of auv is expressed by u since auv has two horizontal thrusters the total power requirement is halved for each of the two thrusters and expressed with p t for identified p t if the operating voltage v and battery capacity c batt in terms of ampere hour are known total corresponding amperage draw i batt gives the

by using the calculated power requirement information a detailed flow chart is presented in fig 6 which clarifies how the drag forces and geometric data obtained by the trajectory planning algorithm are utilized in the evaluation of energy requirement working parameters and performance parameters of the auv 4 hydrodynamic analysis 4 1 case study the cfd simulation was run on the first version of the demarine observer type auv prototype which is implemented in dokuz eylul university robotics laboratory for research in shallow water and observations on ship wetted surfaces demarine auv comprises of a main frame two vertical thrusters two horizontal thrusters a dry box with electronic hardware inside and a battery box as shown in fig 7 technical specifications of demarine auv are given in table 4 numerical results were presented with ansys fluent 19 1 commercial cfd software the following sections will include criteria such as the settings of the selected solver governing equations boundary conditions and mesh independence 4 2 flow model 4 2 1 governing equations the governing equations are continuity momentum and energy equations for specific boundary conditions of three dimensional time dependent incompressible fluids in underwater flow problems the continuity equation which ensures that the amount of substance entering the flow volume equals to the amount of substance at the outlet is defined as in eq 31 kim and park 2017 31 ρ t ρ u 0 here ρ and u represents the flow density and velocity respectively considering newton s second law the naiver stokes or

viscosity and body force respectively 4 2 2 turbulence modelling in engineering in the frame of nearly all practical applications flows are related to turbulence turbulence modelling has four main categories zero one and two equations models and stress transport models david c wilcox 2013 besides that turbulent flow calculations of cfd can be dealt with these models and simulations eddy viscosity models reynolds stress models large eddy simulations les direct numerical simulations dns panda 2019 speziale et al 1991 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 two equation models are used in common but recent approaches on turbulence modelling slide to reynolds stress models panda and warrior 2018 these models bring higher computational loads in contrast eddy viscosity models require less computational effort than reynolds stress models les and dns simulations da silva costa et al 2019 mishra and girimaji 2017 mitra et al 2019 in this study the realizable k ε model which is one of the eddy viscosity models was used as the turbulence model da silva costa et al 2017 this model is based on reynold averaged navier stokes rans approach that has been commonly adopted due to its scientifically proven abilities to be the most accurate approach to analyse the flow around the surface and underwater vehicles with less computational effort jagadeesh et al 2009 rattanasiri et al 2014 sarkar et al 1997 tang et al 2009 the realizable k ε model has two main differences from the standard k ε model in that it comprises alternative formulations for the turbulence viscosity and uses modified transport equations for the diffusion rate ε therewithal it has superiorities in terms of meeting certain mathematical constraints on reynolds stresses under turbulent flow conditions ansys fluent 2015 joung et al 2012 4 2 3 meshing and boundary conditions the flow domain was created as a symmetrical geometry which has a velocity input and atmospheric pressure output as shown in fig 8 mesh size and mesh form was adjusted to be finer in the areas close to critical points as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 boundary values configured before the initialization of the solver are shown in table 5 the cfd process flowchart is shown in fig 11 4 2 4 mesh independency within the scope of the analysis the mesh independency was calculated within the limits of sufficient accuracy by considering the calculation period the mesh independency analysis was realized for six mesh numbers in case of the 5 roll angle for the steady state phase of the model the study was carried out in different element numbers starting from 0 3 m elements until 3 m elements the non dimensional drag and lift coefficient used in the analysis can be defined as in eq 33 and eq 34 33 c d f x 1 2 ρ a u 2 34 c l f y 1 2 ρ a u 2 where a is the projection area of the auv c d and c l are drag and lift coefficients respectively as can be seen in fig 12 while the drag coefficient of auv shows irregular behaviour up to 0 75 m mesh number it was observed that after the convergence is achieved the results fit on a regular regime after convergence of mesh independency cfd analysis was carried out parametrically for the 2 m mesh number 4 2 5 numerical method validation validation is used to determine how accurately the modelled physical process works the confident use of numerical results is supplied by validation of the numerical models considering the numerical accuracy of the applied turbulence method validation is implemented in the underwater axisymmetric body named as afterbody 1 of jagadeesh et al 2009 afterbody 1 is an axisymmetric low drag body with a diameter of 0 14 m and the overall length of this body is 1 4 m in validation process the realizable k ε model is applied against experimental results with similar model domain setup of the current numerical analysis the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental values with acceptable errors validation results for the flow speed range of 0 4 1 4 m s are shown in fig 13 5 results and discussion corresponding slopes f k x k slope angles β k location of intersection nodes z k x z k y z k linear path distances d k and yaw angles ψ k with respect to derivation points p k were obtained as the output vectors of cubic spline curve fitting algorithm which was computerized and run with java as seen in table 6 at all intersection nodes z k maximum yaw angle value in ψ k data set resulting from trajectory planning reached up to ψ max 29 56 for this reason the hydrodynamic analysis settings were adjusted so that the φ and ψ angles were in the range of 0o 30 time dependent analysis was run for an angular rate around x b axis p 0 3 deg s and around zb axis r 0 3 deg s separately for roll and yaw rotations step times was adjusted to last at 10 s on the purpose of acquiring the angle range of 0o 30 on the time domain velocity distributions for roll angles of 5 10 15 20 25 30 around the auv inside the flow domain are illustrated as shown in fig 14 pressure distributions for roll angles of 5 10 15 20 25 30 around the auv inside the flow domain are illustrated as shown in fig 15 velocity distributions for yaw angles of 5 10 15 20 25 30 around the auv inside the flow domain are illustrated as shown in fig 16 pressure distributions for yaw angles of 5 10 15 20 25 30 around the auv inside the flow domain are illustrated as shown in fig 17 for roll rotation time and angular position dependent behaviour of hydrodynamic derivatives drag coefficients lift coefficients resulting forces and moments are given in fig 18 for yaw rotation time and angular position dependent behaviour of hydrodynamic derivatives drag coefficients lift coefficients resulting forces and moments are given in fig 19 as a result of the flow analysis carried out by the finite volume method it was observed that the magnitudes of drag coefficient c d and drag force f x have a slightly decreasing tendency the magnitudes of lift coefficient c l roll moment m x and lift force f y have a slightly increasing tendency in the change of roll angle between φ 0o 30 when the results are evaluated the alterations on the hydrodynamic parameters brought about by roll angle variations are negligibly low this is because the size of the projection area exposed to the flow of the auv is not dependent on the roll angle while the yaw angle was increasing from 0 to 30 degrees more distinct and significant changes were observed in the hydrodynamic derivatives with the increase in the yaw angle the magnitude of c d has an increasing tendency the magnitudes of f x and f y rise and c l changes in the 0 6 bandwidth m z increases during the yaw angle is between ψ 0o 15 remains around 1 5 nm during ψ 15o 23 and decreases during the during ψ 23o 30 presented cfd simulation results with different roll and yaw angles showed that the resistance effect created by the changes of yaw angle is far greater than the effect created by the roll angle for this reason the roll angle is not included in trajectory planning and energy calculation noticeable fluctuations in the early phases of the solution arise from the time dependent operation of the numerical solver the convergence time to the correct result lasts around 2 s cfd simulation was carried out using a 16 core dual processor unit with a processing capacity of 2 53 ghz the use of high capacity processors is known to enable more precise solutions by allowing to configure lower step size in the cfd solver setup therefore by using high processing capacity the initial state values of the time dependent solution can be obtained more accurately besides the simulation can be run in the range of 10 30 to eliminate inaccuracies that occur at the beginning phase of the 0o 30 degree range in the second half of the study f x ψ data set obtained from hydrodynamic analysis which can be seen in fig 19c d k and ψ k angle sets obtained from the trajectory planning phase which can be seen in table 6 constitute the input parameters for the motion induced energy requirement evaluation algorithm the energy modelling of the auv was computerized and run with matlab software outputs of f x ψ eklinear and ekangular are listed in table 7 here to avoid picking the incorrect value of fx ψ 0 inflicted from the initial phase instabilities of the computational solver the point where the trending line intersects the vertical axis was used as can be seen in fig 19c using the data in table 7 the total energy requirement for navigation from the beginning to the end of the trajectory calculated as etotal 1 78 kj considering the time of travel throughout the trajectory δt 18 17 s the need of average power is calculated as pavg 98 18 j s w which is halved by both horizontal thruster as p t 49 09 w in the process of development of demarine auv drive system it is planned to adopt bluerobotics t200 thrusters for performing of horizontal plane motions demarine auv currently supplies its power from 22 2 v 10 ah lithium polymer battery for identified p t and various operating voltages v corresponding rotation speed pwm amperage draw thrust force and efficiency values are received from bluerobotics t200 thruster s performance charts bluerobotics 2019 using the mentioned performance data the calculated discharge time of battery t batt and navigation range l nav are given in table 8 as can be seen in table 8 according to operating voltages ranging from 10 v to 20 v the discharge time of battery t batt and implicitly the duty period of auv vary from 1 03 h to 2 03 h the navigation range l nav 5 57 km 10 97 km and thrust efficiency η t 20 27 g w to 24 6 g w 6 conclusions the aim of this study was to determine the forces moments and hydrodynamic coefficients of an auv that travel at a constant speed in different angular positions in this way auv s energy consumption power requirements thrusters operating data navigational performance results could be evaluated it was revealed that the alterations in the yaw angle create significant changes in drag force lateral force and yaw moment this information will be used as a design and calculation criterion during the development of the propulsion systems of the related auv as it generates total and instantaneous power requirements during navigation and manoeuvring for this reason the determined resistance and moment values are necessary for obtaining actuator parameters that control yaw and roll positions the performance parameters based on the battery and thruster data provides optimum running configurations for auv to complete its mission in the frame of the following study using the obtained results it is planned to design and implement an adaptive controller architecture to adjust thruster parameters such as the rotational speed of propellers and angular positions of flaps in compliance with yaw and roll positions of

21443,jacket structures are generally recommended as the foundations for offshore wind turbines owts with water depth more than 30m in this paper the load sharing characteristic for typical jacket foundation owt is firstly analyzed it is found that the vertical soil resistance along the pile shaft namely the t z springs has the most significant contribution for the anti overturning moment of owt considering the effect of cyclic loadings a novel numerical calculation method is proposed based on a cyclic t z spring model to study the frequency change and accumulated inclination for owt structure in storm situations the novel calculation method for the evaluations of accumulated inclination and load sharing characteristic are verified by one centrifuge test furthermore a series of numerical studies using the novel calculation method are performed the results show that the accumulated inclination should be the controlling factor rather than the natural frequency in the design of jacket foundation owt considering cyclic loading effects for the load sharing characteristic under cyclic loadings the contribution of anti overturning moment by the t z springs decreases obviously this is mainly due to the continuous degradation of t z springs companied by gradual mobilization of the q z spring at the pile tip keywords jacket foundation owt cyclic loadings load sharing cyclic t z springs natural frequency accumulated inclination 1 introduction nowadays offshore wind energy is developing fast and shows the potential to account for a significant proportion of the global renewable energy production breton and moe 2009 pérez collazo et al 2015 for water depth less than 30m the monopile foundation is the most popular support structure for owts when the operating water depth exceeds 30m jacket foundation is recommended due to its economic efficiency and technical feasibility shi et al 2013a abhinav and saha 2015 2017 guo et al 2015 as a three dimensional space frame structure jacket foundation always has a higher stiffness compared to monopile foundation shi et al 2013a b abhinav and saha 2015 2017 the concept of the jacket foundation owts comes from the jacket platforms abhinav and saha 2015 2017 2018 in offshore oil and gas industry however there have been so far some differences between the jacket foundation owt and the jacket platform in oil and gas industry firstly the jacket foundation owt is a type of high rise structure with large overturning moment which is transferred to the piles mainly in axial loading form bhattacharya et al 2017 achmus et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 but for the jacket platform in oil and gas industry the overturning moment is relatively small and the lateral loading is the main loading form of the piles compared to the jacket platforms owt structures have strict requirements for the inclination and natural frequency according to the dnv guidelines dnv 2014 the natural frequency must locate in a narrow safety band between the rotor 1p and blade passing 3p frequencies and the permanent accumulated inclination at the foundation top should not exceed 0 25 accurate evaluations of the natural frequency and inclination are critical for the design of owt structure hurricane or typhoon occurs every year in many areas around the world especially for the western north pacific li et al 2013 emanuel et al 2008 the strength and stiffness of seabed soil will be degraded under these extreme cyclic loadings this will directly affect the interaction between pile and surrounding soil as well as dynamic responses of owt jacket foundation and should be considered adequately recently there have been some studies about the dynamic responses of owt jacket foundations shi et al 2013a 2013b 2015 saha et al 2014 abhinav and saha 2015 2017 but the assumption of elastic pile soil interactions was generally adopted which cannot reflect the soil degradation strength and stiffness induced by cyclic loadings according to nikitas et al 2017 the adoption of fully drained condition is reasonable for analyzing the accumulated deformation of owt in sandy seabed under cyclic loadings it is noted that zhu et al 2019 and kong et al 2019 performed a series of centrifuge tests to investigate the behavior of a jacket foundation for owt in sand but there still lacks effective method to evaluate the natural frequency change and accumulated inclination of owt jacket foundations after cyclic loadings the flowchart of analysis steps and structure for this paper is shown in fig 1 in section 2 the basic information for a typical jacket foundation owt is presented combining the traditional api springs api 2000 for pile soil interaction the load sharing characteristic for the jacket owt under cyclic loadings is analyzed using the fem software comsol comsol 2013 in section 3 the results show that the inclination of jacket foundation owt is mainly affected by the t z springs then in section 4 a novel numerical calculation method is proposed to investigate the natural frequency change and the evolution of accumulated inclination for owt jacket foundation with the cyclic loading effects being included by a cyclic t z spring zhou et al 2019 the presented calculation method is verified by one centrifuge test kong et al 2019 in section 5 later a series of numerical studies based on the proposed method are performed to investigate the evolutions of natural frequency change accumulated inclination and load sharing characteristic for jacket foundation owt in section 6 it is pointed out that the accumulated inclination should be the controlling factor rather than the natural frequency in the design of jacket foundation owt in storm situations 2 typical case of jacket foundation owt in sand a potential wind farm will be constructed in fujian sea area of china for which the water depth is generally more than 30m jacket foundation is recommended as the support structure for owt the silty and medium fine sand are widely distributed in the seabed of fujian in china southeast sea area the environment conditions for the potential offshore wind farm are shown in table 1 in this section a case study is performed to investigate the load sharing characteristic for typical jacket foundation owt 2 1 5 5 mw wind turbine and jacket structure the design sketch of the owt jacket foundation is depicted in fig 2 the myse mingyang smart energy 5 5 mw wind turbine is adopted and its main design parameters are listed in table 2 this wind turbine is supported by a tapering tower with length l t is 86 0m the tower diameter increases from 4 1 m at the top to 7 0 m at the base and the average thickness of tower wall is 35 mm a four legged jacket structure is designed which extends 20 0m above the mean sea level msl the bottom footprint of the jacket at the mudline is 22 m 22 m and the top footprint is 12 m 12 m the diameter and wall thickness of four piles are 1 8m and 30 mm respectively in this paper three cases for different pile lengths are presented the pile lengths are selected as 25m case 1 35m case 2 and 45m case 3 2 2 loads acting on offshore wind turbine structure the wind load on the turbine and tower is calculated using the commercial software bladed ndv gl 2016 by the turbine manufacturer according to iec iec 2009 the calculations consist 22 design load cases in which the yaw misalignment and control system tracking errors are taken into consideration the wind induced maximum moment at tower base m w ex t equals 180477 kn m mudline moment m w ex equals 352473 8 kn m among all the load cases under extreme loading condition the overturning moment acting on the jacket foundation induced by wave and current is calculated by the commercial software sacs karimi et al 2017 in the calculations the stream function wave theory is adopted and the drag added mass coefficients c d c m are taken as 1 05 1 2 according to api api 2000 the mudline moment m hy ex induced by hydraulic load wave and current is 94064 0 kn m under extreme loading condition based on an investigation of 15 offshore wind turbines from 12 european wind farms jalbi et al 2019a estimated the ratio m min m max m min is the minimum mudline moment and the maximum mudline moment m max m w ex m hy ex to study the loading pattern and the mudline moment is superposition of wind and wave loadings with different periods it is pointed out that for large wind turbines the ratio m min m max mostly lies in the range from 0 to about 0 50 under extreme loading condition this ratio range means one way loading case thus a type of one way cyclic loading cases for different pile lengths with m min m max 0 are presented in this paper it is assumed the mean mudline moment m m m max 2 according to yu et al 2008 the period of the turbulence wind under storm condition is approximately 30 0s and the wave period equals 10 1s based on the sea survey in the simulations the wind load and the hydraulic load are simplified into concentrated forces red nodes in fig 3 according to the principle of equal mudline moment the loading direction is set to be diagonal along the jacket structure to simulate the most unfavorable loading condition fig 4 shows the loading path of the wind load or the hydraulic load in the simulations at the start a constant load mean load f m which increases linearly within time t 1 t 1 60s as the foundation settlement reaches stable state is exerted on the jacket foundation owt then the cyclic load with an amplitude f a is applied with a duration time n t according to the national recommendation for the pile design from france alain and jacques 2017 for cyclic events such as a storm the equivalent number of loading cycles with n eq 100 can be considered cautiously thus the maximum loading cycles n max 100 is adopted in this paper after a certain number of loading cycles n the loads reduce to 0 and the jacket foundation calms down with an artificial damping for 60s finally the normal operation load f nr wind induced mudline moment m w nr 117911 1 kn m and hydraulic mudline moment m hy nr 19869 7 kn m is applied to simulate the re operation process of owt correspondingly three special states are defined in the loading path marked in fig 4 which are the initial state point a calm down state point b and re operation state point c 3 traditional calculation method considering pile soil interaction as shown in fig 1 the traditional api springs for pile soil interaction and the load sharing characteristic for jacket foundation owt are described in this section 3 1 api springs for pile soil interaction api 2000 the assumption of elastic pile soil interactions is adopted for the springs in api code the p y q z springs are independent and located along pile shaft representing the pile soil lateral resistance and the axial pile tip resistance respectively the api p y spring for sand is expressed as 1 p a p u tanh k x a p u y where p is the lateral soil resistance a is the factor for cyclic loading p u is the ultimate bearing capacity k is the initial modulus of subgrade reaction x is the depth y is the lateral deflection the api t z spring for sand can be expressed as 2 τ max k 0 σ z tan δ where τ max is the ultimate strength of the pile soil interface k 0 1 is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure considering the soil squeezing effect of driven pile api 2000 σ z is the effective vertical stress δ is the interface friction angle between pile and soil the api q z spring for sand is expressed as 3 q σ tip n q 4 q max q a tip where q is the unit end bearing n q is the dimensionless bearing capacity factor q max is the ultimate resistance of q z spring a tip is the area of pile tip in this paper the seabed is assumed to be medium sand and the parameters for p y t z q z springs in api are presented in table 3 3 2 load sharing characteristic for jacket foundation owt as shown in fig 5 a the environment loads and the resistances from soil are both imposed on the owt jacket foundation for convenience the jacket foundation is divided into two parts at the mudline the one is jacket structure fig 5 b and the other is four piles it is shown that there exists shear force f pi axial force f npi and section moment m pi at the cross sections at pile heads the section moment m pi equals the sum moment of the horizontal forces from the discrete p y springs along pile i thus the overturning moment at the mudline can be calculated through the pile resistances 5 m over i 1 4 m pi i 1 2 2 2 f npi l f where l f is the jacket bottom footprint i 1 2 represent the back pile and front pile respectively i 3 4 represent the two middle piles the sharing percentages of overturning moment from the p y t z q z springs are defined as p p y p t z p q z 6 p p y i 1 4 m pi m over 7 p t z i 1 2 j 1 n 2 2 t ij π d h ij l f m over 8 p q z i 1 2 2 2 q i l f m over where t ij is the interface resistance of element j for pile i h ij is the height of element j for pile i q i is the pile tip resistance of pile i in the numerical calculations the generalized α method is adopted to discretize the time domain the newton raphson method is used to solve the governing equations iteratively to guarantee the request of convergence the time step δ t should satisfy 9 δ t l e ρ p where l is the length of the minimum element the elastic modulus of pile materiel e 210 gpa and ρ p 7850 kg m3 is the density of pile material the overturning moment acting on the owt is jointly resisted by p y t z q z springs the sharing percentages of the three components for case 1 2 and 3 are shown in fig 6 it can be found that the sharing percentage by t z springs is larger than the other two components obviously in case 1 the average sharing percentage by t z springs is 77 6 and increases to 90 6 93 9 in case 2 3 respectively by comparison the average sharing percentage by q z spring decreases from 17 3 in case 1 4 4 1 1 in case 2 3 respectively it also can be seen that the fluctuation of q z spring contribution decreases with the increase of pile length there are no obvious differences of the p y springs sharing percentage for different pile lengths it can be concluded that the responses of the overturning inclination of owt jacket foundation under cyclic loadings are mainly affected by t z springs which is investigated in the following sections 4 novel numerical calculation method considering cyclic loadings in this section a novel calculation method for jacket foundation owt considering cyclic loadings is proposed the detailed calculation procedure novel cyclic t z spring and related parameter calibration method are presented as shown in fig 1 4 1 calculation procedure due to the significant effect of t z springs on the inclination of jacket foundation owt in sand a cyclic t z spring model presented by the authors zhou et al 2019 is adopted to improve the traditional calculation method the p y q z springs in api are still adopted for simplification the detailed calculation steps can be described as follows step 1 program pile soil interaction springs p y t z q z into fem software comsol and establish the numerical model of jacket foundation owt step 2 select the characteristic depths along the pile confirm the boundary conditions and the cyclic shear amplitudes details are shown in sections 4 3 2 and 4 3 3 step 3 perform the cyclic interface shear tests under constant normal stiffness cns condition and the parameters for the cyclic t z spring are calibrated step 4 simulate the dynamic responses of the owt under cyclic loadings using the calibrated cyclic t z spring api p y and q z springs 4 2 cyclic t z spring reflecting the cyclic degradation of interface the cyclic t z spring model is based on the boundary surface theory dafalias 1986 li 2002 and can reflect the cyclic degradation of pile soil interface strength there are 7 parameters in the model and all of them can be calibrated by the cyclic interface shear test under cyclic loadings the shrink of the strength boundary surface will be occurred and the interface strength will be degraded correspondingly the basic introduction about the novel cyclic t z spring model can be found in the appendix 4 3 calibration of the cyclic t z spring the pile soil interface behavior under cyclic loadings is affected by sand type interface roughness depth shear amplitude etc therefore for a specified case the cyclic t z spring should be calibrated based on the corresponding cyclic interface shear test in this section the detailed calibration process and results are presented 4 3 1 sand sample steel interface and the interface shear apparatus typical in situ medium fine sand taken from the potential offshore wind farm is used in the calibration tests the particle gradation curve is shown in fig 7 and the mean particle diameter d 50 equals 0 28 mm and the relative density d r is 60 the maximum void ratio e max and minimum void ratio e min are 0 905 and 0 454 respectively the internal friction angle at the critical state is 37 the steel 1045 in the us standard is used as the interface in the tests the tensile strength of the steel is not less than 600 mpa and the elastic modulus is 210 gpa air abrading is used to control the surface roughness of the steel interface before each test the initial interface roughness is within 3 2 0 1 μm which represents the surface feature of the least rusted pipe pile ruben et al 2018 the interface shear tests are carried out using the interface ring shear apparatus rui et al 2020a 2020b as shown in fig 8 a the apparatus mainly includes the shear ring force transmission rod control motor air cylinder force sensor torque sensor angle sensor and other elements the diameters of the outer and inner ring are 300 mm and 200 mm respectively the shear speed is set to be 5 mm min sadrekarimi and olson 2010 sadrekarimi 2009 the mechanism characteristic diagram of the sand sample in the apparatus is shown in fig 8 b the sand sample suffers a normal stress on the top surface with the cns condition details are introduced in section 4 3 2 and the shear stress is transferred from the sand steel interface to the sand sample under cyclic shearing 4 3 2 characteristic depths and boundary conditions in calibration tests the piles in case 2 3 of jacket foundation are divided into four segments as shown in fig 9 and the pile in case 1 is divided into three segments each segment length is recommended less than 10m also adopted by poulos 1989 unless the shear amplitude is too small to induce interface strength degradation in each segment one characteristic depth is selected to represent the degradation features in this segment under cyclic loadings selected characteristic depths are 5 0 10 0 20 0 30 0m respectively the normal boundary condition of pile shaft can be simulated by the initial normal stress coupled with a constant stiffness spring zheng and kutter 2019 dejong et al 2003 2006 the initial normal stress σ n 0 at a selected characteristic depth z can be calculated by 10 σ n 0 γ z k 0 where γ is the soil effective weight according to previous works dejong et al 2003 2006 the spring stiffness k is 11 k 4 g d where g is the operative shear stiffness of the far field soil combining the empirical formulas in eqs 12 and 13 form hardine and drnevich 1972 the spring stiffnesses at the selected characteristic depths can be calculated the details of boundary conditions are shown in table 4 12 g 22 k 2 max p a σ m 13 σ m 1 3 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 where k 2 max is the coefficient related to the relative density d r hardine and drnevich 1972 p a is the atmospheric pressure σ m is the mean effective stress σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the effective first second and third principal stresses respectively 4 3 3 calibrations of the cyclic t z spring a series of calibration tests are performed with the boundary conditions in table 4 the cyclic shear amplitudes can be preliminarily evaluated using the p y t z and q z springs from api during cyclic shearing the interface strength shows obvious degradation due to normal stress reduction caused by soil contraction in the shear band dejong et al 2003 2006 in each test the lower limit of the normal stress is set to be the initial geo stress which can be calculated using eq 10 with k 0 1 sinϕ the related calibrated parameters for the cyclic t z spring are shown in table 5 as an illustration the comparisons between the cyclic interface shear tests and the simulations of case 2 are shown in fig 10 generally the interface degradation features can be well reflected in the simulation including interface strength and stiffness more details about the calibration process can refer to zhou et al 2019 5 verification of the novel numerical calculation method as shown in fig 1 one centrifuge test by kong et al 2019 is used to verify the novel calculation method in this section and the diagram of the centrifuge test is shown in fig 11 the cyclic loading test of jacket foundation is performed at 100g the model pile is instrumented and coated with a layer of epoxy on the surface for the model pile its outer diameter is 0 0259 m and its length is 0 6m pile embedment length is 0 55m and the spacing s of the piles is 0 15m the fujian standard sand is used in the centrifuge test and its mean particle size d 50 is 0 17 mm internal friction angle ϕ is 35 and relatively density d r is approximately 60 during the centrifuge test a concentrated horizontal cyclic load is applied at the jacket foundation top the constant component of the cyclic load is 0 1h ult and the amplitude of the cyclic component is 0 1h ult as well h ult 16 mn is the horizontal bearing capacity of jacket foundation and the cyclic loading period is 5s to compare with the centrifuge test four cyclic interface shear tests between the epoxy surface and the fujian standard sand are conducted in the calibrations the deepest characteristic depth is set to be 30m below which the cyclic shear displacement amplitudes are too small less than 0 05 mm to cause interface strength degradation the calibrated parameters for the cyclic t z spring are shown in table 6 fig 12 a shows the relationships between the horizontal load and the horizontal displacement at the jacket foundation top in centrifuge test and the simulation the simulation duration is up to 100 loading cycles to make it clearly the first 10 cycles and the last 10 cycles are shown in fig 12 b c for the first 10 cycles the simulation coincides well with the centrifuge test both accumulated displacement and stiffness for the last 10 cycles the accumulated displacement can be well predicted in the simulation but the stiffness in the simulation is a little less than the test result this is probably due to the densification of sand around the piles in the test kong et al 2019 in addition the overturning moment sharing percentage of p y t z q z springs is compared between the centrifuge test and the simulation which is shown in table 7 it can be seen that the contribution from t z and q z springs is over 90 and the contribution from p y spring is less than 10 for both the test and simulation by comparison the contribution from p y spring in the test is larger than the percentage in the simulation and the contribution from t z q z springs in the test is smaller than the percentage in the simulation the reason for this should be that the p y spring in api used in the simulation overestimates the initial stiffness the development rate of the p y resistance is faster in the simulation compared to the centrifuge test from the above comparison it approves the reliability of the novel calculation method to evaluate the dynamic responses of jacket foundation owt 6 simulation and discussion in this section a series of numerical simulations for the jacket foundation owt under cyclic loadings are performed using the proposed novel calculation method as shown in fig 1 the jacket foundation owt and the loading conditions are introduced in section 2 1 2 2 the simulation results about the evolutions of natural frequency accumulated inclination and load shearing characteristic are presented and discussed thoroughly 6 1 natural frequency of the jacket foundation owt in this section the three states a b c defined in section 2 2 are selected to evaluate the natural frequency changes of the jacket foundation owt the pile head stiffnesses in horizontal vertical and rotational directions of the front middle and back piles are obtained from the simulation results by including the total stiffness of all pile heads the natural frequencies of the jacket foundation owt after different loading cycles are calculated fig 13 it can be seen that the natural frequencies of calm down sate b are larger than the natural frequencies of re operation state c because of the non linear relationship of the pile soil interaction without the cyclic loading effects n 0 there are no obvious differences of the natural frequencies for the three different pile lengths however considering the cyclic effects the natural frequency at the re operation state in case 1 drops sharply to 0 198hz with n 5 the safe natural frequency band required by the turbine manufacturer ranges from 0 24hz to 0 48hz thus pile length in case 1 cannot meet the frequency requirement and no further calculations are performed for the natural frequencies in case 2 3 some fluctuations appear among the whole cyclic loading process but the differences are not obvious the differences of frequencies for different loading cycles are within 2 5 2 1 in case 2 3 respectively it can be seen that with long pile length 35m 45m jacket foundation owt shows high stability in natural frequency but as the pile length decreases there exists a sudden drop of the natural frequency due to the mode change this phenomenon is supported by the work of jalbia et al 2019b 6 2 accumulated deformation of the jacket foundation owt 6 2 1 shape evolutions of the jacket foundation central axis after different loading cycles the jacket foundation owt calms down and then is reloaded to normal operation condition at the re operation state the shape evolutions of the jacket foundation central axis fig 3 are analyzed for different loading cycles as shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the jacket foundation shows the tendency to overturning the displacement value and growth rate in case 2 are obvious larger than these in case 3 after 100 loading cycles the accumulated displacement in case 2 reaches 0 47 m at jacket foundation top while only 0 20m in case 3 in addition in case 3 the displacement value is negative deformation direction is opposite the loading direction when n 0 the reason for this is that the unbalanced gravity of turbine plays the main role for the deformation behavior in this situation 6 2 2 accumulated inclination of the jacket foundation fig 15 shows the change of the accumulated inclination absolutely rotation at the jacket foundation top after different loading cycles in case 2 3 for n 0 there is still some degree of inclination because of the unbalanced turbine gravity at the hub after different loading cycles the calm down state inclination and the re operation state inclination are also presented in case 2 it can be found that the growth rate of the accumulated inclination increases firstly and then decreases the inclination has already exceeded the deformation criterion 0 25 after n 60 after 100 loading cycles the accumulated inclination at the re operation state reaches 0 403 by comparison in case 3 the value of accumulated inclination at the re operation state is only 0 189 when n 100 but there also shows an abrupt increase after n 60 combining the natural frequency evolution in section 6 1 it can be found that the accumulated inclination has already exceeded the requirement although the natural frequency change is minor in case 2 in addition in case 1 the accumulated inclination at jacket foundation top under the re operation state after 5 loading cycles is only 0 05 while the natural frequency drops out of the safe bound obviously it can be inferred that the accumulated inclination in case 1 must be larger than the accumulated inclination in case 2 also exceeds the deformation criterion therefore the accumulated inclination should be the controlling factor in the design of jacket foundation owt rather than the natural frequency 6 3 load sharing characteristic under cyclic loadings 6 3 1 sharing of the overturning moment the load sharing characteristic is analyzed under the re operation state after cyclic loadings fig 16 shows the overturning moment sharing percentages of p y t z and q z springs for case 2 3 over the 100 loading cycles in case 2 the sharing percentage by t z springs decreases from 96 7 to 39 6 while the contribution by q z springs increases from 0 03 to 123 1 obvious interface strength degradation appears in the t z springs under the cyclic loadings fig 17 shows the resistances of t z q z springs for front pile and back pile it can be seen in fig 17 a that under the gravity g t is gravity transferred from tower base g j is the jacket structure gravity the directions of t z springs resistances of front back piles are both upward when the jacket foundation suffers the extreme loadings fig 17 b the jacket foundation intends to rotate clockwise so the directions of t z spring resistance are upward and downward for front pile and back pile respectively the moment contributed by the t z springs resistances is counter clockwise positive in the later re operation state fig 17 c the overturning moment decreases and the q z spring of the front pile shows amount of rebound which probably causes the direction reverse of t z springs resistances in this case the moment contributed by the t z springs resistances may tend to be clockwise negative as shown in fig 16 b in case 3 after 100 loading cycles the contribution by t z springs decreases from 96 9 to 33 5 and the contribution by q z springs increases from 0 0004 to 58 1 for the contribution by p y springs it increases slowly and the values reach 16 6 8 4 respectively for case 2 3 for the jacket foundation owt its inclination behavior is dominated by the t z springs in early stage while the cyclic degradation of the pile soil interface strength is not obvious in the later stage of the extreme cyclic loadings the overturning behavior is governed by the q z springs 6 3 2 sharing of the axial load the axial load sharing percentages of the four piles are plotted in fig 18 for the front pile in both case 2 and case 3 the contributions of axial load by t z springs decrease rapidly in case 2 after 100 loading cycles the t z springs contribution decreases to 20 due to the elastic rebound of q z springs and the bearing mode transfers from friction to end bearing in case 2 3 the middle piles are always bearing compression forces over the whole loading cycles the contributions by t z springs decrease obviously after 100 loading cycles the t z springs contributions decrease from 99 7 to 54 4 for case 2 and from 99 8 to 73 6 for case 3 the bearing mode is transferred from friction to friction end bearing for the back pile in the two cases the contributions by t z springs decrease firstly because some settlements occur then the t z springs contributions increase to 100 because the piles are up lift under cyclic loadings the front and middle piles are compression piles which have the tendency to move downward for the back pile it is tension pile and the movement direction is upward therefore the inclination of jacket foundation owt is induced by the opposite movement directions of the back pile and the other three piles 7 conclusions based on a cyclic t z spring model a novel numerical calculation method is proposed to evaluate the dynamic responses of jacket foundation owts in sand under cyclic loadings numerical studies are performed to investigate the evolutions of natural frequency accumulated inclination and load sharing characteristic of the jacket foundation owt the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the overturning moment acting on the jacket foundation owt is jointly resisted by p y t z and q z springs the sharing percentage by t z springs is obvious larger than the other two components the overturn inclination behavior of jacket foundation owt is mainly affected by t z springs 2 a novel numerical calculation method is proposed to consider the cyclic loading effects for jacket foundation owt under storm the proposed method includes the pile segment discretization calibration method for piles with different depths using cyclic interface shear tests p y q z and cyclic t z springs and the complete calculation procedure later the proposed method is verified by one centrifuge test which shows the accumulated inclination of jacket foundation under cyclic loadings can be well predicted by the proposed method 3 the accumulated inclination should be the controlling factor rather than the natural frequency for the design of jacket foundation owt in storm situations in engineering 4 under cyclic loadings the overturn moment sharing percentage by t z springs decreases from over 90 to even a negative value the inclination behavior of jacket foundation owt is dominated by the t z springs in early stage during which the cyclic degradation of the pile soil interface resistance is not obvious in the later stage of the extreme cyclic loadings the overturning behavior is governed by the q z springs for the axial load the contributions by t z springs decrease rapidly for the front and middle piles whose bearing mode changes from shaft friction to end bearing gradually credit authorship contribution statement lizhong wang conceptualization methodology project administration wenjie zhou data curation writing original draft software

21443,jacket structures are generally recommended as the foundations for offshore wind turbines owts with water depth more than 30m in this paper the load sharing characteristic for typical jacket foundation owt is firstly analyzed it is found that the vertical soil resistance along the pile shaft namely the t z springs has the most significant contribution for the anti overturning moment of owt considering the effect of cyclic loadings a novel numerical calculation method is proposed based on a cyclic t z spring model to study the frequency change and accumulated inclination for owt structure in storm situations the novel calculation method for the evaluations of accumulated inclination and load sharing characteristic are verified by one centrifuge test furthermore a series of numerical studies using the novel calculation method are performed the results show that the accumulated inclination should be the controlling factor rather than the natural frequency in the design of jacket foundation owt considering cyclic loading effects for the load sharing characteristic under cyclic loadings the contribution of anti overturning moment by the t z springs decreases obviously this is mainly due to the continuous degradation of t z springs companied by gradual mobilization of the q z spring at the pile tip keywords jacket foundation owt cyclic loadings load sharing cyclic t z springs natural frequency accumulated inclination 1 introduction nowadays offshore wind energy is developing fast and shows the potential to account for a significant proportion of the global renewable energy production breton and moe 2009 pérez collazo et al 2015 for water depth less than 30m the monopile foundation is the most popular support structure for owts when the operating water depth exceeds 30m jacket foundation is recommended due to its economic efficiency and technical feasibility shi et al 2013a abhinav and saha 2015 2017 guo et al 2015 as a three dimensional space frame structure jacket foundation always has a higher stiffness compared to monopile foundation shi et al 2013a b abhinav and saha 2015 2017 the concept of the jacket foundation owts comes from the jacket platforms abhinav and saha 2015 2017 2018 in offshore oil and gas industry however there have been so far some differences between the jacket foundation owt and the jacket platform in oil and gas industry firstly the jacket foundation owt is a type of high rise structure with large overturning moment which is transferred to the piles mainly in axial loading form bhattacharya et al 2017 achmus et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 but for the jacket platform in oil and gas industry the overturning moment is relatively small and the lateral loading is the main loading form of the piles compared to the jacket platforms owt structures have strict requirements for the inclination and natural frequency according to the dnv guidelines dnv 2014 the natural frequency must locate in a narrow safety band between the rotor 1p and blade passing 3p frequencies and the permanent accumulated inclination at the foundation top should not exceed 0 25 accurate evaluations of the natural frequency and inclination are critical for the design of owt structure hurricane or typhoon occurs every year in many areas around the world especially for the western north pacific li et al 2013 emanuel et al 2008 the strength and stiffness of seabed soil will be degraded under these extreme cyclic loadings this will directly affect the interaction between pile and surrounding soil as well as dynamic responses of owt jacket foundation and should be considered adequately recently there have been some studies about the dynamic responses of owt jacket foundations shi et al 2013a 2013b 2015 saha et al 2014 abhinav and saha 2015 2017 but the assumption of elastic pile soil interactions was generally adopted which cannot reflect the soil degradation strength and stiffness induced by cyclic loadings according to nikitas et al 2017 the adoption of fully drained condition is reasonable for analyzing the accumulated deformation of owt in sandy seabed under cyclic loadings it is noted that zhu et al 2019 and kong et al 2019 performed a series of centrifuge tests to investigate the behavior of a jacket foundation for owt in sand but there still lacks effective method to evaluate the natural frequency change and accumulated inclination of owt jacket foundations after cyclic loadings the flowchart of analysis steps and structure for this paper is shown in fig 1 in section 2 the basic information for a typical jacket foundation owt is presented combining the traditional api springs api 2000 for pile soil interaction the load sharing characteristic for the jacket owt under cyclic loadings is analyzed using the fem software comsol comsol 2013 in section 3 the results show that the inclination of jacket foundation owt is mainly affected by the t z springs then in section 4 a novel numerical calculation method is proposed to investigate the natural frequency change and the evolution of accumulated inclination for owt jacket foundation with the cyclic loading effects being included by a cyclic t z spring zhou et al 2019 the presented calculation method is verified by one centrifuge test kong et al 2019 in section 5 later a series of numerical studies based on the proposed method are performed to investigate the evolutions of natural frequency change accumulated inclination and load sharing characteristic for jacket foundation owt in section 6 it is pointed out that the accumulated inclination should be the controlling factor rather than the natural frequency in the design of jacket foundation owt in storm situations 2 typical case of jacket foundation owt in sand a potential wind farm will be constructed in fujian sea area of china for which the water depth is generally more than 30m jacket foundation is recommended as the support structure for owt the silty and medium fine sand are widely distributed in the seabed of fujian in china southeast sea area the environment conditions for the potential offshore wind farm are shown in table 1 in this section a case study is performed to investigate the load sharing characteristic for typical jacket foundation owt 2 1 5 5 mw wind turbine and jacket structure the design sketch of the owt jacket foundation is depicted in fig 2 the myse mingyang smart energy 5 5 mw wind turbine is adopted and its main design parameters are listed in table 2 this wind turbine is supported by a tapering tower with length l t is 86 0m the tower diameter increases from 4 1 m at the top to 7 0 m at the base and the average thickness of tower wall is 35 mm a four legged jacket structure is designed which extends 20 0m above the mean sea level msl the bottom footprint of the jacket at the mudline is 22 m 22 m and the top footprint is 12 m 12 m the diameter and wall thickness of four piles are 1 8m and 30 mm respectively in this paper three cases for different pile lengths are presented the pile lengths are selected as 25m case 1 35m case 2 and 45m case 3 2 2 loads acting on offshore wind turbine structure the wind load on the turbine and tower is calculated using the commercial software bladed ndv gl 2016 by the turbine manufacturer according to iec iec 2009 the calculations consist 22 design load cases in which the yaw misalignment and control system tracking errors are taken into consideration the wind induced maximum moment at tower base m w ex t equals 180477 kn m mudline moment m w ex equals 352473 8 kn m among all the load cases under extreme loading condition the overturning moment acting on the jacket foundation induced by wave and current is calculated by the commercial software sacs karimi et al 2017 in the calculations the stream function wave theory is adopted and the drag added mass coefficients c d c m are taken as 1 05 1 2 according to api api 2000 the mudline moment m hy ex induced by hydraulic load wave and current is 94064 0 kn m under extreme loading condition based on an investigation of 15 offshore wind turbines from 12 european wind farms jalbi et al 2019a estimated the ratio m min m max m min is the minimum mudline moment and the maximum mudline moment m max m w ex m hy ex to study the loading pattern and the mudline moment is superposition of wind and wave loadings with different periods it is pointed out that for large wind turbines the ratio m min m max mostly lies in the range from 0 to about 0 50 under extreme loading condition this ratio range means one way loading case thus a type of one way cyclic loading cases for different pile lengths with m min m max 0 are presented in this paper it is assumed the mean mudline moment m m m max 2 according to yu et al 2008 the period of the turbulence wind under storm condition is approximately 30 0s and the wave period equals 10 1s based on the sea survey in the simulations the wind load and the hydraulic load are simplified into concentrated forces red nodes in fig 3 according to the principle of equal mudline moment the loading direction is set to be diagonal along the jacket structure to simulate the most unfavorable loading condition fig 4 shows the loading path of the wind load or the hydraulic load in the simulations at the start a constant load mean load f m which increases linearly within time t 1 t 1 60s as the foundation settlement reaches stable state is exerted on the jacket foundation owt then the cyclic load with an amplitude f a is applied with a duration time n t according to the national recommendation for the pile design from france alain and jacques 2017 for cyclic events such as a storm the equivalent number of loading cycles with n eq 100 can be considered cautiously thus the maximum loading cycles n max 100 is adopted in this paper after a certain number of loading cycles n the loads reduce to 0 and the jacket foundation calms down with an artificial damping for 60s finally the normal operation load f nr wind induced mudline moment m w nr 117911 1 kn m and hydraulic mudline moment m hy nr 19869 7 kn m is applied to simulate the re operation process of owt correspondingly three special states are defined in the loading path marked in fig 4 which are the initial state point a calm down state point b and re operation state point c 3 traditional calculation method considering pile soil interaction as shown in fig 1 the traditional api springs for pile soil interaction and the load sharing characteristic for jacket foundation owt are described in this section 3 1 api springs for pile soil interaction api 2000 the assumption of elastic pile soil interactions is adopted for the springs in api code the p y q z springs are independent and located along pile shaft representing the pile soil lateral resistance and the axial pile tip resistance respectively the api p y spring for sand is expressed as 1 p a p u tanh k x a p u y where p is the lateral soil resistance a is the factor for cyclic loading p u is the ultimate bearing capacity k is the initial modulus of subgrade reaction x is the depth y is the lateral deflection the api t z spring for sand can be expressed as 2 τ max k 0 σ z tan δ where τ max is the ultimate strength of the pile soil interface k 0 1 is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure considering the soil squeezing effect of driven pile api 2000 σ z is the effective vertical stress δ is the interface friction angle between pile and soil the api q z spring for sand is expressed as 3 q σ tip n q 4 q max q a tip where q is the unit end bearing n q is the dimensionless bearing capacity factor q max is the ultimate resistance of q z spring a tip is the area of pile tip in this paper the seabed is assumed to be medium sand and the parameters for p y t z q z springs in api are presented in table 3 3 2 load sharing characteristic for jacket foundation owt as shown in fig 5 a the environment loads and the resistances from soil are both imposed on the owt jacket foundation for convenience the jacket foundation is divided into two parts at the mudline the one is jacket structure fig 5 b and the other is four piles it is shown that there exists shear force f pi axial force f npi and section moment m pi at the cross sections at pile heads the section moment m pi equals the sum moment of the horizontal forces from the discrete p y springs along pile i thus the overturning moment at the mudline can be calculated through the pile resistances 5 m over i 1 4 m pi i 1 2 2 2 f npi l f where l f is the jacket bottom footprint i 1 2 represent the back pile and front pile respectively i 3 4 represent the two middle piles the sharing percentages of overturning moment from the p y t z q z springs are defined as p p y p t z p q z 6 p p y i 1 4 m pi m over 7 p t z i 1 2 j 1 n 2 2 t ij π d h ij l f m over 8 p q z i 1 2 2 2 q i l f m over where t ij is the interface resistance of element j for pile i h ij is the height of element j for pile i q i is the pile tip resistance of pile i in the numerical calculations the generalized α method is adopted to discretize the time domain the newton raphson method is used to solve the governing equations iteratively to guarantee the request of convergence the time step δ t should satisfy 9 δ t l e ρ p where l is the length of the minimum element the elastic modulus of pile materiel e 210 gpa and ρ p 7850 kg m3 is the density of pile material the overturning moment acting on the owt is jointly resisted by p y t z q z springs the sharing percentages of the three components for case 1 2 and 3 are shown in fig 6 it can be found that the sharing percentage by t z springs is larger than the other two components obviously in case 1 the average sharing percentage by t z springs is 77 6 and increases to 90 6 93 9 in case 2 3 respectively by comparison the average sharing percentage by q z spring decreases from 17 3 in case 1 4 4 1 1 in case 2 3 respectively it also can be seen that the fluctuation of q z spring contribution decreases with the increase of pile length there are no obvious differences of the p y springs sharing percentage for different pile lengths it can be concluded that the responses of the overturning inclination of owt jacket foundation under cyclic loadings are mainly affected by t z springs which is investigated in the following sections 4 novel numerical calculation method considering cyclic loadings in this section a novel calculation method for jacket foundation owt considering cyclic loadings is proposed the detailed calculation procedure novel cyclic t z spring and related parameter calibration method are presented as shown in fig 1 4 1 calculation procedure due to the significant effect of t z springs on the inclination of jacket foundation owt in sand a cyclic t z spring model presented by the authors zhou et al 2019 is adopted to improve the traditional calculation method the p y q z springs in api are still adopted for simplification the detailed calculation steps can be described as follows step 1 program pile soil interaction springs p y t z q z into fem software comsol and establish the numerical model of jacket foundation owt step 2 select the characteristic depths along the pile confirm the boundary conditions and the cyclic shear amplitudes details are shown in sections 4 3 2 and 4 3 3 step 3 perform the cyclic interface shear tests under constant normal stiffness cns condition and the parameters for the cyclic t z spring are calibrated step 4 simulate the dynamic responses of the owt under cyclic loadings using the calibrated cyclic t z spring api p y and q z springs 4 2 cyclic t z spring reflecting the cyclic degradation of interface the cyclic t z spring model is based on the boundary surface theory dafalias 1986 li 2002 and can reflect the cyclic degradation of pile soil interface strength there are 7 parameters in the model and all of them can be calibrated by the cyclic interface shear test under cyclic loadings the shrink of the strength boundary surface will be occurred and the interface strength will be degraded correspondingly the basic introduction about the novel cyclic t z spring model can be found in the appendix 4 3 calibration of the cyclic t z spring the pile soil interface behavior under cyclic loadings is affected by sand type interface roughness depth shear amplitude etc therefore for a specified case the cyclic t z spring should be calibrated based on the corresponding cyclic interface shear test in this section the detailed calibration process and results are presented 4 3 1 sand sample steel interface and the interface shear apparatus typical in situ medium fine sand taken from the potential offshore wind farm is used in the calibration tests the particle gradation curve is shown in fig 7 and the mean particle diameter d 50 equals 0 28 mm and the relative density d r is 60 the maximum void ratio e max and minimum void ratio e min are 0 905 and 0 454 respectively the internal friction angle at the critical state is 37 the steel 1045 in the us standard is used as the interface in the tests the tensile strength of the steel is not less than 600 mpa and the elastic modulus is 210 gpa air abrading is used to control the surface roughness of the steel interface before each test the initial interface roughness is within 3 2 0 1 μm which represents the surface feature of the least rusted pipe pile ruben et al 2018 the interface shear tests are carried out using the interface ring shear apparatus rui et al 2020a 2020b as shown in fig 8 a the apparatus mainly includes the shear ring force transmission rod control motor air cylinder force sensor torque sensor angle sensor and other elements the diameters of the outer and inner ring are 300 mm and 200 mm respectively the shear speed is set to be 5 mm min sadrekarimi and olson 2010 sadrekarimi 2009 the mechanism characteristic diagram of the sand sample in the apparatus is shown in fig 8 b the sand sample suffers a normal stress on the top surface with the cns condition details are introduced in section 4 3 2 and the shear stress is transferred from the sand steel interface to the sand sample under cyclic shearing 4 3 2 characteristic depths and boundary conditions in calibration tests the piles in case 2 3 of jacket foundation are divided into four segments as shown in fig 9 and the pile in case 1 is divided into three segments each segment length is recommended less than 10m also adopted by poulos 1989 unless the shear amplitude is too small to induce interface strength degradation in each segment one characteristic depth is selected to represent the degradation features in this segment under cyclic loadings selected characteristic depths are 5 0 10 0 20 0 30 0m respectively the normal boundary condition of pile shaft can be simulated by the initial normal stress coupled with a constant stiffness spring zheng and kutter 2019 dejong et al 2003 2006 the initial normal stress σ n 0 at a selected characteristic depth z can be calculated by 10 σ n 0 γ z k 0 where γ is the soil effective weight according to previous works dejong et al 2003 2006 the spring stiffness k is 11 k 4 g d where g is the operative shear stiffness of the far field soil combining the empirical formulas in eqs 12 and 13 form hardine and drnevich 1972 the spring stiffnesses at the selected characteristic depths can be calculated the details of boundary conditions are shown in table 4 12 g 22 k 2 max p a σ m 13 σ m 1 3 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 where k 2 max is the coefficient related to the relative density d r hardine and drnevich 1972 p a is the atmospheric pressure σ m is the mean effective stress σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the effective first second and third principal stresses respectively 4 3 3 calibrations of the cyclic t z spring a series of calibration tests are performed with the boundary conditions in table 4 the cyclic shear amplitudes can be preliminarily evaluated using the p y t z and q z springs from api during cyclic shearing the interface strength shows obvious degradation due to normal stress reduction caused by soil contraction in the shear band dejong et al 2003 2006 in each test the lower limit of the normal stress is set to be the initial geo stress which can be calculated using eq 10 with k 0 1 sinϕ the related calibrated parameters for the cyclic t z spring are shown in table 5 as an illustration the comparisons between the cyclic interface shear tests and the simulations of case 2 are shown in fig 10 generally the interface degradation features can be well reflected in the simulation including interface strength and stiffness more details about the calibration process can refer to zhou et al 2019 5 verification of the novel numerical calculation method as shown in fig 1 one centrifuge test by kong et al 2019 is used to verify the novel calculation method in this section and the diagram of the centrifuge test is shown in fig 11 the cyclic loading test of jacket foundation is performed at 100g the model pile is instrumented and coated with a layer of epoxy on the surface for the model pile its outer diameter is 0 0259 m and its length is 0 6m pile embedment length is 0 55m and the spacing s of the piles is 0 15m the fujian standard sand is used in the centrifuge test and its mean particle size d 50 is 0 17 mm internal friction angle ϕ is 35 and relatively density d r is approximately 60 during the centrifuge test a concentrated horizontal cyclic load is applied at the jacket foundation top the constant component of the cyclic load is 0 1h ult and the amplitude of the cyclic component is 0 1h ult as well h ult 16 mn is the horizontal bearing capacity of jacket foundation and the cyclic loading period is 5s to compare with the centrifuge test four cyclic interface shear tests between the epoxy surface and the fujian standard sand are conducted in the calibrations the deepest characteristic depth is set to be 30m below which the cyclic shear displacement amplitudes are too small less than 0 05 mm to cause interface strength degradation the calibrated parameters for the cyclic t z spring are shown in table 6 fig 12 a shows the relationships between the horizontal load and the horizontal displacement at the jacket foundation top in centrifuge test and the simulation the simulation duration is up to 100 loading cycles to make it clearly the first 10 cycles and the last 10 cycles are shown in fig 12 b c for the first 10 cycles the simulation coincides well with the centrifuge test both accumulated displacement and stiffness for the last 10 cycles the accumulated displacement can be well predicted in the simulation but the stiffness in the simulation is a little less than the test result this is probably due to the densification of sand around the piles in the test kong et al 2019 in addition the overturning moment sharing percentage of p y t z q z springs is compared between the centrifuge test and the simulation which is shown in table 7 it can be seen that the contribution from t z and q z springs is over 90 and the contribution from p y spring is less than 10 for both the test and simulation by comparison the contribution from p y spring in the test is larger than the percentage in the simulation and the contribution from t z q z springs in the test is smaller than the percentage in the simulation the reason for this should be that the p y spring in api used in the simulation overestimates the initial stiffness the development rate of the p y resistance is faster in the simulation compared to the centrifuge test from the above comparison it approves the reliability of the novel calculation method to evaluate the dynamic responses of jacket foundation owt 6 simulation and discussion in this section a series of numerical simulations for the jacket foundation owt under cyclic loadings are performed using the proposed novel calculation method as shown in fig 1 the jacket foundation owt and the loading conditions are introduced in section 2 1 2 2 the simulation results about the evolutions of natural frequency accumulated inclination and load shearing characteristic are presented and discussed thoroughly 6 1 natural frequency of the jacket foundation owt in this section the three states a b c defined in section 2 2 are selected to evaluate the natural frequency changes of the jacket foundation owt the pile head stiffnesses in horizontal vertical and rotational directions of the front middle and back piles are obtained from the simulation results by including the total stiffness of all pile heads the natural frequencies of the jacket foundation owt after different loading cycles are calculated fig 13 it can be seen that the natural frequencies of calm down sate b are larger than the natural frequencies of re operation state c because of the non linear relationship of the pile soil interaction without the cyclic loading effects n 0 there are no obvious differences of the natural frequencies for the three different pile lengths however considering the cyclic effects the natural frequency at the re operation state in case 1 drops sharply to 0 198hz with n 5 the safe natural frequency band required by the turbine manufacturer ranges from 0 24hz to 0 48hz thus pile length in case 1 cannot meet the frequency requirement and no further calculations are performed for the natural frequencies in case 2 3 some fluctuations appear among the whole cyclic loading process but the differences are not obvious the differences of frequencies for different loading cycles are within 2 5 2 1 in case 2 3 respectively it can be seen that with long pile length 35m 45m jacket foundation owt shows high stability in natural frequency but as the pile length decreases there exists a sudden drop of the natural frequency due to the mode change this phenomenon is supported by the work of jalbia et al 2019b 6 2 accumulated deformation of the jacket foundation owt 6 2 1 shape evolutions of the jacket foundation central axis after different loading cycles the jacket foundation owt calms down and then is reloaded to normal operation condition at the re operation state the shape evolutions of the jacket foundation central axis fig 3 are analyzed for different loading cycles as shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the jacket foundation shows the tendency to overturning the displacement value and growth rate in case 2 are obvious larger than these in case 3 after 100 loading cycles the accumulated displacement in case 2 reaches 0 47 m at jacket foundation top while only 0 20m in case 3 in addition in case 3 the displacement value is negative deformation direction is opposite the loading direction when n 0 the reason for this is that the unbalanced gravity of turbine plays the main role for the deformation behavior in this situation 6 2 2 accumulated inclination of the jacket foundation fig 15 shows the change of the accumulated inclination absolutely rotation at the jacket foundation top after different loading cycles in case 2 3 for n 0 there is still some degree of inclination because of the unbalanced turbine gravity at the hub after different loading cycles the calm down state inclination and the re operation state inclination are also presented in case 2 it can be found that the growth rate of the accumulated inclination increases firstly and then decreases the inclination has already exceeded the deformation criterion 0 25 after n 60 after 100 loading cycles the accumulated inclination at the re operation state reaches 0 403 by comparison in case 3 the value of accumulated inclination at the re operation state is only 0 189 when n 100 but there also shows an abrupt increase after n 60 combining the natural frequency evolution in section 6 1 it can be found that the accumulated inclination has already exceeded the requirement although the natural frequency change is minor in case 2 in addition in case 1 the accumulated inclination at jacket foundation top under the re operation state after 5 loading cycles is only 0 05 while the natural frequency drops out of the safe bound obviously it can be inferred that the accumulated inclination in case 1 must be larger than the accumulated inclination in case 2 also exceeds the deformation criterion therefore the accumulated inclination should be the controlling factor in the design of jacket foundation owt rather than the natural frequency 6 3 load sharing characteristic under cyclic loadings 6 3 1 sharing of the overturning moment the load sharing characteristic is analyzed under the re operation state after cyclic loadings fig 16 shows the overturning moment sharing percentages of p y t z and q z springs for case 2 3 over the 100 loading cycles in case 2 the sharing percentage by t z springs decreases from 96 7 to 39 6 while the contribution by q z springs increases from 0 03 to 123 1 obvious interface strength degradation appears in the t z springs under the cyclic loadings fig 17 shows the resistances of t z q z springs for front pile and back pile it can be seen in fig 17 a that under the gravity g t is gravity transferred from tower base g j is the jacket structure gravity the directions of t z springs resistances of front back piles are both upward when the jacket foundation suffers the extreme loadings fig 17 b the jacket foundation intends to rotate clockwise so the directions of t z spring resistance are upward and downward for front pile and back pile respectively the moment contributed by the t z springs resistances is counter clockwise positive in the later re operation state fig 17 c the overturning moment decreases and the q z spring of the front pile shows amount of rebound which probably causes the direction reverse of t z springs resistances in this case the moment contributed by the t z springs resistances may tend to be clockwise negative as shown in fig 16 b in case 3 after 100 loading cycles the contribution by t z springs decreases from 96 9 to 33 5 and the contribution by q z springs increases from 0 0004 to 58 1 for the contribution by p y springs it increases slowly and the values reach 16 6 8 4 respectively for case 2 3 for the jacket foundation owt its inclination behavior is dominated by the t z springs in early stage while the cyclic degradation of the pile soil interface strength is not obvious in the later stage of the extreme cyclic loadings the overturning behavior is governed by the q z springs 6 3 2 sharing of the axial load the axial load sharing percentages of the four piles are plotted in fig 18 for the front pile in both case 2 and case 3 the contributions of axial load by t z springs decrease rapidly in case 2 after 100 loading cycles the t z springs contribution decreases to 20 due to the elastic rebound of q z springs and the bearing mode transfers from friction to end bearing in case 2 3 the middle piles are always bearing compression forces over the whole loading cycles the contributions by t z springs decrease obviously after 100 loading cycles the t z springs contributions decrease from 99 7 to 54 4 for case 2 and from 99 8 to 73 6 for case 3 the bearing mode is transferred from friction to friction end bearing for the back pile in the two cases the contributions by t z springs decrease firstly because some settlements occur then the t z springs contributions increase to 100 because the piles are up lift under cyclic loadings the front and middle piles are compression piles which have the tendency to move downward for the back pile it is tension pile and the movement direction is upward therefore the inclination of jacket foundation owt is induced by the opposite movement directions of the back pile and the other three piles 7 conclusions based on a cyclic t z spring model a novel numerical calculation method is proposed to evaluate the dynamic responses of jacket foundation owts in sand under cyclic loadings numerical studies are performed to investigate the evolutions of natural frequency accumulated inclination and load sharing characteristic of the jacket foundation owt the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the overturning moment acting on the jacket foundation owt is jointly resisted by p y t z and q z springs the sharing percentage by t z springs is obvious larger than the other two components the overturn inclination behavior of jacket foundation owt is mainly affected by t z springs 2 a novel numerical calculation method is proposed to consider the cyclic loading effects for jacket foundation owt under storm the proposed method includes the pile segment discretization calibration method for piles with different depths using cyclic interface shear tests p y q z and cyclic t z springs and the complete calculation procedure later the proposed method is verified by one centrifuge test which shows the accumulated inclination of jacket foundation under cyclic loadings can be well predicted by the proposed method 3 the accumulated inclination should be the controlling factor rather than the natural frequency for the design of jacket foundation owt in storm situations in engineering 4 under cyclic loadings the overturn moment sharing percentage by t z springs decreases from over 90 to even a negative value the inclination behavior of jacket foundation owt is dominated by the t z springs in early stage during which the cyclic degradation of the pile soil interface resistance is not obvious in the later stage of the extreme cyclic loadings the overturning behavior is governed by the q z springs for the axial load the contributions by t z springs decrease rapidly for the front and middle piles whose bearing mode changes from shaft friction to end bearing gradually credit authorship contribution statement lizhong wang conceptualization methodology project administration wenjie zhou data curation writing original draft software

21444,extreme wave analysis is essential for the design and deployment of marine structures since extremes in natural phenomena tend to occur in clusters it is necessary to de cluster them in order to form a dataset of independent samples there are several algorithms used to identify independent storms clusters of significant wave height extremes most of which have the disadvantage of relying on an arbitrarily selected de clustering parameter in this paper an existing statistical method for systematic cluster size inferencing is used with runs de clustering and applied for the first time to extreme wave analysis the generalised pareto distribution gpd is fitted to an extreme wave dataset and the return periods of significant wave height extremes are calculated using the resulting model function the methodology proposed in this paper is illustrated using hindcast data for the winter months of two locations one that is exposed to the long atlantic swell off the west coast of france and another in the north sea that is characterised by short fetch this work demonstrates how extremal index estimation may be used in conjunction with the well known runs de clustering algorithm to predict the return periods of significant wave height extremes keywords extreme wave analysis runs de clustering extremal index pareto distribution return periods 1 introduction offshore and coastal engineering requires accurate estimation of the wave height at a potential deployment location a variety of sources may be used including but not limited to hindcast data buoy measurements and satellite observations general guidelines are discussed in mathiesen et al 1994 predicting the occurrence of extreme waves is particularly important for the survivability of offshore platforms raed et al 2020 marine renewable energy deployments e g wave energy converters wecs falcão 2010 mackay 2012 2017 breakwaters marzeddu et al 2020 and mooring systems correia da fonseca et al 2016 barrera et al 2019 the loading damage of mooring connections can be assessed based on the wave period as reported in thies et al 2014 dnv recommended practice rp c205 2010 and dnv gl offshore standard dnvgl os e301 2015 physical modelling of wecs and their mooring components requires modelling of extreme waves at the location for which the technology has been optimised as was performed in correia da fonseca 2014 lack of knowledge on the extreme nature of the wave climate can significantly increase the risk associated with a project greaves and iglesias 2018 a wec must be designed to operate efficiently under typical wave climate conditions morim et al 2019a which are determined via resource assessment at the deployment site iglesias and carballo 2010a b sierra et al 2017 it should also be capable of surviving in stormy seas designing for the survivability of marine deployments involves statistical modelling of extreme waves where the goal is to predict the extremes of the future based on the extremes of the past extreme wave analysis for engineering purposes may be undertaken by fitting a statistical distribution model to significant wave height records goda 2010 castillo and sarabia 1994 mackay and johanning 2018 a comparison of different extreme wave analysis methods being applied at a particular location was performed by sartini et al 2015 li et al 2012 and al mashan et al 2019 and a complete review on extreme wave analysis techniques was described by jonathan and ewans 2013 some extreme value distributions rely on the definition of an extreme threshold the selection of which was elaborated upon in dupuis 1998 if the threshold is exceeded at a particular instance in time an extremogram may be used to quantify the length of time for which the probability of observing subsequent exceedances becomes stable providing insight into the time needed to consider a storm as being independent mackay and johanning 2018 due to the tendency of extremes in natural phenomena to exhibit serial correlation the total dataset is typically divided into separate groups before forming a new presumably independent dataset of extreme values from the maxima of each group automated ways of doing this have been discussed in smith and weissman 1994 and shao et al 2020 de clustering the data helps to identify independent storms which collectively characterise the extreme nature of the waves in a given location there are various algorithms for de clustering a wave record and the performance of several of these techniques was explored by soukissian and arapi 2011 the problem with most de clustering algorithms is that they depend on the arbitrary selection of one or more de clustering parameters leading to potential invalidity of the independence criterion or to statistical bias in the results fortunately these parameters may be inferred from the data itself using extremal index estimators ancona navarrete and tawn 2000 laurini and tawn 2003 ferro and segers 2003 which quantify the clustering tendency of the data as a function of extreme wave threshold in this paper the well known runs de clustering method is coupled with an extremal index inferencing scheme proposed by ferro and segers 2003 and is used to find model distributions to represent significant wave height extremes the following sections begin with a review on extreme wave distributions and de clustering algorithms special attention is drawn to how they may be coupled with the extremal index of ferro and segers 2003 in the methodology a formulation is laid out for how to fit the distribution parameters to a de clustered extreme wave dataset using a region of parameter stability as a function of threshold this procedure is applied to two locations as a case study with a brief description of the models that were used to generate the data in the results and discussion section the clustering and separation tendencies of significant wave height extremes are presented for the studied locations a single set of distribution parameters and extreme wave threshold are used to define a distribution model and calculate extreme wave return periods finally the effectiveness of using the runs method with extremal index inferencing is compared to that of existing de clustering algorithms 2 background information a fundamental requirement for performing an extreme wave analysis is that the extreme value dataset be independently and identically distributed i i d this is a dataset that is characterised by independence and homogeneity the autocorrelation of an unsorted extreme value dataset may be used to test for independence by ensuring that the autocorrelation of lags greater than the zero lag does not exceed a set of confidence bounds 1 1 these are defined as two times the standard error and that they do no exhibit any obvious pattern to satisfy the requirement of homogeneity all data in a sample must have the same parent distribution the homogeneity criterion would not be fulfilled in locations with phenomena such as el niño or monsoons or where there is significant seasonal variability in the two latter cases the data should be studied inter annually as in morton et al 1997 and izaguirre et al 2011 with regards to climate change performing extreme value analysis under the assumption of having the same parent distribution in the future should be undertaken with some caution see morim et al 2019b for future wave climate projections if the dataset spans enough years and homogeneity is a concern one possible course of due diligence is to carry out a trend analysis of the dataset barros et al 2006 there are four common ways of forming an extreme wave dataset 1 the total sample method initially presented by draper 1966 in this case all data are used 2 the k largest annual maxima method where only the k largest significant wave heights of each year are considered 3 the annual maxima method where k 1 in the above approach and only the single largest significant wave height of each year is used 4 the peak over threshold pot method where the peak significant wave heights of independent storms that exceed a certain threshold value are used regarding the total sample method it is difficult to ensure independence if the interval between successive data points is on the order of several hours goda 1988 mackay and jonathan 2020 although independence can often be ensured by using the annual maxima method the statistical uncertainty is often very high since the number of years of available data is typically small by only considering the peak values of storms exceeding a given threshold it is likely that the extreme value dataset will be left with enough samples to keep the variance within reasonable limits while ensuring that the i i d criterion is met for this reason it has been selected as the method of choice in this paper the methodology for the pot method is extensively discussed by ferreira and guedes soares 1998 once an extreme value dataset that is i i d has been put together a probability distribution can be fitted to it and the resulting model function may be used 2 1 extreme value distributions although a given statistical distribution may accurately describe typical occurrences of a particular phenomenon the same statistical distribution is often a poor model for the data s outliers a better model for the extreme values x of a dataset may often be described by the generalised extreme value gev distribution which encompasses several different distributions depending on its parameters goda 2010 1 g x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 exp exp x μ σ ξ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter μ is the location parameter and σ is the scale parameter where σ 0 this is a family of cumulative distribution functions cdf that encompasses the gumbel fréchet and weibull distributions coles 2001 the problem with describing extremes with the gev distribution family is that a change in the estimate of its location parameter μ may significantly alter its parameters ξ and σ such that the model changes from one of the distributions that the gev encompasses to another asymptotic theory says that for extremes exceeding some high enough threshold u the gev distribution family may be approximated by the generalised pareto distribution gpd provided that x u 2 f x 1 1 ξ x u σ 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp x u σ ξ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter of the gev on the interval ξ σ is related to the gev scale parameter by σ σ ξ u μ where σ 0 and u is the extreme significant wave height threshold from here on the notation σ will be replaced with σ the benefit of modelling extremes with the gpd is that its parameters ξ and σ are less sensitive to the choice in threshold u provided that u is high enough 2 2 de clustering algorithms in a time series of data that describe a phenomenon in nature extremes tend to cluster together to ensure that two extreme wave samples are not part of the same storm it is important to de cluster the dataset when fitting an extreme value dataset to the gev it is common practice to de cluster the data using the standard storm length ssl method tawn 1988 or the de clustering algorithm deca proposed by soukissian and kalantzi 2011 ssl assumes that all storms last for a duration t furthermore it assumes that all wave height values before and after a time interval of t 2 from the storm s peak are independent from it deca constitutes a more physically meaningful method since it depends on the wave energy density proportional to h s 2 t e in deep water of a storm and only considers wave height values to be independent after a sufficient reduction in its energy content when fitting the gpd to an extreme value dataset it is possibly best practice to de cluster using the runs method where a new cluster of threshold exceedances is considered to start after a separation of at least r non exceeding datapoints from the previous cluster contrary to ssl the runs method considers how long it takes the sea to calm down rather than how long it remains stormy nevertheless a short coming of this approach is the arbitrary selection of the run length parameter r 2 2 1 runs de clustering in a time series of n datapoints the runs method considers the termination of a cluster to occur when at least r consecutive non exceedances of a threshold u follow the final exceedance in the cluster in extreme wave analysis the run length parameter r may be interpreted as the minimum required storm interval period of calm needed to achieve sample independence in the de clustered extreme dataset the total cluster count z is incremented every time an exceedance in the i th position of the time series is followed by r consecutive non exceedances a parameter w i with a binary value describes whether or not the i th observation exceeds the threshold an exceedance corresponds to w i 1 and a non exceedance corresponds to w i 0 this is to say 3 n i 1 n w i 4 z i 1 n w i 1 w i 1 1 w r 1 where n is the total number of exceedances smith and weissman 1994 the extremal index estimator is then defined as the reciprocal of the mean cluster size m and is given by 5 θ z n the parameter θ is an estimate of the true extremal index θ the extremal index ranges from 0 to 1 davis and mikosch 2009 and describes the clustering tendency of the data in the extreme case of θ 1 all clusters consist of only a single exceedance the other extreme is the case of θ 0 where the data consists of nothing but exceedances i e the selected threshold is too low 2 3 the extremal index before applying the runs method the extremal index θ should be estimated so that a run length parameter r that is optimal for the given dataset may be extracted this indicator θ has been presented in laurini and tawn 2003 and ferro and segers 2003 the value of r in eq 4 should not be chosen arbitrarily it should be chosen based on the clustering tendency of the data the extremal index estimator adopted throughout this paper is the one suggested by ferro and segers 2003 6 θ ˆ u 2 j 1 n 1 t j 1 2 n 1 j 1 n 1 t j 1 t j 2 if max t j 2 7 θ ˆ u 2 j 1 n 1 t j 2 n 1 j 1 n 1 t j 2 if max t j 2 whose first order bias is zero the above equation considers a set of datapoints with n exceedances of a threshold u where n 1 n n and observation i 1 n the extremal index estimator θ ˆ takes into consideration the inter exceedance times t j s j 1 s j where s j represents the position i of an exceedance and j 1 n 1 if n 1 the estimator of eqs 6 and 7 is illustrated in fig 1 for a set of observations and threshold u in addition to the extreme wave analysis presented in this paper the estimator has also been used to de cluster datasets in extreme water level arns et al 2013 and extreme rainfall acero et al 2011 studies 3 methodology runs de clustering with an inferred run length parameter was used to identify clusters of independent storms on which the pot method could then be applied to form an extreme value dataset the gpd was chosen as the model function for predicting extreme wave return values when a fixed threshold u is considered the distribution parameters of the gpd exhibit relatively low sensitivity to changes in threshold selection compared to those of the gev distribution a variable threshold approach to modelling extremes with the gpd is discussed by tancredi et al 2006 for a given threshold u q the gpd parameters were fitted to the resulting extreme wave dataset the mean excess was plotted against the threshold as were the shape and scale parameters the threshold u should be chosen from a region where the mean excess plot is linear with increasing threshold and where the shape and scale parameters fitted using maximum likelihood estimation mle remain constant coles 2001 a brief description of mle is presented in appendix a a subtlety of this approach is that the higher the threshold u the smaller the resultant extreme value dataset becomes with that in mind the lowest value of u was chosen where the linearity of the mean excesses of u and the constancy in ξ and σ began to be fulfilled in order to keep sample variance to a minimum this chosen set of ξ q and σ q for the corresponding threshold u q was then used as the best set of parameters for the gpd to model the location s extreme occurrences in significant wave height quantile quantile qq and probability probability pp plots can provide a visual check as to whether or not the extreme value dataset is well represented by the chosen model function if the empirical data align well with the modelled data then it is likely that the chosen model function is a good representation of the true extreme distribution of significant wave heights the run length parameter was inferred using the extremal index estimator of ferro and segers 2003 this process is summarised in fig 2 3 1 run length inference by extremal index estimation from a given wave record of significant wave heights h s a threshold u q is selected to define an extreme event before the runs method can be applied to de cluster the data the run length parameter r q should be chosen in a way that is not arbitrary but rather so that it is inferred by the data itself this can be accomplished by means of the extremal index θ ˆ which is based on the inter exceedance times t j beneath the threshold u q see eqs 6 and 7 and physically represents the reciprocal of the mean cluster size m q knowing the total number of exceedances n and knowing what the optimal extremal index should be from eqs 6 and 7 the run length parameter r q can be inferred from eq 4 threshold exceedances may then be de clustered using the runs method and the highest value in each cluster may be extracted using the pot method forming a dataset of extreme values finally mle may be used to fit the gpd to the extreme value dataset and obtain the parameters ξ q and σ q corresponding to the threshold u q 3 2 parameter stability and threshold selection the choice of threshold parameter is undertaken with the aid of graphical procedures as suggested by coles 2001 these are parameter stability plots and mean excess plots also known as mean residual life plots scarrot and macdonald 2012 if the gpd is a valid model for excesses over some high enough threshold u 0 then it will be valid for excesses over all thresholds u u 0 the expected value of the threshold excesses is given by 8 e x u x u σ u 0 ξ u 0 u 1 ξ for all u u 0 e x u x u is simply the mean value of the threshold excesses and is a linear function of u this linear relationship facilitates the use of a graphical procedure for identifying a suitably high threshold for modelling extremes via the gpd the point where the threshold excesses become linear with threshold u marks the beginning of the region of validity where the gev distribution may be approximated by the gpd in the mean excess linear region where the threshold choice is valid the gpd parameter estimates should also remain constant in fitting the shape and scale parameters of the gpd using mle there will be a region where the returned estimator values remain approximately constant with u constant gpd parameter estimates along with a linear region in the mean excess plot were used to justify the selection of the threshold value for the gpd above which significant wave height values are considered to be extreme the size of the resulting extreme value dataset decreases with increasing threshold u it should be noted that too high of a threshold will lead to a lower number of data and consequently a higher statistical variance on the other hand too low of a threshold could violate the validity of the gpd approximating the gev distribution although the techniques presented in this section are well established methods for the selection of the threshold u they inherently contain a small degree of subjectivity the quality of the model function s fit to the empirical data may be assessed by using a methodology suggested by coles qq and pp diagnostic plots coles 2001 described in appendix b 3 3 estimation of the return period the runs method involves extracting independent clusters from the dataset that exceed an extreme value threshold u and hence after applying the pot method to the independent clusters the remaining i i d dataset is extreme by definition after performing mle on the resulting extreme value dataset and obtaining gpd parameter estimates for ξ and σ the extreme significant wave height that is expected to occur only once every r years is given by 9 h s u σ ξ r z λ ξ 1 for ξ 0 where the notation denotes an extreme quantity λ is the number of years spanned by the original dataset and z is the number of i i d exceedances that make up the extreme value dataset 4 application of methodology to illustrate the proposed methodology this section presents a case study comparing two ocean basin locations with different characteristics both locations exhibit considerable wave energy resource and hence they may be regarded as favourable areas for exploitation kalogeri et al 2017 provided that the extreme occurrences in significant wave height are small enough to ensure the survivability of a converter runs de clustering with an inferred run length parameter was performed on significant wave height hindcast data to form an extreme value dataset for each location the proposed methodology was followed to obtain a gpd model for predicting the return period of an extreme occurrence in significant wave height 4 1 data used in the study areas the first site selected for applying the proposed methodology is situated on the northern part of the french west coast approximately 10km offshore with coordinates 47 42 24 63 n and 4 23 28 57 w at a water depth of 85m this location is exposed to the long atlantic fetch and hence the extremes are dominated by swell the second location is situated in the north sea with coordinates 55 8 60 n and 3 27 0 e at a water depth of 29m the north sea is a semi enclosed basin with a short fetch area the wave field is primarily wind driven wave extremes are caused by the passage of extra tropical cyclones and polar lows kalogeri et al 2017 the wave dataset used in this analysis is the product of hindcast simulations of the 3rd generation spectral ocean wave model wam the simulations were performed under the framework of the fp7 marina platform project https www msp platform eu projects marina platform by the atmospheric modelling and weather forecasting group of national and kapodistrian university of athens the data span the years 2001 2010 inclusive at an hourly interval providing information for the main met ocean parameters needed to describe the wave field of an area the data cover the entire european coastline with a resolution of 5 km the atmospheric model skiron provided the forcing wind field to wam with the same high spatial resolution and an hourly frequency kallos et al 1997 spyrou et al 2010 kallos et al 2006 the modelling system has been implemented in high resolution in a wide enough region to depict the main storm activity of the atlantic ocean that is responsible for remotely generated atlantic swell which reaches and affects the local wave field of the western coasts of europe the atmospheric and wave systems used in this model have assimilated available altimeter measurements to correct their initial conditions kalogeri et al 2017 patlakas et al 2016 2017 the general performance of the modelling system has been evaluated in numerous research and operational projects edwards et al 2014a b larsén et al 2015 kalogeri et al 2017 and its output has been also used for extreme value analysis patlakas et al 2016 2017 more details on the dataset and modelling approach may be found in kalogeri et al 2017 altimeter data have already been assimilated into wam so to validate the output of the model wave buoy measurements were used various statistical indices show that the dataset is in close agreement with these observations in particular for the areas under study a correlation coefficient greater than 0 8 between the modelled and measured significant wave heights indicates a strong linear relationship between them the data show low systematic error returning bias and root mean squared error rmse values both less than 0 4m and scatter indices 2 2 the scatter index is equal to the rmse divided by the mean less than 0 4 however it should be noted that buoys are not always reliable when recording the heights of extreme waves janssen 2002 therefore buoy measurements cannot guarantee a perfectly reliable source for evaluating the ability of a model to accurately predict extreme waves 4 2 results and discussion for both locations the 10 year hourly datasets of significant wave height are presented in fig 3 along with box plots depicting the seasonal nature of their wave resource if seasonality were successfully removed from a dataset an extreme wave phenomenon coming from the same parent distribution could be modelled in an effort to satisfy the homogeneity criterion of extreme value theory only the winter values were considered in the northern hemisphere waves are usually most energetic during the winter in this work winter values were defined as those spanning the months of december january and february in the box plots of fig 3 h s medians and quartile ranges denoted by the red lines and box edges respectively are highest during the winter months of both locations for both 10 year winter datasets of significant wave height two extreme value datasets were formed using runs de clustering above a threshold u q where the run length was inferred by the estimator θ ˆ given by eqs 6 and 7 in fig 4 a and b the mean cluster size m and run length parameter r are plotted as a function of the threshold u respectively providing insight into the clustering and separation tendencies of storm events at both locations the mean cluster size m initially decreases rapidly with increasing threshold u before reaching a point where the rate of decrease slows down significantly possibly at a value u that is high enough to make the gpd a valid approximation to the gev distribution the physical interpretation is that for low thresholds u a considerable portion of the significant wave heights that exceed u are either part of the wave climate s natural variability or represent a storm that is developing or calming down conversely for thresholds u that are high enough exceeding significant wave heights generally represent developed storms for very high extreme value thresholds a point is reached where the run length parameter begins to increase rapidly this corresponds to the situation where very few clusters of exceeding significant wave heights remain in the original time series thereby causing the minimum required storm interval to increase significantly mle was applied to the extreme value datasets in order to extract estimates of the parameters ξ q and σ q this procedure was repeated for many thresholds u q so that the threshold diagnostics described in the methodology could be used to choose the best values for defining the occurrence of an extreme event to compare the stability of the gpd parameters the shape and scale parameters ξ and σ are plotted against the threshold u in fig 5 a d the corresponding mean excesses are also plotted against the threshold u in fig 5 e and f these plots helped determine the appropriate thresholds u q for the gpd model of the extreme wave occurrences in the two locations the reported methodology was repeated for thresholds u q ranging from 2 50 8 00 m for the west coast of france and 1 00 6 50 m for the north sea both with a step size of 0 25m as outlined in the methodology a region with little change in the distribution parameter estimates and a region of linearity in the mean excesses has been identified in the runs de clustering plots between u q 4 25 m and u q 5 75 m for the west coast of france and between u q 2 00 m and u q 3 25 m for the north sea shown by the highlighted areas in figs 5 a f the lower part of this range was preferred in order to reduce the variance and although the selection was still slightly arbitrary a threshold of u q 4 25 m was chosen as the definition of an extreme event occurrence for the west coast of france and a threshold of u q 2 75 m was chosen for the north sea with these thresholds 88 and 156 independent storm values were de clustered for the west coast of france and the north sea which were then used to form the extreme value datasets the corresponding shape and scale parameters ξ q 0 13 σ q 2 50 m and ξ q 0 32 σ q 2 09 m were selected for the west coast of france and the north sea which were then used to fully specify their respective gpd functions as given by eq 2 with the gpd models determined their representation of the hindcast data could be described qualitatively with the aid of pp and qq plots illustrated in fig 6 if the fit is good the dots in these figures should closely follow the straight dashed red lines which is the case here this means that the gpd with the fitted parameters from mle was a good extreme wave model for the hindcast data of the studied locations for the open sea area french coast an extreme value threshold of u q 4 25 m was selected with shape and scale parameters ξ q 0 13 and σ q 2 50 m for the semi enclosed basin north sea the extreme value threshold of u q 2 75 m was selected with shape and scale parameters ξ q 0 32 and σ q 2 09 m as a final check for independence between the samples of selected extreme value datasets their autocorrelation tendencies were examined as shown in fig 7 a and b no noticeable pattern exists in the autocorrelations of the extreme datasets and the majority of lags after the zero lag do not exceed two times the standard error denoted by the dashed lines in the figure these gpd models were then used to predict the return periods of extreme significant wave height occurrences as shown in fig 8 in both locations the first 20 years show a significant increase in the extreme return value with increasing return period there is little difference in the predicted return values between a 50 year return period and a 100 year return period although the qq and pp plots shown in fig 6 suggest a good fit of the modelled data to the empirical data it is clear from the range of 90 confidence intervals in fig 8 a that in the case of the west coast of france 88 extreme wave occurrences were simply not enough data to keep statistical uncertainty within reasonable limits to study the extreme wave resource of this location with higher accuracy a time series of significant wave height spanning more years would need to be obtained sartini et al 2015 surendran et al 2005 kumar et al 2009 this was not the case for the north sea fig 8 b where a larger extreme wave sample of 156 occurrences gave much lower uncertainty in the predicted extreme wave return values the smaller sample of extremes in the long fetch area french coast can be attributed to the fact that its wave field is swell dominated the swell formations are the result of remotely generated weather systems that can travel hundreds of kilometres with little attenuation they tend to persist for longer periods of time compared to the wind sea wave fields of the north sea which are coupled to the local weather conditions and closely follow their changes barber and ursell 1948 munk et al 1963 cavaleri et al 2007 ardhuin et al 2009 therefore during the same 10 year sample period the swell dominated location exhibited fewer independent storms than the wind sea location consequently in the two original h s time series of the same length the one pertaining to the west coast of france had fewer independent storm data points because individual storms would last longer than in the north sea this lead to a smaller de clustered extreme value dataset for the west coast of france and a consequently higher statistical uncertainty in its predicted extreme wave values compared to the north sea 4 3 comparative analysis with other de clustering algorithms diagnostic plots for mle fitted gpd parameters were also generated for the two alternative de clustering algorithms described in section 2 2 i e ssl tawn 1988 and deca soukissian and kalantzi 2006 to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with algorithms that currently exist in the literature the following investigations were made regarding the stability of the gpd shape and scale parameters using storm length and energy reduction parameter values that are frequently suggested in the literature for ssl and deca respectively using the extremal index estimator of eqs 6 and 7 and the total number of threshold exceeding significant wave heights n to calculate the optimal number of values z in the extreme dataset then finding the storm length and energy reduction parameter values for ssl and deca that would make the dataset be of this size for the first investigation commonly used storm length values of 24 48 72 96 and 120 h were considered for the ssl algorithm zachary et al 1998 soukissian and arapi 2011 similarly commonly used wave energy reductions of 80 85 90 and 95 were considered for the deca algorithm soukissian and arapi 2011 threshold exceedances were de clustered using ssl and deca while considering these typical de clustering parameter values from the clusters that were identified this way as being storms the peak values were taken from each cluster to form an extreme value dataset one for every u examined with ssl the gpd parameter stability plots of fig 9 show that both the west coast of france and the north sea exhibited higher i e less negative shape parameters and lower scale parameters for shorter storm lengths in fig 10 deca exhibited the same tendency when lower energy reductions were considered for the gpd shape parameter in particular it is clear from fig 10 a and b that the region of stability varies significantly with choice of de clustering parameter in fig 9 a and b the gpd parameter response is comparatively more consistent with changing de clustering parameters than in the case of fig 10 a and b however there seems to be a definite downward shift in the shape parameter responses and upward shift in the scale parameter responses with increasing storm length parameter these results suggest that unless the use of a particular storm length or energy reduction can be justified for ssl and deca arbitrarily choosing these values and using them for all thresholds could lead to a region of stability that poorly represents the extreme nature of a given wave climate the second investigation made use of the extremal index estimator to infer optimal storm length and energy reduction values for ssl and deca at every threshold u q this allowed a fair comparison of gpd shape and scale parameter stabilities to be made with those obtained using the runs method knowing the number n of significant wave heights exceeding u and estimating θ from eqs 6 and 7 the number of de clustered values z forming the extreme dataset may be calculated using eq 5 the de clustering parameter of a given algorithm is hence inferred as being the one to separate the original h s time series into z clusters each of them assumed to represent an independent storm event containing on average m consecutive extreme values of h s in runs de clustering the run length parameter r is inferred as being the one to make eq 4 hold and this was found by trial and error similarly in the ssl and deca algorithms the storm length and energy reduction parameters were found by trial and error to be those which would separate the h s time series into z clusters although it is likely that deca is a very robust algorithm in terms of ensuring independence in the samples of an extreme value dataset its two stages of monotonicity filtering inherently leave very few remaining samples in the resulting h s time series for a given threshold u q when the number of de clustered exceedances z q that was suggested by the extremal index estimator θ q turned out to be higher than the number of samples remaining after deca de clustering even with an energy reduction of 1 the deca extreme value dataset was simply formed using the remaining h s extremes this was the case for threshold values in fig 11 where the fitted gpd parameters of deca deviated noticeably from those of ssl and runs de clustering for both the west coast of france and the north sea the runs method seems to have performed best when coupled with extremal index based inferencing of its de clustering parameter 5 conclusions this paper presented a new methodology for the estimation of return periods of extreme significant wave height occurrences the methods presented in this work could be of particular interest when designing for survivability in a marine environment modelling of extreme events relies on the formation of an extreme dataset of i i d values since the extremes of natural phenomena tend to cluster de clustering techniques are used to identify independent clusters from which the pot method is used to pick out their maxima although current bibliography encourages the use of runs de clustering for extreme wave analysis the choice of run length parameter has remained arbitrary therefore an extremal index inferencing method from statistics literature one that is based on the inter exceedance times of the data was proposed to infer the optimal run length once the data has been de clustered and subjected to the pot method the newly formed extreme dataset may then be fitted to a model distribution in this paper the gpd was chosen due to the low sensitivity of its parameters to the choice of extreme value threshold for a given threshold mle was used to estimate the corresponding gpd shape and scale parameters the proposed methodology was applied to hindcast data between the years 2001 2010 for two locations with different climatological characteristics diagnostic plots assisted with the selection of an appropriate threshold for both locations the mean threshold excesses as well as the stability of the shape and scale parameters as a function of the threshold once a threshold had been selected along with its corresponding shape and scale parameters the respective quantiles and probabilities of the empirical data and the gpd model were plotted together on qq and pp plots the resulting gpd model was used to predict the return periods of extreme significant wave height occurrences a considerable spread in the predicted return periods was obtained for the location off the west coast of france and a significantly smaller spread was obtained for the north sea location this was likely attributed to the fact that the swell formations reaching the coasts of france are more persistent systems than the wind driven waves of the north sea for the same time series length there were fewer independent storms from which the pot method was able to form an independent set of extreme values and a smaller sample implies higher variance finally the performance of the proposed methodology was compared to that of existing algorithms ssl and deca were first tested using storm length and energy reduction values that had frequently been used in the literature then the de clustering parameters of ssl and deca were also inferred using extremal index estimation qualitatively speaking it was found that runs de clustering with a run length parameter that is inferred via extremal index estimation exhibited the best gpd parameter

kindly answering their questions on his extremal index estimator the authors have also benefited from discussions with dr takvor soukissian from the hellenic centre for marine research appendix a maximum likelihood estimation the gpd parameters are fitted to the extreme data by using maximum likelihood estimation mle the purpose of mle is to find the distribution parameters of a representative model function so that the probability of obtaining the de clustered i i d extreme dataset is maximised since the joint probability of a series of independent events x k is equal to the product of the events individual probabilities p x x k a likelihood function may be defined as the joint probability of having obtained the resulting i i d extreme dataset for a given set of gpd parameters ξ and σ a 1 l k 1 z p x x k ξ σ the parameter z had previously been used to denote the number of independent clusters resulting from runs de clustering since the pot method picks out only one peak value from each cluster z will be used from hereon to represent the size of the de clustered extreme dataset such that k 1 z the objective of mle is to find the optimal set of model function parameters such that the likelihood function is maximised appendix b quantile quantile and probability probability diagnostic plots ordered statistics lie at the core of this methodology it is of interest to investigate how well the empirical quantiles and probabilities correspond to their respective modelled counterparts it begins with ranking the values of the extreme dataset where the highest rank i e m 1 corresponds to the greatest significant wave height the empirical quantiles are simply given by the values of the extreme dataset whilst the empirical cumulative probabilities are given by b 1 f emp 1 m δ 1 where δ is the number of independent storms and m is the rank of the storm and lies on the interval m 1 δ the theoretical quantiles are given by solving for x in eq 2 where parameters ξ and σ are those returned by the mle method for the threshold u and f x is the empirical cumulative probability given by eq b 1 specifically b 2 x mod u σ ξ 1 f emp ξ 1 where x mod is the modelled quantile similarly the modelled cumulative probability may be obtained by solving eq 2 for the empirical quantiles of x and the distribution parameters ξ and σ returned by mle this is to say b 3 f mod 1 1 ξ x emp u σ 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp x emp u σ ξ 0 where x emp are the empirical values from the extreme dataset if the selection of the gpd with the returned mle parameters ξ q and σ q for the threshold u q is a wise choice for the studied data then the empirical and modelled values on the qq and pp plots will consist of data points close to the unit diagonal li et al 2012 
21444,extreme wave analysis is essential for the design and deployment of marine structures since extremes in natural phenomena tend to occur in clusters it is necessary to de cluster them in order to form a dataset of independent samples there are several algorithms used to identify independent storms clusters of significant wave height extremes most of which have the disadvantage of relying on an arbitrarily selected de clustering parameter in this paper an existing statistical method for systematic cluster size inferencing is used with runs de clustering and applied for the first time to extreme wave analysis the generalised pareto distribution gpd is fitted to an extreme wave dataset and the return periods of significant wave height extremes are calculated using the resulting model function the methodology proposed in this paper is illustrated using hindcast data for the winter months of two locations one that is exposed to the long atlantic swell off the west coast of france and another in the north sea that is characterised by short fetch this work demonstrates how extremal index estimation may be used in conjunction with the well known runs de clustering algorithm to predict the return periods of significant wave height extremes keywords extreme wave analysis runs de clustering extremal index pareto distribution return periods 1 introduction offshore and coastal engineering requires accurate estimation of the wave height at a potential deployment location a variety of sources may be used including but not limited to hindcast data buoy measurements and satellite observations general guidelines are discussed in mathiesen et al 1994 predicting the occurrence of extreme waves is particularly important for the survivability of offshore platforms raed et al 2020 marine renewable energy deployments e g wave energy converters wecs falcão 2010 mackay 2012 2017 breakwaters marzeddu et al 2020 and mooring systems correia da fonseca et al 2016 barrera et al 2019 the loading damage of mooring connections can be assessed based on the wave period as reported in thies et al 2014 dnv recommended practice rp c205 2010 and dnv gl offshore standard dnvgl os e301 2015 physical modelling of wecs and their mooring components requires modelling of extreme waves at the location for which the technology has been optimised as was performed in correia da fonseca 2014 lack of knowledge on the extreme nature of the wave climate can significantly increase the risk associated with a project greaves and iglesias 2018 a wec must be designed to operate efficiently under typical wave climate conditions morim et al 2019a which are determined via resource assessment at the deployment site iglesias and carballo 2010a b sierra et al 2017 it should also be capable of surviving in stormy seas designing for the survivability of marine deployments involves statistical modelling of extreme waves where the goal is to predict the extremes of the future based on the extremes of the past extreme wave analysis for engineering purposes may be undertaken by fitting a statistical distribution model to significant wave height records goda 2010 castillo and sarabia 1994 mackay and johanning 2018 a comparison of different extreme wave analysis methods being applied at a particular location was performed by sartini et al 2015 li et al 2012 and al mashan et al 2019 and a complete review on extreme wave analysis techniques was described by jonathan and ewans 2013 some extreme value distributions rely on the definition of an extreme threshold the selection of which was elaborated upon in dupuis 1998 if the threshold is exceeded at a particular instance in time an extremogram may be used to quantify the length of time for which the probability of observing subsequent exceedances becomes stable providing insight into the time needed to consider a storm as being independent mackay and johanning 2018 due to the tendency of extremes in natural phenomena to exhibit serial correlation the total dataset is typically divided into separate groups before forming a new presumably independent dataset of extreme values from the maxima of each group automated ways of doing this have been discussed in smith and weissman 1994 and shao et al 2020 de clustering the data helps to identify independent storms which collectively characterise the extreme nature of the waves in a given location there are various algorithms for de clustering a wave record and the performance of several of these techniques was explored by soukissian and arapi 2011 the problem with most de clustering algorithms is that they depend on the arbitrary selection of one or more de clustering parameters leading to potential invalidity of the independence criterion or to statistical bias in the results fortunately these parameters may be inferred from the data itself using extremal index estimators ancona navarrete and tawn 2000 laurini and tawn 2003 ferro and segers 2003 which quantify the clustering tendency of the data as a function of extreme wave threshold in this paper the well known runs de clustering method is coupled with an extremal index inferencing scheme proposed by ferro and segers 2003 and is used to find model distributions to represent significant wave height extremes the following sections begin with a review on extreme wave distributions and de clustering algorithms special attention is drawn to how they may be coupled with the extremal index of ferro and segers 2003 in the methodology a formulation is laid out for how to fit the distribution parameters to a de clustered extreme wave dataset using a region of parameter stability as a function of threshold this procedure is applied to two locations as a case study with a brief description of the models that were used to generate the data in the results and discussion section the clustering and separation tendencies of significant wave height extremes are presented for the studied locations a single set of distribution parameters and extreme wave threshold are used to define a distribution model and calculate extreme wave return periods finally the effectiveness of using the runs method with extremal index inferencing is compared to that of existing de clustering algorithms 2 background information a fundamental requirement for performing an extreme wave analysis is that the extreme value dataset be independently and identically distributed i i d this is a dataset that is characterised by independence and homogeneity the autocorrelation of an unsorted extreme value dataset may be used to test for independence by ensuring that the autocorrelation of lags greater than the zero lag does not exceed a set of confidence bounds 1 1 these are defined as two times the standard error and that they do no exhibit any obvious pattern to satisfy the requirement of homogeneity all data in a sample must have the same parent distribution the homogeneity criterion would not be fulfilled in locations with phenomena such as el niño or monsoons or where there is significant seasonal variability in the two latter cases the data should be studied inter annually as in morton et al 1997 and izaguirre et al 2011 with regards to climate change performing extreme value analysis under the assumption of having the same parent distribution in the future should be undertaken with some caution see morim et al 2019b for future wave climate projections if the dataset spans enough years and homogeneity is a concern one possible course of due diligence is to carry out a trend analysis of the dataset barros et al 2006 there are four common ways of forming an extreme wave dataset 1 the total sample method initially presented by draper 1966 in this case all data are used 2 the k largest annual maxima method where only the k largest significant wave heights of each year are considered 3 the annual maxima method where k 1 in the above approach and only the single largest significant wave height of each year is used 4 the peak over threshold pot method where the peak significant wave heights of independent storms that exceed a certain threshold value are used regarding the total sample method it is difficult to ensure independence if the interval between successive data points is on the order of several hours goda 1988 mackay and jonathan 2020 although independence can often be ensured by using the annual maxima method the statistical uncertainty is often very high since the number of years of available data is typically small by only considering the peak values of storms exceeding a given threshold it is likely that the extreme value dataset will be left with enough samples to keep the variance within reasonable limits while ensuring that the i i d criterion is met for this reason it has been selected as the method of choice in this paper the methodology for the pot method is extensively discussed by ferreira and guedes soares 1998 once an extreme value dataset that is i i d has been put together a probability distribution can be fitted to it and the resulting model function may be used 2 1 extreme value distributions although a given statistical distribution may accurately describe typical occurrences of a particular phenomenon the same statistical distribution is often a poor model for the data s outliers a better model for the extreme values x of a dataset may often be described by the generalised extreme value gev distribution which encompasses several different distributions depending on its parameters goda 2010 1 g x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 exp exp x μ σ ξ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter μ is the location parameter and σ is the scale parameter where σ 0 this is a family of cumulative distribution functions cdf that encompasses the gumbel fréchet and weibull distributions coles 2001 the problem with describing extremes with the gev distribution family is that a change in the estimate of its location parameter μ may significantly alter its parameters ξ and σ such that the model changes from one of the distributions that the gev encompasses to another asymptotic theory says that for extremes exceeding some high enough threshold u the gev distribution family may be approximated by the generalised pareto distribution gpd provided that x u 2 f x 1 1 ξ x u σ 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp x u σ ξ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter of the gev on the interval ξ σ is related to the gev scale parameter by σ σ ξ u μ where σ 0 and u is the extreme significant wave height threshold from here on the notation σ will be replaced with σ the benefit of modelling extremes with the gpd is that its parameters ξ and σ are less sensitive to the choice in threshold u provided that u is high enough 2 2 de clustering algorithms in a time series of data that describe a phenomenon in nature extremes tend to cluster together to ensure that two extreme wave samples are not part of the same storm it is important to de cluster the dataset when fitting an extreme value dataset to the gev it is common practice to de cluster the data using the standard storm length ssl method tawn 1988 or the de clustering algorithm deca proposed by soukissian and kalantzi 2011 ssl assumes that all storms last for a duration t furthermore it assumes that all wave height values before and after a time interval of t 2 from the storm s peak are independent from it deca constitutes a more physically meaningful method since it depends on the wave energy density proportional to h s 2 t e in deep water of a storm and only considers wave height values to be independent after a sufficient reduction in its energy content when fitting the gpd to an extreme value dataset it is possibly best practice to de cluster using the runs method where a new cluster of threshold exceedances is considered to start after a separation of at least r non exceeding datapoints from the previous cluster contrary to ssl the runs method considers how long it takes the sea to calm down rather than how long it remains stormy nevertheless a short coming of this approach is the arbitrary selection of the run length parameter r 2 2 1 runs de clustering in a time series of n datapoints the runs method considers the termination of a cluster to occur when at least r consecutive non exceedances of a threshold u follow the final exceedance in the cluster in extreme wave analysis the run length parameter r may be interpreted as the minimum required storm interval period of calm needed to achieve sample independence in the de clustered extreme dataset the total cluster count z is incremented every time an exceedance in the i th position of the time series is followed by r consecutive non exceedances a parameter w i with a binary value describes whether or not the i th observation exceeds the threshold an exceedance corresponds to w i 1 and a non exceedance corresponds to w i 0 this is to say 3 n i 1 n w i 4 z i 1 n w i 1 w i 1 1 w r 1 where n is the total number of exceedances smith and weissman 1994 the extremal index estimator is then defined as the reciprocal of the mean cluster size m and is given by 5 θ z n the parameter θ is an estimate of the true extremal index θ the extremal index ranges from 0 to 1 davis and mikosch 2009 and describes the clustering tendency of the data in the extreme case of θ 1 all clusters consist of only a single exceedance the other extreme is the case of θ 0 where the data consists of nothing but exceedances i e the selected threshold is too low 2 3 the extremal index before applying the runs method the extremal index θ should be estimated so that a run length parameter r that is optimal for the given dataset may be extracted this indicator θ has been presented in laurini and tawn 2003 and ferro and segers 2003 the value of r in eq 4 should not be chosen arbitrarily it should be chosen based on the clustering tendency of the data the extremal index estimator adopted throughout this paper is the one suggested by ferro and segers 2003 6 θ ˆ u 2 j 1 n 1 t j 1 2 n 1 j 1 n 1 t j 1 t j 2 if max t j 2 7 θ ˆ u 2 j 1 n 1 t j 2 n 1 j 1 n 1 t j 2 if max t j 2 whose first order bias is zero the above equation considers a set of datapoints with n exceedances of a threshold u where n 1 n n and observation i 1 n the extremal index estimator θ ˆ takes into consideration the inter exceedance times t j s j 1 s j where s j represents the position i of an exceedance and j 1 n 1 if n 1 the estimator of eqs 6 and 7 is illustrated in fig 1 for a set of observations and threshold u in addition to the extreme wave analysis presented in this paper the estimator has also been used to de cluster datasets in extreme water level arns et al 2013 and extreme rainfall acero et al 2011 studies 3 methodology runs de clustering with an inferred run length parameter was used to identify clusters of independent storms on which the pot method could then be applied to form an extreme value dataset the gpd was chosen as the model function for predicting extreme wave return values when a fixed threshold u is considered the distribution parameters of the gpd exhibit relatively low sensitivity to changes in threshold selection compared to those of the gev distribution a variable threshold approach to modelling extremes with the gpd is discussed by tancredi et al 2006 for a given threshold u q the gpd parameters were fitted to the resulting extreme wave dataset the mean excess was plotted against the threshold as were the shape and scale parameters the threshold u should be chosen from a region where the mean excess plot is linear with increasing threshold and where the shape and scale parameters fitted using maximum likelihood estimation mle remain constant coles 2001 a brief description of mle is presented in appendix a a subtlety of this approach is that the higher the threshold u the smaller the resultant extreme value dataset becomes with that in mind the lowest value of u was chosen where the linearity of the mean excesses of u and the constancy in ξ and σ began to be fulfilled in order to keep sample variance to a minimum this chosen set of ξ q and σ q for the corresponding threshold u q was then used as the best set of parameters for the gpd to model the location s extreme occurrences in significant wave height quantile quantile qq and probability probability pp plots can provide a visual check as to whether or not the extreme value dataset is well represented by the chosen model function if the empirical data align well with the modelled data then it is likely that the chosen model function is a good representation of the true extreme distribution of significant wave heights the run length parameter was inferred using the extremal index estimator of ferro and segers 2003 this process is summarised in fig 2 3 1 run length inference by extremal index estimation from a given wave record of significant wave heights h s a threshold u q is selected to define an extreme event before the runs method can be applied to de cluster the data the run length parameter r q should be chosen in a way that is not arbitrary but rather so that it is inferred by the data itself this can be accomplished by means of the extremal index θ ˆ which is based on the inter exceedance times t j beneath the threshold u q see eqs 6 and 7 and physically represents the reciprocal of the mean cluster size m q knowing the total number of exceedances n and knowing what the optimal extremal index should be from eqs 6 and 7 the run length parameter r q can be inferred from eq 4 threshold exceedances may then be de clustered using the runs method and the highest value in each cluster may be extracted using the pot method forming a dataset of extreme values finally mle may be used to fit the gpd to the extreme value dataset and obtain the parameters ξ q and σ q corresponding to the threshold u q 3 2 parameter stability and threshold selection the choice of threshold parameter is undertaken with the aid of graphical procedures as suggested by coles 2001 these are parameter stability plots and mean excess plots also known as mean residual life plots scarrot and macdonald 2012 if the gpd is a valid model for excesses over some high enough threshold u 0 then it will be valid for excesses over all thresholds u u 0 the expected value of the threshold excesses is given by 8 e x u x u σ u 0 ξ u 0 u 1 ξ for all u u 0 e x u x u is simply the mean value of the threshold excesses and is a linear function of u this linear relationship facilitates the use of a graphical procedure for identifying a suitably high threshold for modelling extremes via the gpd the point where the threshold excesses become linear with threshold u marks the beginning of the region of validity where the gev distribution may be approximated by the gpd in the mean excess linear region where the threshold choice is valid the gpd parameter estimates should also remain constant in fitting the shape and scale parameters of the gpd using mle there will be a region where the returned estimator values remain approximately constant with u constant gpd parameter estimates along with a linear region in the mean excess plot were used to justify the selection of the threshold value for the gpd above which significant wave height values are considered to be extreme the size of the resulting extreme value dataset decreases with increasing threshold u it should be noted that too high of a threshold will lead to a lower number of data and consequently a higher statistical variance on the other hand too low of a threshold could violate the validity of the gpd approximating the gev distribution although the techniques presented in this section are well established methods for the selection of the threshold u they inherently contain a small degree of subjectivity the quality of the model function s fit to the empirical data may be assessed by using a methodology suggested by coles qq and pp diagnostic plots coles 2001 described in appendix b 3 3 estimation of the return period the runs method involves extracting independent clusters from the dataset that exceed an extreme value threshold u and hence after applying the pot method to the independent clusters the remaining i i d dataset is extreme by definition after performing mle on the resulting extreme value dataset and obtaining gpd parameter estimates for ξ and σ the extreme significant wave height that is expected to occur only once every r years is given by 9 h s u σ ξ r z λ ξ 1 for ξ 0 where the notation denotes an extreme quantity λ is the number of years spanned by the original dataset and z is the number of i i d exceedances that make up the extreme value dataset 4 application of methodology to illustrate the proposed methodology this section presents a case study comparing two ocean basin locations with different characteristics both locations exhibit considerable wave energy resource and hence they may be regarded as favourable areas for exploitation kalogeri et al 2017 provided that the extreme occurrences in significant wave height are small enough to ensure the survivability of a converter runs de clustering with an inferred run length parameter was performed on significant wave height hindcast data to form an extreme value dataset for each location the proposed methodology was followed to obtain a gpd model for predicting the return period of an extreme occurrence in significant wave height 4 1 data used in the study areas the first site selected for applying the proposed methodology is situated on the northern part of the french west coast approximately 10km offshore with coordinates 47 42 24 63 n and 4 23 28 57 w at a water depth of 85m this location is exposed to the long atlantic fetch and hence the extremes are dominated by swell the second location is situated in the north sea with coordinates 55 8 60 n and 3 27 0 e at a water depth of 29m the north sea is a semi enclosed basin with a short fetch area the wave field is primarily wind driven wave extremes are caused by the passage of extra tropical cyclones and polar lows kalogeri et al 2017 the wave dataset used in this analysis is the product of hindcast simulations of the 3rd generation spectral ocean wave model wam the simulations were performed under the framework of the fp7 marina platform project https www msp platform eu projects marina platform by the atmospheric modelling and weather forecasting group of national and kapodistrian university of athens the data span the years 2001 2010 inclusive at an hourly interval providing information for the main met ocean parameters needed to describe the wave field of an area the data cover the entire european coastline with a resolution of 5 km the atmospheric model skiron provided the forcing wind field to wam with the same high spatial resolution and an hourly frequency kallos et al 1997 spyrou et al 2010 kallos et al 2006 the modelling system has been implemented in high resolution in a wide enough region to depict the main storm activity of the atlantic ocean that is responsible for remotely generated atlantic swell which reaches and affects the local wave field of the western coasts of europe the atmospheric and wave systems used in this model have assimilated available altimeter measurements to correct their initial conditions kalogeri et al 2017 patlakas et al 2016 2017 the general performance of the modelling system has been evaluated in numerous research and operational projects edwards et al 2014a b larsén et al 2015 kalogeri et al 2017 and its output has been also used for extreme value analysis patlakas et al 2016 2017 more details on the dataset and modelling approach may be found in kalogeri et al 2017 altimeter data have already been assimilated into wam so to validate the output of the model wave buoy measurements were used various statistical indices show that the dataset is in close agreement with these observations in particular for the areas under study a correlation coefficient greater than 0 8 between the modelled and measured significant wave heights indicates a strong linear relationship between them the data show low systematic error returning bias and root mean squared error rmse values both less than 0 4m and scatter indices 2 2 the scatter index is equal to the rmse divided by the mean less than 0 4 however it should be noted that buoys are not always reliable when recording the heights of extreme waves janssen 2002 therefore buoy measurements cannot guarantee a perfectly reliable source for evaluating the ability of a model to accurately predict extreme waves 4 2 results and discussion for both locations the 10 year hourly datasets of significant wave height are presented in fig 3 along with box plots depicting the seasonal nature of their wave resource if seasonality were successfully removed from a dataset an extreme wave phenomenon coming from the same parent distribution could be modelled in an effort to satisfy the homogeneity criterion of extreme value theory only the winter values were considered in the northern hemisphere waves are usually most energetic during the winter in this work winter values were defined as those spanning the months of december january and february in the box plots of fig 3 h s medians and quartile ranges denoted by the red lines and box edges respectively are highest during the winter months of both locations for both 10 year winter datasets of significant wave height two extreme value datasets were formed using runs de clustering above a threshold u q where the run length was inferred by the estimator θ ˆ given by eqs 6 and 7 in fig 4 a and b the mean cluster size m and run length parameter r are plotted as a function of the threshold u respectively providing insight into the clustering and separation tendencies of storm events at both locations the mean cluster size m initially decreases rapidly with increasing threshold u before reaching a point where the rate of decrease slows down significantly possibly at a value u that is high enough to make the gpd a valid approximation to the gev distribution the physical interpretation is that for low thresholds u a considerable portion of the significant wave heights that exceed u are either part of the wave climate s natural variability or represent a storm that is developing or calming down conversely for thresholds u that are high enough exceeding significant wave heights generally represent developed storms for very high extreme value thresholds a point is reached where the run length parameter begins to increase rapidly this corresponds to the situation where very few clusters of exceeding significant wave heights remain in the original time series thereby causing the minimum required storm interval to increase significantly mle was applied to the extreme value datasets in order to extract estimates of the parameters ξ q and σ q this procedure was repeated for many thresholds u q so that the threshold diagnostics described in the methodology could be used to choose the best values for defining the occurrence of an extreme event to compare the stability of the gpd parameters the shape and scale parameters ξ and σ are plotted against the threshold u in fig 5 a d the corresponding mean excesses are also plotted against the threshold u in fig 5 e and f these plots helped determine the appropriate thresholds u q for the gpd model of the extreme wave occurrences in the two locations the reported methodology was repeated for thresholds u q ranging from 2 50 8 00 m for the west coast of france and 1 00 6 50 m for the north sea both with a step size of 0 25m as outlined in the methodology a region with little change in the distribution parameter estimates and a region of linearity in the mean excesses has been identified in the runs de clustering plots between u q 4 25 m and u q 5 75 m for the west coast of france and between u q 2 00 m and u q 3 25 m for the north sea shown by the highlighted areas in figs 5 a f the lower part of this range was preferred in order to reduce the variance and although the selection was still slightly arbitrary a threshold of u q 4 25 m was chosen as the definition of an extreme event occurrence for the west coast of france and a threshold of u q 2 75 m was chosen for the north sea with these thresholds 88 and 156 independent storm values were de clustered for the west coast of france and the north sea which were then used to form the extreme value datasets the corresponding shape and scale parameters ξ q 0 13 σ q 2 50 m and ξ q 0 32 σ q 2 09 m were selected for the west coast of france and the north sea which were then used to fully specify their respective gpd functions as given by eq 2 with the gpd models determined their representation of the hindcast data could be described qualitatively with the aid of pp and qq plots illustrated in fig 6 if the fit is good the dots in these figures should closely follow the straight dashed red lines which is the case here this means that the gpd with the fitted parameters from mle was a good extreme wave model for the hindcast data of the studied locations for the open sea area french coast an extreme value threshold of u q 4 25 m was selected with shape and scale parameters ξ q 0 13 and σ q 2 50 m for the semi enclosed basin north sea the extreme value threshold of u q 2 75 m was selected with shape and scale parameters ξ q 0 32 and σ q 2 09 m as a final check for independence between the samples of selected extreme value datasets their autocorrelation tendencies were examined as shown in fig 7 a and b no noticeable pattern exists in the autocorrelations of the extreme datasets and the majority of lags after the zero lag do not exceed two times the standard error denoted by the dashed lines in the figure these gpd models were then used to predict the return periods of extreme significant wave height occurrences as shown in fig 8 in both locations the first 20 years show a significant increase in the extreme return value with increasing return period there is little difference in the predicted return values between a 50 year return period and a 100 year return period although the qq and pp plots shown in fig 6 suggest a good fit of the modelled data to the empirical data it is clear from the range of 90 confidence intervals in fig 8 a that in the case of the west coast of france 88 extreme wave occurrences were simply not enough data to keep statistical uncertainty within reasonable limits to study the extreme wave resource of this location with higher accuracy a time series of significant wave height spanning more years would need to be obtained sartini et al 2015 surendran et al 2005 kumar et al 2009 this was not the case for the north sea fig 8 b where a larger extreme wave sample of 156 occurrences gave much lower uncertainty in the predicted extreme wave return values the smaller sample of extremes in the long fetch area french coast can be attributed to the fact that its wave field is swell dominated the swell formations are the result of remotely generated weather systems that can travel hundreds of kilometres with little attenuation they tend to persist for longer periods of time compared to the wind sea wave fields of the north sea which are coupled to the local weather conditions and closely follow their changes barber and ursell 1948 munk et al 1963 cavaleri et al 2007 ardhuin et al 2009 therefore during the same 10 year sample period the swell dominated location exhibited fewer independent storms than the wind sea location consequently in the two original h s time series of the same length the one pertaining to the west coast of france had fewer independent storm data points because individual storms would last longer than in the north sea this lead to a smaller de clustered extreme value dataset for the west coast of france and a consequently higher statistical uncertainty in its predicted extreme wave values compared to the north sea 4 3 comparative analysis with other de clustering algorithms diagnostic plots for mle fitted gpd parameters were also generated for the two alternative de clustering algorithms described in section 2 2 i e ssl tawn 1988 and deca soukissian and kalantzi 2006 to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with algorithms that currently exist in the literature the following investigations were made regarding the stability of the gpd shape and scale parameters using storm length and energy reduction parameter values that are frequently suggested in the literature for ssl and deca respectively using the extremal index estimator of eqs 6 and 7 and the total number of threshold exceeding significant wave heights n to calculate the optimal number of values z in the extreme dataset then finding the storm length and energy reduction parameter values for ssl and deca that would make the dataset be of this size for the first investigation commonly used storm length values of 24 48 72 96 and 120 h were considered for the ssl algorithm zachary et al 1998 soukissian and arapi 2011 similarly commonly used wave energy reductions of 80 85 90 and 95 were considered for the deca algorithm soukissian and arapi 2011 threshold exceedances were de clustered using ssl and deca while considering these typical de clustering parameter values from the clusters that were identified this way as being storms the peak values were taken from each cluster to form an extreme value dataset one for every u examined with ssl the gpd parameter stability plots of fig 9 show that both the west coast of france and the north sea exhibited higher i e less negative shape parameters and lower scale parameters for shorter storm lengths in fig 10 deca exhibited the same tendency when lower energy reductions were considered for the gpd shape parameter in particular it is clear from fig 10 a and b that the region of stability varies significantly with choice of de clustering parameter in fig 9 a and b the gpd parameter response is comparatively more consistent with changing de clustering parameters than in the case of fig 10 a and b however there seems to be a definite downward shift in the shape parameter responses and upward shift in the scale parameter responses with increasing storm length parameter these results suggest that unless the use of a particular storm length or energy reduction can be justified for ssl and deca arbitrarily choosing these values and using them for all thresholds could lead to a region of stability that poorly represents the extreme nature of a given wave climate the second investigation made use of the extremal index estimator to infer optimal storm length and energy reduction values for ssl and deca at every threshold u q this allowed a fair comparison of gpd shape and scale parameter stabilities to be made with those obtained using the runs method knowing the number n of significant wave heights exceeding u and estimating θ from eqs 6 and 7 the number of de clustered values z forming the extreme dataset may be calculated using eq 5 the de clustering parameter of a given algorithm is hence inferred as being the one to separate the original h s time series into z clusters each of them assumed to represent an independent storm event containing on average m consecutive extreme values of h s in runs de clustering the run length parameter r is inferred as being the one to make eq 4 hold and this was found by trial and error similarly in the ssl and deca algorithms the storm length and energy reduction parameters were found by trial and error to be those which would separate the h s time series into z clusters although it is likely that deca is a very robust algorithm in terms of ensuring independence in the samples of an extreme value dataset its two stages of monotonicity filtering inherently leave very few remaining samples in the resulting h s time series for a given threshold u q when the number of de clustered exceedances z q that was suggested by the extremal index estimator θ q turned out to be higher than the number of samples remaining after deca de clustering even with an energy reduction of 1 the deca extreme value dataset was simply formed using the remaining h s extremes this was the case for threshold values in fig 11 where the fitted gpd parameters of deca deviated noticeably from those of ssl and runs de clustering for both the west coast of france and the north sea the runs method seems to have performed best when coupled with extremal index based inferencing of its de clustering parameter 5 conclusions this paper presented a new methodology for the estimation of return periods of extreme significant wave height occurrences the methods presented in this work could be of particular interest when designing for survivability in a marine environment modelling of extreme events relies on the formation of an extreme dataset of i i d values since the extremes of natural phenomena tend to cluster de clustering techniques are used to identify independent clusters from which the pot method is used to pick out their maxima although current bibliography encourages the use of runs de clustering for extreme wave analysis the choice of run length parameter has remained arbitrary therefore an extremal index inferencing method from statistics literature one that is based on the inter exceedance times of the data was proposed to infer the optimal run length once the data has been de clustered and subjected to the pot method the newly formed extreme dataset may then be fitted to a model distribution in this paper the gpd was chosen due to the low sensitivity of its parameters to the choice of extreme value threshold for a given threshold mle was used to estimate the corresponding gpd shape and scale parameters the proposed methodology was applied to hindcast data between the years 2001 2010 for two locations with different climatological characteristics diagnostic plots assisted with the selection of an appropriate threshold for both locations the mean threshold excesses as well as the stability of the shape and scale parameters as a function of the threshold once a threshold had been selected along with its corresponding shape and scale parameters the respective quantiles and probabilities of the empirical data and the gpd model were plotted together on qq and pp plots the resulting gpd model was used to predict the return periods of extreme significant wave height occurrences a considerable spread in the predicted return periods was obtained for the location off the west coast of france and a significantly smaller spread was obtained for the north sea location this was likely attributed to the fact that the swell formations reaching the coasts of france are more persistent systems than the wind driven waves of the north sea for the same time series length there were fewer independent storms from which the pot method was able to form an independent set of extreme values and a smaller sample implies higher variance finally the performance of the proposed methodology was compared to that of existing algorithms ssl and deca were first tested using storm length and energy reduction values that had frequently been used in the literature then the de clustering parameters of ssl and deca were also inferred using extremal index estimation qualitatively speaking it was found that runs de clustering with a run length parameter that is inferred via extremal index estimation exhibited the best gpd parameter

like to thank professor jonathan tawn from the department of mathematics and statistics of lancaster university for his constructive suggestions and dr christopher ferro from university of exeter for kindly answering their questions on his extremal index estimator the authors have also benefited from discussions with dr takvor soukissian from the hellenic centre for marine research appendix a maximum likelihood estimation the gpd parameters are fitted to the extreme data by using maximum likelihood estimation mle the purpose of mle is to find the distribution parameters of a representative model function so that the probability of obtaining the de clustered i i d extreme dataset is maximised since the joint probability of a series of independent events x k is equal to the product of the events individual probabilities p x x k a likelihood function may be defined as the joint probability of having obtained the resulting i i d extreme dataset for a given set of gpd parameters ξ and σ a 1 l k 1 z p x x k ξ σ the parameter z had previously been used to denote the number of independent clusters resulting from runs de clustering since the pot method picks out only one peak value from each cluster z will be used from hereon to represent the size of the de clustered extreme dataset such that k 1 z the objective of mle is to find the optimal set of model function parameters such that the likelihood function is maximised appendix b quantile quantile and probability probability diagnostic plots ordered statistics lie at the core of this methodology it is of interest to investigate how well the empirical quantiles and probabilities correspond to their respective modelled counterparts it begins with ranking the values of the extreme dataset where the highest rank i e m 1 corresponds to the greatest significant wave height the empirical quantiles are simply given by the values of the extreme dataset whilst the empirical cumulative probabilities are given by b 1 f emp 1 m δ 1 where δ is the number of independent storms and m is the rank of the storm and lies on the interval m 1 δ the theoretical quantiles are given by solving for x in eq 2 where parameters ξ and σ are those returned by the mle method for the threshold u and f x is the empirical cumulative probability given by eq b 1 specifically b 2 x mod u σ ξ 1 f emp ξ 1 where x mod is the modelled quantile similarly the modelled cumulative probability may be obtained by solving eq 2 for the empirical quantiles of x and the distribution parameters ξ and σ returned by mle this is to say b 3 f mod 1 1 ξ x emp u σ 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp x emp u σ ξ 0 where x emp are the empirical values from the extreme dataset if the selection of the gpd with the returned mle parameters ξ q and σ q for the threshold u q is a wise choice for the studied data then the empirical and modelled values on the qq and pp plots will consist of data points close to the unit diagonal li et al 2012
