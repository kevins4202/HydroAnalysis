1275,under tidal scouring residual petroleum in the intertidal sediment after oil spills could release again causing secondary pollution in the marine ecosystem the current study aimed to investigate the dynamic process and principles of crude oil release from silty intertidal sediment under different influencing factors and screened for the key factors in this paper the fitting equations and correlation between the release amount and various factors were explored through the single factor and orthogonal experiments then the key influencing factors were selected for multi factor fitting of the release amount the results showed that the oil release amount rose with the increase in oil concentration oscillation frequency and release time but decreased with an increase in salinity as the ph decreased the oil release amount increased the relationship between release amount and concentration oscillation frequency can be equipped by the polynomial equation and the average r2 was 0 95 and 0 84 respectively the release amount can be fitted by the lagergren pseudo second order kinetic equation with time with the average r2 0 89 the ph was negatively correlated with the release amount in the fresh contaminated sediment but positively correlated with the weathered one the correlation between each factor and oil release amount was ranked from large to small as oil concentration oscillation frequency salinity time and ph at last a polynomial equation can be fitted between the key influencing factors oil concentration and oscillation frequency and the release amount the results can provide a theoretical basis for predicting the secondary pollution owing to the oil re release from intertidal sediment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords crude oil silty

leakage polluting the marine and intertidal environment crude oil is a complex compound composed of alkanes cyclanes and aromatics which can cause cancer deformities and mutations in humans pan et al 2013 removing oil in a short time is difficult after polluting the environmental media under wave and tide residual oil would release into seawater in large quantities causing secondary pollution and threatening the marine ecosystem large offshore spills usually recover only a fraction of the oil etkin and nedwed 2020 studies on the west falmouth oil spill have shown that a substantial amount of moderately degraded oil remains 8 20 cm below the sediment surface culbertson et al 2007 kirman et al 2016 studying factors affecting the oil release from sediment helps to explore the release mechanism in the marine system oil migration is affected by dissolution biodegradation gong et al 2014 adsorption desorption and dilution by water with the increase in temperature ph liu et al 2007 dissolved organic matter dom hydrodynamic frequency sand concentration wu 2006 and decrease in particle size wang 2010 the oil partially absorbed on sediment particles organic matter and black carbon liu et al 2010 mathialagan and viraraghavan 2008 wang et al 2011 would accelerate desorption and diffusion into overlying water however wu 2006 showed that increasing salinity and ph slowed the desorption and diffusion of oil components into overlying water in addition deng 2017 found that ph had different oil release effects on the fresh and weathered oil stained sand on the sandy beach liu 2006 demonstrated that the fluctuation degree of water flow had little influence on oil release in the river lake system the oil release amount in water is positively related to the oil concentration in sediment under the same release condition the higher the pollution intensity the higher the oil saturation concentration in water and the faster the oil release rate from sediment guo et al 2011 wu 2006 found that the oil absorption and release from the sandy beach were always conducted simultaneously when the oil concentration in water decreases oil re releases and causes pollution again although the adsorption behavior of petroleum or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs on soil sediment has been studied noort et al 2003 yu et al 2011 cao et al 2011 portet et al 2013 poot et al 2014 yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 the establishment of equations describing the release dynamics will provide a basis for further study of the release mechanism guo et al 2011 wu and gschwend 1986 and walter et al 1992 have established the thermodynamic and kinetic models for the adsorption and desorption of oil hydrophobic components in natural sediment and suspended solids the lagergren first order equation lfo was the most commonly used equation tseng et al 2010 chang 2013 guo et al 2011 showed that the oil released into the water from sediment was a typical first order kinetic process which can be described using the hysteretic film model lin et al 1997 deng 2017 also demonstrated that after the oil release from fresh and weathered oil contaminated sand reached a balance the release law of fresh oil contaminated sand complied with the lagergren pseudo second order kinetic equation means 1995 li and luo 2014 fei et al 2015 while the release law of weathered sand conformed to the lagergren pseudo first order release kinetic equation jiang et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 collected sediment from the bohai sea and simulated the static release process of heavy oil pollution in the laboratory they found that the oil release process could be fitted by lagergren s first order equation lfo and the concentration equilibrium could be reached in 48 h without hydrodynamic conditions there is a logarithmic relationship between the equilibrium concentration and the first order rate constant of the fitted curve based on the aforementioned studies studying the oil release kinetics from sediment would benefit the prediction and evaluation of the harm degree caused by oil into the overlying water and provide theoretical support for the treatment of oil release from the above the oil release rules in different sediment types differ under the same influencing factor more importantly there is a lack of research on silty intertidal sediment and the oil release kinetic equations need further verification in the paper the marine sediment in the silty intertidal zone along the zhoushan archipelago and light crude oil were selected as the research object and single factor analysis was used to study the influence of oscillation frequency time salinity and ph on the oil release from fresh and weathered oil contaminated sediment then the fitting equations between the release amount and different influencing factors were explored thirdly the pearson correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between each factor and release amount after that the critical influencing factors were selected for orthogonal experiment verification and the optimal release combination condition was determined finally a polynomial surface equation with the key influencing factors as independent variables and the oil release amount as the target was established 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials 2 1 1 crude oil the light crude oil used in the experiment was obtained from cezi island zhoushan its viscosity was measured as 980 mpa s using an ndj5s rotary viscometer shanghai changji geological instrument co ltd the first institute of oceanology ministry of natural resources was commissioned to determine the content of each component before and after volatilization by chromatography relevant results are listed in table 1 alkanes mainly included n alkanes propane and phytane pahs mainly included naphthalene phenanthrene dibenzothiophene fluorene pyridine and their derivatives the main biomarkers were sterane and hopene as shown in table 1 crude oil contained the most alkanes after one month of volatilization the content of alkanes and pahs decreased and the proportion of relative pah and biomarker content increased pan et al 2020 2 1 2 sediment the tested sediment was collected from the low tidal region of the silty intertidal zone on changzhi island zhoushan zhejiang province china after natural weathering the sediment was roughly screened using a 0 5 mm standard screen to remove large particles and other impurities the particle size of sediment was measured in the zhoushan marine ecological environment monitoring station of zhejiang province using the laser method specified in marine survey specification part 8 marine geology and geography survey gb t12763 8 2007 by microtrac laser particle size analyzer microtrac s3500 usa the results are presented in table 2 the structure scanning by scanning electron microscopy zeiss evo 18 10 kv germany in fig 1a revealed many pores distributed on the sediment surface further barrett joyner halenda bjh analysis in fig 1b showed that the pore sizes of microporous and mesoporous in the sediment were mainly 0 25 nm and for some samples pore size was larger than that close to 250 nm according to the h3 type mesoporous hysteresis ring analysis of the pore size pores on the surface of the sediment mainly included flat slit structure crack and wedge shaped structure the c value in the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area test was 335 68 200 indicating that the tested sediment had a strong adsorption capacity for oil the organic carbon content in the sediment was 1 14 which was three times that of the sand sample 0 44 the increase in organic carbon content increased the oil release amount from the sediment to reach the equilibrium concentration yuan et al 2017 the results demonstrated that the silty sediment has a strong adsorption capacity and a tremendous great slow release effect after being polluted by oil some oil continues to release into the seawater under the action of the tide causing additional long term harm to the marine environment 2 1 3 tested seawater in the experiment seawater was artificially prepared by adding artificial sea salt guangzhou yier biological engineering co ltd to distilled water artificial seawater with different ph was prepared by adding 3 mol l hcl and 2 mol l naoh solution 2 2 experimental methods to study the factors affecting the oil release from silty intertidal sediment fresh and weathered contaminated sediment were prepared to simulate the different stages of intertidal pollution after the oil spill according to the actual oil pollution in the sediment after the oil spill and the saturated oil concentration fresh and weathered sediment were prepared with crude oil mass and dry sediment according to the mass ratios of 2 4 6 8 and 10 respectively firstly the crude oil and sediment were mixed evenly according to the mass ratio then the fresh contaminated sediment samples were sealed and placed in a dark place for 24 h and the weathered contaminated samples were placed in a dark and ventilated place for 30 d a single factor batch simulation experiment method was used to simulate the oil release process under different influence factors 10 g of each contaminated sediment sample was added to a 250 ml conical flask and 150 ml of artificial seawater was added the hydrodynamic force was carried out by adjusting the oscillation frequency deng 2017 yuan et al 2020 the gas bath thermostatic oscillator th2 a shanghai jingqi instrument co ltd was adjusted to rotate at speeds of 100 120 140 160 180 and 200 r min for 2 h at a temperature of 30 c ph of 8 and salinity of 35 the oil release times were set as 10 30 60 90 120 180 240 and 300 min deng 2017 at the same time the salinity temperature ph and oscillator frequency were 35 30 c 8 and 160 r min respectively referenced with the average salinity 35 of the actual seawater and dilution after pollution the salinity values of seawater were 15 20 25 30 and 35 in which the temperature ph oscillator frequency and time were 30 c 8 160 r min 2 h respectively additionally considering the average ph 7 9 8 4 of actual seawater deng 2017 and a complex situation such as seawater pollution different ph values were set as 5 10 and the interval was 1 for the other factors in the ph experiment salinity temperature time and oscillator frequency were set at 35 30 c 2 h and 160 r min respectively each factor was set in 3 parallel experiments the experimental design parameters are listed in table 3 after the oscillation the conical flask was stood for 2 h then 20 ml of the overlying seawater was sampled to measure the oil release amount by ultraviolet spectrophotometry hj 970 2018 2018 according to the correlation analysis of the single factor batch experiment the interaction influence of the critical factors namely oil concentration oscillation frequency and salinity on the oil release from the sediment was studied the orthogonal experiment adopted 3 factors and 3 levels formulated by spss the experimental method was the same as above the temperature was set at 30 c the time was 2 h and the ph was 8 2 3 data processing method the variation trends of oil release amount with different influencing factors were drawn using matlab r2019a and origin 2018 was used to fit the equation between different influencing factors and oil release amount in addition spss ibm spss statistics 24 was used to conduct a pearson correlation analysis between each factor and oil release amount the multi factor equation was established using matlab r2019a with major factors 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of oscillation frequency on the oil release from sediment as shown in fig 2 the peak release amount of both fresh and weathered sediment appeared at a concentration of 10 and an oscillation frequency of 200 r min the maximum oil release amount from the fresh and weathered contaminated sediments was16 68 mg l and 9 98 mg l respectively therefore the higher the oil concentration in the sediment the higher the oscillation frequency and the greater the oil release amount from the sediment when the oil concentration was 2 and the oscillation frequency was 160 r min the oil release amount from the fresh contaminated sediment was 3 95 mg l which was higher than that from the weathered contaminated sediment the release amount from the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment at the other concentrations exhibited the same variation law in other words the release amount in the fresh contaminated sediment was higher than that in the weathered contaminated sediment at the same concentration and oscillation frequency this result may be because oil molecules are mainly adsorbed on sediment particles through the affinity of surface active ions in this adsorption system the lipophilic bases of the active ions are attached to oil molecules chao et al 1997 with an increase in oscillation frequency the motion energy obtained by the sediment increases and there is sufficient collision and friction between the sediment particles which makes the lipophilic bases fracture thus it is very easy to destroy the stable state of the combination between sediment particles and oil deng 2017 fig 2a showed that the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment with five different oil concentrations was significantly improved between 160 r min and 200 r min relative to other rotating speeds with the increase in oscillation frequency many sediment particles appear to be suspended the contact area between sediment particles and overlying water increases the bonds among particles are broken and turbulent diffusion begins to dominate chen et al 2019 therefore the oil release amount was improved this finding was consistent with that of deng 2017 and yuan et al 2020 namely oil desorption efficiency increased as oscillation frequency a representative parameter of hydrodynamic condition increased during the preparation of the fresh contaminated sediment the combination of crude oil and sediment was not close and the volatile components in the weathered contaminated sediment were lost to a certain extent after one month of weathering the remaining crude oil components in the weathering process were more closely combined with the sediment and there was sufficient weathering oil film to fully wrap the sediment particles deng et al 2018 thus the release amount reduced and the stability of the release amount increased in general the oil release amount increased with an increase in oscillation frequency and the increase in the amplitude of the fresh contaminated sediment was larger than that of the weathered sediment which was consistent with other studies wu 2006 deng 2017 yuan et al 2017 3 2 influence of time on the oil release from sediment as shown in fig 3a the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment at 10 min with 2 and 10 concentrations were 2 18 and 9 07 mg l respectively with an increase in the oil content in the sediment the difference in oil concentration between the solid and liquid phases increased and the release amount increased deng 2017 the oil concentration in 2 and 4 contaminated sediment was relatively low and the figure curve changed gently with the increase in release time still the oil release amount showed an overall fluctuating upward trend with an increase in time the oil release amount of 6 concentration firstly increased 10 30 min then decreased 30 60 min and then continued to increase again 60 300 min reaching a maximum of 11 06 mg l the oil concentration of 8 and 10 contaminated sediment was relatively high and the oil release amount decreased in 10 30 min the oil release amount of the 8 oil contaminated sediment fluctuated and increased which was generally higher than that at 10 min the oil release amount of 10 contaminated sediment fluctuated and increased in the condition that the oil release amount was 10 min 30 120 min and the highest oil release amount was 11 98 mg l the oil release from sediment required two processes the oil in the sediment was desorbed into the pore water first and then diffused into the overlying water xie et al 2005 the oil release amount of 2 6 contaminated sediment increased with time at the early stage which may be because oil was not fully combined with sediment particles during the sample preparation process and then released rapidly with an increase in time the oil release amount decreased temporarily which may be due to the decrease in the oil concentration difference between the solid and liquid phase and part of the oil desorbed in water was adsorbed to the sediment particles again wu 2006 zhao et al 2015 therefore the adsorption and desorption processes were simultaneous wu 2006 as the release time extended the hydrodynamically induced desorption was dominant and the oil release amount increased again yuan et al 2020 because of the high pollution concentration of 8 10 contaminated sediment oil released rapidly at the early stage the concentration difference between the solid and liquid phase decreased and oil in water was re adsorbed leading to a temporary decrease in oil release amount as time increased in general the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment at different concentrations increased with time and the oil release amount simultaneously increased with concentration as shown in fig 3b the release amount of the weathered contaminated sediment with 2 pollution concentration decreased in a fluctuating manner with an increase in time and the release amount at 300 min 2 27 mg l was lower than that at 10 min 3 16 mg l the oil release amount of sediment with 4 10 concentration decreased within 10 30 min and then increased again the oil release amount of 4 and 6 concentration reached the first small peak at 90 min and 4 15 mg l and 6 58 mg l respectively after 90 min the oil release amount increased in a fluctuating manner and the oil release amount at both concentrations at 300 min was higher than that at 10 min when petroleum hydrocarbon molecules enter microbial cells they are oxidized by oxygenase to aliphatic alcohols which are converted to aliphatic acids and acyl coenzyme a and subsequently degraded by β oxidation li and ding 2021 the oil release amount of the weathered contaminated sediment was relatively high at the early stage which may be mainly due to the increase in water soluble components caused by microbial degradation of oil ledesma and nicaud 2016 after the concentration difference between the solid and liquid phase gradually decreased some oil components were re absorbed by the sediment the higher the pollution concentration the more obvious the re adsorption effect and the less the influence of time and hydrodynamic action on oil release in general the highest oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment appeared at 10 concentration 11 98 mg l after 300 min and that of the weathered contaminated sediment appeared at 4 concentration 12 23 mg l at the same pollution concentration the oil release amount of the weathered contaminated sediment was greater than that of the fresh contaminated sediment at the early stage within 10 min at the later stage after 30 min the former was generally less than the latter except for 4 concentration which was mainly caused by microbial degradation of oil in the weathered contaminated sediment ahmad et al 2020 this was different from the result of deng 2017 that the release amount of the fresh oil contaminated sand was greater than that of the weathered contaminated sand mainly because of the different sediment types in our study silty sediment had a small particle size high organic matter content and obvious biodegradation effect thus time had a greater impact on the oil release from the fresh contaminated sediment than the weathered contaminated sediment and the release amount would increase as oil concentration and release time increased xie et al 2000 for the weathered contaminated sediment the short term release amount under different pollution concentrations or the long term release amount under moderate pollution conditions would be higher than the ones under other circumstances 3 3 influence of salinity on the oil release from sediment in fig 4 the oil release amount of the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment with five different oil concentrations formed a slope that decreased slightly from right to left in the salinity axis that is with an increase in salinity the oil release amount from the sediment gradually decreases some studies have shown that salinity affects the pollutant concentration in the aquatic system cao et al 2011 soubaneh et al 2014 this phenomenon occurs because the increase in the salinity enhances the oil adsorption strength in the sediment further reducing the solubility of oil in water this phenomenon is called the salting out effect tremblay et al 2005 you et al 2010 and turner 2003 have found that the salting out effect strengthens the adsorption of organic matter with an increase in salinity other studies have demonstrated that increasing salinity would also increase the number of oil particle aggregates opas sun et al 2014 fitzpatrick et al 2015 this is mainly due to that the increase of salinity in seawater means the increase of charged ions charged ions can compress the double electric layer and improve the close contact between oil molecules and sediment thus making some particles condense and settle deng 2017 the above phenomenon inhibits the desorption of oil chao et al 1997 chen et al 2012 and results in a slight decrease in oil release amount with increasing salinity however in the two contaminated sediment states the oil release in the fresh state was more unstable than that in the weathered state therefore the sediment state affects oil release from the sediment under the influence of salinity in general the oi release amount decreased with increasing seawater salinity similar to the other studies wu 2006 deng 2017 yuan et al 2020 3 4 influence of ph on the oil release from sediment when the ph in the seawater changes a series of acid base reactions with sediment particles or oil may be induced which will affect the oil release amount from sediment deng 2017 as shown in fig 5 the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment had higher oil solubility and more significant oil release amount in low ph and acidic environments than in other ph cases tremblay et al 2005 when the ph increased from 5 to 7 the release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment with five different concentrations decreased to varying degrees and a turning point appeared in the graph for example the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment with 2 oil concentration decreased from 1 88 to 1 65 mg l in this ph change mainly due to the simultaneous desorption and adsorption of sediment wu 2006 as the ph increased the acidity of the water sediment system decreased and the oil solubility in the water diminished therefore the oil release amount from sediment decreased with the increase in ph from 7 to 9 the alkalinity of the artificial seawater environment increased the mixture of organic compounds such as carboxylic acids esters phenols and halogenated hydrocarbons in the oil would react with the alkali deng 2017 resulting in an increase in the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment from 1 64 to 4 00 mg l such as in 2 oil contaminated sediment the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment with other oil concentrations also showed similar characteristics of increasing oil release amount when the ph was 9 the oil release amount decreased significantly and another turning point appeared in the graph with an increase in alkalinity mg2 and al3 in seawater tends to form white flocculating constituents attached to the surface of the sediment which hinders the release of soluble oil thus the mass concentration of oil in water decreases significantly wu et al 2008 similar to the fresh contaminated sediment the weathered contaminated sediment showed two turning points still the turning point of oil release from the weathered contaminated sediment at ph 7 was not noticeable the maximum oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment was 12 68 mg l and that of the weathered contaminated sediment was 9 05 mg l the oil film of the weathered contaminated sediment was more tightly wrapped than that of the fresh contaminated sediment which caused the amount of opas to be larger than that in the fresh contaminated sediment and the oil release amount was smaller as shown in fig 4 when the seawater was in strong acid or weak base environment the oil release amount from the sediment was greater than in other ph li et al 1997 3 5 relationship equations between oil release amount and different influencing factors table 4 shows the determination coefficients of different fitting equations between oil release amounts and various influencing factors according to r2 lagergren s pseudo second order release dynamics equation fitted better than the polynomial equation between time and oil release amount the fitting r2 of the lagergren pseudo first order release dynamics equation was negative and had no reference significance it can be seen that with the change in oil release time the oil release law of silty intertidal sediment applied to the lagergren pseudo second order release kinetics equation and the fitting effect of the fresh contaminated sediment r2 0 9472 was better than that of the weathered contaminated sediment r2 0 8411 this result was consistent with deng 2017 and yuan et al 2017 by comparing r2 in table 4 for all the influencing factors the polynomial equation provided the best description of the oil release law r2 0 9243 from the fresh contaminated sediment with different pollution concentrations followed by oscillation frequency r2 0 8705 and salinity r2 0 8045 for oil release from the weathered contaminated sediment the fitting effect from high to low was oil concentration r2 0 9820 oscillation frequency r2 0 8026 and salinity r2 0 6942 combined with the r2 of polynomial and lagergren s pseudo second order release kinetics equation the oil release law of the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment was evident under the influence of concentration oscillation frequency time and salinity but not very obvious for ph by comparing the r2 the fitting equation of oil release amount from the fresh contaminated sediment was superior to that from the weathered contaminated sediment under the influence of time and salinity the opposite phenomenon occurred under the influence of concentration and little difference was observed between the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment under the influence of oscillation frequency this result indicated that time and salinity had a greater influence on pollutant migration in sediment under short term pollution than long term pollution fitzpatrick et al 2015 deng 2017 as the combination of various ions in oil and sediment became more stable for a long time the influence of oil concentration increased in prominence gustitus et al 2017 yuan et al 2020 3 6 correlation between oil release amount and various factors as shown in fig 6 the pearson correlation coefficients obtained by correlation analysis with spss showed that the concentration oscillation frequency and time of the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment were positively correlated with oil release amount the correlation coefficient was oil concentration oscillation frequency time there was a significant positive correlation between oil concentration and release amount in both the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment p 0 01 with pearson correlation coefficients of 0 724 and 0 709 respectively which were consistent with the results of yuan et al 2020 indicating that oil concentration was the most critical factor affecting the release amount there was an extremely significant positive correlation between the oscillation frequency of the fresh contaminated sediment and the oil release amount p 0 01 with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 543 for the weathered contaminated sediment there was a positive correlation with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 274 the release time of the fresh contaminated sediment was significantly positively correlated with the oil release amount p 0 05 and there was also a positive correlation for the weathered contaminated sediment in which the pearson correlation coefficients were 0 350 and 0 250 respectively however the salinity of the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment negatively correlated with the oil release amount in which there was an extremely significant negative correlation p 0 01 for the fresh contaminated sediment with a correlation coefficient of 0 537 and a negative correlation for the weathered contaminated sediment with a correlation coefficient of 0 233 the relationship between ph and oil release amount differed between the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment the fresh contaminated sediment showed a negative correlation and the weathered contaminated sediment showed a positive correlation and correlation coefficients were 0 068 and 0 150 respectively based on fig 6 the absolute value of the correlation coefficients in both fresh and weathered contaminated sediment ranked as oil concentration oscillation frequency salinity time ph therefore concentration in the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment was the most important influencing factor for oil release this finding occurred because with the increase in oil concentration of sediment the concentration difference of the solid liquid phase in the water sediment system increased promoting the desorption of petroleum from sediment wu 2006 deng 2017 as the second influencing factor of oil release oscillation frequency had a significant effect on the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment relative to the fresh contaminated sediment part of the oil in the weathered contaminated sediment was degraded and volatilized gu et al 2016 ahmad et al 2020 pan et al 2021 and the residual oil was stable in combination with the sediment particles therefore with the increase in oscillation frequency the oil in the weathered contaminated sediment would release slowly and the oil release amount was stable while the oil binding state with sediment particles was unstable in the fresh contaminated sediment which caused the oil release amount to fluctuate wildly and change with the oscillation frequency as subordinate factors time and salinity had a greater impact on the oil release from the fresh contaminated sediment than on the weathered contaminated sediment and ph had different effects on the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment in different manners and degree which was consistent with the variation law described in figs 3 5 3 7 effects of multi factor interaction on oil release from sediment from fig 6a the oil concentration oscillation frequency and salinity were extremely significantly correlated with the oil release amount combined with the absolute value of the pearson correlation coefficient the 3 factors were selected to carry out an orthogonal experiment as shown in table 5 range analysis was used to analyze the influence of different factors on oil release amount and find the optimal conditions in which the oil release amount was the biggest in the range analysis method wang 2021 the greater the value of r factor range the greater the impact of this factor on the oil release amount from table 5 for both fresh and weathered contaminated sediment the r value of the oil concentration was the largest followed by the oscillation frequency and the salinity was relatively small the optimal condition combination of oil release was oil concentration of 10 oscillation frequency of 200 r min and salinity of 15 the result of the orthogonal experiment was consistent with the one of correlation analysis between oil release amount and each factor as shown in table 5 for the two kinds of sediment oil concentration was the most important factor for release but the r value of different factors for the fresh contaminated sediment was greater than the weathered sediment the result showed that each factor had more effect on the fresh contaminated sediment than the weathered one one of the reasons was that after weathering part of the oil volatilized and the oil concentration in the sediment reduced compared with the fresh contaminated sediment on the other hand the oil molecules were more closely connected with the sediment particles in weathering contaminated sediment so that the oil release was less affected by various factors than the fresh contaminated sediment at the same time the r difference between oil concentration and other factors of the weathered contaminated sediment was bigger than the fresh one it may be that during the weathering process part of the oil component was degraded by microorganisms ledesma and nicaud 2016 ahmad et al 2020 the water soluble component increased and the higher the oil concentration the more obvious the oil release by contrast the other 2 factors had less impact than oil concentration based on the correlation analysis of the single factor and range analysis of the orthogonal experiment it can be seen that the two factors of oil concentration and oscillation frequency were significantly positively correlated with the oil release amount in the two types of sediment therefore matlab r2019a cftool was used to perform the polynomial surface fitting in the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment the oil concentration x1 and oscillation frequency x2 were used as independent variables to establish a polynomial surface equation with oil release amount y as the target namely y a1 a2x1 a3x2 a4x1 2 a5x1x2 a6x2 2 in which a1 a6 are fitting constants the r2 of the polynomial surface equation was 0 924 for the fresh contaminated sediment and 0 960 for the weathered contaminated sediment indicating a good fitting effect therefore by probing into the release amount equation under the influence of oil concentration and oscillation frequency the accuracy of predicting the oil release amount from contaminated sediment can increase 4 conclusion in conclusion the influence of various factors on the fresh contaminated sediment was greater than that on weathering contaminated sediment the oil release amount was positively correlated with oil concentration oscillation frequency and time while negatively correlated with salinity through pearson correlation analysis and orthogonal experiment the oil concentration in the sediment and oscillation frequency were the key influencing factors for release the oil release amount with oil concentration oscillation frequency and salinity can be fitted by the polynomial equation while lagergren pseudo second order kinetics equation was better for time the optimal combination of environmental factors for oil release was oil concentration of 10 oscillation frequency of 200 r min and salinity of 15 with oil concentration and oscillation frequency as independent variables a polynomial equation with release amount as the objective was established and r2 was 0 9 the study can provide theoretical guidance for the remediation of the intertidal zone after marine oil spills

1275,under tidal scouring residual petroleum in the intertidal sediment after oil spills could release again causing secondary pollution in the marine ecosystem the current study aimed to investigate the dynamic process and principles of crude oil release from silty intertidal sediment under different influencing factors and screened for the key factors in this paper the fitting equations and correlation between the release amount and various factors were explored through the single factor and orthogonal experiments then the key influencing factors were selected for multi factor fitting of the release amount the results showed that the oil release amount rose with the increase in oil concentration oscillation frequency and release time but decreased with an increase in salinity as the ph decreased the oil release amount increased the relationship between release amount and concentration oscillation frequency can be equipped by the polynomial equation and the average r2 was 0 95 and 0 84 respectively the release amount can be fitted by the lagergren pseudo second order kinetic equation with time with the average r2 0 89 the ph was negatively correlated with the release amount in the fresh contaminated sediment but positively correlated with the weathered one the correlation between each factor and oil release amount was ranked from large to small as oil concentration oscillation frequency salinity time and ph at last a polynomial equation can be fitted between the key influencing factors oil concentration and oscillation frequency and the release amount the results can provide a theoretical basis for predicting the secondary pollution owing to the oil re release from intertidal sediment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords crude oil silty

2013 removing oil in a short time is difficult after polluting the environmental media under wave and tide residual oil would release into seawater in large quantities causing secondary pollution and threatening the marine ecosystem large offshore spills usually recover only a fraction of the oil etkin and nedwed 2020 studies on the west falmouth oil spill have shown that a substantial amount of moderately degraded oil remains 8 20 cm below the sediment surface culbertson et al 2007 kirman et al 2016 studying factors affecting the oil release from sediment helps to explore the release mechanism in the marine system oil migration is affected by dissolution biodegradation gong et al 2014 adsorption desorption and dilution by water with the increase in temperature ph liu et al 2007 dissolved organic matter dom hydrodynamic frequency sand concentration wu 2006 and decrease in particle size wang 2010 the oil partially absorbed on sediment particles organic matter and black carbon liu et al 2010 mathialagan and viraraghavan 2008 wang et al 2011 would accelerate desorption and diffusion into overlying water however wu 2006 showed that increasing salinity and ph slowed the desorption and diffusion of oil components into overlying water in addition deng 2017 found that ph had different oil release effects on the fresh and weathered oil stained sand on the sandy beach liu 2006 demonstrated that the fluctuation degree of water flow had little influence on oil release in the river lake system the oil release amount in water is positively related to the oil concentration in sediment under the same release condition the higher the pollution intensity the higher the oil saturation concentration in water and the faster the oil release rate from sediment guo et al 2011 wu 2006 found that the oil absorption and release from the sandy beach were always conducted simultaneously when the oil concentration in water decreases oil re releases and causes pollution again although the adsorption behavior of petroleum or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs on soil sediment has been studied noort et al 2003 yu et al 2011 cao et al 2011 portet et al 2013 poot et al 2014 yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 the establishment of equations describing the release dynamics will provide a basis for further study of the release mechanism guo et al 2011 wu and gschwend 1986 and walter et al 1992 have established the thermodynamic and kinetic models for the adsorption and desorption of oil hydrophobic components in natural sediment and suspended solids the lagergren first order equation lfo was the most commonly used equation tseng et al 2010 chang 2013 guo et al 2011 showed that the oil released into the water from sediment was a typical first order kinetic process which can be described using the hysteretic film model lin et al 1997 deng 2017 also demonstrated that after the oil release from fresh and weathered oil contaminated sand reached a balance the release law of fresh oil contaminated sand complied with the lagergren pseudo second order kinetic equation means 1995 li and luo 2014 fei et al 2015 while the release law of weathered sand conformed to the lagergren pseudo first order release kinetic equation jiang et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 collected sediment from the bohai sea and simulated the static release process of heavy oil pollution in the laboratory they found that the oil release process could be fitted by lagergren s first order equation lfo and the concentration equilibrium could be reached in 48 h without hydrodynamic conditions there is a logarithmic relationship between the equilibrium concentration and the first order rate constant of the fitted curve based on the aforementioned studies studying the oil release kinetics from sediment would benefit the prediction and evaluation of the harm degree caused by oil into the overlying water and provide theoretical support for the treatment of oil release from the above the oil release rules in different sediment types differ under the same influencing factor more importantly there is a lack of research on silty intertidal sediment and the oil release kinetic equations need further verification in the paper the marine sediment in the silty intertidal zone along the zhoushan archipelago and light crude oil were selected as the research object and single factor analysis was used to study the influence of oscillation frequency time salinity and ph on the oil release from fresh and weathered oil contaminated sediment then the fitting equations between the release amount and different influencing factors were explored thirdly the pearson correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between each factor and release amount after that the critical influencing factors were selected for orthogonal experiment verification and the optimal release combination condition was determined finally a polynomial surface equation with the key influencing factors as independent variables and the oil release amount as the target was established 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials 2 1 1 crude oil the light crude oil used in the experiment was obtained from cezi island zhoushan its viscosity was measured as 980 mpa s using an ndj5s rotary viscometer shanghai changji geological instrument co ltd the first institute of oceanology ministry of natural resources was commissioned to determine the content of each component before and after volatilization by chromatography relevant results are listed in table 1 alkanes mainly included n alkanes propane and phytane pahs mainly included naphthalene phenanthrene dibenzothiophene fluorene pyridine and their derivatives the main biomarkers were sterane and hopene as shown in table 1 crude oil contained the most alkanes after one month of volatilization the content of alkanes and pahs decreased and the proportion of relative pah and biomarker content increased pan et al 2020 2 1 2 sediment the tested sediment was collected from the low tidal region of the silty intertidal zone on changzhi island zhoushan zhejiang province china after natural weathering the sediment was roughly screened using a 0 5 mm standard screen to remove large particles and other impurities the particle size of sediment was measured in the zhoushan marine ecological environment monitoring station of zhejiang province using the laser method specified in marine survey specification part 8 marine geology and geography survey gb t12763 8 2007 by microtrac laser particle size analyzer microtrac s3500 usa the results are presented in table 2 the structure scanning by scanning electron microscopy zeiss evo 18 10 kv germany in fig 1a revealed many pores distributed on the sediment surface further barrett joyner halenda bjh analysis in fig 1b showed that the pore sizes of microporous and mesoporous in the sediment were mainly 0 25 nm and for some samples pore size was larger than that close to 250 nm according to the h3 type mesoporous hysteresis ring analysis of the pore size pores on the surface of the sediment mainly included flat slit structure crack and wedge shaped structure the c value in the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area test was 335 68 200 indicating that the tested sediment had a strong adsorption capacity for oil the organic carbon content in the sediment was 1 14 which was three times that of the sand sample 0 44 the increase in organic carbon content increased the oil release amount from the sediment to reach the equilibrium concentration yuan et al 2017 the results demonstrated that the silty sediment has a strong adsorption capacity and a tremendous great slow release effect after being polluted by oil some oil continues to release into the seawater under the action of the tide causing additional long term harm to the marine environment 2 1 3 tested seawater in the experiment seawater was artificially prepared by adding artificial sea salt guangzhou yier biological engineering co ltd to distilled water artificial seawater with different ph was prepared by adding 3 mol l hcl and 2 mol l naoh solution 2 2 experimental methods to study the factors affecting the oil release from silty intertidal sediment fresh and weathered contaminated sediment were prepared to simulate the different stages of intertidal pollution after the oil spill according to the actual oil pollution in the sediment after the oil spill and the saturated oil concentration fresh and weathered sediment were prepared with crude oil mass and dry sediment according to the mass ratios of 2 4 6 8 and 10 respectively firstly the crude oil and sediment were mixed evenly according to the mass ratio then the fresh contaminated sediment samples were sealed and placed in a dark place for 24 h and the weathered contaminated samples were placed in a dark and ventilated place for 30 d a single factor batch simulation experiment method was used to simulate the oil release process under different influence factors 10 g of each contaminated sediment sample was added to a 250 ml conical flask and 150 ml of artificial seawater was added the hydrodynamic force was carried out by adjusting the oscillation frequency deng 2017 yuan et al 2020 the gas bath thermostatic oscillator th2 a shanghai jingqi instrument co ltd was adjusted to rotate at speeds of 100 120 140 160 180 and 200 r min for 2 h at a temperature of 30 c ph of 8 and salinity of 35 the oil release times were set as 10 30 60 90 120 180 240 and 300 min deng 2017 at the same time the salinity temperature ph and oscillator frequency were 35 30 c 8 and 160 r min respectively referenced with the average salinity 35 of the actual seawater and dilution after pollution the salinity values of seawater were 15 20 25 30 and 35 in which the temperature ph oscillator frequency and time were 30 c 8 160 r min 2 h respectively additionally considering the average ph 7 9 8 4 of actual seawater deng 2017 and a complex situation such as seawater pollution different ph values were set as 5 10 and the interval was 1 for the other factors in the ph experiment salinity temperature time and oscillator frequency were set at 35 30 c 2 h and 160 r min respectively each factor was set in 3 parallel experiments the experimental design parameters are listed in table 3 after the oscillation the conical flask was stood for 2 h then 20 ml of the overlying seawater was sampled to measure the oil release amount by ultraviolet spectrophotometry hj 970 2018 2018 according to the correlation analysis of the single factor batch experiment the interaction influence of the critical factors namely oil concentration oscillation frequency and salinity on the oil release from the sediment was studied the orthogonal experiment adopted 3 factors and 3 levels formulated by spss the experimental method was the same as above the temperature was set at 30 c the time was 2 h and the ph was 8 2 3 data processing method the variation trends of oil release amount with different influencing factors were drawn using matlab r2019a and origin 2018 was used to fit the equation between different influencing factors and oil release amount in addition spss ibm spss statistics 24 was used to conduct a pearson correlation analysis between each factor and oil release amount the multi factor equation was established using matlab r2019a with major factors 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of oscillation frequency on the oil release from sediment as shown in fig 2 the peak release amount of both fresh and weathered sediment appeared at a concentration of 10 and an oscillation frequency of 200 r min the maximum oil release amount from the fresh and weathered contaminated sediments was16 68 mg l and 9 98 mg l respectively therefore the higher the oil concentration in the sediment the higher the oscillation frequency and the greater the oil release amount from the sediment when the oil concentration was 2 and the oscillation frequency was 160 r min the oil release amount from the fresh contaminated sediment was 3 95 mg l which was higher than that from the weathered contaminated sediment the release amount from the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment at the other concentrations exhibited the same variation law in other words the release amount in the fresh contaminated sediment was higher than that in the weathered contaminated sediment at the same concentration and oscillation frequency this result may be because oil molecules are mainly adsorbed on sediment particles through the affinity of surface active ions in this adsorption system the lipophilic bases of the active ions are attached to oil molecules chao et al 1997 with an increase in oscillation frequency the motion energy obtained by the sediment increases and there is sufficient collision and friction between the sediment particles which makes the lipophilic bases fracture thus it is very easy to destroy the stable state of the combination between sediment particles and oil deng 2017 fig 2a showed that the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment with five different oil concentrations was significantly improved between 160 r min and 200 r min relative to other rotating speeds with the increase in oscillation frequency many sediment particles appear to be suspended the contact area between sediment particles and overlying water increases the bonds among particles are broken and turbulent diffusion begins to dominate chen et al 2019 therefore the oil release amount was improved this finding was consistent with that of deng 2017 and yuan et al 2020 namely oil desorption efficiency increased as oscillation frequency a representative parameter of hydrodynamic condition increased during the preparation of the fresh contaminated sediment the combination of crude oil and sediment was not close and the volatile components in the weathered contaminated sediment were lost to a certain extent after one month of weathering the remaining crude oil components in the weathering process were more closely combined with the sediment and there was sufficient weathering oil film to fully wrap the sediment particles deng et al 2018 thus the release amount reduced and the stability of the release amount increased in general the oil release amount increased with an increase in oscillation frequency and the increase in the amplitude of the fresh contaminated sediment was larger than that of the weathered sediment which was consistent with other studies wu 2006 deng 2017 yuan et al 2017 3 2 influence of time on the oil release from sediment as shown in fig 3a the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment at 10 min with 2 and 10 concentrations were 2 18 and 9 07 mg l respectively with an increase in the oil content in the sediment the difference in oil concentration between the solid and liquid phases increased and the release amount increased deng 2017 the oil concentration in 2 and 4 contaminated sediment was relatively low and the figure curve changed gently with the increase in release time still the oil release amount showed an overall fluctuating upward trend with an increase in time the oil release amount of 6 concentration firstly increased 10 30 min then decreased 30 60 min and then continued to increase again 60 300 min reaching a maximum of 11 06 mg l the oil concentration of 8 and 10 contaminated sediment was relatively high and the oil release amount decreased in 10 30 min the oil release amount of the 8 oil contaminated sediment fluctuated and increased which was generally higher than that at 10 min the oil release amount of 10 contaminated sediment fluctuated and increased in the condition that the oil release amount was 10 min 30 120 min and the highest oil release amount was 11 98 mg l the oil release from sediment required two processes the oil in the sediment was desorbed into the pore water first and then diffused into the overlying water xie et al 2005 the oil release amount of 2 6 contaminated sediment increased with time at the early stage which may be because oil was not fully combined with sediment particles during the sample preparation process and then released rapidly with an increase in time the oil release amount decreased temporarily which may be due to the decrease in the oil concentration difference between the solid and liquid phase and part of the oil desorbed in water was adsorbed to the sediment particles again wu 2006 zhao et al 2015 therefore the adsorption and desorption processes were simultaneous wu 2006 as the release time extended the hydrodynamically induced desorption was dominant and the oil release amount increased again yuan et al 2020 because of the high pollution concentration of 8 10 contaminated sediment oil released rapidly at the early stage the concentration difference between the solid and liquid phase decreased and oil in water was re adsorbed leading to a temporary decrease in oil release amount as time increased in general the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment at different concentrations increased with time and the oil release amount simultaneously increased with concentration as shown in fig 3b the release amount of the weathered contaminated sediment with 2 pollution concentration decreased in a fluctuating manner with an increase in time and the release amount at 300 min 2 27 mg l was lower than that at 10 min 3 16 mg l the oil release amount of sediment with 4 10 concentration decreased within 10 30 min and then increased again the oil release amount of 4 and 6 concentration reached the first small peak at 90 min and 4 15 mg l and 6 58 mg l respectively after 90 min the oil release amount increased in a fluctuating manner and the oil release amount at both concentrations at 300 min was higher than that at 10 min when petroleum hydrocarbon molecules enter microbial cells they are oxidized by oxygenase to aliphatic alcohols which are converted to aliphatic acids and acyl coenzyme a and subsequently degraded by β oxidation li and ding 2021 the oil release amount of the weathered contaminated sediment was relatively high at the early stage which may be mainly due to the increase in water soluble components caused by microbial degradation of oil ledesma and nicaud 2016 after the concentration difference between the solid and liquid phase gradually decreased some oil components were re absorbed by the sediment the higher the pollution concentration the more obvious the re adsorption effect and the less the influence of time and hydrodynamic action on oil release in general the highest oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment appeared at 10 concentration 11 98 mg l after 300 min and that of the weathered contaminated sediment appeared at 4 concentration 12 23 mg l at the same pollution concentration the oil release amount of the weathered contaminated sediment was greater than that of the fresh contaminated sediment at the early stage within 10 min at the later stage after 30 min the former was generally less than the latter except for 4 concentration which was mainly caused by microbial degradation of oil in the weathered contaminated sediment ahmad et al 2020 this was different from the result of deng 2017 that the release amount of the fresh oil contaminated sand was greater than that of the weathered contaminated sand mainly because of the different sediment types in our study silty sediment had a small particle size high organic matter content and obvious biodegradation effect thus time had a greater impact on the oil release from the fresh contaminated sediment than the weathered contaminated sediment and the release amount would increase as oil concentration and release time increased xie et al 2000 for the weathered contaminated sediment the short term release amount under different pollution concentrations or the long term release amount under moderate pollution conditions would be higher than the ones under other circumstances 3 3 influence of salinity on the oil release from sediment in fig 4 the oil release amount of the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment with five different oil concentrations formed a slope that decreased slightly from right to left in the salinity axis that is with an increase in salinity the oil release amount from the sediment gradually decreases some studies have shown that salinity affects the pollutant concentration in the aquatic system cao et al 2011 soubaneh et al 2014 this phenomenon occurs because the increase in the salinity enhances the oil adsorption strength in the sediment further reducing the solubility of oil in water this phenomenon is called the salting out effect tremblay et al 2005 you et al 2010 and turner 2003 have found that the salting out effect strengthens the adsorption of organic matter with an increase in salinity other studies have demonstrated that increasing salinity would also increase the number of oil particle aggregates opas sun et al 2014 fitzpatrick et al 2015 this is mainly due to that the increase of salinity in seawater means the increase of charged ions charged ions can compress the double electric layer and improve the close contact between oil molecules and sediment thus making some particles condense and settle deng 2017 the above phenomenon inhibits the desorption of oil chao et al 1997 chen et al 2012 and results in a slight decrease in oil release amount with increasing salinity however in the two contaminated sediment states the oil release in the fresh state was more unstable than that in the weathered state therefore the sediment state affects oil release from the sediment under the influence of salinity in general the oi release amount decreased with increasing seawater salinity similar to the other studies wu 2006 deng 2017 yuan et al 2020 3 4 influence of ph on the oil release from sediment when the ph in the seawater changes a series of acid base reactions with sediment particles or oil may be induced which will affect the oil release amount from sediment deng 2017 as shown in fig 5 the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment had higher oil solubility and more significant oil release amount in low ph and acidic environments than in other ph cases tremblay et al 2005 when the ph increased from 5 to 7 the release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment with five different concentrations decreased to varying degrees and a turning point appeared in the graph for example the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment with 2 oil concentration decreased from 1 88 to 1 65 mg l in this ph change mainly due to the simultaneous desorption and adsorption of sediment wu 2006 as the ph increased the acidity of the water sediment system decreased and the oil solubility in the water diminished therefore the oil release amount from sediment decreased with the increase in ph from 7 to 9 the alkalinity of the artificial seawater environment increased the mixture of organic compounds such as carboxylic acids esters phenols and halogenated hydrocarbons in the oil would react with the alkali deng 2017 resulting in an increase in the oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment from 1 64 to 4 00 mg l such as in 2 oil contaminated sediment the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment with other oil concentrations also showed similar characteristics of increasing oil release amount when the ph was 9 the oil release amount decreased significantly and another turning point appeared in the graph with an increase in alkalinity mg2 and al3 in seawater tends to form white flocculating constituents attached to the surface of the sediment which hinders the release of soluble oil thus the mass concentration of oil in water decreases significantly wu et al 2008 similar to the fresh contaminated sediment the weathered contaminated sediment showed two turning points still the turning point of oil release from the weathered contaminated sediment at ph 7 was not noticeable the maximum oil release amount of the fresh contaminated sediment was 12 68 mg l and that of the weathered contaminated sediment was 9 05 mg l the oil film of the weathered contaminated sediment was more tightly wrapped than that of the fresh contaminated sediment which caused the amount of opas to be larger than that in the fresh contaminated sediment and the oil release amount was smaller as shown in fig 4 when the seawater was in strong acid or weak base environment the oil release amount from the sediment was greater than in other ph li et al 1997 3 5 relationship equations between oil release amount and different influencing factors table 4 shows the determination coefficients of different fitting equations between oil release amounts and various influencing factors according to r2 lagergren s pseudo second order release dynamics equation fitted better than the polynomial equation between time and oil release amount the fitting r2 of the lagergren pseudo first order release dynamics equation was negative and had no reference significance it can be seen that with the change in oil release time the oil release law of silty intertidal sediment applied to the lagergren pseudo second order release kinetics equation and the fitting effect of the fresh contaminated sediment r2 0 9472 was better than that of the weathered contaminated sediment r2 0 8411 this result was consistent with deng 2017 and yuan et al 2017 by comparing r2 in table 4 for all the influencing factors the polynomial equation provided the best description of the oil release law r2 0 9243 from the fresh contaminated sediment with different pollution concentrations followed by oscillation frequency r2 0 8705 and salinity r2 0 8045 for oil release from the weathered contaminated sediment the fitting effect from high to low was oil concentration r2 0 9820 oscillation frequency r2 0 8026 and salinity r2 0 6942 combined with the r2 of polynomial and lagergren s pseudo second order release kinetics equation the oil release law of the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment was evident under the influence of concentration oscillation frequency time and salinity but not very obvious for ph by comparing the r2 the fitting equation of oil release amount from the fresh contaminated sediment was superior to that from the weathered contaminated sediment under the influence of time and salinity the opposite phenomenon occurred under the influence of concentration and little difference was observed between the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment under the influence of oscillation frequency this result indicated that time and salinity had a greater influence on pollutant migration in sediment under short term pollution than long term pollution fitzpatrick et al 2015 deng 2017 as the combination of various ions in oil and sediment became more stable for a long time the influence of oil concentration increased in prominence gustitus et al 2017 yuan et al 2020 3 6 correlation between oil release amount and various factors as shown in fig 6 the pearson correlation coefficients obtained by correlation analysis with spss showed that the concentration oscillation frequency and time of the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment were positively correlated with oil release amount the correlation coefficient was oil concentration oscillation frequency time there was a significant positive correlation between oil concentration and release amount in both the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment p 0 01 with pearson correlation coefficients of 0 724 and 0 709 respectively which were consistent with the results of yuan et al 2020 indicating that oil concentration was the most critical factor affecting the release amount there was an extremely significant positive correlation between the oscillation frequency of the fresh contaminated sediment and the oil release amount p 0 01 with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 543 for the weathered contaminated sediment there was a positive correlation with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 274 the release time of the fresh contaminated sediment was significantly positively correlated with the oil release amount p 0 05 and there was also a positive correlation for the weathered contaminated sediment in which the pearson correlation coefficients were 0 350 and 0 250 respectively however the salinity of the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment negatively correlated with the oil release amount in which there was an extremely significant negative correlation p 0 01 for the fresh contaminated sediment with a correlation coefficient of 0 537 and a negative correlation for the weathered contaminated sediment with a correlation coefficient of 0 233 the relationship between ph and oil release amount differed between the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment the fresh contaminated sediment showed a negative correlation and the weathered contaminated sediment showed a positive correlation and correlation coefficients were 0 068 and 0 150 respectively based on fig 6 the absolute value of the correlation coefficients in both fresh and weathered contaminated sediment ranked as oil concentration oscillation frequency salinity time ph therefore concentration in the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment was the most important influencing factor for oil release this finding occurred because with the increase in oil concentration of sediment the concentration difference of the solid liquid phase in the water sediment system increased promoting the desorption of petroleum from sediment wu 2006 deng 2017 as the second influencing factor of oil release oscillation frequency had a significant effect on the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment relative to the fresh contaminated sediment part of the oil in the weathered contaminated sediment was degraded and volatilized gu et al 2016 ahmad et al 2020 pan et al 2021 and the residual oil was stable in combination with the sediment particles therefore with the increase in oscillation frequency the oil in the weathered contaminated sediment would release slowly and the oil release amount was stable while the oil binding state with sediment particles was unstable in the fresh contaminated sediment which caused the oil release amount to fluctuate wildly and change with the oscillation frequency as subordinate factors time and salinity had a greater impact on the oil release from the fresh contaminated sediment than on the weathered contaminated sediment and ph had different effects on the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment in different manners and degree which was consistent with the variation law described in figs 3 5 3 7 effects of multi factor interaction on oil release from sediment from fig 6a the oil concentration oscillation frequency and salinity were extremely significantly correlated with the oil release amount combined with the absolute value of the pearson correlation coefficient the 3 factors were selected to carry out an orthogonal experiment as shown in table 5 range analysis was used to analyze the influence of different factors on oil release amount and find the optimal conditions in which the oil release amount was the biggest in the range analysis method wang 2021 the greater the value of r factor range the greater the impact of this factor on the oil release amount from table 5 for both fresh and weathered contaminated sediment the r value of the oil concentration was the largest followed by the oscillation frequency and the salinity was relatively small the optimal condition combination of oil release was oil concentration of 10 oscillation frequency of 200 r min and salinity of 15 the result of the orthogonal experiment was consistent with the one of correlation analysis between oil release amount and each factor as shown in table 5 for the two kinds of sediment oil concentration was the most important factor for release but the r value of different factors for the fresh contaminated sediment was greater than the weathered sediment the result showed that each factor had more effect on the fresh contaminated sediment than the weathered one one of the reasons was that after weathering part of the oil volatilized and the oil concentration in the sediment reduced compared with the fresh contaminated sediment on the other hand the oil molecules were more closely connected with the sediment particles in weathering contaminated sediment so that the oil release was less affected by various factors than the fresh contaminated sediment at the same time the r difference between oil concentration and other factors of the weathered contaminated sediment was bigger than the fresh one it may be that during the weathering process part of the oil component was degraded by microorganisms ledesma and nicaud 2016 ahmad et al 2020 the water soluble component increased and the higher the oil concentration the more obvious the oil release by contrast the other 2 factors had less impact than oil concentration based on the correlation analysis of the single factor and range analysis of the orthogonal experiment it can be seen that the two factors of oil concentration and oscillation frequency were significantly positively correlated with the oil release amount in the two types of sediment therefore matlab r2019a cftool was used to perform the polynomial surface fitting in the fresh and weathered contaminated sediment the oil concentration x1 and oscillation frequency x2 were used as independent variables to establish a polynomial surface equation with oil release amount y as the target namely y a1 a2x1 a3x2 a4x1 2 a5x1x2 a6x2 2 in which a1 a6 are fitting constants the r2 of the polynomial surface equation was 0 924 for the fresh contaminated sediment and 0 960 for the weathered contaminated sediment indicating a good fitting effect therefore by probing into the release amount equation under the influence of oil concentration and oscillation frequency the accuracy of predicting the oil release amount from contaminated sediment can increase 4 conclusion in conclusion the influence of various factors on the fresh contaminated sediment was greater than that on weathering contaminated sediment the oil release amount was positively correlated with oil concentration oscillation frequency and time while negatively correlated with salinity through pearson correlation analysis and orthogonal experiment the oil concentration in the sediment and oscillation frequency were the key influencing factors for release the oil release amount with oil concentration oscillation frequency and salinity can be fitted by the polynomial equation while lagergren pseudo second order kinetics equation was better for time the optimal combination of environmental factors for oil release was oil concentration of 10 oscillation frequency of 200 r min and salinity of 15 with oil concentration and oscillation frequency as independent variables a polynomial equation with release amount as the objective was established and r2 was 0 9 the study can provide theoretical guidance for the remediation of the intertidal zone after marine oil spills

1277,groundwater security is a pressing environmental and societal issue particularly due to significantly increasing stressors on water resources including rapid urbanization and climate change groundwater arsenic is a major water security and public health challenge impacting millions of people in the gangetic basin of india and elsewhere globally in the rapidly developing city of patna bihar in northern india we have studied the evolution of groundwater chemistry under the city following a three dimensional sampling framework of multi depth wells spanning the central urban zone in close proximity to the river ganges ganga and transition into peri urban and rural areas outside city boundaries and further away from the river using inorganic geochemical tracers including arsenic iron manganese nitrate nitrite ammonium sulfate sulfide and others and residence time indicators cfcs and sf6 we have evaluated the dominant hydrogeochemical processes occurring and spatial patterns in redox conditions across the study area the distribution of arsenic and other redox sensitive parameters is spatially heterogenous and elevated arsenic in some locations is consistent with arsenic mobilization via reductive dissolution of iron hydroxides residence time indicators evidence modern 60 70 years groundwater and suggest important vertical and lateral flow controls across the study area including an apparent seasonal reversal in flow regimes near the urban center an overall arsenic accumulation rate is estimated to be 0 003 0 003 μm yr 1 equivalent to 0 3 0 2 μg yr 1 based on an average of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 derived models with the highest rates of arsenic accumulation observed in shallow near river groundwaters also exhibiting elevated concentrations of nutrients including ammonium our findings have implications on groundwater management in patna and other rapidly developing cities including potential future increased groundwater vulnerability associated with

concentrations via dilution or flushing if the timescale of transport is more rapid than arsenic mobilization and accumulation conversely increased abstraction and hence increased surface derived

study was focussed around patna the capital city of the state of bihar india in the middle gangetic plain patna is a rapidly developing smart city with a dense urban population government of india 2011 saha et al 2014 heavily centered within relatively close proximity within 5 km to the river ganga intensive groundwater pumping in urban areas of patna has drastically increased with rapid urbanization and associated water demand saha et al 2014 the climate is sub tropical to sub humid with an annual monsoon season from around june to september groundwater sampling sites richards et al 2020 richards et al 2021 were systematically selected to target the transition from dominantly urban zones to peri urban and rural areas with increasing distance from the river ganga running in transects broadly parallel to inferred dominant groundwater flowpaths fig 1 the overall average density of sampling sites was approximately one site per 10 km2 a density which was higher in the urban center and near the river ganga in a sampling area of 480 km2 a sampling density which is much higher than typically used for groundwater monitoring in the area central ground water board 2013 in general the dominant groundwater flow direction is oriented towards the river ganga contributing to its baseflow central ground water board 2015 however a monsoonal reversal in groundwater flow direction can occur if the river stage is higher than the hydraulic heads of adjacent aquifers shamsudduha et al 2011 das et al 2021 lu et al 2022 two major quaternary aquifers are present in patna within the top 300 m separated by a clay sandy clay layer of variable thickness 15 30 m saha 2009 saha et al 2011 saha et al 2014 central ground water board 2015 typical groundwater level depth in the study area is 5 10 m below ground surface central ground water board 2015 further information on hydrogeological setting and hydrological conditions in selected areas of the wider patna district is provided in reports by other authors saha et al 2014 central ground water board 2015 noting that detailed or high resolution information on the hydrogeological substructure under patna including for the particular sampling sites is not available 2 2 water sample collection groundwater was sampled during two sampling seasons i pre monsoon in june july 2019 n 44 samples and ii post monsoon in november december 2019 n 44 groundwater was collected from existing private or public wells predominantly used for drinking from multiple sampling depths ranging from 6 120 m using handpumps or submersible pumps richards et al 2020 screening lengths were not always known and were reported to vary depending on installation and intended purpose based on hydrogeological characterization reported elsewhere in the patna district central ground water board 2015 and locally reported information we expect that two aquifers are likely found within this depth range site sample ids are coded as xxx yy pre where xxx is a site code and yy is well depth in m pre or post indicates pre and post monsoon respectively subsamples for major and trace inorganic analyses were filtered 0 45 μm

groundwater residence time indicators 3 results and discussion 3 1 dominant groundwater geochemical conditions the major element groundwater chemistry in patna is dominated by in order of decreasing median concentrations bicarbonate calcium sodium magnesium silicon chloride nitrate potassium and sulfate fig s2 calcium magnesium and sodium contribute a maximum of 77 48 and 37 of the bulk cationic charge the bulk anionic charge is strongly dominated by bicarbonate contributing a maximum of 100 of the bulk anionic charge followed by chloride and sulfate with maximum contributions 36 and 25 respectively the groundwater is mostly a calcium magnesium carbonate type fig s3 with samples with relatively high e g 1000 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds trending towards a calcium magnesium sulfate type near the ganga river and a sodium carbonate type at greater distance from the river and urban center most groundwaters are of circum neutral ph range 5 9 7 7 median 7 2 spanning a wide range of redox potential eh range 30 430 mv median 240 mv electrical conductivity ec range 120 2200 μs cm 1 median 240 μs cm 1 and temperature range 22 31 c median 26 c the patna groundwater chemistry is similar to previously characterized across bihar richards et al 2020 and broadly typical of other arsenic bearing groundwaters in south and southeast asia berg et al 2001 mcarthur et al 2001 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 polizzotto et al 2008 buschmann and berg 2009 lawson et al 2013 richards et al 2017 pincetti zúñiga et al 2020 summary statistics and sample specific selected compositions are in supplementary information tables s3 s4 3 2 concentrations of arsenic and other health relevant elements in groundwater dissolved arsenic concentrations in the studied groundwater range from below detection to 0 88 μm 1 70 μg l 1 with 2 of samples exceeding the world health organization who provisional guideline value for drinking water of 0 13 μm 10 μg l 1 world health organization 2011 and 55 of samples exceeding 0 013 μm 1 μg l 1 fig s4 other exceedances are described in supplementary information 3 3 arsenic and related inorganic hydrogeochemical parameters 3 3 1 relationship between arsenic and inorganic hydrogeochemical parameters arsenic is positively correlated with iron fig 2a t 86 4 8 p 0 01 and manganese fig 2b t 86 3 8 p 0 01 in patna consistent with arsenic mobilization via reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxides nickson et al 2000 islam et al 2004 lawson et al 2013 yadav et al 2015 richards et al 2017 richards et al 2020 a broadly inverse relationship between arsenic and sulfate fig 2c t 85 1 0 p 0 32 noting a linear relationship is not statistically significant at the 0 05 level shows that elevated arsenic usually corresponds to low sulfate and indicates that high sulfate waters are not consistently favorable to support arsenic reduction and mobilization redox conditions are variable noting the presence of sulfide suggests sulfate reduction even if the relationship between sulfide and arsenic is not statistically significant fig 2d t 42 0 7 p 0 48 further arsenic concentrations are not significantly correlated with nitrate fig 2e t 42 0 8 p 0 44 nor nitrite fig 2f t 42 0 7 p 0 52 concentrations although they are strongly and positively correlated with ammonium fig 2g t 42 4 7 p 0 01 which is stable typically under strongly reducing conditions the presence of ammonium suggests that nitrate and nitrite have started to be reduced and that conditions are sufficiently reducing to support arsenic release ammonium inputs may also be river or surface derived pyrite oxidation is not expected to be the dominant arsenic mobilization mechanism given that elevated arsenic occurs in low sulfate waters iron and sulfate are not positively correlated t 43 1 4 p 0 15 and that the iron sulfate molar ratios are usually much less than 0 5 mcarthur et al 2001 3 3 2 spatial distribution of arsenic and related hydrogeochemical parameters the relationship between depth below land surface and arsenic concentration and other associated parameters shows that relatively shallow groundwater 15 to 20 m in depth is typically characterized by the highest observed concentrations of arsenic sulfate sulfide nitrate nitrite and ammonium fig s5 noting the log scale a similar depth profile of arsenic concentrations has been observed previously in bangladesh harvey et al 2002 and elsewhere erban et al 2013 elevated arsenic iron and sulfate tends to occur mostly in relatively shallow groundwaters noting the overall relationship between depth with arsenic iron and sulfate is not statistically significantly at the 0 05 level p 0 36 p 0 37 and p 0 08 respectively when combined across seasons notably a strong and significant inverse relationship between sulfate and depth is observed exclusively in the post monsoon season dataset t 42 2 1 p 0 05 indicating rapid ingress of oxic recharge during the monsoon this input might be masked by confounding factors e g mixing intensive pumping if the entire annual dataset is considered the highest concentrations of sulfide occur at a similar depth as the peak in sulfate concentrations 15 m in situ measurements of nitrogen species reflect a strong vertical control on the distribution of surface derived constituents significant inverse correlations with depth for both nitrate t 42 2 9 p 0 01 fig s5e and nitrite t 42 2 9 p 0 05 fig s5f are observed as well as broadly for ammonium although not statistically significant at the 0 05 level t 42 1 7 p 0 10 fig s5g interestingly post monsoon nitrate and nitrite both reach peak values at the shallow depth of 15 m which is slightly shallower in comparison to the ammonium peak 20 m suggesting the development of a depth controlled redox front likely impacted by monsoonal ingress and which plausibly might be exacerbated by intensive pumping in urban areas the ammonium concentration peak at a depth of 20 m is located around the same depth where peak arsenic and elevated iron occur a similar spatial correlation was previously noted in bangladesh harvey et al 2002 the co occurrence of maximum arsenic and ammonium is notable as ammonium has been postulated as an electron donor to induce arsenic mobilization from the reduction of iron oxide minerals in the hetao basin in china xiu et al 2020 noting however that there are also groundwaters present in patna which contain relatively high ammonium but low arsenic geochemical conditions in groundwater under patna are characterized by substantial spatial heterogeneity laterally as well as vertically fig 3 the highest arsenic concentrations are detected in very shallow groundwaters in close proximity to the river ganga in the pre monsoon season a front of higher arsenic groundwater appears to develop at greater depths near the urban center of patna within 5 km of the river ganga and at intermediate depths in the expanding urban peri urban area within 5 15 km of the river ganga fig 3a these patterns are broadly mirrored by observed fe distributions fig 3c d interestingly the distributions of eh fig 3e f and sulfate concentrations fig 3g h strongly suggest the ingress of oxic groundwater recharge both from the surface across the field area and in areas in close proximity within 1 km of the river ganga in the dry pre monsoon season the most oxidized groundwaters are found at depths 60 m under urban areas suggesting that urban groundwater abstraction is drawing down oxic groundwater at a faster rate than would occur naturally under areas less impacted by pumping e g in peri urban and rural areas 15 km from the river fig 3e g the greater depth of the unsaturated zone during this period due to drawdown may also facilitate oxic conditions at this time in the post monsoon season rapid surface derived ingress likely occurs across the field area refreshing an input of oxic groundwater recharge and contributing to water table rebound in this case the impact of urban pumping becomes masked and more oxidizing groundwaters are observed throughout the depth profile in urban areas whilst at greater distance from highly urbanized areas they only appear near the surface fig 3f h higher eh and sulfate are both observed across the field area in the post monsoon season see section 3 5 on seasonal changes importantly however the observed trends are very spatially heterogeneous whilst the highest concentrations of arsenic occur at shallow depths and near the river ganga for example not all shallow groundwaters near the ganga exhibit high arsenic concentrations the lateral variation of various hydrogeochemical parameters reveals spatial bands of broadly similarly characterized groundwater throughout the study area fig s6 this helps to explain some of the variability which is not fully explained by depth or perpendicular distance from the river or urban center these bands mostly oriented in a similar direction in increasing distance from the river are indicative of zones where redox conditions are systematically shifting some parameters like nitrate nitrite and ammonium have clear areas of elevated concentrations very near the river and in shallow depths as shown on fig s5 which then decrease with increasing distance before increasing again in the south east part of the field area other parameters like arsenic and iron also exhibit a near river city elevated band before decreasing beyond the outskirts of the city these patterns and consistency between them suggest that lateral flow controls are also very important across the study area as many of the patterns seem to span the entire distance along the river covered in the field area this seems to suggest that at least some of the observed trends are attributed to river groundwater interactions this is consistent with the relatively high hydraulic conductivities 150 m day 1 reported near the river ganga in the upper aquifer 30 130 m depth near patna central ground water board 2015 systematic patterns e g zones of developing redox fronts specifically surrounding the urban center of patna like as observed beneath hat yai thailand lawrence et al 2000 are less clear which is likely due to the confounding variables including diffuse sources and the wide distribution of municipal pumping wells central ground water board 2015 influences from the river as compared to the urban center are not necessarily mutually exclusive as urban pumping may increase the extent of river groundwater interactions lu et al 2022 detailed geochemical modelling of the evolution of redox zones under patna is the subject of ongoing investigation by co authors 3 4 residence time indicators cfc and sf6 groundwater signatures apparent ages based on cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 signatures indicate that most groundwater in the study area is modern less than 60 70 years and mostly within the age range of 40 70 years fig 4 independent age indicators are generally consistent with cfc 11 ages being well correlated with cfc 12 ages t 43 7 4 p 0 01 and sf6 ages t 28 2 3 p 0 05 when over modern and below detection values are excluded the presence of modern groundwater is also qualitatively consistent with emerging organic contaminants in the study area richards et al 2021 the distributions of pre monsoon groundwater ages are statistically similar to post monsoon groundwater ages noting although the youngest ages are observed post monsoon which is consistent with monsoonal ingress of young recharge two groups appear to be following contrasting systematic patterns fig 4b d as groundwater evolves from relatively young to relatively old along separate flowpaths as there is some evidence of slight excess in cfc 12 plausibly deriving from air conditioning units and refrigerators in the area much of the detailed interpretation will focus on cfc 11 rather than cfc 12 data no statistically significant relationship is observed between concentrations of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 with eh nor fe fig s7 suggesting that potential degradation of cfcs particularly cfc 11 under reducing conditions hinsby et al 2007 sebol et al 2007 lapworth et al 2018a 2018b is not the dominant control on cfc 11 concentrations observed this is consistent with the relatively low groundwater doc concentrations observed usually 2 mg l 1 observed table s3 suggesting that the reducing conditions are likely not dominantly attributed to organic carbon degradation which would likely co metabolize with cfc 11 noting however that this does not preclude that organic degradation may still be an important process in some cases although the groundwater throughout the study area is consistently modern there is no apparent overall systematic relationship between groundwater age and depth fig s8 in the pre monsoon season there is a broadly inverse relationship between depth and cfc 11 age with the youngest pre monsoon waters found at relatively deep depths 90 110 m depth although the overall relationship is not statistically significant at the 0 05 level t 11 1 5 p 0 16 over modern and below detection values excluded this could possibly be explained by upwelling of younger water in some locations in the hyporheic zone klump et al 2006 hester et al 2013 krause et al 2013 gomez velez and krause 2014 arising from a zone of relatively deep hyporheic water with high hydraulic connectivity with the river more apparent in the drier pre monsoon season in contrast and interestingly in the post monsoon season depth and age switch to a positive correlation which is statistically significant for sf6 based ages t 26 2 3 p 0 05 although not cfc 11 based ages t 30 0 85 p 0 40 fig s8 this suggests a monsoonal reversal in groundwater flow direction consistent with modelled lateral flow path predictions based on particle tracking lu et al 2022 the observation that shallow groundwater is typically younger than deeper groundwater in the post monsoon season is consistent with monsoonal ingress of surface derived recharge the lack of overall age depth relationship observed is likely due to a number of confounding factors including these seasonally dependent flow patterns impacting groundwater surface water exchange perturbations due to pumping subsurface heterogeneity and other factors such as leaky well construction and likely variation in well screening length between sampling wells these factors are difficult to isolate given the co variances and complexity of the groundwater system studied however regardless of the numerous factors potentially contributing to the controls on these processes the presence of modern age indicators at depths 100 m strongly suggests that groundwater at all depths may be vulnerable to the influence of modern recharge at some locations these findings are consistent with those within a comparable setting in varanasi lapworth et al 2018a cfc 11 and sf6 signatures are compared to simple theoretical mixing models to disentangle apparent dominant hydrogeochemical controls across the study area fig s9 in brief the highest proportion of samples are consistent with a piston flow model pfm 47 of samples suggesting the dominance of young recharge from a consistent source and location the observation that cfc 11 and sf6 data does not consistently fall below the piston flow line further indicates that potential degradation of cfcs is not the dominant control on cfc 11 concentrations other groundwater samples are consistent with a binary mixing model bmm or an exponential mixing model emm see supplementary information patterns in the spatial distribution of cfc 11 fig 5 are consistent with those observed for other geochemical parameters fig 3 fig s6 at locations farthest from both the river ganga and urban center 20 km away from river younger groundwater is found at shallower depths this is as expected and consistent with a dominant vertical flow control and the main source of recharge being monsoonal surface derived ingress from precipitation and or flooded areas in these locations far from the river perturbations both due to urban pumping and direct river groundwater interactions are expected to be minimal and thus the conditions are controlled mostly by natural factors such as the subsurface lithological structure the downwards trend in groundwater age is also observed very near the river in the post monsoon season peach box fig 5b consistent with vertical recharge from the surface and or river groundwater interactions at shallow depths importantly however some reversals in these patterns were also observed in urban areas in the post monsoon season green box fig 5b an opposite trend occurs here the youngest groundwaters are seen in the deepest samples this could perhaps be explained by upwelling of younger groundwaters from deeper depths possibly associated with high permeability zones from old river channel paths or by the combination of monsoonal ingress and urban pumping which draws in a higher proportion of well oxygenated recharge that would occur simply by pumping alone this also may be reflected in the pre monsoon sites very near the river peach box fig 5a if there is a time delay between observation and flow reversal due to the transport times the pre monsoon groundwater in the urban area is likely a mixture of these impacts with the youngest groundwaters at middle depths these samples are plausibly impacted by a combination of monsoonal recharge river surface water interactions and urban pumping the majority of samples in the post monsoon season are consistent with a piston flow mechanism suggesting point sources of young recharge which control the distribution of groundwater ages these seasonal shifts in direction of flow regimes likely reflect the combined influence of multiple factors likely both geogenic e g monsoonal ingress river groundwater interactions changing hydraulic gradients and anthropogenic e g pumping induced perturbations surface inputs of organic carbon which control the groundwater chemistry in and around patna 3 5 seasonal variation in groundwater composition direct seasonal comparisons of identically paired pre and post monsoon groundwater samples is shown in fig s10 generally there is strong seasonal agreement with the major element composition although there are some parameters e g sulfate and chloride which are substantially different in a limited number of shallow samples indicative of localized point inputs fig s10d h seasonal differences are systematically apparent and statistically significant for physico chemical parameters ph and eh showing lower ph and higher eh in the post monsoon season fig s10f g consistent with rapid monsoonal ingress of oxic recharge across the field area more details are provided in supplementary information 3 6 implications on controls on arsenic mobilization and groundwater vulnerability arsenic concentrations are compared to apparent cfc 11 years fig 6a with maximum concentrations of arsenic substantially increasing in older groundwater t 4 1 8 p 0 14 below detection cfc 11 excluded the envelope relationship suggests that although the maximum concentrations are associated with age other geochemical processes e g adsorption desorption goldberg et al 2007 lalonde et al 2012 richards et al 2019a co precipitation johnson et al 2015 and or physical processes e g flushing plausibly contribute to the range observed the overall relationship between arsenic concentrations and cfc 11 ages allows for a rough estimation of an overall arsenic accumulation rate in patna of 0 002 0 003 μm yr 1 0 2 0 2 μg l 1 yr 1 if apparent cfc 12 ages are used to estimate an overall arsenic accumulation rate rather than cfc 11 ages a stronger and statistically significant relationship is observed in the dataset 0 005 0 003 μm yr 1 t 49 2 1 p 0 05 arsenic accumulation rates based on sf6 ages 0 002 0 002 μm yr 1 or 0 2 0 2 μg l 1 yr 1 t 33 1 0 p 0 3 are very similar to the cfc 11 based estimation the average overall accumulation rate based on a combined average of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 based estimations is 0 003 0 003 μm yr 1 0 3 0 2 μg l 1 yr 1 the maximum observed rates based on each residence time indicator are very consistent across tracers and are 0 014 μm yr 1 0 013 μm yr 1 and 0 015 μm yr 1 for cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 respectively with an average maximum rate across the age models being 0 014 μm yr 1 1 μg l 1 yr 1 the arsenic accumulation rates do not strongly depend on season as the distributions of pre and post monsoon rates are not significantly different the maximum arsenic accumulation rate in groundwater of 0 014 μm yr 1 and other elevated rates are clearly observed at relatively shallow depths 20 m and at locations in near proximity to the river ganga 1 km fig 6b c particularly in urban areas in the eastern part of patna fig s6l a broad decrease in accumulation rates is observed with regard to both increasing depth and distance from the river ganga in envelope type relationships importantly however these relationships are heterogeneous and an overall dependence of accumulation rate on both depth t 43 0 65 p 0 52 and distance from river ganga t 43 1 3 p 0 21 is not statistically significant nevertheless the observation of elevated arsenic accumulation at some shallow depths in close proximity to the river ganga suggests there are particular zones which provide an important control on arsenic mobilization processes the presence of near river fast track zones in some locations would facilitate high groundwater surface water connectivity leading to the ingress of young oxic recharge particularly to relatively shallow groundwater the observation that the site of highest arsenic and arsenic accumulation is also characterized by highest ammonium concentrations and elevated iron fig 2 fig s5 suggests that nutrient bearing sewage may ingress into groundwaters in this area possibly via groundwater river connectivity which in turn could induce iron reduction and arsenic release if ammonium is used as a potential electron donor xiu et al 2020 this has important implications for groundwater management including siting of pumping locations particularly as urban abstraction in relatively vulnerable locations may exacerbate surface groundwater interactions leading to geochemical conditions which are more favorable for arsenic release and hence future accumulation in groundwater the overall estimated arsenic accumulation rate in patna of 0 003 0 003 μm yr 1 is more than an order of magnitude lower than similarly estimated rates in cambodia 0 08 0 03 μm yr 1 richards et al 2019c and two orders of magnitude lower than suggested in bangladesh estimates between 0 28 0 05 and 0 31 0 08 μm yr 1 radloff et al 2007 and 0 26 0 03 and 0 32 0 04 μm yr 1 stute et al 2007 even the maximum value 0 014 μm yr 1 observed in patna are lower than these rates reported elsewhere the much lower arsenic accumulation rates observed in patna as compared to other arsenic impacted areas in the circum himalayan region raises a number of interesting questions regarding these differences and wider implications including on future groundwater vulnerability a systematic investigation of the nature of organic matter in the study area and its potential role or otherwise as an electron donor in arsenic mobilization including in comparison to trends observed in arsenic impacted bengali kulkarni et al 2017 vega et al 2017 kulkarni et al 2018 or cambodian richards et al 2019b aquifers is currently being undertaken by co authors further a reactive transport model is under development to better understand the changing redox conditions hydrological controls and groundwater surface water dynamics in relation to groundwater arsenic release interpreting the potential geochemical interactions between recently characterized surface water in the ganga river basin richards et al 2022 and groundwater in patna is an important next step including to inform future predictions of groundwater vulnerability especially given insight provided by other investigations demonstrating the importance of the riverbed aquifer interface as a hotspot for biogeochemical interactions influencing arsenic mobilization in high abstraction zones of the red river basin in vietnam wallis et al 2020 a simplified conceptual schematic illustrates some of the key geochemical conditions and interactions which appear to be occurring in the groundwater under patna fig 7 in areas away from the river and patna urban center the dominant flow control is vertical and the main source of recharge is monsoonal surface derived ingress flow regimes and chemical groundwater signatures become more complex near the central urban areas likely attributed to the combined influence of extensive urban pumping and river groundwater interactions this leads to a spatially dependent redox front where patterns in the behaviour of redox sensitive parameters e g sulfate nitrate nitrite ammonium are observed the river is likely contributing nutrients to the groundwater especially during periods of flow reversal during or after the monsoon however regardless of season the highest arsenic concentrations and arsenic accumulation rates are observed in shallow samples very near the river and are also associated with elevated iron and ammonium zones of relatively high extents of surface groundwater interactions are the most vulnerable and are likely to be the most sensitive of pumping related vertical drawdown as well as lateral connectivity there are likely multiple processes occurring particularly under the urban center where pumping regimes and proximity to the river ganga lead to more complex hydrochemical conditions 4 conclusions here we have studied the spatial distribution and evolution of inorganic groundwater chemistry under the rapidly developing city of patna india using a suite of inorganic hydrochemical parameters and residence time indicators the groundwater is mostly a ca mg hco3 type and concentrations of dissolved arsenic are highly heterogeneous ranging from below detection to 0 88 μm 70 μg l 1 arsenic is positively associated with iron manganese and ammonium and broadly inversely correlated with nitrate and nitrite consistent with arsenic mobilization via the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing iron hydroxide minerals arsenic and other redox sensitive species are depth dependent and reveal systematic spatial patterns cfcs and sf6 evidence modern groundwater 60 70 years throughout the depth profile although there is no apparent overall relationship between groundwater age and depth there is evidence of both vertical and lateral flow controls across the study area with the dominant flow control being vertical particularly at distances relatively far from the river although seasonal changes in major element groundwater geochemistry are generally not significant an observed decrease in ph and increase in eh in the post monsoon season are consistent with an overall monsoonal flushing and dilution impact from monsoonal recharge across the study area seasonal patterns in residence time indicators suggest that there is a seasonally inversion of flow patterns particularly near the urban center and the river ganga apparent groundwater ages are used to derive an overall estimated arsenic accumulation rate in patna of 0 003 0 003 μm yr 1 0 3 0 2 μg l 1 yr 1 based on an average of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 derived models a rate which is an order of magnitude lower than previously estimated in cambodia richards et al 2019c and two orders of magnitude lower than previously estimated in bangladesh radloff et al 2007 stute et al 2007 arsenic accumulation rates are highest maximum 0 014 μm yr 1 or 1 μg l 1 yr 1 in shallow groundwaters located near the river ganga suggesting these groundwaters are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of nutrient bearing ingress which may induce arsenic mobilization in particular locations this has important implications on water management e g on siting of large scale groundwater pumping infrastructure and on long term groundwater vulnerability in patna and other similar rapidly developing cities in the

1277,groundwater security is a pressing environmental and societal issue particularly due to significantly increasing stressors on water resources including rapid urbanization and climate change groundwater arsenic is a major water security and public health challenge impacting millions of people in the gangetic basin of india and elsewhere globally in the rapidly developing city of patna bihar in northern india we have studied the evolution of groundwater chemistry under the city following a three dimensional sampling framework of multi depth wells spanning the central urban zone in close proximity to the river ganges ganga and transition into peri urban and rural areas outside city boundaries and further away from the river using inorganic geochemical tracers including arsenic iron manganese nitrate nitrite ammonium sulfate sulfide and others and residence time indicators cfcs and sf6 we have evaluated the dominant hydrogeochemical processes occurring and spatial patterns in redox conditions across the study area the distribution of arsenic and other redox sensitive parameters is spatially heterogenous and elevated arsenic in some locations is consistent with arsenic mobilization via reductive dissolution of iron hydroxides residence time indicators evidence modern 60 70 years groundwater and suggest important vertical and lateral flow controls across the study area including an apparent seasonal reversal in flow regimes near the urban center an overall arsenic accumulation rate is estimated to be 0 003 0 003 μm yr 1 equivalent to 0 3 0 2 μg yr 1 based on an average of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 derived models with the highest rates of arsenic accumulation observed in shallow near river groundwaters also exhibiting elevated concentrations of nutrients including ammonium our findings have implications on groundwater management in patna and other rapidly developing cities including potential future increased groundwater vulnerability associated with

concentrations via dilution or flushing if the timescale of transport is more rapid than arsenic mobilization and accumulation conversely increased abstraction and hence increased surface derived ingress could stimulate higher rates of arsenic mobilization if arsenic mobilization is occurring at a faster rate than recharge van geen et al 2008 radloff et al 2017 anthropogenic residence time

particularly important in the context of rapidly developing urban areas such as patna where population densities and groundwater demand is generally highest this study aims to elucidate the hydrogeochemical processes impacting arsenic mobilization in patna india as an exemplar rapidly developing city in the circum himalayan region using a complementary suite of geochemical tracers e g major and trace inorganic tracers and residence time indicators our objectives are to i develop profiles of the evolution of groundwater geochemistry along inferred groundwater flowpaths following an urban to rural transition ii determine associations and or spatial co variance between arsenic and other redox sensitive inorganics e g iron manganese nitrate nitrite ammonium sulfate sulfide and residence time indicators to identify key transport and transformation processes iii estimate the extent of seasonal monsoonal influence on key redox zones and hydrogeochemical conditions including apparent flow regimes and iv estimate arsenic accumulation rates in patna including in comparison to other shallow circum himalayan groundwaters 2 methods 2 1 study area the field research of this study was focussed around patna the capital city of the state of bihar india in the middle gangetic plain patna is a rapidly developing smart city with a dense urban population government of india 2011 saha et al 2014 heavily centered within relatively close proximity within 5 km to the river ganga intensive groundwater pumping in urban areas of patna has drastically increased with rapid urbanization and associated water demand saha et al 2014 the climate is sub tropical to sub humid with an annual monsoon season from around june to september groundwater sampling sites richards et al 2020 richards et al 2021 were systematically selected to target the transition from dominantly urban zones to peri urban and rural areas with increasing distance from the river ganga running in transects broadly parallel to inferred dominant groundwater flowpaths fig 1 the overall average density of sampling sites was approximately one site per 10 km2 a density which was higher in the urban center and near the river ganga in a sampling area of 480 km2 a sampling density which is much higher than typically used for groundwater monitoring in the area central ground water board 2013 in general the dominant groundwater flow direction is oriented towards the river ganga contributing to its baseflow central ground water board 2015 however a monsoonal reversal in groundwater flow direction can occur if the river stage is higher than the hydraulic heads of adjacent aquifers shamsudduha et al 2011 das et al 2021 lu et al 2022 two major quaternary aquifers are present in patna within the top 300 m separated by a clay sandy clay layer of variable thickness 15 30 m saha 2009 saha et al 2011 saha et al 2014 central ground water board 2015 typical groundwater level depth in the study area is 5 10 m below ground surface central ground water board 2015 further information on hydrogeological setting and hydrological conditions in selected areas of the wider patna district is provided in reports by other authors saha et al 2014 central ground water board 2015 noting that detailed or high resolution information on the hydrogeological substructure under patna including for the particular sampling sites is not available 2 2 water sample collection groundwater was sampled during two sampling seasons i pre monsoon in june july 2019 n 44 samples and ii post monsoon in november december 2019 n 44 groundwater was collected from existing private or public wells predominantly used for drinking from multiple sampling depths ranging from 6 120 m using handpumps or submersible pumps richards et al 2020 screening lengths were not always known and were reported to vary depending on installation and intended purpose based on hydrogeological characterization reported elsewhere in the patna district central ground water board 2015 and locally reported information we expect that two aquifers are likely found within this depth range site sample ids are coded as xxx yy pre where xxx is a site code and yy is well depth in m pre or post indicates pre and post monsoon respectively subsamples for major and trace inorganic analyses were filtered 0 45 μm cellulose and polypropylene syringe filters minisart rc uk in the field directly into 60 ml amber glass bottles acid washed and furnaced due to transport restrictions on nitric acid samples for major and trace elemental analysis excluding subset for anion analyses were acidified upon arrival at the manchester analytical geochemical unit magu laboratories at the university of manchester subsamples for cfcs and sf6 analyses were collected in 60 and 500 ml glass bottles respectively using motorbike innertubes and the usgs single bottle diffusion barrier method to avoid atmospheric contact plummer

assurance quality control software packages and data analysis including estimation of arsenic accumulation rates based on measured concentrations of groundwater arsenic and apparent ages derived from groundwater residence time indicators 3 results and discussion 3 1 dominant groundwater geochemical conditions the major element groundwater chemistry in patna is dominated by in order of decreasing median concentrations bicarbonate calcium sodium magnesium silicon chloride nitrate potassium and sulfate fig s2 calcium magnesium and sodium contribute a maximum of 77 48 and 37 of the bulk cationic charge the bulk anionic charge is strongly dominated by bicarbonate contributing a maximum of 100 of the bulk anionic charge followed by chloride and sulfate with maximum contributions 36 and 25 respectively the groundwater is mostly a calcium magnesium carbonate type fig s3 with samples with relatively high e g 1000 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds trending towards a calcium magnesium sulfate type near the ganga river and a sodium carbonate type at greater distance from the river and urban center most groundwaters are of circum neutral ph range 5 9 7 7 median 7 2 spanning a wide range of redox potential eh range 30 430 mv median 240 mv electrical conductivity ec range 120 2200 μs cm 1 median 240 μs cm 1 and temperature range 22 31 c median 26 c the patna groundwater chemistry is similar to previously characterized across bihar richards et al 2020 and broadly typical of other arsenic bearing groundwaters in south and southeast asia berg et al 2001 mcarthur et al 2001 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 polizzotto et al 2008 buschmann and berg 2009 lawson et al 2013 richards et al 2017 pincetti zúñiga et al 2020 summary statistics and sample specific selected compositions are in supplementary information tables s3 s4 3 2 concentrations of arsenic and other health relevant elements in groundwater dissolved arsenic concentrations in the studied groundwater range from below detection to 0 88 μm 1 70 μg l 1 with 2 of samples exceeding the world health organization who provisional guideline value for drinking water of 0 13 μm 10 μg l 1 world health organization 2011 and 55 of samples exceeding 0 013 μm 1 μg l 1 fig s4 other exceedances are described in supplementary information 3 3 arsenic and related inorganic hydrogeochemical parameters 3 3 1 relationship between arsenic and inorganic hydrogeochemical parameters arsenic is positively correlated with iron fig 2a t 86 4 8 p 0 01 and manganese fig 2b t 86 3 8 p 0 01 in patna consistent with arsenic mobilization via reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxides nickson et al 2000 islam et al 2004 lawson et al 2013 yadav et al 2015 richards et al 2017 richards et al 2020 a broadly inverse relationship between arsenic and sulfate fig 2c t 85 1 0 p 0 32 noting a linear relationship is not statistically significant at the 0 05 level shows that elevated arsenic usually corresponds to low sulfate and indicates that high sulfate waters are not consistently favorable to support arsenic reduction and mobilization redox conditions are variable noting the presence of sulfide suggests sulfate reduction even if the relationship between sulfide and arsenic is not statistically significant fig 2d t 42 0 7 p 0 48 further arsenic concentrations are not significantly correlated with nitrate fig 2e t 42 0 8 p 0 44 nor nitrite fig 2f t 42 0 7 p 0 52 concentrations although they are strongly and positively correlated with ammonium fig 2g t 42 4 7 p 0 01 which is stable typically under strongly reducing conditions the presence of ammonium suggests that nitrate and nitrite have started to be reduced and that conditions are sufficiently reducing to support arsenic release ammonium inputs may also be river or surface derived pyrite oxidation is not expected to be the dominant arsenic mobilization mechanism given that elevated arsenic occurs in low sulfate waters iron and sulfate are not positively correlated t 43 1 4 p 0 15 and that the iron sulfate molar ratios are usually much less than 0 5 mcarthur et al 2001 3 3 2 spatial distribution of arsenic and related hydrogeochemical parameters the relationship between depth below land surface and arsenic concentration and other associated parameters shows that relatively shallow groundwater 15 to 20 m in depth is typically characterized by the highest observed concentrations of arsenic sulfate sulfide nitrate nitrite and ammonium fig s5 noting the log scale a similar depth profile of arsenic concentrations has been observed previously in bangladesh harvey et al 2002 and elsewhere erban et al 2013 elevated arsenic iron and sulfate tends to occur mostly in relatively shallow groundwaters noting the overall relationship between depth with arsenic iron and sulfate is not statistically significantly at the 0 05 level p 0 36 p 0 37 and p 0 08 respectively when combined across seasons notably a strong and significant inverse relationship between sulfate and depth is observed exclusively in the post monsoon season dataset t 42 2 1 p 0 05 indicating rapid ingress of oxic recharge during the monsoon this input might be masked by confounding factors e g mixing intensive pumping if the entire annual dataset is considered the highest concentrations of sulfide occur at a similar depth as the peak in sulfate concentrations 15 m in situ measurements of nitrogen species reflect a strong vertical control on the distribution of surface derived constituents significant inverse correlations with depth for both nitrate t 42 2 9 p 0 01 fig s5e and nitrite t 42 2 9 p 0 05 fig s5f are observed as well as broadly for ammonium although not statistically significant at the 0 05 level t 42 1 7 p 0 10 fig s5g interestingly post monsoon nitrate and nitrite both reach peak values at the shallow depth of 15 m which is slightly shallower in comparison to the ammonium peak 20 m suggesting the development of a depth controlled redox front likely impacted by monsoonal ingress and which plausibly might be exacerbated by intensive pumping in urban areas the ammonium concentration peak at a depth of 20 m is located around the same depth where peak arsenic and elevated iron occur a similar spatial correlation was previously noted in bangladesh harvey et al 2002 the co occurrence of maximum arsenic and ammonium is notable as ammonium has been postulated as an electron donor to induce arsenic mobilization from the reduction of iron oxide minerals in the hetao basin in china xiu et al 2020 noting however that there are also groundwaters present in patna which contain relatively high ammonium but low arsenic geochemical conditions in groundwater under patna are characterized by substantial spatial heterogeneity laterally as well as vertically fig 3 the highest arsenic concentrations are detected in very shallow groundwaters in close proximity to the river ganga in the pre monsoon season a front of higher arsenic groundwater appears to develop at greater depths near the urban center of patna within 5 km of the river ganga and at intermediate depths in the expanding urban peri urban area within 5 15 km of the river ganga fig 3a these patterns are broadly mirrored by observed fe distributions fig 3c d interestingly the distributions of eh fig 3e f and sulfate concentrations fig 3g h strongly suggest the ingress of oxic groundwater recharge both from the surface across the field area and in areas in close proximity within 1 km of the river ganga in the dry pre monsoon season the most oxidized groundwaters are found at depths 60 m under urban areas suggesting that urban groundwater abstraction is drawing down oxic groundwater at a faster rate than would occur naturally under areas less impacted by pumping e g in peri urban and rural areas 15 km from the river fig 3e g the greater depth of the unsaturated zone during this period due to drawdown may also facilitate oxic conditions at this time in the post monsoon season rapid surface derived ingress likely occurs across the field area refreshing an input of oxic groundwater recharge and contributing to water table rebound in this case the impact of urban pumping becomes masked and more oxidizing groundwaters are observed throughout the depth profile in urban areas whilst at greater distance from highly urbanized areas they only appear near the surface fig 3f h higher eh and sulfate are both observed across the field area in the post monsoon season see section 3 5 on seasonal changes importantly however the observed trends are very spatially heterogeneous whilst the highest concentrations of arsenic occur at shallow depths and near the river ganga for example not all shallow groundwaters near the ganga exhibit high arsenic concentrations the lateral variation of various hydrogeochemical parameters reveals spatial bands of broadly similarly characterized groundwater throughout the study area fig s6 this helps to explain some of the variability which is not fully explained by depth or perpendicular distance from the river or urban center these bands mostly oriented in a similar direction in increasing distance from the river are indicative of zones where redox conditions are systematically shifting some parameters like nitrate nitrite and ammonium have clear areas of elevated concentrations very near the river and in shallow depths as shown on fig s5 which then decrease with increasing distance before increasing again in the south east part of the field area other parameters like arsenic and iron also exhibit a near river city elevated band before decreasing beyond the outskirts of the city these patterns and consistency between them suggest that lateral flow controls are also very important across the study area as many of the patterns seem to span the entire distance along the river covered in the field area this seems to suggest that at least some of the observed trends are attributed to river groundwater interactions this is consistent with the relatively high hydraulic conductivities 150 m day 1 reported near the river ganga in the upper aquifer 30 130 m depth near patna central ground water board 2015 systematic patterns e g zones of developing redox fronts specifically surrounding the urban center of patna like as observed beneath hat yai thailand lawrence et al 2000 are less clear which is likely due to the confounding variables including diffuse sources and the wide distribution of municipal pumping wells central ground water board 2015 influences from the river as compared to the urban center are not necessarily mutually exclusive as urban pumping may increase the extent of river groundwater interactions lu et al 2022 detailed geochemical modelling of the evolution of redox zones under patna is the subject of ongoing investigation by co authors 3 4 residence time indicators cfc and sf6 groundwater signatures apparent ages based on cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 signatures indicate that most groundwater in the study area is modern less than 60 70 years and mostly within the age range of 40 70 years fig 4 independent age indicators are generally consistent with cfc 11 ages being well correlated with cfc 12 ages t 43 7 4 p 0 01 and sf6 ages t 28 2 3 p 0 05 when over modern and below detection values are excluded the presence of modern groundwater is also qualitatively consistent with emerging organic contaminants in the study area richards et al 2021 the distributions of pre monsoon groundwater ages are statistically similar to post monsoon groundwater ages noting although the youngest ages are observed post monsoon which is consistent with monsoonal ingress of young recharge two groups appear to be following contrasting systematic patterns fig 4b d as groundwater evolves from relatively young to relatively old along separate flowpaths as there is some evidence of slight excess in cfc 12 plausibly deriving from air conditioning units and refrigerators in the area much of the detailed interpretation will focus on cfc 11 rather than cfc 12 data no statistically significant relationship is observed between concentrations of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 with eh nor fe fig s7 suggesting that potential degradation of cfcs particularly cfc 11 under reducing conditions hinsby et al 2007 sebol et al 2007 lapworth et al 2018a 2018b is not the dominant control on cfc 11 concentrations observed this is consistent with the relatively low groundwater doc concentrations observed usually 2 mg l 1 observed table s3 suggesting that the reducing conditions are likely not dominantly attributed to organic carbon degradation which would likely co metabolize with cfc 11 noting however that this does not preclude that organic degradation may still be an important process in some cases although the groundwater throughout the study area is consistently modern there is no apparent overall systematic relationship between groundwater age and depth fig s8 in the pre monsoon season there is a broadly inverse relationship between depth and cfc 11 age with the youngest pre monsoon waters found at relatively deep depths 90 110 m depth although the overall relationship is not statistically significant at the 0 05 level t 11 1 5 p 0 16 over modern and below detection values excluded this could possibly be explained by upwelling of younger water in some locations in the hyporheic zone klump et al 2006 hester et al 2013 krause et al 2013 gomez velez and krause 2014 arising from a zone of relatively deep hyporheic water with high hydraulic connectivity with the river more apparent in the drier pre monsoon season in contrast and interestingly in the post monsoon season depth and age switch to a positive correlation which is statistically significant for sf6 based ages t 26 2 3 p 0 05 although not cfc 11 based ages t 30 0 85 p 0 40 fig s8 this suggests a monsoonal reversal in groundwater flow direction consistent with modelled lateral flow path predictions based on particle tracking lu et al 2022 the observation that shallow groundwater is typically younger than deeper groundwater in the post monsoon season is consistent with monsoonal ingress of surface derived recharge the lack of overall age depth relationship observed is likely due to a number of confounding factors including these seasonally dependent flow patterns impacting groundwater surface water exchange perturbations due to pumping subsurface heterogeneity and other factors such as leaky well construction and likely variation in well screening length between sampling wells these factors are difficult to isolate given the co variances and complexity of the groundwater system studied however regardless of the numerous factors potentially contributing to the controls on these processes the presence of modern age indicators at depths 100 m strongly suggests that groundwater at all depths may be vulnerable to the influence of modern recharge at some locations these findings are consistent with those within a comparable setting in varanasi lapworth et al 2018a cfc 11 and sf6 signatures are compared to simple theoretical mixing models to disentangle apparent dominant hydrogeochemical controls across the study area fig s9 in brief the highest proportion of samples are consistent with a piston flow model pfm 47 of samples suggesting the dominance of young recharge from a consistent source and location the observation that cfc 11 and sf6 data does not consistently fall below the piston flow line further indicates that potential degradation of cfcs is not the dominant control on cfc 11 concentrations other groundwater samples are consistent with a binary mixing model bmm or an exponential mixing model emm see supplementary information patterns in the spatial distribution of cfc 11 fig 5 are consistent with those observed for other geochemical parameters fig 3 fig s6 at locations farthest from both the river ganga and urban center 20 km away from river younger groundwater is found at shallower depths this is as expected and consistent with a dominant vertical flow control and the main source of recharge being monsoonal surface derived ingress from precipitation and or flooded areas in these locations far from the river perturbations both due to urban pumping and direct river groundwater interactions are expected to be minimal and thus the conditions are controlled mostly by natural factors such as the subsurface lithological structure the downwards trend in groundwater age is also observed very near the river in the post monsoon season peach box fig 5b consistent with vertical recharge from the surface and or river groundwater interactions at shallow depths importantly however some reversals in these patterns were also observed in urban areas in the post monsoon season green box fig 5b an opposite trend occurs here the youngest groundwaters are seen in the deepest samples this could perhaps be explained by upwelling of younger groundwaters from deeper depths possibly associated with high permeability zones from old river channel paths or by the combination of monsoonal ingress and urban pumping which draws in a higher proportion of well oxygenated recharge that would occur simply by pumping alone this also may be reflected in the pre monsoon sites very near the river peach box fig 5a if there is a time delay between observation and flow reversal due to the transport times the pre monsoon groundwater in the urban area is likely a mixture of these impacts with the youngest groundwaters at middle depths these samples are plausibly impacted by a combination of monsoonal recharge river surface water interactions and urban pumping the majority of samples in the post monsoon season are consistent with a piston flow mechanism suggesting point sources of young recharge which control the distribution of groundwater ages these seasonal shifts in direction of flow regimes likely reflect the combined influence of multiple factors likely both geogenic e g monsoonal ingress river groundwater interactions changing hydraulic gradients and anthropogenic e g pumping induced perturbations surface inputs of organic carbon which control the groundwater chemistry in and around patna 3 5 seasonal variation in groundwater composition direct seasonal comparisons of identically paired pre and post monsoon groundwater samples is shown in fig s10 generally there is strong seasonal agreement with the major element composition although there are some parameters e g sulfate and chloride which are substantially different in a limited number of shallow samples indicative of localized point inputs fig s10d h seasonal differences are systematically apparent and statistically significant for physico chemical parameters ph and eh showing lower ph and higher eh in the post monsoon season fig s10f g consistent with rapid monsoonal ingress of oxic recharge across the field area more details are provided in supplementary information 3 6 implications on controls on arsenic mobilization and groundwater vulnerability arsenic concentrations are compared to apparent cfc 11 years fig 6a with maximum concentrations of arsenic substantially increasing in older groundwater t 4 1 8 p 0 14 below detection cfc 11 excluded the envelope relationship suggests that although the maximum concentrations are associated with age other geochemical processes e g adsorption desorption goldberg et al 2007 lalonde et al 2012 richards et al 2019a co precipitation johnson et al 2015 and or physical processes e g flushing plausibly contribute to the range observed the overall relationship between arsenic concentrations and cfc 11 ages allows for a rough estimation of an overall arsenic accumulation rate in patna of 0 002 0 003 μm yr 1 0 2 0 2 μg l 1 yr 1 if apparent cfc 12 ages are used to estimate an overall arsenic accumulation rate rather than cfc 11 ages a stronger and statistically significant relationship is observed in the dataset 0 005 0 003 μm yr 1 t 49 2 1 p 0 05 arsenic accumulation rates based on sf6 ages 0 002 0 002 μm yr 1 or 0 2 0 2 μg l 1 yr 1 t 33 1 0 p 0 3 are very similar to the cfc 11 based estimation the average overall accumulation rate based on a combined average of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 based estimations is 0 003 0 003 μm yr 1 0 3 0 2 μg l 1 yr 1 the maximum observed rates based on each residence time indicator are very consistent across tracers and are 0 014 μm yr 1 0 013 μm yr 1 and 0 015 μm yr 1 for cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 respectively with an average maximum rate across the age models being 0 014 μm yr 1 1 μg l 1 yr 1 the arsenic accumulation rates do not strongly depend on season as the distributions of pre and post monsoon rates are not significantly different the maximum arsenic accumulation rate in groundwater of 0 014 μm yr 1 and other elevated rates are clearly observed at relatively shallow depths 20 m and at locations in near proximity to the river ganga 1 km fig 6b c particularly in urban areas in the eastern part of patna fig s6l a broad decrease in accumulation rates is observed with regard to both increasing depth and distance from the river ganga in envelope type relationships importantly however these relationships are heterogeneous and an overall dependence of accumulation rate on both depth t 43 0 65 p 0 52 and distance from river ganga t 43 1 3 p 0 21 is not statistically significant nevertheless the observation of elevated arsenic accumulation at some shallow depths in close proximity to the river ganga suggests there are particular zones which provide an important control on arsenic mobilization processes the presence of near river fast track zones in some locations would facilitate high groundwater surface water connectivity leading to the ingress of young oxic recharge particularly to relatively shallow groundwater the observation that the site of highest arsenic and arsenic accumulation is also characterized by highest ammonium concentrations and elevated iron fig 2 fig s5 suggests that nutrient bearing sewage may ingress into groundwaters in this area possibly via groundwater river connectivity which in turn could induce iron reduction and arsenic release if ammonium is used as a potential electron donor xiu et al 2020 this has important implications for groundwater management including siting of pumping locations particularly as urban abstraction in relatively vulnerable locations may exacerbate surface groundwater interactions leading to geochemical conditions which are more favorable for arsenic release and hence future accumulation in groundwater the overall estimated arsenic accumulation rate in patna of 0 003 0 003 μm yr 1 is more than an order of magnitude lower than similarly estimated rates in cambodia 0 08 0 03 μm yr 1 richards et al 2019c and two orders of magnitude lower than suggested in bangladesh estimates between 0 28 0 05 and 0 31 0 08 μm yr 1 radloff et al 2007 and 0 26 0 03 and 0 32 0 04 μm yr 1 stute et al 2007 even the maximum value 0 014 μm yr 1 observed in patna are lower than these rates reported elsewhere the much lower arsenic accumulation rates observed in patna as compared to other arsenic impacted areas in the circum himalayan region raises a number of interesting questions regarding these differences and wider implications including on future groundwater vulnerability a systematic investigation of the nature of organic matter in the study area and its potential role or otherwise as an electron donor in arsenic mobilization including in comparison to trends observed in arsenic impacted bengali kulkarni et al 2017 vega et al 2017 kulkarni et al 2018 or cambodian richards et al 2019b aquifers is currently being undertaken by co authors further a reactive transport model is under development to better understand the changing redox conditions hydrological controls and groundwater surface water dynamics in relation to groundwater arsenic release interpreting the potential geochemical interactions between recently characterized surface water in the ganga river basin richards et al 2022 and groundwater in patna is an important next step including to inform future predictions of groundwater vulnerability especially given insight provided by other investigations demonstrating the importance of the riverbed aquifer interface as a hotspot for biogeochemical interactions influencing arsenic mobilization in high abstraction zones of the red river basin in vietnam wallis et al 2020 a simplified conceptual schematic illustrates some of the key geochemical conditions and interactions which appear to be occurring in the groundwater under patna fig 7 in areas away from the river and patna urban center the dominant flow control is vertical and the main source of recharge is monsoonal surface derived ingress flow regimes and chemical groundwater signatures become more complex near the central urban areas likely attributed to the combined influence of extensive urban pumping and river groundwater interactions this leads to a spatially dependent redox front where patterns in the behaviour of redox sensitive parameters e g sulfate nitrate nitrite ammonium are observed the river is likely contributing nutrients to the groundwater especially during periods of flow reversal during or after the monsoon however regardless of season the highest arsenic concentrations and arsenic accumulation rates are observed in shallow samples very near the river and are also associated with elevated iron and ammonium zones of relatively high extents of surface groundwater interactions are the most vulnerable and are likely to be the most sensitive of pumping related vertical drawdown as well as lateral connectivity there are likely multiple processes occurring particularly under the urban center where pumping regimes and proximity to the river ganga lead to more complex hydrochemical conditions 4 conclusions here we have studied the spatial distribution and evolution of inorganic groundwater chemistry under the rapidly developing city of patna india using a suite of inorganic hydrochemical parameters and residence time indicators the groundwater is mostly a ca mg hco3 type and concentrations of dissolved arsenic are highly heterogeneous ranging from below detection to 0 88 μm 70 μg l 1 arsenic is positively associated with iron manganese and ammonium and broadly inversely correlated with nitrate and nitrite consistent with arsenic mobilization via the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing iron hydroxide minerals arsenic and other redox sensitive species are depth dependent and reveal systematic spatial patterns cfcs and sf6 evidence modern groundwater 60 70 years throughout the depth profile although there is no apparent overall relationship between groundwater age and depth there is evidence of both vertical and lateral flow controls across the study area with the dominant flow control being vertical particularly at distances relatively far from the river although seasonal changes in major element groundwater geochemistry are generally not significant an observed decrease in ph and increase in eh in the post monsoon season are consistent with an overall monsoonal flushing and dilution impact from monsoonal recharge across the study area seasonal patterns in residence time indicators suggest that there is a seasonally inversion of flow patterns particularly near the urban center and the river ganga apparent groundwater ages are used to derive an overall estimated arsenic accumulation rate in patna of 0 003 0 003 μm yr 1 0 3 0 2 μg l 1 yr 1 based on an average of cfc 11 cfc 12 and sf6 derived models a rate which is an order of magnitude lower than previously estimated in cambodia richards et al 2019c and two orders of magnitude lower than previously estimated in bangladesh radloff et al 2007 stute et al 2007 arsenic accumulation rates are highest maximum 0 014 μm yr 1 or 1 μg l 1 yr 1 in shallow groundwaters located near the river ganga suggesting these groundwaters are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of nutrient bearing ingress which may induce arsenic mobilization in particular locations this has important implications on water management e g on siting of large scale groundwater pumping infrastructure and on long term groundwater vulnerability in patna and other similar rapidly developing cities in the

toxicity persistence and strong bioaccumulative potential chabukdhara et al 2017 pekey et al 2004 drinking hard water can lead to health problems such as kidney failure who 2008 heavy metal exposure has been linked to serious human health consequences such as cardiovascular and skeletal diseases infertility and neurotoxicity among others who 2011 metal exposure causes a variety of liver and kidney disorders in humans and this group of toxicants is also regarded as a genotoxic carcinogen chabukdhara et al 2017 strachan 2010 some metals are important for the growth and function of living organisms in trace amounts but higher concentrations are harmful to humans and aquatic life ouyang et al 2002 groundwater contaminated by hazardous metals poses serious threats to local residents and the natural environment he and wu 2019 sang et al 2008 the degree of groundwater contamination may differ with spatial and temporal variation infrastructure development industrial growth geological formations and other related human induced activities in case of land use agriculture is the dominant while urbanization dewan and yamaguchi 2009 and industrialization lipczynska kochany 2018 are happening hastily in contrast groundwater contamination varies in relation to human interventions geographical location groundwater flow oxidation and reduction reactions microbial activity and depositional materials the groundwater in the unconfined aquifers of holocene sediments in the ganges brahmaputra and meghna river floodplain contains about 200 times more arsenic as compared to the world health organization who guideline of 10 μg l ravenscroft et al 2005 it was expected that arsenic might be released from aquifer minerals and associated organic matter depending on variations in geochemical reactions geological composition aquifer characteristics anawar et al 2003 he et al 2021 wei et al 2021 and land use land cover changes at the same time groundwater quality relies on a number of other factors such as sediments or rocks types bhattacharya et al 2002 hasan et al 2009 raju et al 2015 chemical compositions and the quality of surface water that recharges aquifer ijeh and udoinyang 2013 elevated levels of as in groundwater were reported elsewhere berg et al 2001 2007 buschmann et al 2007 das et al 1994 mandal et al 1998 nickson et al 1998 polya et al 2003 2005 tseng 1977 tseng et al 1968 many industries including leather textile knitting dyeing chemicals and fertilizer are located in bangladesh consequently industrial effluent which contains hazardous materials is found in many of the streams surrounding different cities creating serious environmental problems during the dry season sultana et al 2009 a few studies have documented the potential toxicity of lead pb manganese mn barium ba uranium u chromium cr molybdenum mo and nickel ni in drinking water frisbie et al 2002 bgs dphe 2001 in addition the coastal parts of bangladesh are severely affected by climate change and sea level rise impacts while cyclonic storm surges create flooding waterlogging and saltwater intrusions mallick et al 2017 rakib et al 2019 salinity intrusions increase the risk of drinking water contamination local freshwater scarcity and health problems in the coastal community rahman et al 2017 rakib et al 2020 due to rising groundwater demands in both urban and rural areas a large volume of groundwater is pumped out every day almost everybody both in rural and urban areas uses groundwater for household purposes such as drinking bathing cooking livestocks feeding and washing millions of people rely on subsurface water for irrigation and household bhattacharjee et al 2019 several studies have been conducted on groundwater contamination and its consequences on human health adimalla and qian 2021 anim gyampo et al 2019 hossain et al 2021 mthembu et al 2021 rahman et al 2021 zakir et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 however the contaminated water may cause a public health risk if it is used for drinking or agricultural purposes therefore it is essential to conduct a study on the quality assessment of groundwater with regard to the relevant public health risk still there is a lack of understanding of groundwater quality and its associated impacts on health in the context of diverse contaminants hence this study was designed to i determine the variation of elemental concentration in coastal and floodplain areas ii assess the health risk from toxic metals and iii source determination of contaminant elements 2 methodology 2 1 location climate and hydrogeology of the study area bangladesh is located in the north eastern region of south asia between 20 34 and 26 38 north and 88 01 and 92 41 east fig 1 the himalayas are located to the north while the bay of bengal is located to the south tripura mizoram india and myanmar lie to the east of west bengal which borders to the west bangladesh has four major river systems the brahmaputra jamuna the ganges padma the surma meghna and the chittagong region river system banglapedia 2021 bangladesh is classified as having a subtropical monsoon climate the average temperature ranges from 11 c to 20 c october to february in the winter and 21 c to 38 c march to september in the summer from june to august the area receives 1100 to 3400 mm of rain mofa 2017 the bengal delta is being developed by the holocene and recent sediments of the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm river system morgan and mcintire 1959 which encompasses the majority of bangladesh and the neighboring indian state of west bengal coleman 1969 goodbred jr and kuehl 2000 lindsay et al 1991 ravenscroft et al 2005 although older deposits of the tertiary period are rarely found in aquifers in bangladesh the majority of the country is covered with fluvio deltaic unconsolidated alluvial deposits of the quaternary period ravenscroft et al 2005 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 the coastal shallow aquifer is composed of fine to very fine sand the deep aquifer is made up of fine to medium sand with the occasional coarse sand the aquifer in the central part of bangladesh lies within a few meters to a few ten meters of the lithostratigraphic units composed of fine to medium grained dupi tila sand the madhupur and barind tracts overlay the dupi tila sediments confining the aquifer system the upper and lower parts of the aquifer lie within a few meters of each other in the ganges delta and meghna delta plains and are composed of fine to very fine sand and medium to coarse sand respectively the upper and lower aquifers in the ganges floodplain the brahmaputra floodplain the tista floodplain and the meghna floodplain are composed of fine to very fine sand and medium to coarse sand with occasional gravel ahmed et al 2004 the aquifers are classified as shallow 70 m intermediate 70 80 m and deep 180 m majumder et al 2011 in shallow aquifers groundwater moves from the northwest and north eastern areas toward the center and then south and southwest where it flows into the bay of bengal undp 1982 to the north of the delta there is a single continuous unconfined aquifer system that is gradually interlaced with discontinuous aquitard layers of varying thicknesses toward the active delta mouth thus the aquifer system is divided into confined to semiconfined poorly linked and multilayered aquifer units to the south the primary aquifer is mostly connected to the atmosphere in the delta s northern reaches but it is gradually being overlain by an increasingly thick aquitard layer to the south with a thickness of up to several tens of meters in places this aquifer deepens toward the active delta mouth progressing from up to 80 m thick in the north to over 450 m deep in the extreme south chakraborty et al 2021 this basal aquitard is characterized by multiple deep separate aquifer units that are mostly often used trap saline and brackish groundwater mukherjee et al 2007 pumping induces an increase in the vertical hydraulic gradients within the shallow groundwater flow system along with the development of local flows and recharge zones michael and voss 2009 annual potential recharge ranges from 400 to 1000 mm mpo 1987 but actual recharge is substantially lower due to aquifer full conditions developing during the monsoon season ravenscroft et al 2005 seasonally the water table rises and falls by about 4 6 m without pumping unicef 1994 the surface water bodies within the delta which include a dense network of river channels streams lakes ponds and wetlands closely interact with the groundwater system in absence of extensive groundwater irrigation the groundwater discharges to rivers under natural hydraulic gradients chakraborty et al 2021 2 2 sample collection and analysis water samples were gathered across the country to examine the quality of the water and the extent of its distribution as indicated in fig 1 this study attempted to cover the southern central and northern parts of the country in order to determine the variability of contamination status and its potential risk to human health in the southern part a total of eleven 11 sampling stations were selected as s3

kalia of narail and s25 galachipa of potuakhali eight 8 samples were collected from the industrialized areas in the central part of bangladesh which included s5 gazipur sadar s6 faridpur sadar s12 ashulia of dhaka s13 habiganj sadar s16 narayanganj sadar s20 faridpur sadar s21 daudkhandi of cumilla and s23 belabo of narsingdi in most of the sampling areas industrial effluents are discharging into the wetlands lakes canals and rivers other types of trash are disposed of in open places such as beside towns and or cities streets and within the drainage system another six 6 samples were collected from the northern part of bangladesh including s1 thakurgaon s2 sherpur of nalitabari s4 sreebardi of sherpur sadar s7 rangpur sadar s14 nandigram of bogra and s18 gomostapur of chapai nawabganj which are partially urbanized however agro farming is mostly dominating in these areas the groundwater samples were collected by pumping for 10 min using 200 ml plastic bottles prior to sampling the bottles were rinsed with the water to be sampled and the samples were preserved by acidifying them to ph 2 with hno3 and keeping them at a temperature of 4 c until analysis water temperature electrical conductivity ec and ph were recorded during the sampling each water sample was filtered with a 0 45 μm millipore filter 5 hno3 was added and diluted to a suitable concentration with deionized water for the icp ms measurement hydrochloric acid and nitric acid were ultra pure analytical grade deionized water 18mω obtained from a milli q water system millipore co was used for dilution of reagents and rinsing the laboratory ware the physicochemical parameters such as ph and ec were measured using field kits the ph measurement was performed using an accumet electrode and an accumet excel xl50 meter dual channel ph ion conductivity fisher scientific singapore the electrode was calibrated using different reference solutions with ph 4 sb101 500 ph 7 sb107 500 and ph 10 sb115 500 buffer solutions fisher scientific usa were used before taking the samples for the reading before measuring ec the ec meter was also calibrated with a reference solution to maximize the accuracy rate of values or error free measurement measurement of trace elements al cr mn fe co ni cu zn se cd th u as in water samples were carried out with icp ms model 7500a cations and anions nh4 k mg2 na ca2 f cl no3 so4 2 were measured using ic 7000 ion chromatographic analyzer yokogawa analytical system scanning was repeated three times with 100 sweeps for each run for the determination of elements multi element standard solution xstc 355 spex industries inc was used to make a calibration for icp ms measurement to guarantee the accuracy of the assessment the national institute of standards and technology standard reference material 1643e was used 2 3 statistical analysis a descriptive statistical analysis was performed to understand the overall structural pattern of the data pearson s correlation coefficient was also carried out to draw the internal relationship in water quality parameters that exhibits statistical consistency in regards to dependent and independent variables and their abundance in the aquifer level multivariate statistical analysis is a substantial technique to understand the internal dependency and or influence of any factor in the measured variables principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca are considered key statistical approaches to reduce the dimension of a data set that may significantly show the key dominant factors and their influence li et al 2019b wu et al 2019 pca analysis transforms the original variables and converts them into new uncorrelated components that show the loading score regarding objects and pc numbers pca is a helpful and well recognized technique that transforms the original variables into uncorrelated variables like principal components pcs and interrelated variables into fewer jiang et al 2018 sârbu and pop 2005 used pca to investigate the variation in the data set helena et al 2000 describes the meaningful and significant parameters with the minimum loss of original information to determine sampling adequacy pca was used in conjunction with kmo and bartlett s test a number of studies have employed pca analysis for water quality data bhuiyan et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2019 the equation is given below 1 x i l 1 i m 1 l 2 i m 2 l 3 i m 3 l ni m n where x indicates component score l denotes component loading m represents measured value of the variable i demonstrates component number and n denotes total number of variables the component loadings are classified as strong 0 75 moderate 0 75 0 50 and weak 0 50 0 30 based on their absolute values gao et al 2016 liu et al 2003 wang et al 2017 ca is also considered a substantial data reduction technique that helps to create groups among the variables based on similar characteristics based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering it is illustrated by the tree diagram dendrogram which provides the internal intuitive similarities among the samples or the whole data set mckenna jr 2003 the dendrogram explains the closeness of each group as a visual summary of the whole clustering process that helps to reduce the dimensionality of the original data set mckenna jr 2003 2 4 heavy metal pollution index heavy metal pollution index hpi techniques were used to figure out the status of water quality in terms of heavy metal contamination these methods were developed by the assigning of weightage w i to each parameter the rating was maintained within zero to one while the assigned weights were considered depending on the importance of relative water quality parameters bhuiyan et al 2016 mohan et al 1996 it is defined as the inversely proportional to standard permissible values s i of each water quality parameter horton 1965 mohan et al 1996 the concentration limits such as permissible limit values s i and maximum desirable values i i of each parameter were selected from the who standards the hpi was calculated using the following eq 2 bhuiyan et al 2016 mohan et al 1996 2 hpi i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where hpi indicates heavy pollution index q i is denotes the sub index of the i th parameters and n denotes the total number of parameters the value of the critical pollution index is 100 reza and singh 2010 bhuiyan et al 2016 the subindex q i is calculated as follows 3 q i i 1 n m i i i s i i i 100 where m i s i and i i indicates the monitored values standard values and ideal values of the i th number of water quality parameters respectively the negative symbols were used to figure out the difference between two number later ignored the algebraic sign 2 5 the degree of contamination c d the degree of contamination was calculated by the following equation which was adopted by backman et al 1998 4 c d i 1 n c fi where c fi c ai c ni 1 c fi is the contamination factor c ai denotes the analytical values and c ni denotes the permissible values of highest values of the ith parameters and n denotes the normative value the resulting c d value identifies areas of varied contamination levels which are classified as low c d 1 medium c d 1 3 and high c d 3 edet and offiong 2002 2 6 health risk assessment technique the exposure level of hazardous materials explicitly demonstrates the degree of pollution that may pose threats to living organisms bortey sam et al 2015 reported that risk assessment is a combined action of hazards and the level of exposure which is defined as the process of estimating the probability of occurrence of any given magnitude of adverse health effects over a specified time period but sometimes it may significantly vary depending on regional point and non point pollution sources and how the pollution removal action is going on however medium contamination may augment the level of contamination in a living cell each heavy metal and metalloid health risk analysis is quantified in terms of carcinogenic or non carcinogenic properties usepa 2009 moreover in most cases slope factors sf and reference dose rfd are used to evaluate the toxicity risk of carcinogenic and non carcinogenic substances lim et al 2008 as a result exposure pathways may differ depending on the factor responsible for contaminating the medium for instance direct ingestion such as consumption of contaminated water is a more significant factor that can cause heavy metal contamination liu et al 2011 while food chain contamination may enhance the contamination level with regard to the time length eq 5 is adopted to calculate the chronically daily intake cdi of contaminants through the ingestion process de miguel et al 2007 ji et al 2020 karim 2011 wu et al 2009 wu et al 2019 usepa 1989 the cdi oral is calculated as follows 5 cdi oral cw ir ef ed bw at where cdi indicates chronically daily intakes cw is the concentrations of the parameters ir indicates the day of drinking ef indicates the frequency of exposure ed indicates the duration of drinking time bw indicates the body weight and at denotes the average time of exposures as shown in detail in supplementary table 1 the exposure level of hazardous materials explicitly demonstrates the degree of pollution that may pose threats to living organisms bortey sam et al 2015 reported that risk

cdi indicates chronically daily intakes cw is the concentrations of the parameters ir indicates the day of drinking ef indicates the frequency of exposure ed indicates the duration of drinking time bw indicates the body weight and at denotes the average time of exposures as shown in detail in supplementary table 1 contaminated groundwater consumption and its health risk were quantified using the computed value of the cdi and the toxicity level for heavy metals or metalloids sometimes the toxicity level in the human body can be influenced by physiological conditions and or the immune system the health impacts of drinking contaminated groundwater may be influenced by factors such as the level of exposure the frequency with which the water is consumed and other pathway the exposure level could be visualized as chronic fatigue or show different symptoms in the human body however in eq 6 hazard quotient hq can be calculated using chronic daily intake cdi and reference dose rfd values usepa 1989 if the hq values exceed 1 it represents the possible threat of cariogenic effects on health but in the opposite situation such as 1 it represents an acceptable level giri and singh 2015 wongsasuluk et al 2014 usepa 2001 the hq is calculated as follows 6 hq cdi rfd where hq stands for hazards quotient and rfd stands for reference dose values as shown in supplementary table 2 for each chemical or metal hq values are summed and estimates of the hazard index hi values that express the possibility of carcinogenic effects in the human body if the hi value is 1 then it exhibits less possibility of causing chronic effects if most hq values are 1 owing to the summing of different hqs then it s better to drive separate hqs through making different groups of compounds e g for each organ depending on the effects and mechanism of action yang et al 2012 usepa 1989 ecetoc 2001 this approach indicates the integrated impacts of different chemicals that may lead to health impacts at the subthreshold level of exposure sometimes the sum of the subthreshold level exposure ratios will be proportional to the magnitude of the adverse health impacts however hazard quotients sum and hi will be the same while rfd and exposure level of intake indicate the same exposure period the hi is calculated as follows 7 hi hq 1 hq 2 hq n where hi stands for the hazards index the carcinogenic risk of groundwater consumption depends on an exposure period that may increase the probability of developing cancer in terms of the potentiality of carcinogenic compounds in water and the exposure route the following equations eqs 8 and 9 can estimate the linear dose of carcinogenic risk for each exposure route usepa 1989 8 low dose exposure risk cdi sf 9 high dose exposure risk 1 exp cdi sf where sf indicates the carcinogen slope coefficient of the carcinogenic risk as shown in supplementary table 2 if the estimated value is greater than the expected level 0 01 then move on to the next 2nd formula instead however if it has a number of carcinogenic compounds to determine individual carcinogenic risk it should be added to each of the exposure routes and compared to the accepted risk value the acceptable limit is 1 10 6 which means the average probability of causing cancer is 1 person among the total number of 1 000 000 people in relation to the exposure level lim et al 2008 whereas 1 10 6 is an acceptable risk value however the range of 10 6 to 10 4 is also considered an acceptable limit yang et al 2012 usepa 1992 the health impacts of drinking contaminated groundwater may be influenced by factors such as the level of exposure the frequency with which the water is consumed and other pathway the exposure level could be visualized as chronic fatigue or show different

parameters the mean value of ph and ec were observed 8 33 and 0 52 ms cm respectively the concentration range of major cations were from 10 2 mg l to 273 mg l 0 8 mg l to 14 5 mg l 1 mg l to 48 1 mg l and 2 1 mg l to 38 1 mg l for na k mg2 and ca2 respectively the annions concentrations of f cl no3 and so4 2 were observed at range from 0 03 mg l to 1 30 mg l 1 6 mg l to 227 mg l 0 05 mg l to 32 5 mg l and 0 05 mg l to 18 4 mg l respectively on the other hand the metal concentrations were found to range from 0 53 μg l to 39 μg l 8 7 μg l to 1600 μg l 1 4 μg l to 58 μg l and 3 75 ng l to 520 ng l for al fe zn and se respectively the average as concentration was 21 06 μg l almost twice the who who 2017 drinking water limit 10 μg l where the concentrations ranged from 0 09 μg l to 160 μg l the range of mn was 2 2 μg l to 880 μg l with a mean of 41 16 μg l where the highest concentration 880 μg l was found in sample s1 it was found that the concentrations of fe and as were very consistent across the southern middle and northern areas of bangladesh the findings revealed that the high concentrations of na and cl were found in groundwater samples at s9 s11 s17 and s19 in coastal areas saltwater intrusion may influence the increasing amount of na and cl in the coastal aquifer rakib et al 2020 not considerable variations were found for ca2 mg2 and k concentrations in the study area however as was found in high concentrations at s10 s21 and s24 from table 1 the concentrations of cr co ni cu and cd ranged from 0 02 μg l to 0 86 μg l 12 ng l to 350 ng l 0 1 μg l to 5 2 μg l 0 07 μg l to 29 μg l and 0 02 μg l to 0 88 μg l respectively sample s12 and s16 had relatively high concentrations of cr ni cu and cd these areas were highly influenced by industrial activities where effluents and waste materials might release metal contaminants in groundwater with time from table 1 th and u were found ranging from 1 65 ng l to 41 ng l and 0 06 μg l to 31 μg l respectively the average concentration of u was found to be 2 36 μg l in the studied samples according to who recommended values the standard concentration of u was 30 μg l while the highest concentration 31 μg l was found in the noakhali area s9 which slightly exceeded the who standard this sampling point is located at the nearest point to the southern coastal part of bangladesh it might be originated from the regional tertiary geological formations and relevant rock forming minerals turekian and wedepohl 1961 reported that a high concentration of u may derive from carbonates granites and shales 3 2 correlation coefficient matrix major cations ca2 mg2 na and k exhibited a strong correlation among some other elements table 2 most of cases cations showed a strong affinity toward anions whereas as was positively correlated with ca2 mg2 and k the strong positive correlation between na and cl r 0 784 p 01 reflected that it might occur due to saltwater intrusions in coastal aquifer in addition ni cr and cu as and fe mn and th and zn ni and cu demonstrated a positive correlation among them the high abundance of trace metals in groundwater reflected the degree of contamination and their possible sources of contaminants some of the contaminants might be caused by agricultural practices industrial activities and the aquifer s mineralogical composition furthermore strong association among different elements demonstrated their homogeneity and depositional coherence in a specific time place and source of deposition 3 3 principal component analysis pca results are shown in table 3 pc1 contains 16 50 of the total variance k mg2 ca2 no3 co and as were strong positively loaded indicating geogenic driven major ions and metalloids pc2 explain 15 56 of the total variance which was significantly positively loaded with ph ec na cl and f reflecting salinity related parameters along with fluoride dominance pc3 describes 15 26 of the total variance and had significant positive loadings for cr ni cu and zn indicating industrial pollution driven heavy metals pc4 describe 11 07 of the total variance which was strongly positively loaded with al and fe pc5 pc6 pc7 and pc8 explain 8 22 7 26 7 24 and 6 57 of the total variances respectively whereas they showed strong positive loadings for so4 2 and cd mn and th k and se and nh4 and u respectively these chemical components may originate from the natural sources pca results revealed the dominant parameters regarding pcs which reflects the possible sources of contaminants and their potentials to degrade the groundwater quality it is clear that arsenic may homogenously distributed while salinity and industrial related contaminants seems to be locally dominants in addition fluoride abundance can be associated with saltwater in the aquifers 3 4 cluster analysis the dendrogram in fig 2 explicitly divided the elements into three major clusters cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 cluster 1 was divided into three sub clusters cluster 1a cluster 1b and cluster 1c cluster 1a consists of ec na cl ph f al and fe the majority of the parameters in cluster 1a are salinity related and close together which are dominant in coastal aquifers seawater intrusions may influence salinity related parameters coastal aquifers may also be enriched with minerals containing f cluster 1b contained only nh4 and u nh4 and u showed similarities and closed together thus the dissolution of aquifer minerals could so provide nh4 and u cluster 1c consisted of cu zn ni cr so4 2 cd and se the majority of parameters in cluster 1c are heavy metals that are close together and are dominant in aquifers in industrial zones heavy metals in aquifers may come from industrial effluents contaminated rivers and lagoons in industrial areas may also heavily pollute aquifers furthermore heavy metals may accumulate in aquifers as a result of the overuse of agricultural fertilizers cluster 2 was composed of mn and th mn and th exhibited similar characteristics and closed together thus mn and th could be derived from the dissolution of aquifer minerals cluster 3 was associated with mg2 as no3 co ca2 and k thus cluster 3 contains ionic components that are close together these ionic components are known as major ions and they are abundant in the mineralogical composition of aquifers interestingly as exhibited similar properties to major ions indicating that it may be abundant in aquifers like major ions as a result cluster 3 composed components may be driven by geogenic sources cluster 2 and cluster 3 were associated with mostly geogenic components the results of ca revealed that groundwater quality parameters were grouped depending on their possible sources and distributions 3 5 heavy metal

level of contamination and s1 s12 s13 s16 s20 s21 and s24 had the highest level of contamination the highest contamination of metals was found in 28 of the samples the medium and low contamination levels are represented by 16 and 56 of the samples respectively the areas with the highest degree of contamination risk were mostly industrial table 4 showed the analysis of hpi values according to prasad and bose 2001 the critical pollution index of hpi value for drinking water is 100 the average hpi value in this study ranged from 26 64 to 806 91 samples s1 769 06 s12 806 91 and s16 123 97 exceeded the critical limit about 12 of samples had hpi values above the critical values whereas s12 and s16 belong to industrial zones where contamination may be driven from anthropogenic sources sample s1 is located in a non industrial area where contamination may be caused by natural sources in the groundwater aquifer in addition 40 of samples had medium hpi value 3 6 human health risk the

values of as were observed in s6 s8 s10 s20 s21 and s24 the maximum hq values were found at s9 s13 and s25 for u mn and al the hi values for children and adults are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively adults and children had average hi values of 2 67e 00 and 3 39e 00 respectively adults had the greatest hi values in s6 s8 s9 s10 s13 s20 s21 s24 and s25 the highest hi values for children were found in s2 s6 s8 s9 s10 s11 s13 s20 s21 s24 and s25 44 and 36 of samples for children and adults exceeded 1 respectively table 7 showed the values for carcinogenic cancer risk the typical toxic metal responsible for carcinogenic or cancer risk cr as and cd the average carcinogenic risk of as and cr in adults was 9 93e 04 and 1 95e 04 respectively and 1 26e 03 and 2 48e 04 in children for as contamination 40 of samples surpassed 1e 04 cancer risk values indicating a considerable possibility for cancer risk among groundwater users for cr contamination 48 and 68 of samples exceeded 1e 04 cancer risk values in both adults and children respectively it is obvious that the cancer risk associated with cr pollution rises with age 4 discussion according to the findings of this study three types of pollutant sources were found in groundwater in coastal and floodplain areas the average cl concentration was 45 01 mg l in this study table 1 a previous study found an average cl content of 44 9 mg l mostafa et al 2017 sharmin et al 2020 and zakir et al 2020 found the average cl concentrations in groundwater to be 21 65 mg l and 15 95 mg l respectively the cl concentration in the present study was higher than in previous studies the highest concentrations of cl were reported at s9 92 2 mg l s11 227 mg l s17 131 mg l and s19 134 mg l likewise the mean na concentration was 75 31 mg l table 1 according to zakir et al 2020 the average concentration of na in groundwater is 17 71 mg l bakali et al 2014 and sharmin et al 2020 found an average na concentration of 40 90 mg l and 28 65 mg l in groundwater respectively these previous findings were shown to be lower than the current findings s9 81 5 mg l s11 273 mg l s17 251 mg l and s19 187 mg l had the highest concentrations surprisingly high cl and na rich aquifers such as s9 s11 s17 and s19 were revealed in bangladesh near the bay of bengal in coastal aquifers seawater intrusions have increased na and cl content making the water unsafe for drinking rakib et al 2020 high saltwater consumption is linked to long term health risks chakraborty et al 2019 evaporation and over pumping harvey et al 2006 may increase salinity in groundwater water flow and rock water interaction may cause the aquifer s salinity dissolution of carbonate minerals and evaporation may be responsible for the increased salinity selvakumar et al 2022 in coastal areas waterlogging and flooding may contribute to high salt in coastal aquifers the average as concentration was found to be 21 06 μg l table 1 mostafa et al 2017 and ahmed et al 2010 have reported the average as concentration are 0 012 mg l and 0 021 mg l in groundwater respectively previous investigations revealed lower levels of as content than the present findings the sampling stations s10 160 μg l s21 130 μg l and s24 150 μg l revealed elevated as concentrations in groundwater arsenic concentrations in groundwater in a holocene unconfined aquifer was found at an alarming level in the last decade mihajlov et al 2020 arsenic can be caused by agricultural activities such as the use of fertilizer on farmland the degree of as contamination in shallow and deep aquifers may be influenced by mineralogical characteristics over pumping of groundwater may expedite more as dissolution in groundwater around 40 of sampling points were found to pose a carcinogenic or cancer risk due to as pollution both for children and adults about 24 of the samples had a high risk of chronic effects on human health due to as contamination long term exposure to arsenic poisoning through drinking water may result in chronic disorders such as keratosis hyperpigmentation cancer organ malfunction and death who 1993 who 2017 the average cr concentration was determined to be 0 15 μg l table 1 a mean groundwater cr content of 0 0015 mg l was reported by sharmin et al 2020 according to yesmeen et al 2018 the average cr concentration in groundwater is 0 008 mg l the maximum concentration of cr was reported at s16 0 86 μg l which is located in narayanganj and is considered a heavily industrialized area cr exhibited a connection with ni cu and zn cr may be transported into groundwater via industrial waste water several human induced variables e g industrial waste metal plating and mining activity may also contribute to a rise in cr concentration in groundwater zamani et al 2012 cr concentration may be increased through heavy metal waste disposal at the landfill site unplanned use of heavy metal containing chemicals and lack of proper management agricultural chemicals may accelerate the cr concentration in groundwater for cr approximately 48 and 68 of cancer risks were found in both adults and child respectively drinking a high concentration of cr contaminated water for an extended length of time may pose serious health hazards to future generations depending on the dose exposure level and duration human health risks range from skin irritation to dna damage and cancer development tumolo et al 2020 average al u and mn contents were 3 78 μg l 2 36 μg l and 41 16 μg l respectively table 1 the average u concentration in groundwater was found to be 2 5 μg l by frisbie et al 2009 seddique et al 2020 found that the u content in shallow groundwater in southeast coastal area of cox s bazar district bangladesh ranged from 0 09 to 9 57 μg l average mn content in groundwater is 18 00 μg l reported by sarker and zaman 2003 the average concentration of u was found to be slightly lower and mn was found to be higher than in prior studies at s25 s9 and s15 the highest concentrations of al u and mn were found respectively due to the earth s surface deposits mn is the most prevalent element and is frequently found in groundwater tobiason et al 2016 u may release from the surrounding rocks which can be precipitated under reducing environmental conditions dall aglio 1971 dall aglio 1971 reported that u may leach out and pass into the groundwater aquifer from uraninite in pegmatites in addition anthropogenic activities on a local scale may raise the u concentration in groundwater saikia et al 2021 al may be derived from weathering of minerals in the aquifer by the reaction of ph temperature and the concentration of organic and inorganic ligands such as sulfur fluorides sulfates phosphates and suspended particles frankowski et al 2011 al concentration can be influenced by its amphoterism and ability to transform a significant amount of al remains immobile in secondary minerals whereas a low concentration of aluminum may dissolve in groundwater due to the transformation of aluminosilicate frankowski et al 2011 this research reveals that al u and mn have a significant risk of long term effects on both children and adults chromosome abnormalities in barley meristem cells may be caused by an increase in al in drinking water momot and synzynys 2005 u has shown the binding properties of transferrin iron transport protein bicarbonate enriched red blood cells and hemoglobin ansoborlo et al 2006 it may cause nephrotoxicity in the kidneys stalder et al 2012 drinking water with a high concentration of mn over a long time may cause neurological and reproductive issues but it is unlikely to cause cancer usepa 2004 who 2011 from table 3 the pca findings revealed the variance among measured variables based on pc loadings pc1 represents the mostly geogenic parameters including k mg2 ca2 no3 co and as which are correlated with one another dolomite biotite and chlorite minerals are the primary sources of mg2 orthoclase and clay minerals are the sources of k halim et al 2011 in groundwater the weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals releases ca2 mg2 na and k which are further amplified by co2 respiration from decomposing organic matter in both the oxic and anoxic environments zheng et al 2004 datta et al 2009 reported that holocene sediment is enriched with arsenic containing minerals arsenic was most likely dissolved from the oxidation of sulfide minerals primarily pyrite originating in the himalayan granitic and metamorphic source regions anthropogenic causes such as irrigation septic tanks organic waste degradation livestock farming and residential sewage contribute to higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater adimalla and qian 2021 aguilar et al 2019 ahamad et al 2019 according to pairwise correlation ca2 was positively associated with mg2 and na and no3 was positively associated with mg2 na and k arsenic exhibited a positive correlation with mg2 na k and no3 table 2 as shown in fig 2 cluster 3 demonstrated consistent findings with pca and pairwise correlations pc2 was shown to be linked to mostly salinity related parameters table 3 including ph ec na cl and f which are considered local groundwater vulnerabilities that could occur as a result of saltwater incursions the presence of ec na and cl in high concentrations in groundwater samples suggests that saline water has interacted with groundwater the most common causes of salinity intrusion along the coastal region are climate change and rising sea levels dasgupta et al 2015 groundwater salinization can also be influenced by hydrogeochemical processes and evaporation he et al 2021 the cl concentration in the groundwater could be driven by seawater intrusion shrimp farm induced salinity and waterlogged induced salinity tds ca2 and na abundances have also been identified as potential risk factors for increased f levels in groundwater hu et al 2017 the f in groundwater is boosted by an increase in ca2 levels caused by an increase in evaporation that results in heavy precipitation of calcite li et al 2019 fluorite fluorapatite cryolite topaz montmorillonite kaolinite and vermiculite are the major fluoride bearing minerals chen et al 2017 the presence of ca2 and na in groundwater has an effect on fluoride concentration the replacement of ca2 by na thus plays an important role in groundwater fluoride chemistry edmunds and smedley 2005 chloride was found to be positively linked with ph ec na and f through pairwise correlation table 2 similar na also exhibited a positive correlation with f content with pca and pairwise correlations cluster 1a revealed consistent results as shown in fig 2 pc3 was found to be substantially linked with heavy metals including cr ni cu and zn which are also considered regional dominant factors that may occur as a result of industrial sewage or effluent discharge into groundwater some hazardous elements such as cr ni cu and zn were found in varying concentrations in various industrial sampling points zacchaeus et al 2020 cited those toxic metals from industrial effluent might degrade groundwater quality cr was found to be positively related with ni cu and zn by pairwise correlation table 2 as shown in fig 2 cluster 1c also showed a consistent result natural processes like rock weathering as well as human activities like industrial activity can enhance cr ni cu and zn in groundwater agrochemicals may contribute to groundwater accumulation of cr ni cu and zn to sum up pearson correlation pca and ca results were found to be compatible and consistent with respect to the coherence characteristics of water quality parameters based on their sources depositions and mineralogy furthermore the hpi and c d results revealed that 12 of the sample exceeds the mean hpi values with s1 s2 and s3 exhibiting higher values than the critical values 44 of the samples had a moderate to high levels of contamination with s1 s2 and s3 having the highest level of contamination the degree of pollution types of contaminants water usage pattern time and location all influence groundwater contamination and human health exposure to prevent seawater intrusions into inland areas it is critical to maintain river flow from upstream to downstream limit groundwater extraction and find a technique to improve freshwater recharge into the aquifer because of climate change induced saltwater intrusions into the coastal aquifer this is by far the most difficult problem to solve on the other hand a sustainable industrial waste or waste water management system should be introduced so that industrial contaminants cannot get into groundwater industrialized areas should be classified into several groups depending on the possible risks of hazardous waste generations and its impacts on groundwater in addition to avoid the health risk from the natural sources of groundwater contamination it would be better to make people aware of the consequences of drinking contaminated groundwater possible sources of contamination degree of contamination level and how it evolves and possible measures overall to maintain the sustainable usage of groundwater resources the government should take region wise groundwater management initiatives based on potential groundwater threats human interventions such as pollutant discharge into the aquifer should be stopped a proper groundwater monitoring system should be launched so that it can enrich groundwater quality data which can be useful for formulating data driven policy finally a holistic water resource management related awareness program should be introduced for future drinking water security and to achieve sustainable development however one of the major limitations of this study was that the number of samples was comparatively small in relation to the volume of the country because of the limitations of analytical support and funding 5 conclusions to ensure safe drinking water and good health it is essential to evaluate the elemental concentration of groundwater in the respective well the high concentration of chemical components in groundwater may pose a potential threat to human health health risk analyses were performed based on the measured chemical contents and their respective standards pearson correlation pca and ca determine the source of the contaminants in groundwater the results showed that some sampling stations had elevated concentrations of na nh4 k mg2 mn fe se u and as that exceeded doe and who water quality guidelines there was an abundance of na and cl in the groundwater of the coastal belt area while heavy metals were detected in the middle region known as the industrial zones while arsenic was abundant across the study area interestingly uranium was found along the southeastern coastline of bangladesh which was often associated with geological materials the hpi and c d data indicated the presence of heavy metal contamination with 12 and 28 of test spots exhibiting significantly high values respectively concentrations of cr were shown to be associated with a greater cancer risk in both child 68 and adults 48 than concentrations of as and cd the hq and hi results revealed the long term implications for human health values of hi larger than one were found in 36 for adults and 44 for children of the sample locations indicating a potential non carcinogenic effect on human health long term exposure to contaminated water may cause chronic ailments in many age groups of local populations the findings of the pca and ca indicated

1278,groundwater aquifers are a common source of drinking water in bangladesh however groundwater contamination is a major public health concern across the country this research aims to examine the groundwater quality and health concerns using a random sampling process multivariate statistical and health risk analyses of elements were performed to determine the source of contaminants and their effects on human health a total of 24 parameters were analyzed where na nh4 k mg2 f no3 mn fe se u and as concentrations were found to be high in different sampling points compared to the department of environment of bangladesh doe and the world health organization who groundwater quality standards principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca identified the dominant and potential sources of contaminants in the groundwater aquifer including geogenic salinity intrusion industrial and agricultural the results of the degree of contamination level c d and the heavy metal pollution

coastal area multivariate statistics health risk bangladesh 1 introduction pollution is the biggest concern for both developed and developing countries in the current world at least once a year approximately two thirds of the world s population faces a severe safe drinking water crisis mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 generally both natural and anthropogenic activities cause contamination in the different spheres of the environment such as the hydrosphere biosphere and atmosphere but the intensification of contamination may occur from human interventions surface and subsurface waters degrade over time for a range of factors uddin 2017 and these waters can potentially contain considerable quantities of contaminants that are detrimental to human health and other living organisms groundwater contaminants have the potential to cause health problems in humans through various mechanisms he and wu 2019 li et al 2019a heavy metal pollution of water is a severe environmental concern due to its toxicity persistence and strong bioaccumulative potential chabukdhara et al 2017 pekey et al 2004 drinking hard water can lead to health problems such as kidney failure who 2008 heavy metal exposure has been linked to serious human health consequences such as cardiovascular and skeletal diseases infertility and neurotoxicity among others who 2011 metal exposure causes a variety of liver and kidney disorders in humans and this group of toxicants is also regarded as a genotoxic carcinogen chabukdhara et al 2017 strachan 2010 some metals are important for the growth and function of living organisms in trace amounts but higher concentrations are harmful to humans and aquatic life ouyang et al 2002 groundwater contaminated by hazardous metals poses serious threats to local residents and the natural environment he and wu 2019 sang et al 2008 the degree of groundwater contamination may differ with spatial and temporal variation infrastructure development industrial growth geological formations and other related human induced activities in case of land use agriculture is the dominant while urbanization dewan and yamaguchi 2009 and industrialization lipczynska kochany 2018 are happening hastily in contrast groundwater contamination varies in relation to human interventions geographical location groundwater flow oxidation and reduction reactions microbial activity and depositional materials the groundwater in the unconfined aquifers of holocene sediments in the ganges brahmaputra and meghna river floodplain contains about 200 times more arsenic as compared to the world health organization who guideline of 10 μg l ravenscroft et al 2005 it was expected that arsenic might be released from aquifer minerals and associated organic matter depending on variations in geochemical reactions geological composition aquifer characteristics anawar et al 2003 he et al 2021 wei et al 2021 and land use land cover changes at the same time groundwater quality relies on a number of other factors such as sediments or rocks types bhattacharya et al 2002 hasan et al 2009 raju et al 2015 chemical compositions and the quality of surface water that recharges aquifer ijeh and udoinyang 2013 elevated levels of as in groundwater were reported elsewhere berg et al 2001 2007 buschmann et al 2007 das et al 1994 mandal et al 1998 nickson et al 1998 polya et al 2003 2005 tseng 1977 tseng et al 1968 many industries including leather textile knitting dyeing chemicals and fertilizer are located in bangladesh consequently industrial effluent which contains hazardous materials is found in many of the streams surrounding different cities creating serious environmental problems during the dry season sultana et al 2009 a few studies have documented the potential toxicity of lead pb manganese mn barium ba uranium u chromium cr molybdenum mo and nickel ni in drinking water frisbie et al 2002 bgs dphe 2001 in addition the coastal parts of bangladesh are severely affected by climate change and sea level rise impacts while cyclonic storm surges create flooding waterlogging and saltwater intrusions mallick et al 2017 rakib et al 2019 salinity intrusions increase the risk of drinking water contamination local freshwater scarcity and health problems in the coastal community rahman et al 2017 rakib et al 2020 due to rising groundwater demands in both urban and rural areas a large volume of groundwater is pumped out every day almost everybody both in rural and urban areas uses groundwater for household purposes such as drinking bathing cooking livestocks feeding and washing millions of people rely on subsurface water for irrigation and household bhattacharjee et al 2019 several studies have been conducted on groundwater contamination and its consequences on human health adimalla and qian 2021 anim gyampo et al 2019 hossain et al 2021 mthembu et al 2021 rahman et al 2021 zakir et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 however the contaminated water may cause a public health risk if it is used for drinking or agricultural purposes therefore it is essential to conduct a study on the quality assessment of groundwater with regard to the relevant public health risk still there is a lack of understanding of groundwater quality and its associated impacts on health in the context of diverse contaminants hence this study was designed to i determine the variation of elemental concentration in coastal and floodplain areas ii assess the health risk from toxic metals and iii source determination of contaminant elements 2 methodology 2 1 location climate and hydrogeology of the study area bangladesh is located in the north eastern region of south asia between 20 34 and 26 38 north and 88 01 and 92 41 east fig 1 the himalayas are located to the north while the bay of bengal is located to the south tripura mizoram india and myanmar lie to the east of west bengal which borders to the west bangladesh has four major river systems the brahmaputra jamuna the ganges padma the surma meghna and the chittagong region river system banglapedia 2021 bangladesh is classified as having a subtropical monsoon climate the average temperature ranges from 11 c to 20 c october to february in the winter and 21 c to 38 c march to september in the summer from june to august the area receives 1100 to 3400 mm of rain mofa 2017 the bengal delta is being developed by the holocene and recent sediments of the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm river system morgan and mcintire 1959 which encompasses the majority of bangladesh and the neighboring indian state of west bengal coleman 1969 goodbred jr and kuehl 2000 lindsay et al 1991 ravenscroft et al 2005 although older deposits of the tertiary period are rarely found in aquifers in bangladesh the majority of the country is covered with fluvio deltaic unconsolidated alluvial deposits of the quaternary period ravenscroft et al 2005 shamsudduha and uddin 2007 the coastal shallow aquifer is composed of fine to very fine sand the deep aquifer is made up of fine to medium sand with the occasional coarse sand the aquifer in the central part of bangladesh lies within a few meters to a few ten meters of the lithostratigraphic units composed of fine to medium grained dupi tila sand the madhupur and barind tracts overlay the dupi tila sediments confining the aquifer system the upper and lower parts of the aquifer lie within a few meters of each other in the ganges delta and meghna delta plains and are composed of fine to very fine sand and medium to coarse sand respectively the upper and lower aquifers in the ganges floodplain the brahmaputra floodplain the tista floodplain and the meghna floodplain are composed of fine to very fine sand and medium to coarse sand with occasional gravel ahmed et al 2004 the aquifers are classified as shallow 70 m intermediate 70 80 m and deep 180 m majumder et al 2011 in shallow aquifers groundwater moves from the northwest and north eastern areas toward the center and then south and southwest where it flows into the bay of bengal undp 1982 to the north of the delta there is a single continuous unconfined aquifer system that is gradually interlaced with discontinuous aquitard layers of varying thicknesses toward the active delta mouth thus the aquifer system is divided into confined to semiconfined poorly linked and multilayered aquifer units to the south the primary aquifer is mostly connected to the atmosphere in the delta s northern reaches but it is gradually being overlain by an increasingly thick aquitard layer to the south with a thickness of up to several tens of meters in places this aquifer deepens toward the active delta mouth progressing from up to 80 m thick in the north to over 450 m deep in the extreme south chakraborty et al 2021 this basal aquitard is characterized by multiple deep separate aquifer units that are mostly often used trap saline and brackish groundwater mukherjee et al 2007 pumping induces an increase in the vertical hydraulic gradients within the shallow groundwater flow system along with the development of local flows and recharge zones michael and voss 2009 annual potential recharge ranges from 400 to 1000 mm mpo 1987 but actual recharge is substantially lower due to aquifer full conditions developing during the monsoon season ravenscroft et al 2005 seasonally the water table rises and falls by about 4 6 m without pumping unicef 1994 the surface water bodies within the delta which include a dense network of river channels streams lakes ponds and wetlands closely interact with the groundwater system in absence of extensive groundwater irrigation the groundwater discharges to rivers under natural hydraulic gradients chakraborty et al 2021 2 2 sample collection and analysis water samples were gathered across the country to examine the quality of the water and the extent of its distribution as indicated in fig 1 this study attempted to cover the southern central and northern parts of the country in order to determine the variability of contamination status and its potential risk to human health in the southern part a total of eleven 11 sampling stations were selected as s3 daulatkhan of bhola s8 bagherpara of jessore s9 noakhali sadar s10 rupsa of khulna s11 therokhada of khulna s15 wzirpur of barisal s17 barisal sadar s19 boyra of khulna s22 bakalia of chittagong s24 kalia of narail and s25 galachipa of potuakhali eight 8 samples were collected from the industrialized areas in the central part of bangladesh which included s5 gazipur sadar s6 faridpur sadar s12 ashulia of dhaka s13 habiganj sadar s16 narayanganj sadar s20 faridpur sadar s21 daudkhandi of cumilla and s23 belabo of narsingdi in most of the sampling areas industrial effluents are discharging into the wetlands lakes canals and rivers other types of trash are disposed of in open places such as beside towns and or cities streets and within the drainage system another six 6 samples were collected from the northern part of bangladesh including s1 thakurgaon s2 sherpur of nalitabari s4 sreebardi of sherpur sadar s7 rangpur sadar s14 nandigram of bogra and s18 gomostapur of chapai nawabganj which are partially urbanized however agro farming is mostly dominating in these areas the groundwater samples were collected by pumping for 10 min using 200 ml plastic bottles prior to sampling the bottles were rinsed with the water to be sampled and the samples were preserved by acidifying them to ph 2 with hno3 and keeping them at a temperature of 4 c until analysis water temperature electrical conductivity ec and ph were recorded during the sampling each water sample was filtered with a 0 45 μm millipore filter 5 hno3 was added and diluted to a suitable concentration with deionized water for the icp ms measurement hydrochloric acid and nitric acid were ultra pure analytical grade deionized water 18mω obtained from a milli q water system millipore co was used for dilution of reagents and rinsing the laboratory ware the physicochemical parameters such as ph and ec were measured using field kits the ph measurement was performed using an accumet electrode and an accumet excel xl50 meter dual channel ph ion conductivity fisher scientific singapore the electrode was calibrated using different reference solutions with ph 4 sb101 500 ph 7 sb107 500 and ph 10 sb115 500 buffer solutions fisher scientific usa were used before taking the samples for the reading before measuring ec the ec meter was also calibrated with a reference solution to maximize the accuracy rate of values or error free measurement measurement of trace elements al cr mn fe co ni cu zn se cd th u as in water samples were carried out with icp ms model 7500a cations and anions nh4 k mg2 na ca2 f cl no3 so4 2 were measured using ic 7000 ion chromatographic analyzer yokogawa analytical system scanning was repeated three times with 100 sweeps for each run for the determination of elements multi element standard solution xstc 355 spex industries inc was used to make a calibration for icp ms measurement to guarantee the accuracy of the assessment the national institute of standards and technology standard reference material 1643e was used 2 3 statistical analysis a descriptive statistical analysis was performed to understand the overall structural pattern of the data pearson s correlation coefficient was also carried out to draw the internal relationship in water quality parameters that exhibits statistical consistency in regards to dependent and independent variables and their abundance in the aquifer level multivariate statistical analysis is a substantial technique to understand the internal dependency and or influence of any factor in the measured variables principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca are considered key statistical approaches to reduce the dimension of a data set that may significantly show the key dominant factors and their influence li et al 2019b wu et al 2019 pca analysis transforms the original variables and converts them into new uncorrelated components that show the loading score regarding objects and pc numbers pca is a helpful and well recognized technique that transforms the original variables into uncorrelated variables like principal components pcs and interrelated variables into fewer jiang et al 2018 sârbu and pop 2005 used pca to investigate the variation in the data set helena et al 2000 describes the meaningful and significant parameters with the minimum loss of original information to determine sampling adequacy pca was used in conjunction with kmo and bartlett s test a number of studies have employed pca analysis for water quality data bhuiyan et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2019 the equation is given below 1 x i l 1 i m 1 l 2 i m 2 l 3 i m 3 l ni m n where x indicates component score l denotes component loading m represents measured value of the variable i demonstrates component number and n denotes total number of variables the component loadings are classified as strong 0 75 moderate 0 75 0 50 and weak 0 50 0 30 based on their absolute values gao et al 2016 liu et al 2003 wang et al 2017 ca is also considered a substantial data reduction technique that helps to create groups among the variables based on similar characteristics based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering it is illustrated by the tree diagram dendrogram which provides the internal intuitive similarities among the samples or the whole data set mckenna jr 2003 the dendrogram explains the closeness of each group as a visual summary of the whole clustering process that helps to reduce the dimensionality of the original data set mckenna jr 2003 2 4 heavy metal pollution index heavy metal pollution index hpi techniques were used to figure out the status of water quality in terms of heavy metal contamination these methods were developed by the assigning of weightage w i to each parameter the rating was maintained within zero to one while the assigned weights were considered depending on the importance of relative water quality parameters bhuiyan et al 2016 mohan et al 1996 it is defined as the inversely proportional to standard permissible values s i of each water quality parameter horton 1965 mohan et al 1996 the concentration limits such as permissible limit values s i and maximum desirable values i i of each parameter were selected from the who standards the hpi was calculated using the following eq 2 bhuiyan et al 2016 mohan et al 1996 2 hpi i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where hpi indicates heavy pollution index q i is denotes the sub index of the i th parameters and n denotes the total number of parameters the value of the critical pollution index is 100 reza and singh 2010 bhuiyan et al 2016 the subindex q i is calculated as follows 3 q i i 1 n m i i i s i i i 100 where m i s i and i i indicates the monitored values standard values and ideal values of the i th number of water quality parameters respectively the negative symbols were used to figure out the difference between two number later ignored the algebraic sign 2 5 the degree of contamination c d the degree of contamination was calculated by the following equation which was adopted by backman et al 1998 4 c d i 1 n c fi where c fi c ai c ni 1 c fi is the contamination factor c ai denotes the analytical values and c ni denotes the permissible values of highest values of the ith parameters and n denotes the normative value the resulting c d value identifies areas of varied contamination levels which are classified as low c d 1 medium c d 1 3 and high c d 3 edet and offiong 2002 2 6 health risk assessment technique the exposure level of hazardous materials explicitly demonstrates the degree of pollution that may pose threats to living organisms bortey sam et al 2015 reported that risk assessment is a combined action of hazards and the level of exposure which is defined as the

parameters the mean value of ph and ec were observed 8 33 and 0 52 ms cm respectively the concentration range of major cations were from 10 2 mg l to 273 mg l 0 8 mg l to 14 5 mg l 1 mg l to 48 1 mg l and 2 1 mg l to 38 1 mg l for na k mg2 and ca2 respectively the annions concentrations of f cl no3 and so4 2 were observed at range from 0 03 mg l to 1 30 mg l 1 6 mg l to 227 mg l 0 05 mg l to 32 5 mg l and 0 05 mg l to 18 4 mg l respectively on the other hand the metal concentrations were found to range from 0 53 μg l to 39 μg l 8 7 μg l to 1600 μg l 1 4 μg l to 58 μg l and 3 75 ng l to 520 ng l for al fe zn and se respectively the average as concentration was 21 06 μg l almost twice the who who 2017 drinking water limit 10 μg l where the concentrations ranged from 0 09 μg l to 160 μg l the range of mn was 2 2 μg l to 880 μg l with a mean of 41 16 μg l where the highest concentration 880 μg l was found in sample s1 it was found that the concentrations of fe and as were very consistent across the southern middle and northern areas of bangladesh the findings revealed that the high concentrations of na and cl were found in groundwater samples at s9 s11 s17 and s19 in coastal areas saltwater intrusion may influence the increasing amount of na and cl in the coastal aquifer rakib et al 2020 not considerable variations were found for ca2 mg2 and k concentrations in the study area however as was found in high concentrations at s10 s21 and s24 from table 1 the concentrations of cr co ni cu and cd ranged from 0 02 μg l to 0 86 μg l 12 ng l to 350 ng l 0 1 μg l to 5 2 μg l 0 07 μg l to 29 μg l and 0 02 μg l to 0 88 μg l respectively sample s12 and s16 had relatively high concentrations of cr ni cu and cd these areas were highly influenced by industrial activities where effluents and waste materials might release metal contaminants in groundwater with time from table 1 th and u were found ranging from 1 65 ng l to 41 ng l and 0 06 μg l to 31 μg l respectively the average concentration of u was found to be 2 36 μg l in the studied samples according to who recommended values the standard concentration of u was 30 μg l while the highest concentration 31 μg l was found in the noakhali area s9 which slightly exceeded the who standard this sampling point is located at the nearest point to the southern coastal part of bangladesh it might be originated from the regional tertiary geological formations and relevant rock forming minerals turekian and wedepohl 1961 reported that a high concentration of u may derive from carbonates granites and shales 3 2 correlation coefficient matrix major cations ca2 mg2 na and k exhibited a strong correlation among some other elements table 2 most of cases cations showed a strong affinity toward anions whereas as was positively correlated with ca2 mg2 and k the strong positive correlation between na and cl r 0 784 p 01 reflected that it might occur due to saltwater intrusions in coastal aquifer in addition ni cr and cu as and fe mn and th and zn ni and cu demonstrated a positive correlation among them the high abundance of trace metals in groundwater reflected the degree of contamination and their possible sources of contaminants some of the contaminants might be caused by agricultural practices industrial activities and the aquifer s mineralogical composition furthermore strong association among different elements demonstrated their homogeneity and depositional coherence in a specific time place and source of deposition 3 3 principal component analysis pca results are shown in table 3 pc1 contains 16 50 of the total variance k mg2 ca2 no3 co and as were strong positively loaded indicating geogenic driven major ions and metalloids pc2 explain 15 56 of the total variance which was significantly positively loaded with ph ec na cl and f reflecting salinity related parameters along with fluoride dominance pc3 describes 15 26 of the total variance and had significant positive loadings for cr ni cu and zn indicating industrial pollution driven heavy metals pc4 describe 11 07 of the total variance which was strongly positively loaded with al and fe pc5 pc6 pc7 and pc8 explain 8 22 7 26 7 24 and 6 57 of the total variances respectively whereas they showed strong positive loadings for so4 2 and cd mn and th k and se and nh4 and u respectively these chemical components may originate from the natural sources pca results revealed the dominant parameters regarding pcs which reflects the possible sources of contaminants and their potentials to degrade the groundwater quality it is clear that arsenic may homogenously distributed while salinity and industrial related contaminants seems to be locally dominants in addition fluoride abundance can be associated with saltwater in the aquifers 3 4 cluster analysis the dendrogram in fig 2 explicitly divided the elements into three major clusters cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 cluster 1 was divided into three sub clusters cluster 1a cluster 1b and cluster 1c cluster 1a consists of ec na cl ph f al and fe the majority of the parameters in cluster 1a are salinity related and close together which are dominant in coastal aquifers seawater intrusions may influence salinity related parameters coastal aquifers may also be enriched with minerals containing f cluster 1b contained only nh4 and u nh4 and u showed similarities and closed together thus the dissolution of aquifer minerals could so provide nh4 and u cluster 1c consisted of cu zn ni cr so4 2 cd and se the majority of parameters in cluster 1c are heavy metals that are close together and are dominant in aquifers in industrial zones heavy metals in aquifers may come from industrial effluents contaminated rivers and lagoons in industrial areas may also heavily pollute aquifers furthermore heavy metals may accumulate in aquifers as a result of the overuse of agricultural fertilizers cluster 2 was composed of mn and th mn and th exhibited similar characteristics and closed together thus mn and th could be derived from the dissolution of aquifer minerals cluster 3 was associated with mg2 as no3 co ca2 and k thus cluster 3 contains ionic components that are close together these ionic components are known as major ions and they are abundant in the mineralogical composition of aquifers interestingly as exhibited similar properties to major ions indicating that it may be abundant in aquifers like major ions as a result cluster 3 composed components may be driven by geogenic sources cluster 2 and cluster 3 were associated with mostly geogenic components the results of ca revealed that groundwater quality parameters were grouped depending on their possible sources and distributions 3 5 heavy metal contamination table 4 showed the degree of contamination by metals samples s3 s4 s5 s7 s8 s9 s11 s14 s15 s17 s18 s19 s22 and s23 had the lowest level of contamination s2 s6 s10 and s25 had medium level of contamination and s1 s12 s13 s16 s20 s21 and s24 had the highest level of contamination the highest contamination of metals was found in 28 of the samples the medium and low contamination levels are represented by 16 and 56 of the samples respectively the areas with the highest degree of contamination risk were mostly industrial table 4 showed the analysis of hpi values according to prasad and bose 2001 the critical pollution index of hpi value for drinking water is 100 the average hpi value in this study ranged from 26 64 to 806 91 samples s1 769 06 s12 806 91 and s16 123 97 exceeded the critical limit about 12 of samples had hpi values above the critical values whereas s12 and s16 belong to industrial zones where contamination may be driven from anthropogenic sources sample s1 is located in a non industrial area where contamination may be caused by natural sources in the groundwater aquifer in addition 40 of samples had medium hpi value 3 6 human health risk the hq values for children and adults are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively for both children and adults the highest average hq sequences were as u al co mn fe cd cr ni ni cu and se the highest hq values of as were observed in s6 s8 s10 s20 s21 and s24 the maximum hq values were found at s9 s13 and s25 for u mn and al the hi values for children and adults are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively adults and children had average hi values of 2 67e 00 and 3 39e 00 respectively adults had the greatest hi values in s6 s8 s9 s10 s13 s20 s21 s24 and s25 the highest hi values for children were found in s2 s6 s8 s9 s10 s11 s13 s20 s21 s24 and s25 44 and 36 of samples for children and adults exceeded 1 respectively table 7 showed the values for carcinogenic cancer risk the typical toxic metal responsible for carcinogenic or cancer risk cr as and cd the average carcinogenic risk of as and cr in adults was 9 93e 04 and 1 95e 04 respectively and 1 26e 03 and 2 48e 04 in children for as contamination 40 of samples surpassed 1e 04 cancer risk values indicating a considerable possibility for cancer risk among groundwater users for cr contamination 48 and 68 of samples exceeded 1e 04 cancer risk values in both adults and children respectively it is obvious that the cancer risk associated with cr pollution rises with age 4 discussion according to the findings of this study three types of pollutant sources were found in groundwater in coastal and floodplain areas the average cl concentration was 45 01 mg l in this study table 1 a previous study found an average cl content of 44 9 mg l mostafa et al 2017 sharmin et al 2020 and zakir et al 2020 found the average cl concentrations in groundwater to be 21 65 mg l and 15 95 mg l respectively the cl concentration in the present study was higher than in previous studies the highest concentrations of cl were reported at s9 92 2 mg l s11 227 mg l s17 131 mg l and s19 134 mg l likewise the mean na concentration was 75 31 mg l table 1 according to zakir et al 2020 the average concentration of na in groundwater is 17 71 mg l bakali et al 2014 and sharmin et al 2020 found an average na concentration of 40 90 mg l and 28 65 mg l in groundwater respectively these previous findings were shown to be lower than the current findings s9 81 5 mg l s11 273 mg l s17 251 mg l and s19 187 mg l had the highest concentrations surprisingly high cl and na rich aquifers such as s9 s11 s17 and s19 were revealed in bangladesh near the bay of bengal in coastal aquifers seawater intrusions have increased na and cl content making the water unsafe for drinking rakib et al 2020 high saltwater consumption is linked to long term health risks chakraborty et al 2019 evaporation and over pumping harvey et al 2006 may increase salinity in groundwater water flow and rock water interaction may cause the aquifer s salinity dissolution of carbonate minerals and evaporation may be responsible for the increased salinity selvakumar et al 2022 in coastal areas waterlogging and flooding may contribute to high salt in coastal aquifers the average as concentration was found to be 21 06 μg l table 1 mostafa et al 2017 and ahmed et al 2010 have reported the average as concentration are 0 012 mg l and 0 021 mg l in groundwater respectively previous investigations revealed lower levels of as content than the present findings the sampling stations s10 160 μg l s21 130 μg l and s24 150 μg l revealed elevated as concentrations in groundwater arsenic concentrations in groundwater in a holocene unconfined aquifer was found at an alarming level in the last decade mihajlov et al 2020 arsenic can be caused by agricultural activities such as the use of fertilizer on farmland the degree of as contamination in shallow and deep aquifers may be influenced by mineralogical characteristics over pumping of groundwater may expedite more as dissolution in groundwater around 40 of sampling points were found to pose a carcinogenic or cancer risk due to as pollution both for children and adults about 24 of the samples had a high risk of chronic effects on human health due to as contamination long term exposure to arsenic poisoning through drinking water may result in chronic disorders such as keratosis hyperpigmentation cancer organ malfunction and death who 1993 who 2017 the average cr concentration was determined to be 0 15 μg l table 1 a mean groundwater cr content of 0 0015 mg l was reported by sharmin et al 2020 according to yesmeen et al 2018 the average cr concentration in groundwater is 0 008 mg l the maximum concentration of cr was reported at s16 0 86 μg l which is located in narayanganj and is considered a heavily industrialized area cr exhibited a connection with ni cu and zn cr may be transported into groundwater via industrial waste water several human induced variables e g industrial waste metal plating and mining activity may also contribute to a rise in cr concentration in groundwater zamani et al 2012 cr concentration may be increased through heavy metal waste disposal at the landfill site unplanned use of heavy metal containing chemicals and lack of proper management agricultural chemicals may accelerate the cr concentration in groundwater for cr approximately 48 and 68 of cancer risks were found in both adults and child respectively drinking a high concentration of cr contaminated water for an extended length of time may pose serious health hazards to future generations depending on the dose exposure level and duration human health risks range from skin irritation to dna damage and cancer development tumolo et al 2020 average al u and mn contents were 3 78 μg l 2 36 μg l and 41 16 μg l respectively table 1 the average u concentration in groundwater was found to be 2 5 μg l by frisbie et al 2009 seddique et al 2020 found that the u content in shallow groundwater in southeast coastal area of cox s bazar district bangladesh ranged from 0 09 to 9 57 μg l average mn content in groundwater is 18 00 μg l reported by sarker and zaman 2003 the average concentration of u was found to be slightly lower and mn was found to be higher than in prior studies at s25 s9 and s15 the highest concentrations of al u and mn were found respectively due to the earth s surface deposits mn is the most prevalent element and is frequently found in groundwater tobiason et al 2016 u may release from the surrounding rocks which can be precipitated under reducing environmental conditions dall aglio 1971 dall aglio 1971 reported that u may leach out and pass into the groundwater aquifer from uraninite in pegmatites in addition anthropogenic activities on a local scale may raise the u concentration in groundwater saikia et al 2021 al may be derived from weathering of minerals in the aquifer by the reaction of ph temperature and the concentration of organic and inorganic ligands such as sulfur fluorides sulfates phosphates and suspended particles frankowski et al 2011 al concentration can be influenced by its amphoterism and ability to transform a significant amount of al remains immobile in secondary minerals whereas a low concentration of aluminum may dissolve in groundwater due to the transformation of aluminosilicate frankowski et al 2011 this research reveals that al u and mn have a significant risk of long term effects on both children and adults chromosome abnormalities in barley meristem cells may be caused by an increase in al in drinking water momot and synzynys 2005 u has shown the binding properties of transferrin iron transport protein bicarbonate enriched red blood cells and hemoglobin ansoborlo et al 2006 it may cause nephrotoxicity in the kidneys stalder et al 2012 drinking water with a high concentration of mn over a long time may cause neurological and reproductive issues but it is unlikely to cause cancer usepa 2004 who 2011 from table 3 the pca findings revealed the variance among measured variables based on pc loadings pc1 represents the mostly geogenic parameters including k mg2 ca2 no3 co and as which are correlated with one another dolomite biotite and chlorite minerals are the primary sources of mg2 orthoclase and clay minerals are the sources of k halim et al 2011 in groundwater the weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals releases ca2 mg2 na and k which are further amplified by co2 respiration from decomposing organic matter in both the oxic and anoxic environments zheng et al 2004 datta et al 2009 reported that holocene sediment is enriched with arsenic containing minerals arsenic was most likely dissolved from the oxidation of sulfide minerals primarily pyrite originating in the himalayan granitic and metamorphic source regions anthropogenic causes such as irrigation septic tanks organic waste degradation livestock farming and residential sewage contribute to higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater adimalla and qian 2021 aguilar et al 2019 ahamad et al 2019 according to pairwise correlation ca2 was positively associated with mg2 and na and no3 was positively associated with mg2 na and k arsenic exhibited a positive correlation with mg2 na k and no3 table 2 as shown in fig 2 cluster 3 demonstrated consistent findings with pca and pairwise correlations pc2 was shown to be linked to mostly salinity related parameters table 3 including ph ec na cl and f which are considered local groundwater vulnerabilities that could occur as a result of saltwater incursions the presence of ec na and cl in high concentrations in groundwater samples suggests that saline water has interacted with groundwater the most common causes of salinity intrusion along the coastal region are climate change and rising sea levels dasgupta et al 2015 groundwater salinization can also be influenced by hydrogeochemical processes and evaporation he et al 2021 the cl concentration in the groundwater could be driven by seawater intrusion shrimp farm induced salinity and waterlogged induced salinity tds ca2 and na abundances have also been identified as potential risk factors for increased f levels in groundwater hu et al 2017 the f in groundwater is boosted by an increase in ca2 levels caused by an increase in evaporation that results in heavy precipitation of calcite li et al 2019 fluorite fluorapatite cryolite topaz montmorillonite kaolinite and vermiculite are the major fluoride bearing minerals chen et al 2017 the presence of ca2 and na in groundwater has an effect on fluoride concentration the replacement of ca2 by na thus plays an important role in groundwater fluoride chemistry edmunds and smedley 2005 chloride was found to be positively linked with ph ec na and f through pairwise correlation table 2 similar na also exhibited a positive correlation with f content with pca and pairwise correlations cluster 1a revealed consistent results as shown in fig 2 pc3 was found to be substantially linked with heavy metals including cr ni cu and zn which are also considered regional dominant factors that may occur as a result of industrial sewage or effluent discharge into groundwater some hazardous elements such as cr ni cu and zn were found in varying concentrations in various industrial sampling points zacchaeus et al 2020 cited those toxic metals from industrial effluent might degrade groundwater quality cr was found to be positively related with ni cu and zn by pairwise correlation table 2 as shown in fig 2 cluster 1c also showed a consistent result natural processes like rock weathering as well as human activities like industrial activity can enhance cr ni cu and zn in groundwater agrochemicals may contribute to groundwater accumulation of cr ni cu and zn to sum up pearson correlation pca and ca results were found to be compatible and consistent with respect to the coherence characteristics of water quality parameters based on their sources depositions and mineralogy furthermore the hpi and c d results revealed that 12 of the sample exceeds the mean hpi values with s1 s2 and s3 exhibiting higher values than the critical values 44 of the samples had a moderate to high levels of contamination with s1 s2 and s3 having the highest level of contamination the degree of pollution types of contaminants water usage pattern time and location all influence groundwater contamination and human health exposure to prevent seawater intrusions into inland areas it is critical to maintain river flow from upstream to downstream limit groundwater extraction and find a technique to improve freshwater recharge into the aquifer because of climate change induced saltwater intrusions into the coastal aquifer this is by far the most difficult problem to solve on the other hand a sustainable industrial waste or waste water management system should be introduced so that industrial contaminants cannot get into groundwater industrialized areas should be classified into several groups depending on the possible risks of hazardous waste generations and its impacts on groundwater in addition to avoid the health risk from the natural sources of groundwater contamination it would be better to make people aware of the consequences of drinking contaminated groundwater possible sources of contamination degree of contamination level and how it evolves and possible measures overall to maintain the sustainable usage of groundwater resources the government should take region wise groundwater management initiatives based on potential groundwater threats human interventions such as pollutant discharge into the aquifer should be stopped a proper groundwater monitoring system should be launched so that it can enrich groundwater quality data which can be useful for formulating data driven policy finally a holistic water resource management related awareness program should be introduced for future drinking water security and to achieve sustainable development however one of the major limitations of this study was that the number of samples was comparatively small in relation to the volume of the country because of the limitations of analytical support and funding 5 conclusions to ensure safe drinking water and good health it is essential to evaluate the elemental concentration of groundwater in the respective well the high concentration of chemical components in groundwater may pose a potential threat to human health health risk analyses were performed based on the measured chemical contents and their respective standards pearson correlation pca and ca determine the source of the contaminants in groundwater the results showed that some sampling stations had elevated concentrations of na nh4 k mg2 mn fe se u and as that exceeded doe and who water quality guidelines there was an abundance of na and cl in the groundwater of the coastal belt area while heavy metals were detected in the middle region known as the industrial zones while arsenic was abundant across the study area interestingly uranium was found along the southeastern coastline of bangladesh which was often associated with geological materials the hpi and c d data indicated the presence of heavy metal contamination with 12 and 28 of test spots exhibiting significantly high values respectively concentrations of cr were shown to be associated with a greater cancer risk in both child 68 and adults 48 than concentrations of as and cd the hq and hi results revealed the long term implications for human health values of hi larger than one were found in 36 for adults and 44 for children of the sample locations indicating a potential non carcinogenic effect on human health long term exposure to contaminated water may cause chronic ailments in many age groups of local populations the findings of the pca and ca indicated the dominant parameters and coherence properties in relation to the source composition abundance and geochemical reactions in the groundwater aquifer the major sources associated with the groundwater

1279,high nitrogen concentration of groundwater poses a threat to human health this study evaluated the potential health risk of nitrogen pollution in yinchuan plain by geostatistical analysis and triangular stochastic model considering different land use types and identified the uncertainties of the parameters 163 samples were collected from groundwater wells in different land use types the results show that the concentration of no3 n ranges from 0 059 to 450 mg l with an average of 22 439 mg l approximately 32 of the samples exceed grade iii threshold 20 mg l of n the concentration of nh4 n ranges from 0 011 to 11 mg l with an average of 0 456 mg l the concentration of no2 n ranges from 0 003 to 9 09 mg l the no3 n and nh4 n concentration in the groundwater of the unutilized land use is significantly lowest among all the land types the concentration of nitrogen is highest in farmland use the ranking of non carcinogenic risk under different land types for infants children adult males and females is farmland use residential land use unutilized land use the non carcinogenic risk value of farmland use is three times as much as that of the residential land use drinking groundwater can be potentially harmful to human health and nitrogen pollutants pose an even greater threat to infant at the same time considering the impact of different land use types on groundwater would avoid overestimating or underestimating regional risk value triangular stochastic model is more sensitive to data changes and can reduce uncertainty the contribution rate of nitrate concentration to risk is more than 83 indicating that random sampling is needed to improve the reliability of evaluation results the research results of this study will provide a new way to solve the uncertainty in groundwater security management keywords groundwater chemistry nitrogen pollution triangular fuzzy number health risk assessment uncertainty 1 introduction groundwater is usually an important source of domestic water drinking water agricultural irrigation and industrial activities in arid areas due to the shortage of precipitation and surface water li et al 2019 seltzer et al 2021 in particular groundwater quality is very vital to human health food security and socio economic development singha et al 2021 however groundwater quality has been deteriorating at a staggering rate due to the rapid development of industrialization the continuous increase of population and the acceleration of industrialization khan et al 2020 koohbanani et al 2020 inorganic nitrogen in the form of nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 in groundwater and nh4 n and no2 n concentrations are usually very low because they are easily converted to no3 n scherger et al 2021 nitrate has become one of the most widespread chemical pollutants in groundwater around the world ghalhari et al 2021 li et al 2021 and the nitrate is generated by natural processes or human activities including point septic tank domestic sewage chemical plant discharge and non point nitrogen fertilizer pesticides farm manure application atmospheric deposition etc colborne et al 2018 qasemi et al 2018 among them the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer has become the most important way of regional non point source water pollution ren et al 2021 the leaching loss of nitrate is increased by high nitrogen fertilizer rate combined with flood irrigation which can greatly deteriorate the quality of groundwater in recent decades wang and huang 2021 zhang et al 2021 nitrate contamination in groundwater is closely related to land use attributing to land use change affects the hydrological connectivity between soil and groundwater zheng and wang 2021 zhou et al 2017 several studies have shown that land use change significantly affects nitrate concentration in groundwater through altering the input mode of water and nitrogen pollutants changing the recharge source and the mechanism of unsaturated zone wilson 2015 zhang et al 2020 the impact is quantitatively estimated by the correlation between land use and nitrate concentration in groundwater li et al 2021 badeenezhad et al 2021 cendejas et al 2021 in assessing the health risk of groundwater nitrogen pollution recent studies have not taken into account the impact of land use on exposure models which can lead to overestimate or underestimate of health risks in study areas from the human health viewpoint drinking the high nitrate of groundwater can cause adverse effects on human health recent research confirms that high nitrate in drinking water have been linked to methemoglobinemia and thyroid cancer tariqi and naughton 2021 moreover many studies have shown that infants ages 1 to 6 months are more likely than other groups to develop methemoglobinemia due to their enzyme activity levels have not increased to normal level barakat et al 2020 nitrate in drinking water can cause glucose and thyroid hormone imbalances and reproductive effects in women gandarilla esparza et al 2021 thus for the safety of human health some countries and organizations have set limit on the concentration no3 n in drinking water us environmental protection agency usepa and world health organization who have set the standard limit for no3 n in drinking water at 10 and 11 3 mg l respectively more and more attention has been paid to the study of drinking water pollution and health risk assessment of nitrogen in the groundwater teng et al 2019 qasemi et al 2018 li et al 2021 human health risk assessment is an effective method to determine the risk degree of various pollutants to human health which is used to detect potential health risk from exposure to toxic pollutants in different environments tian et al 2019 li et al 2016 alidadi et al 2019 at present most studies on groundwater health risk assessment are based on the recommended model of using the us environmental protection agency usepa qasemi et al 2018 li et al 2016 tian et al 2019 however there are several sources of uncertainty and variability in the human health risk assessment process in this case the traditional risk assessment model is inevitably affected by information loss and fuzzy uncertainty risk therefore health risk assessments must take uncertainty into account in order to make the best decisions at present commonly used methods to reduce the uncertainty of evaluation results is interval method cashin et al 2021 fuzzy mathematics davoudabadi et al 2021 stochastic theory cai et al 2020 among them stochastic theory is the most widely used and combined with random triangle method it can accurately present the actual situation and provide reliable information for decision makers however few studies have used this approach to address information loss and uncertainty in health risk assessment the yinchuan plain where the groundwater is the main source of irrigation and drinking water is an artificial oasis of farmland irrigation in order to increase grain production chemical fertilizer is widely used in farmland the severe groundwater pollution in the yinchuan plain has aroused much attention chen et al 2017 2020 2021 high nitrate levels can be detected in surface water and groundwater leading to deterioration of water quality this will pose a huge potential risk to the health of the people who drink it the purpose of this study is 1 to analyze the current situation and spatial distribution of nitrogen pollution in the groundwater 2 to consider the different land use types to the potential risk of human health 3 to identify the uncertainty and sensitive parameters of the risk assessment model this study will help government policymakers improve groundwater quality and reduce human health risk in the region 2 study area 2 1 location the yinchuan plain ningxia is located in the north part of ningxia autonomous region with geographical coordinates of n 37 45 39 14 and e 105 52 106 53 it covers about one tenth of ningxia fig 1a the yellow river is the main river that flows through the yinchuan plain entering the plain from the southeast end and moving northward across the whole plain extending northward from the first ridge of shizuishan the yinchuan plain can be divided into two landforms mountain and plain in the west is helan mountain which is high stone mountain with 1500 3200 m the eastern part is plain which consists of piedmont alluvial plain alluvial flood plain and river lake plain cai et al 2020 drainage ditches and farmland are widely distributed yinchuan plain has been irrigated for more than 2000 years and the land is fertile with rice and corn yinchuan plain is 754 69 ha accounting for 58 13 of the total farmland area fig 1b the climate of the yinchuan plain belong to the temperate inland drought with the characteristics of drought and less rainfall the average precipitation and evaporation of the study area are 184 7 1748 4 mm respectively cai et al 2020 the evaporation is 10 times more than precipitation the annual average temperature is 8 92 c the highest temperature is 23 63 c in july and the lowest is 7 73 c in january there are about 3 million population in the yinchuan plain accounting for about 46 of ningxia s urban and rural populations are completely dependent on groundwater for their domestic daily needs groundwater is used in a wide variety of industries and is a reliable source of irrigation to support crop production during droughts and shortages of surface water supplies chen et al 2018 2 2 hydrogeological setting the phreatic water aquifer in the study area is mainly composed of quaternary loose rock pore water the aquifer lithology is mainly composed of fine sand and the confining bed lithology is sandy clay and clay fig s1 the groundwater level is shallow and flows from southwest to northeast as a whole the direction and conditions of groundwater runoff varies in different areas in the piedmont alluvial plain the hydraulic gradient is greater than 10 while in the alluvial plain and river lake plain areas the hydraulic gradient is only 0 5 so the runoff rate is very slow the main recharge source of groundwater is canal leakage and farmland irrigation leakage these sources account for more than 80 of groundwater recharge groundwater discharge mainly includes evaporation drainage ditch and artificial exploitation 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and testing a total of 163 wells with 15 120 m deep were selected from different land types in the study area to characterize the physical and chemical properties of groundwater in 2020 fig 1b each well should be pumped for at least 30 min prior to sampling to avoid negative effects of non fresh groundwater some in situ parameters include ph oxidation reduction potential orp temperature t and dissolved oxygen do were measured by the multi parameter water quality analyzer hach sl1000 the sample 500 ml was collected at 0 5 m below the groundwater table filtering with 0 45 μm membrane samples used for cation and trace element analysis were acidified with superior pure hno3 until ph was less than 2 all samples were stored in the refrigerator until they were sent to the laboratory for analysis the concentrations of the main cations na k ca2 and mg2 and main anions cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 were determined in a laboratory via ion chromatography with a diane ics 900 model no2 was determined by spectrophotometry no3 n and nh4 n by ion chromatography gb t 14848 2017 the analytical charge imbalance between anions and cations was less than 5 the classification of groundwater quality refers to the standard limits of five types of water in the groundwater quality standard qsgw 3 2 methods 3 2 1 groundwater health risk assessment model the us environmental protection agency defines human health risk assessment as the process of assessing the likelihood of harm to health and human exposure to chemicals in a contaminated environment there are three potential routes of exposure direct drinking of water inhalation of air and absorption through the skin since nitrogen in groundwater is non volatile and skin absorption is less than 1 1000 of drinking water intake only exposure through drinking water intake is considered in this study the dosage is expressed by the following formula chen et al 2017 tian et al 2019 wu et al 2019 1 cdi cw ir ef ed bw at where cdi is the exposure expressed as the mass of the substance exposed per unit of weight per unit of time mg kg d cw is the contamination concentration mg l ir is daily water intake l day ef is exposure frequency 365 days year ed is the duration of continuous drinking adult 30 years infant 0 6 month 0 5 years children 6 years bw is body weight kg at is averaging time for non carcinogens at 365 ed days health risk can be classified into carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk depending on toxicity nowadays there is insufficient evidence that nitrogen is carcinogenic to human health so this study only evaluates the non carcinogenic risk of nitrogen the non carcinogenic risk assessment was performed using hazard quotient hq by considering the chronic daily intake dose cdi calculated for the nitrate based on the results of chemical detection for the groundwater samples in the study areas according to usepa usepa 2011 the health risk model is as follows tian et al 2019 2 hq cdi rfd 3 hi i n hq where hq is the hazard quotient dimensionless hi is the total risk index dimensionless n is total number of contamination causing non carcinogenic dimensionless rfd is the reference dose of contamination in the groundwater mg kg day usepa 2012 when hi 1 it indicates that the non carcinogenic risk is beyond the acceptable level 3 2 2 health risk assessment based on triangular stochastic theory 1 triangular fuzzy numbers method zadeh proposed the concept of triangular fuzzy number in 1965 and the triangular fuzzy number is used to describe the problems in the environment containing uncertain or inaccurate information wu et al 2019 the membership function of triangular fuzzy number is only defined by three points a1 lower value a2 expected value and a3 upper value meanwhile the three pints are the minimum most possible and maximum values of a fuzzy variable x respectively three values are real numbers constituting triangular fuzzy number a a 1 a 2 a 3 its linear membership function is given by as follows 4 μ a x a 1 a 2 a 1 x a 1 a 2 a 3 x a 3 a 2 x a 2 a 3 0 x a 1 a 3 when μa 0 means it can t be treated as a possible value of a when μa 1 means that it completely belongs to a in general the value of a 1 a 2 and a 3 triangular fuzzy numbers are determined by mathematical statistics according to mathematical statistics more than 95 of normally distributed or nearly normally distributed data belongs to the range of x 2σ x x 2σ wu et al 2019 x is the average value and σ is the standard deviation the membership degree of triangle fuzzy number represents the relative reliability of each data in the minimum and maximum possible ranges different confidence levels α 0 1 represent different interval data in order to simplify the operation process triangular fuzzy numbers are usually converted into α cut set the higher α is the closer it is to the average value the more frequency of occurrence of the data and the confidence level is not lower than the data interval of α the α cut set can be expressed as follows wu et al 2019 5 a ɑ a l α a r α a 2 a 1 ɑ a 1 a 2 a 3 ɑ a 3 where a ɑ represents the value of fuzzy variable a under confidence level ɑ 2 stochastic simulation of triangular fuzzy number when the data accuracy is low or the quantity is small triangle fuzzy theory is used to approximate the normal distribution of parameters the existing triangular fuzzy function operation is not rigorous enough and the operation process is relatively complicated wu et al 2019 therefore by random simulation of crystal ball software decision engineering inc usa the function operation of triangular fuzzy number can be converted to real number operation thus reducing the error of the triangular fuzzy calculation process and obtaining statistical information representing the distribution characteristics of predicted parameters the selected evaluation parameters are represented by triangular fuzzy numbers f a b c where a selects the larger value between the minimum value and average 2σ of the data b selects the average value c selects the smaller value between the maximum value and average 2σ of data wu et al 2019 then crystal ball software was used to perform 50 000 random simulations of monte carlo method when the frequency distribution is astringent based on the formula 1 to 3 the health risk based on stochastic simulation of triangular fuzzy number can be obtained shown as follow formula 6 8 6 cdi cw ir ef ed bw at 7 hq cdi rfd 8 hi i n hq 3 land use determination the land use data were extracted from landsat 8 satellite images in 2020 it was provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn a buffer with a radius of 500 m around each sampling point is created by arcgis 10 7 land use types within the radius of each sampling point mainly includes farmland use residential land use and unutilized land use the area proportion of each land use type in the buffer zone was counted and the land type of the sampling site with the largest area was determined 4 statistics and geostatistical analysis to investigate the contamination distribution of major ion and nitrogen the basic statistics and the correlation matrices of principal component analysis were conducted by spss 17 0 ibm corp usa in order to effectively evaluate the health risk of nitrogen and reduce the uncertainty a health risk model based on stochastic simulation of triangular fuzzy number was established by using crystal ball software for spatial characterize enrichments of nitrogen kriging interpolation was performed by arcgis 10 7 esri usa 4 results 4 1 chemical characteristics of groundwater the chemical characteristics of groundwater are an important factor in determining suitability for human drinking agriculture and industry uses zakhem and hafez 2015 it also has important influence on studying the concentration and existence form of groundwater pollutants the physical and chemical properties of groundwater samples in the study area are shown in fig 2 the order of chemical anion and cation concentration is cl so4 2 hco3 and na mg2 ca2 k respectively each sampling point has a different vertical range which reflects the dispersion of data at the sampling points chadha diagram with four different hydrogeochemical types has been shown in fig s2 the order of main chemical types in the study area is ca mg cl na cl ca hco3 the spatial distribution of each parameter was obtained by kriging interpolation method of arcgis10 7 fig s3 through the measurement of groundwater samples collected in the field the maximum value minimum value and average value of ph are 8 88 6 84 and 7 61 respectively this shows a weakly alkaline groundwater environment at the same time ph is a small and stable indicator in addition tds is the total amount of various ions molecules and compounds dissolved in groundwater the fig 2 shows that the concentration of tds exceeds 229 mg l and the highest value is in the middle of pingluo county according to qcsc the amount of tds over grade iii water fig 3 is approximately 46 reflecting poor water quality in nearly half of the study area the major ions k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 in groundwater determine the chemical types and distribution characteristic the maximum concentration value of k is 120 mg l in the middle of pingluo county and the south of lingwu city in general na has a wide range of concentrations and is the dominant ion among cations the concentration value of na in the middle of pingluo county and the east of helan county is the highest with 5996 mg l ca2 in more than 50 of the samples was over 170 mg l and the maximum value reaches 1003 mg l the maximum value of mg appears in the east of helan county reaching 1630 mg l the spatial distribution variability of mg and ca2 is basically consistent the chemical composition of groundwater in the study area may be mainly controlled by water rock interaction such as dissolution of carbonate and gypsum calcite precipitation chen et al 2017 2020 the spatial distributions of the high values of cl and so4 2 in the study area are the same in the middle of pingluo county and the south of helan county however the so4 2 over the grade iii water higher than cl hco3 is the least concentration value of the anions 60 of the areas exceeded 352 mg l hco3 is inconsistent with the high values of the anions and appears in the eastern part of pingluo county the concentration of main anion and tds increases gradually along the direction of groundwater flow 4 2 groundwater nitrogen pollution circumstance 4 2 1 groundwater nitrogen content the order of nitrogen concentration in the study area is no3 n nh4 n and no2 n fig 3 shows the classification results of no3 n nh4 n and no2 n the concentration of nh4 n ranges from 0 011 to 11 mg l with an average of 0 456 mg l as for nh4 n about 34 of the samples exceed grade iii the concentration of no2 n ranges from 0 003 to 9 09 mg l with an average of 0 115 mg l and 17 of the samples exceed grade iii the concentration of no3 n ranges from 0 059 to 450 mg l with an average of 22 439 mg l approximately 32 of the samples exceed grade iii the groundwater with high no3 n concentration is classified as ca mg cl fig s2 principal component analysis obtains correlation matrices between variables in different land types table s1 considering all of the mentioned variables the correlation coefficient r2 of significance is defined as 0 5 zakhem and hafez 2015 thus all variable coefficients greater than it have been considered and highlighted in table s1 for farmland use it could be seen that no3 n is positively correlated with cl r2 0 484 so4 2 r2 0 464 ca2 r2 0 418 the significant positive correlation between no3 n and cl indicates effects of manure application in agricultural production nakagawa et al 2016 the positive correlation between no3 n and so4 2 is found which may reflect application of the n fertilizer such as nh4 2so4 babiker et al 2004 babiker et al 2004 reported that the positive correlation between no3 n and ca2 no3 n and mg2 suggest that the application of chemical fertilizer such as caco3 and mgco3 in agricultural production for residential land use it could be seen that no3 n is positively correlated with cl r2 0 422 so4 2 r2 0 405 mishima et al 2017 reported that livestock waste contains cl and nutrients such as n p and k the significant positive correlation between no3 n and cl indicates effects of livestock waste discharge nakagawa et al 2016 the positive correlation between no3 n and so4 2 is found which may reveal the potential pollutants derived from domestic sewage discharge fabro et al 2015 in addition there is a negative correlation between no3 n and hco3 r2 0 250 r2 0 363 in farmland use and residential land use indicating that groundwater denitrification is caused jalali 2011 for unutilized land use it could be seen that no3 n is negatively correlated with so4 2 r2 0 213 cl r2 0 147 obviously the source of nitrogen of groundwater in unutilized land use is different that of farmland use and residential land use it may be that the surrounding groundwater with high nitrate nitrogen has been polluted by human activities such as fertilization or domestic sewage with the flow of groundwater nitrate nitrogen migrates to the groundwater of unutilized land use under the farmland use residential land use and unutilized land use the positive correlation coefficients between no3 n and orp are 0 568 0 497 and 0 508 respectively the positive correlation between no3 n and orp which indicates oxidation environment is favorable to generate no3 n feng et al 2020 4 2 2 spatial distribution of groundwater nitrogen according to the horizontal space diagram of nitrogen fig 4 the distribution of high and low values of three nitrogen are different the high value area of no3 n is in dawukou district huinong district and pingluo country on the one hand the soil with constituents of the sand and gravel in the high value area have large porosity on the other hand the depth of groundwater in this area is about 2 0 m the soil with large porosity has caused the faster transfer of nitrate contaminants from the surface to the deeper soil layer in addition the higher dissolved oxygen in groundwater inhibits denitrification and provides favorable conditions for nitrification the high value area of no2 n is in xingqing district where the soil with constituents of caly has small porosity even if the depth of groundwater in this area is about 1 5 m there is not enough dissolved oxygen and further nitrification occurs to generate no2 n the high value area of nh4 n is in north of pingluo county nitrogen characteristics of groundwater in vertical depth are shown in fig 5 the groundwater depth has obvious influence on no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations in groundwater with the increase of groundwater depth no3 n and no2 n concentrations decrease and nh4 n concentrations increase 4 3 health risk assessment based on triangular stochastic models for different land use types and crowds under different land use types the living habits of residents are very different and the exposure routes of pollutants are also different adams and kanaroglou 2016 liu et al 2021 water samples in the study area are mainly concentrated in farmland use residential land use and unutilized land use the crowds are divided into different groups adult males adult females children and infants by sex and age based on the pollutant exposure model established by usepa the probability risk of groundwater nitrogen pollution of three main land use types and four crowds is evaluated 4 3 1 the results were evaluated by triangular fuzzy method the weight data of residents table s2 are from national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2003 the weight triangle fuzzy number is obtained by fuzzy processing the weight data reference dose assessment model for drinking water exposure to health risks refer to usepa standard usepa u s environmental protection agency 2012 rfdno3 n 1 6 mg kg day rfdno2 n 0 1 mg kg day and rfdnh4 n 0 9 mg kg day the exposure parameters of infants ir 0 07 0 3 0 76 and bw 5 7 9 children 8 months 17 years ir 1 0 1 2 1 4 and bw 9 24 55 adults 18 years ir 1 4 2 0 2 6 bw female 44 58 72 and bw male 53 62 70 tian et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the data types of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n pollutant concentrations under different land use types are treated with fuzzy processing and the processing results are shown in table 1 for different memberships α 0 1 interval values belonging to different membership values can be calculated when α 0 represents the high and low limit of the possible risk value α 1 represents the most possible risk a high confidence level α 0 8 is used to evaluate health risks in this study the membership curve of non carcinogenic risk of nitrogen pollution is shown in fig 6 the risk range for infants children adult males and females under different land use types is as follows farmland use residential land use unutilized land use the risk of unutilized land use hi 1 for different crowds is acceptable for farmland use the reverse are the case the risk of farmland use is unacceptable to different crowds for residential land use non carcinogenic risk of nitrogen pollution only for infant is unacceptable the risk of unutilized land use hi 1 for different crowds is acceptable moreover the total risk of infants is greater than both children and adults and groundwater is more likely to have an impact on infants health it may be that infant drink more water relative to their body weight than other age group in the infant age group the immune digestive and nervous systems are growing which makes them more vulnerable than other age group alidadi et al 2019 it can be seen from fig 6 that the maximum and minimum concentrations of nitrogen pollutants fluctuate greatly indicating that the evaluation results have great uncertainties among them infants have the strongest fuzziness the most significant impact of uncertainty and the most sensitive to data changes as membership decreases the upper and lower risk of non carcinogenic increase which is a fuzzy data increase 4 3 2 evaluation results of triangular stochastic model according to the method of triangular random simulation using the monte carlo module in oracle crystal ball as a platform after 50 000 random simulations the result met the accuracy of 0 001 and the simulation results converge see table 2 the farmland use has the highest non carcinogenic risk to all the crowds with the minimum and maximum of average is 2 31 to 3 92 moreover the non carcinogenic risk values are above the security level the second is residential land use with the minimum and maximum of average is 0 78 to 1 32 the value of non carcinogenic risk for farmland use is three times as much as that of residential land use only the value of non carcinogenic risk for infant and children are above the security level both the groundwater in farmland use and residential land use can be potentially harmful to human health and nitrogen pollutants pose an even greater threat to infant the area of residential land use is at high risk of non carcinogenic nitrogen to humans as domestic sewage infiltrates into groundwater for farmland use a large amount of chemical fertilizers were used and nitrogen fertilizer infiltrated into groundwater through irrigation water resulting in high nitrogen levels and affecting human health for residential land use livestock waste and domestic sewage discharge caused high nitrogen concentration in groundwater the evaluation result of the triangle stochastic model is close to that of the triangle fuzzy number which indicates that the simulation result is reasonable 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty analysis the maximum and minimum health risk varies greatly depending on pollutant concentrations and evaluation parameters risk assessment is accompanied by uncertainty ignoring uncertainty would lead manager to make wrong decisions dong et al 2015 analyzing uncertainties in human health risk assessment on public health is a key issue li et al 2018 the sources of uncertainty in this study are as follows firstly the usepa s recommendation values are not necessarily suitable for chinese so there is inevitably uncertainty in the selection for example rfd and et are derived directly from the reference values given by usepa according to the national conditions of the united states secondly some errors may inevitably exist in the process of collecting water samples and measuring nitrogen concentration in the field thus causing certain deviations in the accuracy of data results li et al 2016 and then the greater uncertainty lies in the distribution of nitrogen concentration over time the results of the health risk assessment assume that future concentrations will be the same as present s finally this study only considered drinking water as the main intake channel not excluding food mainly organic nitrogen and skin contact intake the range of evaluation results of triangular random simulation is larger than that of triangular fuzzy method for example the interval value of residential land use for infant evaluation results obtained by triangular fuzzy method is 0 4 957 nevertheless under the same land use triangular random simulation evaluation of the infants is 0 04 7 240 this indicates that the results obtained by triangular random simulation evaluation are more sensitive to data changes the operation between fuzzy trigonometric numbers and functions is transformed into the operation among of ordinary real numbers by monte carlo method which can reduce the uncertainty in the calculation process of triangular fuzzy number chatzivasileiadis et al 2019 5 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis refers to finding out the factors that have important influence on evaluation results monte carlo sensitivity analysis method can consider the changes of different parameters and accurately reflect the impact of each parameter on the evaluation result wu et al 2019 badeenezhad et al 2021 mohammadpour et al 2022 based on oracle crystal ball platform this study used monte carlo random sampling statistical analysis method to conduct sensitivity analysis considering contaminant concentration and parameters i e drinking water consumption and body weight the results show that the sensitivity of each parameter to the non carcinogenic risk is different and the contribution rate of nitrate nitrogen to the total non carcinogenic risk is more than 83 indicating that nitrate nitrogen concentration is the principal factor of the total non carcinogenic risk in other words by reducing the contaminant concentration the non carcinogenic risk also reduces and then body weight is the secondary factor in another study conducted in india the most important sensitivity parameters of heavy metal concentration and water intake were reported in non carcinogenic risk assessment result mishra et al 2021 however the sensitivity of ammonia nitrogen to the total non carcinogenic of risk is extremely low 6 conclusions the nitrogen pollution in groundwater and its effect on residents health have been investigated by using statistics and correlation analysis in yinchuan plain the following conclusions can be summarized as follow 1 analysis of the general characteristics of groundwater chemistry in the study area shows that ph ranges from 6 84 to 8 88 with an average value of 7 61 suggesting a weakly alkaline groundwater environment the order of ation and cation concentration are cl so4 2 hco3 and na mg2 ca2 k respectively chadha diagram indicates ca mg cl type being the dominated water type 2 the spatial distribution map of no3 n nh4 n and no2 n shows significant spatial difference in no3 n distribution with an average value of 22 439 mg l and about 32 of the samples exceeded the grade iii 20 mg l of n according to china s standard the higher values are mainly distributed in northwest including dawukou district huinong district and pingluo country with the maximum value of 449 mg l which indicates higher pollution potential 3 the no3 n nh4 n and no2 n concentration in the groundwater of the unutilized land use is significantly lowest among all the land use types the results of principal component analysis show that the positive correlation between no3 n and cl so4 2 and ca2 determining that the high no3 n concentration of groundwater in the study area could be attributed to human activities including the excessive use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture the application of manure and domestic sewage 4 infants are the most vulnerable groups to nitrate contaminants exposure through drinking the ranking of non carcinogenic risk under different land types for infants children adult males and females is farmland use residential land use unutilized land use for all the crowds non carcinogenic risk value of unutilized land use is less than 1 acceptable however the non carcinogenic risks of farmland use are much higher than the safety threshold value of 1 unacceptable the contribution rate of nitrate nitrogen to the total non carcinogenic risk is more than 83 it should be noted that there are uncertainties in the health risk assessment results such as temporal and spatial distribution of nitrogen exposure route and parameter selection for the sustainable agricultural and economic development of the region attention should be paid to raising the awareness of farmers and local residents on pollution control governments should take immediate action to remove contaminants from drinking water as soon as the concentration and health risks of pollutants in groundwater exceed levels that are acceptable for drinking this study will focus decision makers attention on how to use fertilizers more effectively in agriculture

nh4 n ranges from 0 011 to 11 mg l with an average of 0 456 mg l the concentration of no2 n ranges from 0 003 to 9 09 mg l the no3 n and nh4 n concentration in the groundwater of the unutilized land use is significantly lowest among all the land types the concentration of nitrogen is highest in farmland use the ranking of non carcinogenic risk under different land types for infants children adult males and females is farmland use residential land use unutilized land use the non carcinogenic risk value of farmland use is three times as much as that of the residential land use drinking groundwater can be potentially harmful to human health and nitrogen pollutants pose an even greater threat to infant at the same time considering the impact of different land use types on groundwater would avoid overestimating or underestimating regional risk value triangular stochastic model is more sensitive to data changes and can reduce uncertainty the contribution rate of nitrate concentration to risk is more than 83 indicating that random sampling is needed to improve the reliability of evaluation results the research results of this study will provide a new way to solve the uncertainty in groundwater security management keywords groundwater chemistry nitrogen pollution triangular fuzzy number health risk assessment uncertainty 1 introduction groundwater is usually an important source of domestic water drinking water agricultural irrigation and industrial activities in arid areas due to the shortage of precipitation and surface water li et al 2019 seltzer et al 2021 in particular groundwater quality is very vital to human health food security and socio economic development singha et al 2021 however groundwater quality has been deteriorating at a staggering rate due to the rapid development of industrialization the continuous increase of population and the acceleration of industrialization khan et al 2020 koohbanani et al 2020 inorganic nitrogen in the form of nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 in groundwater and nh4 n and no2 n concentrations are usually very low because they are easily converted to no3 n scherger et al 2021 nitrate has become one of the most widespread chemical pollutants in groundwater around the world ghalhari et al 2021 li et al 2021 and the nitrate is generated by natural processes or human activities including point septic tank domestic sewage chemical plant discharge and non point nitrogen fertilizer pesticides farm manure application atmospheric deposition etc colborne et al 2018 qasemi et al 2018 among them the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer has become the most important way of regional non point source water pollution ren et al 2021 the leaching loss of nitrate is increased by high nitrogen fertilizer rate combined with flood irrigation which can greatly deteriorate the quality of groundwater in recent decades wang and huang 2021 zhang et al 2021 nitrate contamination in groundwater is closely related to land use attributing to land use change affects the hydrological connectivity between soil and groundwater zheng and wang 2021 zhou et al 2017 several studies have shown that land use change significantly affects nitrate concentration in groundwater through altering the input mode of water and nitrogen pollutants changing the recharge source and the mechanism of unsaturated zone wilson 2015 zhang et al 2020 the impact is quantitatively estimated by the correlation between land use and nitrate concentration in groundwater li et al 2021 badeenezhad et al 2021 cendejas et al 2021 in assessing the health risk of groundwater nitrogen pollution recent studies have not taken into account the impact of land use on exposure models which can lead to overestimate or underestimate of health risks in study areas from the human health viewpoint drinking the high nitrate of groundwater can cause adverse effects on human health recent research confirms that high nitrate in drinking water have been linked to methemoglobinemia and thyroid cancer tariqi and naughton 2021 moreover many studies have shown that infants ages 1 to 6 months are more likely than other groups to develop methemoglobinemia due to their enzyme activity levels have not increased to normal level barakat et al 2020 nitrate in drinking water can cause glucose and thyroid hormone imbalances and reproductive effects in women gandarilla esparza et al 2021 thus for the safety of human health some countries and organizations have set limit on the concentration no3 n in drinking water us environmental protection agency usepa and world health organization who have set the standard limit for no3 n in drinking water at 10 and 11 3 mg l respectively more and more attention has been paid to the study of drinking water pollution and health risk assessment of nitrogen in the groundwater teng et al 2019 qasemi et al 2018 li et al 2021 human health risk assessment is an effective method to determine the risk degree of various pollutants to human health which is used to detect potential health risk from exposure to toxic pollutants in different environments tian et al 2019 li et al 2016 alidadi et al 2019 at present most studies on groundwater health risk assessment are based on the recommended model of using the us environmental protection agency usepa qasemi et al 2018 li et al 2016 tian et al 2019 however there are several sources of uncertainty and variability in the human health risk assessment process in this case the traditional risk assessment model is inevitably affected by information loss and fuzzy uncertainty risk therefore health risk assessments must take uncertainty into account in order to make the best decisions at present commonly used methods to reduce the uncertainty of evaluation results is interval method cashin et al 2021 fuzzy mathematics davoudabadi et al 2021 stochastic theory cai et al 2020 among them stochastic theory is the most widely used and combined with random triangle method it can accurately present the actual situation and provide reliable information for decision makers however few studies have used this approach to address information loss and uncertainty in health risk assessment the yinchuan plain where the groundwater is the main source of irrigation and drinking water is an artificial oasis of farmland irrigation in order to increase grain production chemical fertilizer is widely used in farmland the severe groundwater pollution in the yinchuan plain has aroused much attention chen et al 2017 2020 2021 high nitrate levels can be detected in surface water and groundwater leading to deterioration of water quality this will pose a huge potential risk to the health of the people who drink it the purpose of this study is 1 to analyze the current situation and spatial distribution of nitrogen pollution in the groundwater 2 to consider the different land use types to the potential risk of human health 3 to identify the uncertainty and sensitive parameters of the risk assessment model this study will help government policymakers improve groundwater quality and reduce human health risk in the region 2 study area 2 1 location the yinchuan plain ningxia is located in the north part of ningxia autonomous region with geographical coordinates of n 37 45 39 14 and e 105 52 106 53 it covers about one tenth of ningxia fig 1a the yellow river is the main river that flows through the yinchuan plain entering the plain from the southeast end and moving northward across the whole plain extending northward from the first ridge of shizuishan the yinchuan plain can be divided into two landforms mountain and plain in the west is helan mountain which is high stone mountain with 1500 3200 m the eastern part is plain which consists of piedmont alluvial plain alluvial flood plain and river lake plain cai et al 2020 drainage ditches and farmland are widely distributed yinchuan plain has been irrigated for more than 2000 years and the land is fertile with rice and corn yinchuan plain is 754 69 ha accounting for 58 13 of the total farmland area fig 1b the climate of the yinchuan plain belong to the temperate inland drought with the characteristics of drought and less rainfall the average precipitation and evaporation of the study area are 184 7 1748 4 mm respectively cai et al 2020 the evaporation is 10 times more than precipitation the annual average temperature is 8 92 c the highest temperature is 23 63 c in july and the lowest is 7 73 c in january there are about 3 million population in the yinchuan plain accounting for about 46 of ningxia s urban and rural populations are completely dependent on groundwater for their domestic daily needs groundwater is used in a wide variety of industries and is a reliable source of irrigation to support crop production during droughts and shortages of surface water supplies chen et al 2018 2 2 hydrogeological setting the phreatic water aquifer in the study area is mainly composed of quaternary loose rock pore water the aquifer lithology is mainly composed of fine sand and the confining bed lithology is sandy clay and clay fig s1 the groundwater level is shallow and flows from southwest to northeast as a whole the direction and conditions of groundwater runoff varies in different areas in the piedmont alluvial plain the hydraulic gradient is greater than 10 while in the alluvial plain and river lake plain areas the hydraulic gradient is only 0 5 so the runoff rate is very slow the main recharge source of groundwater is canal leakage and farmland irrigation leakage these sources account for more than 80 of groundwater recharge groundwater discharge mainly includes evaporation drainage ditch and artificial exploitation 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and testing a total of 163 wells with 15 120 m deep were selected from different land types in the study area to characterize the physical and chemical properties of groundwater in 2020 fig 1b each well should be pumped for at least 30 min prior to sampling to avoid negative effects of non fresh groundwater some in situ parameters include ph oxidation reduction potential orp temperature t and dissolved oxygen do were measured by the multi parameter water quality analyzer hach sl1000 the sample 500 ml was collected at 0 5 m below the groundwater table filtering with 0 45 μm membrane samples used for cation and trace element analysis were acidified with superior pure hno3 until ph was less than 2 all samples were stored in the refrigerator until they were sent to the laboratory for analysis the concentrations of the main cations na k ca2 and mg2 and main anions cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 were determined in a laboratory via ion chromatography with a diane ics 900 model no2 was determined by spectrophotometry no3 n and nh4 n by ion chromatography gb t 14848 2017 the analytical charge imbalance between anions and cations was less than 5 the classification of groundwater quality refers to the standard limits of five types of water in the groundwater quality standard qsgw 3 2 methods 3 2 1 groundwater health risk assessment model the us environmental protection agency defines human health risk assessment as the process of assessing the likelihood of harm to health and human exposure to chemicals in a contaminated environment there are three potential routes of exposure direct drinking of water inhalation of air and absorption through the skin since nitrogen in groundwater is non volatile and skin absorption is less than 1 1000 of drinking water intake only exposure through drinking water intake is considered in this study the dosage is expressed by the following formula chen et al 2017 tian et al 2019 wu et al 2019 1 cdi cw ir ef ed bw at where cdi is the exposure expressed as the mass of the substance exposed per unit of weight per unit of time mg kg d cw is the contamination concentration mg l ir is daily water intake l day ef is exposure frequency 365 days year ed is the duration of continuous drinking adult 30 years infant 0 6 month 0 5 years children 6 years bw is body weight kg at is averaging time for non carcinogens at 365 ed days health risk can be classified into carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk depending on toxicity nowadays there is insufficient evidence that nitrogen is carcinogenic to human health so this study only evaluates the non carcinogenic risk of nitrogen the non carcinogenic risk assessment was performed using hazard quotient hq by considering the chronic daily intake dose cdi calculated for the nitrate based on the results of chemical detection for the groundwater samples in the study areas according to usepa usepa 2011 the health risk model is as follows tian et al 2019 2 hq cdi rfd 3 hi i n hq where hq is the hazard quotient dimensionless hi is the total risk index dimensionless n is total number of contamination causing non carcinogenic dimensionless rfd is the reference dose of contamination in the groundwater mg kg day usepa 2012 when hi 1 it indicates that the non carcinogenic risk is beyond the acceptable level 3 2 2 health risk assessment based on triangular stochastic theory 1 triangular fuzzy numbers method zadeh proposed the concept of triangular fuzzy number in 1965 and the triangular fuzzy number is used to describe the problems in the environment containing uncertain or inaccurate information wu et al 2019 the membership function of triangular fuzzy number is only defined by three points a1 lower value a2 expected value and a3 upper value meanwhile the three pints are the minimum most possible and maximum values of a fuzzy variable x respectively three values are real numbers constituting triangular fuzzy number a a 1 a 2 a 3 its linear membership function is given by as follows 4 μ a x a 1 a 2 a 1 x a 1 a 2 a 3 x a 3 a 2 x a 2 a 3 0 x a 1 a 3 when μa 0 means it can t be treated as a possible value of a when μa 1 means that it completely belongs to a in general the value of a 1 a 2 and a 3 triangular fuzzy numbers are determined by mathematical statistics according to mathematical statistics more than 95 of normally distributed or nearly normally distributed data belongs to the range of x 2σ x x 2σ wu et al 2019 x is the average value and σ is the standard deviation the membership degree of triangle fuzzy number represents the relative reliability of each data in the minimum and maximum possible ranges different confidence levels α 0 1 represent different interval data in order to simplify the operation process triangular fuzzy numbers are usually converted into α cut set the higher α is the closer it is to the average value the more frequency of occurrence of the data and the confidence level is not lower than the data interval of α the α cut set can be expressed as follows wu et al 2019 5 a ɑ a l α a r α a 2 a 1 ɑ a 1 a 2 a 3 ɑ a 3 where a ɑ represents the value of fuzzy variable a under confidence level ɑ 2 stochastic simulation of triangular fuzzy number when the data accuracy is low or the quantity is small triangle fuzzy theory is used to approximate the normal distribution of parameters the existing triangular fuzzy function operation is not rigorous enough and the operation process is relatively complicated wu et al 2019 therefore by random simulation of crystal ball software decision engineering inc usa the function operation of triangular fuzzy number can be converted to real number operation thus reducing the error of the triangular fuzzy calculation process and obtaining statistical information representing the distribution characteristics of predicted parameters the selected evaluation parameters are represented by triangular fuzzy numbers f a b c where a selects the larger value between the minimum value and average 2σ of the data b selects the average value c selects the smaller value between the maximum value and average 2σ of data wu et al 2019 then crystal ball software was used to perform 50 000 random simulations of monte carlo method when the frequency distribution is astringent based on the formula 1 to 3 the health risk based on stochastic simulation of triangular fuzzy number can be obtained shown as follow formula 6 8 6 cdi cw ir ef ed bw at 7 hq cdi rfd 8 hi i n hq 3 land use determination the land use data were extracted from landsat 8 satellite images in 2020 it was provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn a buffer with a radius of 500 m around each sampling point is created by arcgis 10 7 land use types within the radius of each sampling point mainly includes farmland use residential land use and unutilized land use the area proportion of each land use type in the buffer zone was counted and the land type of the sampling site with the largest area was determined 4 statistics and geostatistical analysis to investigate the contamination distribution of major ion and nitrogen the basic statistics and the correlation matrices of principal component analysis were conducted by spss 17 0 ibm corp usa in order to effectively evaluate the health risk of nitrogen and reduce the uncertainty a health risk model based on stochastic simulation of triangular fuzzy number was established by using crystal ball software for spatial characterize enrichments of nitrogen kriging interpolation was performed by arcgis 10 7 esri usa 4 results 4 1 chemical characteristics of groundwater the chemical characteristics of groundwater are an important factor in determining suitability for human drinking agriculture and industry uses zakhem and hafez 2015 it also has important influence on studying the concentration and existence form of groundwater pollutants the physical and chemical properties of groundwater samples in the study area are shown in fig 2 the order of chemical anion and cation concentration is cl so4 2 hco3 and na mg2 ca2 k respectively each sampling point has a different vertical range which reflects the dispersion of data at the sampling points chadha diagram with four different hydrogeochemical types has been shown in fig s2 the order of main chemical types in the study area is ca mg cl na cl ca hco3 the spatial distribution of each parameter was obtained by kriging interpolation method of arcgis10 7 fig s3 through the measurement of groundwater samples collected in the field the maximum value minimum value and average value of ph are 8 88 6 84 and 7 61 respectively this shows a weakly alkaline groundwater environment at the same time ph is a small and stable indicator in addition tds is the total amount of various ions molecules and compounds dissolved in groundwater the fig 2 shows that the concentration of tds exceeds 229 mg l and the highest value is in the middle of pingluo county according to qcsc the amount of tds over grade iii water fig 3 is approximately 46 reflecting poor water quality in nearly half of the study area the major ions k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 in groundwater determine the chemical types and distribution characteristic the maximum concentration value of k is 120 mg l in the middle of pingluo county and the south of lingwu city in general na has a wide range of concentrations and is the dominant ion among cations the concentration value of na in the middle of pingluo county and the east of helan county is the highest with 5996 mg l ca2 in more than 50 of the samples was over 170 mg l and the maximum value reaches 1003 mg l the maximum value of mg appears in the east of helan county reaching 1630 mg l the spatial distribution variability of mg and ca2 is basically consistent the chemical composition of groundwater in the study area may be mainly controlled by water rock interaction such as dissolution of carbonate and gypsum calcite precipitation chen et al 2017 2020 the spatial distributions of the high values of cl and so4 2 in the study area are the same in the middle of pingluo county and the south of helan county however the so4 2 over the grade iii water higher than cl hco3 is the least concentration value of the anions 60 of the areas exceeded 352 mg l hco3 is inconsistent with the high values of the anions and appears in the eastern part of pingluo county the concentration of main anion and tds increases gradually along the direction of groundwater flow 4 2 groundwater nitrogen pollution circumstance 4 2 1 groundwater nitrogen content the order of nitrogen concentration in the study area is no3 n nh4 n and no2 n fig 3 shows the classification results of no3 n nh4 n and no2 n the concentration of nh4 n ranges from 0 011 to 11 mg l with an average of 0 456 mg l as for nh4 n about 34 of the samples exceed grade iii the concentration of no2 n ranges from 0 003 to 9 09 mg l with an average of 0 115 mg l and 17 of the samples exceed grade iii the concentration of no3 n ranges from 0 059 to 450 mg l with an average of 22 439 mg l approximately 32 of the samples exceed grade iii the groundwater with high no3 n concentration is classified as ca mg cl fig s2 principal component analysis obtains correlation matrices between variables in different land types table s1 considering all of the mentioned variables the correlation coefficient r2 of significance is defined as 0 5 zakhem and hafez 2015 thus all variable coefficients greater than it have been considered and highlighted in table s1 for farmland use it could be seen that no3 n is positively correlated with cl r2 0 484 so4 2 r2 0 464 ca2 r2 0 418 the significant positive correlation between no3 n and cl indicates effects of manure application in agricultural production nakagawa et al 2016 the positive correlation between no3 n and so4 2 is found which may reflect application of the n fertilizer such as nh4 2so4 babiker et al 2004 babiker et al 2004 reported that the positive correlation between no3 n and ca2 no3 n and mg2 suggest that the application of chemical fertilizer such as caco3 and mgco3 in agricultural production for residential land use it could be seen that no3 n is positively correlated with cl r2 0 422 so4 2 r2 0 405 mishima et al 2017 reported that livestock waste contains cl and nutrients such as n p and k the significant positive correlation between no3 n and cl indicates effects of livestock waste discharge nakagawa et al 2016 the positive correlation between no3 n and so4 2 is found which may reveal the potential pollutants derived from domestic sewage discharge fabro et al 2015 in addition there is a negative correlation between no3 n and hco3 r2 0 250 r2 0 363 in farmland use and residential land use indicating that groundwater denitrification is caused jalali 2011 for unutilized land use it could be seen that no3 n is negatively correlated with so4 2 r2 0 213 cl r2 0 147 obviously the source of nitrogen of groundwater in unutilized land use is different that of farmland use and residential land use it may be that the surrounding groundwater with high nitrate nitrogen has been polluted by human activities such as fertilization or domestic sewage with the flow of groundwater nitrate nitrogen migrates to the groundwater of unutilized land use under the farmland use residential land use and unutilized land use the positive correlation coefficients between no3 n and orp are 0 568 0 497 and 0 508 respectively the positive correlation between no3 n and orp which indicates oxidation environment is favorable to generate no3 n feng et al 2020 4 2 2 spatial distribution of groundwater nitrogen according to the horizontal space diagram of nitrogen fig 4 the distribution of high and low values of three nitrogen are different the high value area of no3 n is in dawukou district huinong district and pingluo country on the one hand the soil with constituents of the sand and gravel in the high value area have large porosity on the other hand the depth of groundwater in this area is about 2 0 m the soil with large porosity has caused the faster transfer of nitrate contaminants from the surface to the deeper soil layer in addition the higher dissolved oxygen in groundwater inhibits denitrification and provides favorable conditions for nitrification the high value area of no2 n is in xingqing district where the soil with constituents of caly has small porosity even if the depth of groundwater in this area is about 1 5 m there is not enough dissolved oxygen and further nitrification occurs to generate no2 n the high value area of nh4 n is in north of pingluo county nitrogen characteristics of groundwater in vertical depth are shown in fig 5 the groundwater depth has obvious influence on no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations in groundwater with the increase of groundwater depth no3 n and no2 n concentrations decrease and nh4 n concentrations increase 4 3 health risk assessment based on triangular stochastic models for different land use types and crowds under different land use types the living habits of residents are very different and the exposure routes of pollutants are also different adams and kanaroglou 2016 liu et al 2021 water samples in the study area are mainly concentrated in farmland use residential land use and unutilized land use the crowds are divided into different groups adult males adult females children and infants by sex and age based on the pollutant exposure model established by usepa the probability risk of groundwater nitrogen pollution of three main land use types and four crowds is evaluated 4 3 1 the results were evaluated by triangular fuzzy method the weight data of residents table s2 are from national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2003 the weight triangle fuzzy number is obtained by fuzzy processing the weight data reference dose assessment model for drinking water exposure to health risks refer to usepa standard usepa u s environmental protection agency 2012 rfdno3 n 1 6 mg kg day rfdno2 n 0 1 mg kg day and rfdnh4 n 0 9 mg kg day the exposure parameters of infants ir 0 07 0 3 0 76 and bw 5 7 9 children 8 months 17 years ir 1 0 1 2 1 4 and bw 9 24 55 adults 18 years ir 1 4 2 0 2 6 bw female 44 58 72 and bw male 53 62 70 tian et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the data types of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n pollutant concentrations under different land use types are treated with fuzzy processing and the processing results are shown in table 1 for different memberships α 0 1 interval values belonging to different membership values can be calculated when α 0 represents the high and low limit of the possible risk value α 1 represents the most possible risk a high confidence level α 0 8 is used to evaluate health risks in this study the membership curve of non carcinogenic risk of nitrogen pollution is shown in fig 6 the risk range for infants children adult males and females under different land use types is as follows farmland use residential land use unutilized land use the risk of unutilized land use hi 1 for different crowds is acceptable for farmland use the reverse are the case the risk of farmland use is unacceptable to different crowds for residential land use non carcinogenic risk of nitrogen pollution only for infant is unacceptable the risk of unutilized land use hi 1 for different crowds is acceptable moreover the total risk of infants is greater than both children and adults and groundwater is more likely to have an impact on infants health it may be that infant drink more water relative to their body weight than other age group in the infant age group the immune digestive and nervous systems are growing which makes them more vulnerable than other age group alidadi et al 2019 it can be seen from fig 6 that the maximum and minimum concentrations of nitrogen pollutants fluctuate greatly indicating that the evaluation results have great uncertainties among them infants have the strongest fuzziness the most significant impact of uncertainty and the most sensitive to data changes as membership decreases the upper and lower risk of non carcinogenic increase which is a fuzzy data increase 4 3 2 evaluation results of triangular stochastic model according to the method of triangular random simulation using the monte carlo module in oracle crystal ball as a platform after 50 000 random simulations the result met the accuracy of 0 001 and the simulation results converge see table 2 the farmland use has the highest non carcinogenic risk to all the crowds with the minimum and maximum of average is 2 31 to 3 92 moreover the non carcinogenic risk values are above the security level the second is residential land use with the minimum and maximum of average is 0 78 to 1 32 the value of non carcinogenic risk for farmland use is three times as much as that of residential land use only the value of non carcinogenic risk for infant and children are above the security level both the groundwater in farmland use and residential land use can be potentially harmful to human health and nitrogen pollutants pose an even greater threat to infant the area of residential land use is at high risk of non carcinogenic nitrogen to humans as domestic sewage infiltrates into groundwater for farmland use a large amount of chemical fertilizers were used and nitrogen fertilizer infiltrated into groundwater through irrigation water resulting in high nitrogen levels and affecting human health for residential land use livestock waste and domestic sewage discharge caused high nitrogen concentration in groundwater the evaluation result of the triangle stochastic model is close to that of the triangle fuzzy number which indicates that the simulation result is reasonable 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty analysis the maximum and minimum health risk varies greatly depending on pollutant concentrations and evaluation parameters risk assessment is accompanied by uncertainty ignoring uncertainty would lead manager to make wrong decisions dong et al 2015 analyzing uncertainties in human health risk assessment on public health is a key issue li et al 2018 the sources of uncertainty in this study are as follows firstly the usepa s recommendation values are not necessarily suitable for chinese so there is inevitably uncertainty in the selection for example rfd and et are derived directly from the reference values given by usepa according to the national conditions of the united states secondly some errors may inevitably exist in the process of collecting water samples and measuring nitrogen concentration in the field thus causing certain deviations in the accuracy of data results li et al 2016 and then the greater uncertainty lies in the distribution of nitrogen concentration over time the results of the health risk assessment assume that future concentrations will be the same as present s finally this study only considered drinking water as the main intake channel not excluding food mainly organic nitrogen and skin contact intake the range of evaluation results of triangular random simulation is larger than that of triangular fuzzy method for example the interval value of residential land use for infant evaluation results obtained by triangular fuzzy method is 0 4 957 nevertheless under the same land use triangular random simulation evaluation of the infants is 0 04 7 240 this indicates that the results obtained by triangular random simulation evaluation are more sensitive to data changes the operation between fuzzy trigonometric numbers and functions is transformed into the operation among of ordinary real numbers by monte carlo method which can reduce the uncertainty in the calculation process of triangular fuzzy number chatzivasileiadis et al 2019 5 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis refers to finding out the factors that have important influence on evaluation results monte carlo sensitivity analysis method can consider the changes of different parameters and accurately reflect the impact of each parameter on the evaluation result wu et al 2019 badeenezhad et al 2021 mohammadpour et al 2022 based on oracle crystal ball platform this study used monte carlo random sampling statistical analysis method to conduct sensitivity analysis considering contaminant concentration and parameters i e drinking water consumption and body weight the results show that the sensitivity of each parameter to the non carcinogenic risk is different and the contribution rate of nitrate nitrogen to the total non carcinogenic risk is more than 83 indicating that nitrate nitrogen concentration is the principal factor of the total non carcinogenic risk in other words by reducing the contaminant concentration the non carcinogenic risk also reduces and then body weight is the secondary factor in another study conducted in india the most important sensitivity parameters of heavy metal concentration and water intake were reported in non carcinogenic risk assessment result mishra et al 2021 however the sensitivity of ammonia nitrogen to the total non carcinogenic of risk is extremely low 6 conclusions the nitrogen pollution in groundwater and its effect on residents health have been investigated by using statistics and correlation analysis in yinchuan plain the following conclusions can be summarized as follow 1 analysis of the general characteristics of groundwater chemistry in the study area shows that ph ranges from 6 84 to 8 88 with an average value of 7 61 suggesting a weakly alkaline groundwater environment the order of ation and cation concentration are cl so4 2 hco3 and na mg2 ca2 k respectively chadha diagram indicates ca mg cl type being the dominated water type 2 the spatial distribution map of no3 n nh4 n and no2 n shows significant spatial difference in no3 n distribution with an average value of 22 439 mg l and about 32 of the samples exceeded the grade iii 20 mg l of n according to china s standard the higher values are mainly distributed in northwest including dawukou district huinong district and pingluo country with the maximum value of 449 mg l which indicates higher pollution potential 3 the no3 n nh4 n and no2 n concentration in the groundwater of the unutilized land use is significantly lowest among all the land use types the results of principal component analysis show that the positive correlation between no3 n and cl so4 2 and ca2 determining that the high no3 n concentration of groundwater in the study area could be attributed to human activities including the excessive use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture the application of manure and domestic sewage 4 infants are the most vulnerable groups to nitrate contaminants exposure through drinking the ranking of non carcinogenic risk under different land types for infants children adult males and females is farmland use residential land use unutilized land use for all the crowds non carcinogenic risk value of unutilized land use is less than 1 acceptable however the non carcinogenic risks of farmland use are much higher than the safety threshold value of 1 unacceptable the contribution rate of nitrate nitrogen to the total non carcinogenic risk is more than 83 it should be noted that there are uncertainties in the health risk assessment results such as temporal and spatial distribution of nitrogen exposure route and parameter selection for the sustainable agricultural and economic development of the region attention should be paid to raising the awareness of farmers and local residents on pollution control governments should take immediate action to remove contaminants from drinking water as soon as the concentration and health risks of pollutants in groundwater exceed levels that are acceptable for drinking this study will focus decision makers attention on how to use fertilizers more effectively in agriculture
