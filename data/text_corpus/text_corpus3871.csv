with minimal intermediate accumulation and in parallel with complete denitrification of 20 mg n l nitrate pcp initially was reductively dechlorinated to phenol which was then mineralized to co2

surface water and groundwater häggblom et al 1993 therefore pcp can be found in the air water and soil as well as in the blood urine seminal fluid breast milk and adipose tissue of humans around the world zheng et al 2011 due to its being a probable carcinogen chetty et al 2004 pcp has been placed on the usepa s us environmental protection agency pollutant priority list with a maximum contamination level mcl of 1 μg l water epa although pcp is prohibited for use the concentration of pcp in the contaminated area is still high and the toxicity will remain for a long time zheng et al 2011 pcp can be removed from water by physicochemical methods such as activated carbon adsorption mollah and robinson 1996 hydrogen peroxide oxidation viraraghavan and sapach 2006 and photocatalytic degradation zhang et al 2012 but they have high capital and energy costs or require disposal of problematic residues chiang et al 1997 in contrast microbial dechlorination is more economical and detoxifies pcp yang and chen 2016 microbial dechlorination can be aerobic or anaerobic wen et al 2017 in aerobic conditions ring cleavage can occur either before or after removal of the chlorine substituents giving rise to a wide array of intermediates some of which have high toxicity and poor biodegradability kao et al 2005 in anaerobic conditions pcp can be reductively dechlorinated to less toxic and readily biodegradable phenol limam et al 2016a however challenges for reductive dechlorination include that some dechlorinating microorganisms are only able to partially dechlorinate pcp limam et al 2016b and that an organic electron donor typically methanol ethanol or acetate is needed leon santiesteban et al 2016 but it may cause secondary contamination tang et al 2012 the second challenge can be addressed by using an alternative electron donor hydrogen gas h2 h2 is the universal electron donor for autotrophic dechlorination and it also has advantages of being non toxic and having a lower biomass yield zhao et al 2011 zhou et al 2016b the challenge for using h2 lies in supplying h2 to the microorganisms since h2 has low water solubility this challenge is overcome with the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr which delivers h2 gas directly to a biofilm that lives on the exterior wall of bubbleless gas transfer membranes bubbleless gas transfer occurs by diffusion of h2 molecules in response to a concentration gradient established by h2 consumption in the biofilm h2 delivery in the mbfr is on demand which allows accurate h2 supply with nearly 100 utilization zhou et al 2017 previous studies reported successful reduction of several halogenated organics such as p cnb xia et al 2011a 2 chlorophenol xia et al 2011b and trichloroethene chung et al 2007 ziv el et al 2012 in h2 based mbfrs we evaluated pcp removal in a h2 based mbfr identified intermediate products of pcp dechlorination and characterized the microbial community as it is a common oxidized contaminant co existing with pcp in surface water or groundwater xia et al 2016 nitrate no3 was introduced along with pcp throughout the study and we investigated the effect of no3 on pcp reduction we

the start up stage stage 0 the reactor was run in a semi batch mode for 2 days until biomass could be observed visually on the membrane surfaces then the mbfr was fed continuously with pcp free synthetic water at a steady hrt of 24 h for 15 days until no no3 was detected in the effluent the removal of no3 in this stage is shown in fig s1 in the following two stages the mbfr was fed

hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and the temperature was controlled at 25 1 c 2 4 sampling and analyses samples from the influent and effluent were collected on a daily basis and they were immediately filtered through a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf syringe filter millipore 0 45 μm pcp and the products of pcp dechlorination were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms

metabolic category as reported by kegg database in the biofilms for samples with so4 2 and without so4 2 and φ a is the relative abundance of a certain metabolic category as reported by kegg database for the anoxic sludge or sample a table s1 describes the kegg orthologs related to aerobic dechlorination denitrification sulfur oxidation so4 2 reduction and phenol degradation 3 results and discussion 3 1 pcp removal along with no3 and so4 2 reductions fig 2 shows concentrations and removal efficiencies of pcp a and no3 n b across all stages for the 114 days of operation following the initial 15 day start up stage 1 1 which had 100 μg l pcp 20 mg l so4 2 and 20 mg l no3 n in the influent had no3 n removal that stabilized at 98 2 effluent pcp slowly decreased to 27 of the influent concentration during the first three days and then rapidly dropped to undetectable 10 μg l in stage 1 2 with 1 5 fold more pcp introduced into the influent the pcp removal gradually increased to 100 within 5 days while the no3 removal stabilized at 95 2 the average so4 2 removals were only 63 and 41 in the two sub stages shown in fig s2 3 2 pcp removal along with denitrification in stage 2 so4 2 was removed from the influent so that pcp and no3 were the only electron acceptors keeping the no3 input constant at 20 mg n l we gradually increased the influent pcp concentrations from 0 5 to 10 mg l no3 removal was steady at 96 3 throughout the whole stage when the influent pcp concentration was no more than 3 mg l sub stages 2 1 to 2 4 the effluent pcp concentration was undetectable but increasing the influent pcp concentration to 10 mg l led to an average effluent pcp concentration of 0 93 mg l or 91 removal 3 3 the analysis on electron equivalent fluxes of the electron acceptors table 2 summarizes the electron equivalent fluxes of the electron acceptors denitrification was insensitive to so4 2 loading and pcp loading since no3 fluxes were nearly invariant at 60 e meq m2 d denitrification also dominated the total flux averaging 97 of the total electrons ultimately from h2 when it occurred in stages 1 1 and 1 2 so4 2 reduction was the second biggest consumer of electrons up to 12 of the total electrons in stage 1 1 pcp reduction was a very small percentage of electron fluxes less than 6 of the total electrons as the pcp loading was increased in stages 1 1 to 2 4 its reduction flux increased proportionally since pcp removal was 100 3 4 identification and quantification of intermediates of pcp dechlorination gc and lc spectra form the mbfr effluents shown in fig s3 identify a variety of chlorinated phenols as well as phenol that were intermediates from pcp dechlorination gc ms fig s3a shows evidence of tetrachlorophenol tecp including 2 3 4 5 or 2 3 4 6 tecps detected by gc ms fig s3a lc fig s3b d shows evidence of tetrachlorophenol tecp 2 3 4 5 tecp trichlorophenol tcp 3 4 5 tcp dichlorophenol dcp 3 5 dcp monochlorophenol cp 3 cp and phenol fig 3 presents the concentrations of the detected phenols and free chloride ions cl throughout all stages the transient appearance of the partially dechlorinated phenols and phenol along with the stoichiometric accumulation of cl confirms that pcp was removed through dechlorination in the mbfr accumulation of intermediates was insignificant in the initial low pcp loading stages but became significant as the pcp loading increased in sub stage 2 5 having the highest pcp loading the initial accumulation of tetra and tri chlorophenols reached 15 2 μm comprising 41 of the influent pcp however the total concentration of pcp derived intermediates reflected by the height of each stacked column declined over time in each stage and the intermediates were reduced to undetectable levels 0 039 μm for each steady state furthermore the measured increases of free cl in the effluent matched the stoichiometric values for complete dechlorination of pcp even phenol was undetectable at the end of each sub stage and the effluent soluble cod in the end of sub stage 2 5 with the highest pcp loading was less than 0 01 mg l which confirms that phenol was mineralized 3 5 structure and predicted metabolic functions of the microbial communities fig 4 presents the analyses of the microbial community structures in the inoculum and at the end of stages 1 and 2 the inoculum was diverse but sphingobacteriales was the major order at 27 of unique sequences at the end of stage 1 the microbial community was dominated by the β proteobacteria order rhodocyclales 23 with sequences clustering in the family rhodocyclaceae 23 at the end of stage 2 with the increased loading of pcp and the absence of so4 2 the predominant microbial group shifted to the α proteobacteria order rhizobiales 48 with sequences mainly clustering into the family xanthobacteraceae 40 which mostly consisted of the genus xanthobacter 37 table s2 proteobacteria genera known to be capable of dechlorination and denitrification were enriched after pcp was introduced in particular thauera becker et al 2006 weelink et al 2009 and hydrogenophaga lambo and patel 2007 lemmer et al 1997 were enriched in both stages while cupriavidus cao et al 2013 coelho et al 2010 tiemeyer et al 2007 starkeya dudasova et al 2014 rapson et al 2008 workun et al 2008 and xanthobacter gomez et al 2005 herbst and wiesmann 1996 saez et al 2006 were enriched only in the so4 2 free stage 2 dechlorinators incapable of denitrification including longilinea lee and lee 2016 and rhizobium bouquard et al 1997 and denitrifiers incapable of dechlorination including azospira and planctomyces slobodkina et al 2016 became significantly more abundant in the so4 2 free stage 2 some genera involved in so4 2 metabolism were present only in stage 1 the genus desulfomicrobium order desulfovibrionales class deltaproteobacteria capable of so4 2 reduction tkalec et al 2000 and the genera sulfuritalea kojima and fukui 2011 order rhodocyclales class betaproteobacteria flavobacterium germida and janzen 1993 order flavobacteriales class flavobacteria capable of sulfide oxidation were enriched from negligible levels to 8 5 7 7 and 4 0 respectively in stage 1 the resulting accumulation of sulfide enabled growth of sobs including sulfuritalea and flavobacterium that oxidized sulfide back to sulfate forming a s cycling in the end of stage 2 having had no so4 2 addition for 3 months their abundances again decreased to the undetectable level table s1 lists the enzymes predicted by picrust metagenomic analysis and involved in pcp no3 or so4 2 metabolism fig 5 presents the odds ratios for these enzyme based functions from table s1 for stages 1 and 2 compared to the original anoxic inoculum while the predicted abundance of genes encoding the monooxygenase responsible for aerobic pcp oxidation table s1 decreased in both stages the predicted abundances of genes encoding enzymes catalyzing aerobic activation of phenol and dissimilatory reduction of no3 to n2 i e denitrification increased genes encoding enzymes responsible for anaerobic activation of phenol so4 2 reduction and sulfide oxidation including sulfide to sulfite and sulfite to sulfate increased in the so4 2 involved stage 1 but decreased in the so4 2 free stage 2 table si1 although we were unable to directly quantify elemental sulfur immobilized in the biofilm we assume that the elemental sulfur did not accumulate in the system and mostly was further oxidized back to sulfate by sob this is further supported by the fact that 50 so4 2 remained in the effluent at the steady state under sufficient h2 supply for complete so4 2 reduction in the first stage dechlorinators incapable of denitrification were absent thus pcp was reduced to phenol by hydrogenophaga a denitrifier that was enriched and is reported capable of dehalogenation along with denitrification fetzner 1998 and probably by desulfomicrobium which was reported to dechlorinate pcp genthner et al 1997 and mineralize phenol schnell et al 1989 through so4 2 respiration sulfide the key metabolite in the microbially driven s cycling ontiveros valencia et al 2014 2017 tang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 was probably involved in pcp degradation as well on the one hand sulfide may have served as a supplementary sources of electron sinks for dechlorination as well as sob mediated dissimilatory no3 reduction crawford and mohn 1985 kojima and fukui 2011 particularly dechlorination process was probably coupled to sulfide oxidation by flavobacterium crawford and mohn 1985 besides sulfide was reported abiotic dechlorination gong et al 2016 this abiotic process may have accelerated pcp dechlorination and at the same time competed with bacteria for chlorinated phenols resulting in the less abundance of exclusive dechlorinators such as rhizobium in the sulfate containing stage fig 4 and table s2 as a result sulfur cycling provided a supplementary form of electron sinks hs s2 for denitrification and dechlorination 3 6 proposed pathways of pcp biotransformation fig 6 is a proposed pathway for pcp dechlorination and mineralization based on combining information about detected intermediates and metagenomic prediction pcp was step wise anaerobically dechlorinated to phenol since all of the reductive intermediates were detected but intermediates of aerobic dechlorination chloranil and chlorinated hydroquinones were absent the insignificance of the aerobic pathway is reinforced by the decreased predicted abundances of genes encoding the pentachlorophenol monooxygenases throughout the time of pcp addition based on detected intermediates pcp was ortho dechlorinated to 2 3 4 5 tecp and then to 3 4 5 tcp tcp was further para dechlorinated to 3 5 dcp meta dechlorinated to 3 cp and finally meta dechlorinated to phenol this pathway is identical to that used by desulfitobacterium frappieri the only strain reported capable of complete dechlorination of pcp to mcp bouchard et al 1996 a previous study reported that complete dechlorination of pcp required that all three positions of dechlorination be catalyzed by three different enzymes mikesell and boyd 1986 most bacteria tested in previous pure culture studies did not completely dechlorinate pcp desulfitobacterium dehalogenans utkin et al 1995 and desulfitobacterium hafniense dcb 2 madsen and licht 1992 even in more versatile mixed culture systems limam et al 2016b pcp was not completely dechlorinated due to lack of para dechlorinating capacity thus the long term retention of three dechlorination pathways in our system provides a new baseline for the complete bio dechlorination of polychlorinated aromatics phenol the product of pcp reductive dechlorination could have been activated via monooxygenation to catechol lowry et al 2009 or carboxylase mediated activation to benzyl coa sueoka et al 2009 the denitrifying conditions in our mbfr favored the o2 independent carboxylation pathway and this pathway is supported by the increased presence of the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for benzyl coa formation in stage 1 and of the increase presence of azospira and thauera spp which are reported to anaerobically degrade phenol under denitrifying conditions sueoka et al 2009 the o2 dependent monooxygenation of phenol also was possible due to the low concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the influent averaging 1 2 mg l according to stoichiometry 3 phenol o2 nadph h catechol nadp h2o 1 2 mg l of do would be sufficient for activating all the phenol to catechol liu et al 2018 in addition the picrust analysis predicted an enhanced presence of genes encoding enzymes associated with aerobic activation and cleavage of phenol in both stages table s1 and fig 5 aerobic activation is consistent with studies documenting biodegradation of benzene derivatives in microaerophilic conditions through o2 driven activation and cleavage followed by no3 or so4 2 driven mineralization liu et al 2018 schnell et al 1989 sueoka et al 2009 it also is consistent with the increased abundance xanthobacter spp which are reported capable of mineralizing phenol through aerobic activation with the final products of co2 lowry et al 2009 theoretically the products of phenol activation can serve as electron donors to drive the reductive dechlorination of cps the monooxygenation of phenol or both bacteria like xanthobacter azospira and thauera are able to break phenol down to low molecular weight organics lowry et al 2009 sueoka et al 2009 which could be used by heterotrophic bacteria and this is consistent the very low concentratrion of scod at the end of the last stage 4 conclusions our study documents a unique and useful means for bioremediating pcp in water that also contains no3 and so4 2 a continuously operated h2 based mbfr gave nearly 100 reductive dechlorination of 10 mg l pcp concomitant with 100 denitrification of 20 mg l no3 n l and reduction of 10 mg l so4 2 phenol the product of reductive dechlorination could be mineralized to co2 through after activation by a combination of aerobic activation via monooxygenation by xanthobacter and anaerobic activation via carboxylation by azospira and thauera sulfur cycling induced by so4 2 reduction affected the microbial community the dominant bacteria became sulfate reducers desulfomicrobium sulfur oxidizers sulfuritalea and flavobacterium in summary dechlorination denitrification and sulfate reduction could be fueled autotrophically by h2 which provides a promising

synthetic water at a steady hrt of 24 h for 15 days until no no3 was detected in the effluent the removal of no3 in this stage is shown in fig s1 in the following two stages the mbfr was fed continuously with pcp containing medium in stage 1 pcp and so4 2 were added to the reactor giving three e acceptors in stage 2 so4 2 was removed from the influent the influent no3 n concentration was held at 20 mg l and the influent pcp concentration was gradually increased from 500 to 10 000 μg l throughout the 115 days of continuous operation the flow rate was fixed at 1 ml min giving a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and the temperature was controlled at 25 1 c 2 4 sampling and analyses samples from the influent and effluent were collected on a daily basis and they were immediately filtered through a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf syringe filter millipore 0 45 μm pcp and the products of pcp dechlorination were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms trace dsqⅱ ms thermo fisher usa concentrations of all phenolics were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu lc 20a japan equipped with an agilent c18 column and a diode

were validated using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer agilent technologies palo alto ca usa and quantified by qubit dna libraries were multiplexed and loaded on an illumina miseq instrument according to manufacturer s instructions illumina san diego ca usa sequencing was performed using a 2 250 or 2 300 paired end pe configuration image analysis and base calling were conducted by the miseq control software mcs on the miseq instrument the sequences were processed and analyzed by genewiz taxonomy analysis was carried out on qiime platform caporaso et al 2010 a panel of proprietary primers was designed to anneal to the relatively conserved regions bordering v3 v4 and v5 hypervariable regions the v3 and v4 regions were amplified using forward primers containing the sequence cctacggrrbgcascagkvrvgaat and reverse primers containing the sequence ggactacnvgggtwtctaatcc the v4 and v5 regions were also amplified using forward and reverse primers containing the sequence

library with high complexity ready for downstream ngs sequencing on illumina miseq to predict the metagenomic compositions of the biofilm communities from the 16s rdna gene sequences we employed the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust pipeline and the latest kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database we calculated the odd ratios or to compare the pcp treated biofilms with the original anoxic sludge using the method modified from zhou et al 2016a 2 or φ p c p 1 φ p c p φ a 1 φ a where φ pcp is the relative abundance of a certain metabolic category as reported by kegg database in the biofilms for samples with so4 2 and without so4 2 and φ a is the relative abundance of a certain metabolic category as reported by kegg database for the anoxic sludge or sample a table s1 describes the kegg orthologs related to aerobic dechlorination denitrification sulfur oxidation so4 2 reduction and phenol degradation 3 results and discussion 3 1 pcp removal along with no3 and so4 2 reductions fig 2 shows concentrations and removal efficiencies of pcp a and no3 n b across all stages for the 114 days of operation following the initial 15 day start up stage 1 1 which had 100 μg l pcp 20 mg l so4 2 and 20 mg l no3 n in the influent had no3 n removal that stabilized at 98 2 effluent pcp slowly decreased to 27 of the influent concentration during the first three days and then rapidly dropped to undetectable 10 μg l in stage 1 2 with 1 5 fold more pcp introduced into the influent the pcp removal gradually increased to 100 within 5 days while the no3 removal stabilized at 95 2 the average so4 2 removals were only 63 and 41 in the two sub stages shown in fig s2 3 2 pcp removal along with denitrification in stage 2 so4 2 was removed from the influent so that pcp and no3 were the only electron acceptors keeping the no3 input constant at 20 mg n l we gradually increased the influent pcp concentrations from 0 5 to 10 mg l no3 removal was steady at 96 3 throughout the whole stage when the influent pcp concentration was no more than 3 mg l sub stages 2 1 to 2 4 the effluent pcp concentration was undetectable but increasing the influent pcp concentration to 10 mg l led to an average effluent pcp concentration of 0 93 mg l or 91 removal 3 3 the analysis on electron equivalent fluxes of the electron acceptors table 2 summarizes the electron equivalent fluxes of the electron acceptors denitrification was insensitive to so4 2 loading and pcp loading since no3 fluxes were nearly invariant at 60 e meq m2 d denitrification also dominated the total flux averaging 97 of the total electrons ultimately from h2 when it occurred in stages 1 1 and 1 2 so4 2 reduction was the second biggest consumer of electrons up to 12 of the total electrons in stage 1 1 pcp reduction was a very small percentage of electron fluxes less than 6 of the total electrons as the pcp loading was increased in stages 1 1 to 2 4 its reduction flux increased proportionally since pcp removal was 100 3 4 identification and quantification of intermediates of pcp dechlorination gc and lc spectra form the mbfr effluents shown in fig s3 identify a variety of chlorinated phenols as well as phenol that were intermediates from pcp dechlorination gc ms fig s3a shows evidence of tetrachlorophenol tecp including 2 3 4 5 or 2 3 4 6 tecps detected by gc ms fig s3a lc fig s3b d shows evidence of tetrachlorophenol tecp 2 3 4 5 tecp trichlorophenol tcp 3 4 5 tcp dichlorophenol dcp 3 5 dcp monochlorophenol cp 3 cp and phenol fig 3 presents the concentrations of the detected phenols and free chloride ions cl throughout all stages the transient appearance of the partially dechlorinated phenols and phenol along with the stoichiometric accumulation of cl confirms that pcp was removed through dechlorination in the mbfr accumulation of intermediates was insignificant in the initial low pcp loading stages but became significant as the pcp loading increased in sub stage 2 5 having the highest pcp loading the initial accumulation of tetra and tri chlorophenols reached 15 2 μm comprising 41 of the influent pcp however the total concentration of pcp derived intermediates reflected by the height of each stacked column declined over time in each stage and the intermediates were reduced to undetectable levels 0 039 μm for each steady state furthermore the measured increases of free cl in the effluent matched the stoichiometric values for complete dechlorination of pcp even phenol was undetectable at the end of each sub stage and the effluent soluble cod in the end of sub stage 2 5 with the highest pcp loading was less than 0 01 mg l which confirms that phenol was mineralized 3 5 structure and predicted metabolic functions of the microbial communities fig 4 presents the analyses of the microbial community structures in the inoculum and at the end of stages 1 and 2 the inoculum was diverse but sphingobacteriales was the major order at 27 of unique sequences at the end of stage 1 the microbial community was dominated by the β proteobacteria order rhodocyclales 23 with sequences clustering in the family rhodocyclaceae 23 at the end of stage 2 with the increased loading of pcp and the absence of so4 2 the predominant microbial group shifted to the α proteobacteria order rhizobiales 48 with sequences mainly clustering into the family xanthobacteraceae 40 which mostly consisted of the genus xanthobacter 37 table s2 proteobacteria genera known to be capable of dechlorination and denitrification were enriched after pcp was introduced in particular thauera becker et al 2006 weelink et al 2009 and hydrogenophaga lambo and patel 2007 lemmer et al 1997 were enriched in both stages while cupriavidus cao et al 2013 coelho et al 2010 tiemeyer et al 2007 starkeya dudasova et al 2014 rapson et al 2008 workun et al 2008 and xanthobacter gomez et al 2005 herbst and wiesmann 1996 saez et al 2006 were enriched only in the so4 2 free stage 2 dechlorinators incapable of denitrification including longilinea lee and lee 2016 and rhizobium bouquard et al 1997 and denitrifiers incapable of dechlorination including azospira and planctomyces slobodkina et al 2016 became significantly more abundant in the so4 2 free stage 2 some genera involved in so4 2 metabolism were present only in stage 1 the genus desulfomicrobium order desulfovibrionales class deltaproteobacteria capable of so4 2 reduction tkalec et al 2000 and the genera sulfuritalea kojima and fukui 2011 order rhodocyclales class betaproteobacteria flavobacterium germida and janzen 1993 order flavobacteriales class flavobacteria capable of sulfide oxidation were enriched from negligible levels to 8 5 7 7 and 4 0 respectively in stage 1 the resulting accumulation of sulfide enabled growth of sobs including sulfuritalea and flavobacterium that oxidized sulfide back to sulfate forming a s cycling in the end of stage 2 having had no so4 2 addition for 3 months their abundances again decreased to the undetectable level table s1 lists the enzymes predicted by picrust metagenomic analysis and involved in pcp no3 or so4 2 metabolism fig 5 presents the odds ratios for these enzyme based functions from table s1 for stages 1 and 2 compared to the original anoxic inoculum while the predicted abundance of genes encoding the monooxygenase responsible for aerobic pcp oxidation table s1 decreased in both stages the predicted abundances of genes encoding enzymes catalyzing aerobic activation of phenol and dissimilatory reduction of no3 to n2 i e denitrification increased genes encoding enzymes responsible for anaerobic activation of phenol so4 2 reduction and sulfide oxidation including sulfide to sulfite and sulfite to sulfate increased in the so4 2 involved stage 1 but decreased in the so4 2 free stage 2 table si1 although we were unable to directly quantify elemental sulfur immobilized in the biofilm we assume that the elemental sulfur did not accumulate in the system and mostly was further oxidized back to sulfate by sob this is further supported by the fact that 50 so4 2 remained in the effluent at the steady state under sufficient h2 supply for complete so4 2 reduction in the first stage dechlorinators incapable of denitrification were absent thus pcp was reduced to phenol by hydrogenophaga a denitrifier that was enriched and is reported capable of dehalogenation along with denitrification fetzner 1998 and probably by desulfomicrobium which was reported to dechlorinate pcp genthner et al 1997 and mineralize phenol schnell et al 1989 through so4 2 respiration sulfide the key metabolite in the microbially driven s cycling ontiveros valencia et al 2014 2017 tang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 was probably involved in pcp degradation as well on the one hand sulfide may have served as a supplementary sources of electron sinks for dechlorination as well as sob mediated dissimilatory no3 reduction crawford and mohn 1985 kojima and fukui 2011 particularly dechlorination process was probably coupled to sulfide oxidation by flavobacterium crawford and mohn 1985 besides sulfide was reported abiotic dechlorination gong et al 2016 this abiotic process may have accelerated pcp dechlorination and at the same time competed with bacteria for chlorinated phenols resulting in the less abundance of exclusive dechlorinators such as rhizobium in the sulfate containing stage fig 4 and table s2 as a result sulfur cycling provided a supplementary form of electron sinks hs s2 for denitrification and dechlorination 3 6 proposed pathways of pcp biotransformation fig 6 is a proposed pathway for pcp dechlorination and mineralization based on combining information about detected intermediates and metagenomic prediction pcp was step wise anaerobically dechlorinated to phenol since all of the reductive intermediates were detected but intermediates of aerobic dechlorination chloranil and chlorinated hydroquinones were absent the insignificance of the aerobic pathway is reinforced by the decreased predicted abundances of genes encoding the pentachlorophenol monooxygenases throughout the time of pcp addition based on detected intermediates pcp was ortho dechlorinated to 2 3 4 5 tecp and then to 3 4 5 tcp tcp was further para dechlorinated to 3 5 dcp meta dechlorinated to 3 cp and finally meta dechlorinated to phenol this pathway is identical to that used by desulfitobacterium frappieri the only strain reported capable of complete dechlorination of pcp to mcp bouchard et al 1996 a previous study reported that complete dechlorination of pcp required that all three positions of dechlorination be catalyzed by three different enzymes mikesell and boyd 1986 most bacteria tested in previous pure culture studies did not completely dechlorinate pcp desulfitobacterium dehalogenans utkin et al 1995 and desulfitobacterium hafniense dcb 2 madsen and licht 1992 even in more versatile mixed culture systems limam et al 2016b pcp was not completely dechlorinated due to lack of para dechlorinating capacity thus the long term retention of three dechlorination pathways in our system provides a new baseline for the complete bio dechlorination of polychlorinated aromatics phenol the product of pcp reductive dechlorination could have been activated via monooxygenation to catechol lowry et al 2009 or carboxylase mediated activation to benzyl coa sueoka et al 2009 the denitrifying conditions in our mbfr favored the o2 independent carboxylation pathway and this pathway is supported by the increased presence of the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for benzyl coa formation in stage 1 and of the increase presence of azospira and thauera spp which are reported to anaerobically degrade phenol under denitrifying conditions sueoka et al 2009 the o2 dependent monooxygenation of phenol also was possible due to the low concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the influent averaging 1 2 mg l according to stoichiometry 3 phenol o2 nadph h catechol nadp h2o 1 2 mg l of do would be sufficient for activating all the phenol to catechol liu et al 2018 in addition the picrust analysis predicted an enhanced presence of genes encoding enzymes associated with aerobic activation and cleavage of phenol in both stages table s1 and fig 5 aerobic activation is consistent with studies documenting biodegradation of benzene derivatives in microaerophilic conditions through o2 driven activation and cleavage followed by no3 or so4 2 driven mineralization liu et al 2018 schnell et al 1989 sueoka et al 2009 it also is consistent with the increased abundance xanthobacter spp which are reported capable of mineralizing phenol through aerobic activation with the final products of co2 lowry et al 2009 theoretically the products of phenol activation can serve as electron donors to drive the reductive dechlorination of cps the monooxygenation of phenol or both bacteria like xanthobacter azospira and thauera are able to break phenol down to low molecular weight organics lowry et al 2009 sueoka et al 2009 which could be used by heterotrophic bacteria and this is consistent the very low concentratrion of scod at the end of the last stage 4 conclusions our study documents a unique and useful means for bioremediating pcp in water that also contains no3 and so4 2 a continuously operated h2 based mbfr gave nearly 100 reductive dechlorination of 10 mg l pcp concomitant with 100 denitrification of 20 mg l no3 n l and reduction of 10 mg l so4 2 phenol the product of reductive dechlorination could be mineralized to co2 through after activation by a combination of aerobic activation via monooxygenation by xanthobacter and anaerobic activation via carboxylation by azospira and thauera sulfur cycling induced by so4 2 reduction affected the microbial community the dominant bacteria became sulfate reducers desulfomicrobium sulfur oxidizers sulfuritalea and flavobacterium in summary dechlorination denitrification and sulfate reduction could be fueled autotrophically by h2 which provides a promising strategy for bioremediating water contaminated with pcp nitrate and sulfate acknowledgements this work is supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51678422 appendix a supplementary

19356,to better understand the environmental impact of ubiquitous perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in waters reliable and robust measurement techniques are needed as one of the most widely used passive sampling approaches diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is not only easy to handle but also provides time weighted analyte concentrations based on dgt with xad18 as a binding agent we developed a new methodology to measure two frequently detected pfass in surface waters and wastewaters i e perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos their diffusion coefficients in the diffusive gel measured using an independent diffusion cell were 4 37 10 6 and 5 08 10 6 cm2 s 1 at 25 c respectively dgt had a high capacity for pfoa and pfos at 196 and 246 μg per gel disk suggesting the dgt sampler was suitable for deployment of several weeks time integrated concentrations of pfoa and pfos in a natural lake and river and a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent using dgt samplers deployed in situ for 12 33 d were comparable to those measured by a solid phase extraction method coupled with high frequency grab sampling this study demonstrates that dgt is an effective tool for in situ monitoring of pfass in natural waters and wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords perfluoroalkyl substances diffusive gradients in thin films diffusion coefficients passive sampling surface waters wastewaters 1 introduction emerging contaminants perfluoroalkyl substances pfass have been produced and used for more than 60 years lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 due to their thermal stability and oxidative resistance pfass are widely used as surfactants and surface protectors in commercial products and industries including protective coatings and fire fighting foams giesy and kannan 2002 kusoglu and weber 2017 renner 2001 wu et al 2015 generally two sources account for the release of pfass into the environment one is direct sources such as the manufacturing of pfass and consumption of products containing pfass and the other is indirect sources like reaction impurities or degradation of precursors zareitalabad et al 2013 two long chain fully fluorinated pfass perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos are ubiquitously present in natural waters boulanger et al 2004 lindim et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 drinking water hu et al 2016 schwanz et al 2016 xiao et al 2013 and wastewater arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 kwon et al 2017 pan et al 2016 xiao et al 2012b at concentrations ranging from pg l 1 to μg l 1 levels krafft and riess 2015a zareitalabad et al 2013 besides it is generally accepted that they are persistent bioaccumulative and recalcitrant to removal by drinking water and municipal wastewater treatment xiao 2017 to reduce their emission pfos was listed on the stockholm convention as persistent organic pollutants in may 2009 whereas pfoa was proposed by european union to be listed in the stockholm convention in october 2015 lam et al 2017 the environmental quality standard expressed as an annual average value for pfos in freshwaters corresponding to the long term exposure scenario for human consumption of freshwater fish set by european commission is at 0 65 ng l 1 whereas a provisional threshold of 0 4 μg l 1 was proposed by us environmental protection agency usepa for pfoa in drinking waters valsecchi et al 2017 in 2016 usepa issued lifetime drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l 1 for the combined concentration of pfoa and pfos weber et al 2017 due to their relatively high polarity and moderate water solubility the majority of pfass are distributed in the liquid phase kaserzon et al 2012 li et al 2017 as such accurate determination of pfass concentrations in natural waters and wastewaters is necessary to better understand their biogeochemistry and to further evaluate their potential effect on aquatic organisms and human beings most strategies for pfass measurement need to collect large volume water samples through grab spot sampling which are sent back to laboratory for chemical pre concentration before quantitative analysis using high sensitive equipments such as liquid chromatography negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms richardson and kimura 2016 yu et al 2013 however the methodology provides only snapshots of pfass concentration at specific sampling time for periodical monitoring it can be time consuming and costly to screen pfass and capture the concentration dependent biogeochemical behavior of pfass in environments in situ analysis is preferable however field analysis of pfass were not feasible due to the non portability and non specification of instruments giesy and kannan 2002 therefore in situ preconcentration of pfass in passive sampling samplers followed by laboratorial analysis is an alternatively promising solution roll and halden 2016 vrana et al 2005 moreover this practice is a very common approach for many other groups of organic substances the advantages of passive sampling over traditional spot sampling include in situ time integrating and labor saving continuous monitoring lower detection limits cleaner sample matrices and easier sample storage based on polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis several passive samplers have been successfully used to monitor pfass alvarez et al 2007 fedorova et al 2013 kaserzon et al 2012 however a drawback of pocis based samplers is the necessity of in situ calibration of the sampling rates caused by the different field conditions from laboratory calibrations kaserzon et al 2014 hydrodynamic conditions such as flow rate temperature and turbulence could affect sampling rates thereby contributing to the uncertainty and variation in concentration estimates of pfass in water kaserzon et al 2013 2014 passive sampling technique based on diffusive gradients in thin films technique dgt is independent of water flow rate so it has the potential to provide concentrations with improved performance compared to other passive samplers sigg et al 2006 in the last 20 years dgt has been established to measure labile inorganic species in aquatic environments such as metals gu et al 2017 guan et al 2016 luo et al 2010 2018 pan et al 2015 zhang and davison 1995 zhang et al 2017 phosphate guan et al 2015

hydrophilic lipophilic balance powder as the binding agent have been extended to measure trace organics in waters including antibiotics chen et al 2013 bisphenols zheng et al 2015 polar organic contaminants challis et al 2016 household and personal care products including preservatives antioxidants and disinfectants chen et al 2017 illicit drugs guo et al 2017 anionic pesticides guibal et al 2017 and endocrine disrupting compounds chen et al 2018 these pioneering studies shed light on using dgt as a fully quantitative passive sampling technique to monitor polar organics such as pfass in

temperature specific and can be measured by a diffusion cell or using dgt samplers luo et al 2010 recently xad resins have been used as the core binding phase in passive air samplers loewen et al 2008 and cartridges sinclair et al 2007 for measuring pfass these resins are also known for effectively removing pfass from water and wastewater du et al 2015 xiao et al 2012a to better understand the concentration dependent environmental behavior and impact of pfass in aquatic system here we developed a dgt sampler with a binding layer comprising xad18 incorporated into agarose gel and evaluated its performance characteristics to measure two typical pfass i e pfoa and pfos the binding kinetics elution efficiencies by methanol and capacities of the xad18 binding gel were studied the possible effects of ph ionic strength dissolved organic matter dom deployment time and competition between pfoa and pfos were also investigated the dgt samplers were deployed in natural waters and wastewaters

cap with a 2 51 cm2 round window that holds all the layers tightly together guan et al 2015 the resin gel acts as a sink inducing a flux of a solute from the solution through the diffusive gel the diffusive gels and binding gels were prepared according to a previously published procedure chen et al 2012 guan et al 2017 the diffusive gel 0 75 mm thickness was prepared by dissolving 0 45 g agarose bio rad usa in 30 ml milli q water 18 2 mω cm millipore usa while being heated until the solution became transparent the hot gel solution was immediately pipetted into two preheated glass plates which were separated by a 0 75 mm thick spacer and left to cool down at room temperature for 6 h to form solidified gels the binding gel 0 5 mm thickness was made by mixing 4 g xad18 resin wet weight with 20 ml of 1 5 hot agarose solution which was mixed well and then cast between a gel casting assembly and left to cool down at room temperature both the agarose diffusive and binding gels were hydrated in milli q water and stored in 0 01 mol l 1 nacl solution 2 3 diffusion coefficient in the diffusive gel according to eq 1 diffusion coefficients d of pfoa and pfos were required for calculation of dgt measured concentrations and therefore were measured using both a previously described diffusion cell zhang and davison 1999 with minor modification and dgt samplers luo et al 2010 two pp compartments of the cell were connected by a 1 5 cm diameter circular window containing a 0 75 mm thick agarose based diffusive gel zheng et al 2015 the pes membrane was not included in the diffusion cell measurements both compartments were filled with 50 ml of 0 01 mol l 1 nacl solution and the source compartment contained additionally 2 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos the ph was the same in both the receptor and source compartments the solutions in both compartments were well stirred during the 4 h experiment aliquots of 0 2 ml of solution were collected from both compartments at intervals of 15 min for further lc ms ms analysis the slope of the linear plot of the measured mass of pfoa or pfos diffused into the receptor compartment versus experimental time was used to calculate the diffusion coefficient d cell 2 d cell s l o p e δ g c a where a cm2 is the area 1 5 cm in diameter of the connecting window of the diffusion cell c μg l 1 is the concentration of pfoa or pfos in the

pfos xad binding gel discs 2 5 cm in diameter were loaded with a known amount of perfluoroalkyl substances by immersing them in 10 ml of 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos solution with a matrix of 0 01 mol l 1 nacl while being kept shaken for different time from 1 min to 24 h the concentrations of pfoa and pfos in the solutions before and after gel immersion were measured to obtain the elution efficiency f

the laboratory 2 5 1 effect of ph and ionic strength to study the effect of ph on dgt performance triplicate dgt samplers equipped with an xad binding gel a 0 75 mm thick agarose based diffusive gel and a pes filter membrane were immersed for 12 h in well stirred solution of 2 l of 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos with a matrix of 0 01 mol l 1 nacl at various ph 4 8 the ph was adjusted using 1 mol l 1 hcl or naoh solution similarly for investigating the effect of ionic strength triplicate dgt samplers were deployed for 12 h in well stirred solutions of 2 l of 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos and different concentrations of nacl ranging from 0 1 to 500 mmol l 1 at ph 6 5 0 1 here the xad binding gels were eluted using 10 ml of 100 methanol for at least 24 h and pfoa and pfos in the eluate were analyzed

uptake triplicate dgt samplers were deployed for 12 h in 2 l well stirred solution containing 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos 0 01 mol l 1 nacl and 0 2 5 5 10 or 20 mg l 1 of humic acid at ph 6 0 0 5 2 5 3 capacity of dgt for a sampling technique based on diffusion and adsorption theory its binding capacity is a key factor for reliable measurement of target analyte adequate adsorption capacity makes it possible for dgt samplers to be deployed long term or in high concentration environments to evaluate the capacity of xad binding gels to adsorb pfoa or pfos dgt samplers equipped with xad binding gels were deployed for 10 h in 2 l of well stirred solutions containing pfoa or pfos at different concentrations 0 1 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 10 20 40 and 50 mg l 1 and 0 01 mol l 1 nacl the accumulated masses of pfoa and pfos increases linearly with the increasing concentrations in solution and fit the theoretical line calculated from the known deployment time using eq 1 the capacity of binding gels can be estimated at the point where the measured masses start to deviate from the theoretical line 2 5 4 effect of deployment time to test the effect of different deployment time on dgt performance dgt samplers were immersed in 6 l well stirred solution containing 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos and 0 01 mol l 1 nacl ph 6 5 0 1 triplicate samplers were retrieved at different time from 4 to 132 h if the accumulated mass of pfoa and pfos increases linearly with time and fits the theoretical line calculated from the known solution concentrations using eq 1 it indicates the dgt technique is suitable for measuring in situ pfoa and pfos concentrations 2 5 5 competition effects the competition effects between pfoa and pfos were assessed by deploying the dgt samplers for 12 h in 2 l of different well stirred solutions containing 0 01 mol l 1 nacl a pfoa and pfos set at 2000 and 20 μg l 1 b pfoa and pfos set at 200 and 20 μg l 1 c pfoa and pfos set at 20 and 200 μg l 1 d pfoa and pfos set at 20 and 2000 μg l 1 if the ratios of dgt measured to solution concentrations for pfoa and pfos were within the acceptable limits 1 0 0 1 there is no competition effect between the two chemicals 2 6 field trial to check the reproducibility and reliability of dgt measurements in natural waters dgt samplers were deployed in november and december 2015 in lake yueya a city lake in nanjing china and the city moat of nanjing which is connected with lake yueya sites 1 to 5 fig s1 the lake is located in the downtown and was surrounded by residential quarters water quality data of lake yueya and the city moat were provided in table s1 to extend the applicability of dgt samplers in wastewaters the samplers were tested in late may and early april 2017 in an effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in nanjing china site 6 a hexahedral unit assembled with six dgt samplers including button data loggers maxim integrated products usa set to record temperature at intervals of 3 h for calibrating temperature dependent diffusion coefficient zheng et al 2015 was placed in six sampling sites for 12 33 d table s2 upon retrieval dgt samplers were jet washed with milli q water and then stored in sealed clean plastic bag before removing the xad binding gels in the laboratory for further analysis no biofouling was visible on the filter membrane of the dgt samplers the retrieved xad binding gels were soaked in 10 ml of 100 methanol for at least 24 h 10 ml of eluates were concentrated to dryness under nitrogen followed by redissolving in 0 5 ml of 100 methanol and passing through a pp membrane syringe filter acrodisc ghp 13 mm diameter 0 2 μm pore size waters for instrumental analysis water samples 1 0 3 8 l were collected every 2 4 d at each sampling site during dgt deployments table s2 using pp containers they were transferred to the laboratory within 12 h and were stored at 4 c in pp containers before analysis before pre concentration water samples were spiked with internal standards of 13c4 pfoa and 13c4 pfos 5 ng l 1 passed through 0 45 μm pes filters and extracted by the oasis wax cartridges 6 cc 150 mg 30 μm particle size waters which were pre cleaned and pre conditioned by 4 ml of methanol containing 0 1 nh4oh 4 ml of methanol and 4 ml of milli q water yu et al 2013 at a rate of 1 2 drops s 1 the cartridges were then washed with 4 ml of buffer 25 mmol l 1 acetic acid ammonium acetate ph 4 followed by 3 min centrifugation at 3000 r min 1 to remove residual water and the target compounds were eluted with 4 ml of methanol and 4 ml of methanol containing 0 1 nh4oh the latter eluate was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen dissolved in 100 methanol and passed through a pp syringe filter for instrumental analysis 2 7 instrument analysis and qa qc to assess potential sorption of pfoa and pfos by diffusive gels filter membranes and dgt plastic moldings for housing the gels the adsorption experiment was performed diffusive gels made from agarose and pes filter membranes were soaked in 10 ml of 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos solutions and then shaken for 24 h dgt moldings were treated following the above procedure but with 50 ml solutions due to their large physical sizes the concentrations of pfoa or pfos in the solutions before and after exposure were determined to calculate the adsorption mass analytes were measured using agilent 1260 infinity high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with api4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer a pfas isolator column was placed in line between the solvent mixer and the injector to reduce the instrument background chromatographic separation of pfoa and pfos was performed using an xbridge beh c18 2 1 50 mm 2 6 μm column operated at 40 c the mobile phase consisted of a combination of two solvents solvent a 2 mmol l 1 ammonium acetate and solvent b methanol maintaining a flow rate of 300 μl min 1 the ratio of solvent a and b varied with the linear gradient program 0 5 min 5 b 0 5 1 5 min 5 20 b 1 5 5 min 20 50 b 5 10 min 50 60 b 10 10 1 min 60 100 b 10 1 11 min 100 b 11 11 1 min 100 5 b 11 1 15 min 5 b the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in negative electrospray ionization multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode two mrm reactions were acquired for pfoa 413 169 and 413 369 and pfos 499 80 and 499 99 reagent methanol blanks were run continuously between the samples to ensure that the column was clean and traces of analyte were not carried over between samples all fluorinated materials that could come into contact with the samples during sampling and extraction were removed to avoid contamination seven point internal standard curves ranging from 0 1 to 50 ng ml 1 were prepared for the quantification of individual pfoa pfos with coefficients of determination r 2 for all target analytes higher than 0 99 one procedural blank of spot sampling was analyzed to check for the contamination every 10 samples one matrix milli q water spike sample of spot sampling was analyzed to check for accuracy every 10 samples dgt blanks were assessed by analyzing the mass of pfoa and pfos on xad binding gels assembled into dgt samplers which were left for 168 h in moisturized plastic bags under room temperature without solution deployment limit of quantity loq was defined as the lowest point on the calibration curve that could be accurately measured within 20 of its theoretical value method detection limits mdls were evaluated from the loq by assuming a deployment time of 30 d at 25 c with a 0 75 mm thick diffusive gel and a 0 13 mm thick filter membrane 2 8 statistical analysis all dgt laboratory deployments were performed in at least triplicate and the results expressed as mean standard deviation statistical analysis was carried out using sas software statistically significant differences were established using analysis of variance anova and least significant difference lsd at the 5 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential sorption release of pfoa and pfos via dgt moldings diffusive gels and filter membranes to accurately measure pfoa and pfos their potential sorption onto materials used for dgt samplers should be negligible therefore pes filter membranes agarose based diffusive gels and acetonitrile butadiene styrene abs based dgt moldings were evaluated fig s2 shows the sorption of pfoa and pfos by these materials based on the difference between the amounts in solution before and after soaking the components in the solution little sorption onto pes based filter membranes agarose based diffusive gels and abs based dgt moldings 4 6 was observed it seems that the pes membrane and diffusion gel could release some pfos but insignificantly at 1 1 3 8 so in this study the pes based filter membranes agarose based diffusive gels and abs based dgt moldings were used for dgt development 3 2 dgt blanks and method detection limits the obtained dgt blanks of pfoa and pfos were 0 07 0 04 and 0 17 0 14 ng per sampler n 12 respectively the obtained mdls of pfoa and pfos were 0 31 and 0 95 ng l 1 respectively according to a recent review zareitalabad et al 2013 these mdls are lower than 75 of the reported concentrations n 475 of pfoa and pfos in surface water and almost 100 of those in wastewater treatment plant effluents n 70 these comparisons suggest that dgt coupled with lc ms ms analysis can provide sufficient sensitivity for in situ monitoring of pfoa and pfos in the environment if detection limits for dgt measured pfass were an issue a longer deployment time or samplers with a larger exposure window size could be adopted according to eq 1 this technique is particularly promising considering the much smaller exposure surface for a cylinder type dgt sampler 2 5 3 1 cm2 compared to pocis 42 cm2 even though the typical deployment time of dgt sampler is slightly longer than that 2 10 d of pocis kaserzon et al 2012 2013 li et al 2016 3 3 uptake kinetics of pfoa and pfos onto xad binding gels the performance of dgt is determined by the uptake kinetics of the binding gel about 65 of pfoa and pfos in solution were adsorbed by xad gels within 1 min fig s3 indicating fast and efficient binding of xad gels towards pfass krafft and riess 2015b the adsorption of pfoa by xad gel increased linearly with time for the first 20 min reaching 90 95 of the maximum adsorption of pfoa and pfos after 30 60 min fig s3 mean rates of binding to the resin gel in the first 10 min for pfoa and pfos were 2 86 3 65 ng cm 2 min 1 which were much higher than the theoretical binding rates 0 30 0 35 ng cm 2 min 1 calculated from eq 1 for the dgt device deployed in a solution containing a 100 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos at 25 c this suggests the binding rates were sufficiently rapid to ensure the uptake of the chemicals was efficient and effective the concentrations at the interface of the diffusive gel and binding gel were effectively zero to follow the principle of the dgt technique 3 4 elution efficiencies of pfoa and pfos consistent and quantitative elution efficiencies of pfoa and pfos from the loaded xad gels are required for accurate calculation of dgt measured concentrations previous studies showed methanol can effectively elute antibiotics from the xad binding gels chen et al 2012 2013 here methanol was used as eluent using two different procedures immersion of binding gels into 10 ml of methanol for 24 h or extraction of binding gels using two rounds of 5 ml of methanol in a sonication bath for 20 min each the obtained elution efficiencies of pfoa and pfos using methanol for 24 h were 0 95 0 07 and 1 04 0 09 respectively while 1 00 0 08 and 1 05 0 08 for elution with a sonication bath the data implied robust and consistent elution efficiencies using the two procedures the high elution efficiency 1 00 was similar to that of antibiotics from the binding gels reported by chen et al 2012 and higher than that of bisphenols 0 35 0 96 reported by zheng et al 2015 3 5 diffusion coefficients of pfoa and pfos in the agarose diffusive gels accurate measurement of diffusion coefficients of pfoa and pfos in the diffusive gels is necessary for calculating dgt measured concentrations using eq 1 the masses of pfoa and pfos diffused through the agarose diffusive gel increased linearly r 2 0 98 0 99 n 3 with time fig s4 the diffusion coefficients d cell of pfoa and pfos at 25 c were derived from the slopes of the linear plots in fig s4 and eq 2 d cell at 25 c of pfoa and pfos were 4 37 10 6 and 5 08 10 6 cm2 s 1 respectively similar to d dgt 4 58 10 6 and 4 71 10 6 cm2 s 1 respectively obtained from dgt measurement the difference between these values derived from two measurement approaches was 7 indicating reliable values of diffusion coefficients of pfoa and pfos for dgt calculation the measured d cell at 25 c was 89 and 108 of the theoretically predicted diffusion coefficients d water 4 9 10 6 and 4 7 10 6 cm2 s 1 respectively for pfoa and pfos in water pereira et al 2014 similar to the proportions of d cell versus d water of cationic and anionic metals luo et al 2010 pan et al 2015 zhang and davison 1995 the data implied that the diffusion of pfoa in the diffusive gel was slightly impeded by the structure of gel compared to water 3 6 effects of ph ionic strength and dom there are wide ranges of ph ionic strength and dom concentration in the environment so it is necessary to investigate their effects on the performance of dgt samplers for measuring pfoa and pfos the ratios of dgt measured concentrations c dgt of pfoa and pfos to deployment solution concentrations c sol under different ph ionic strengths and dom concentrations are shown in fig 1 with solution ph from 4 26 to 7 82 nacl concentrations from 0 1 to 500 mmol l 1 and humic acid concentrations from 0 to 20 mg l 1 the ratios of c dgt c sol for pfoa and pfos were 0 87 1 15 and 0 73 1 08 respectively the slightly lower ratio of 0 73 for pfos at the lowest ionic strength 0 1 mmol l 1 may be caused by the increasing repulsion interaction between the resin and anionic pfos at slightly acidic environment ph 6 5 davison 2016 similar low ratio of analytes at low ionic strength was reported elsewhere chen et al 2014 pescim et al 2012 warnken et al 2005 the results suggested that dgt samplers performed generally well for a wide range of environmental conditions i e ph 4 3 7 8 ionic strength 1 500 mmol l 1 nacl and dom concentrations 0 20 mg l 1 indicating that dgt can be used to measure pfoa and pfos in fresh water environment 3 7 capacity of dgt containing xad gels adequate capacity of the binding phase for pfass is necessary to ensure their accurate measurement by dgt when they are present at high concentrations or when long term monitoring is required the mass of pfoa and pfos bound onto the xad gel used in dgt measurements initially increased linearly with the solution concentration and followed theoretical prediction using dgt equation eq 1 fig 2 a and b the capacities of dgt for pfoa and pfos were at least 196 and 246 μg per disk respectively assuming that the concentration of pfoa or pfos in water was 100 μg l 1 the maximum deployment time is more than 10 weeks these high capacities implied that dgt was suitable for long time hours to weeks deployments to measure pfass 3 8 effect of deployment time and competition effect between pfoa and pfos the measured masses of pfoa and pfos accumulated by dgt increased linearly with deployment time t over 132 h fig 2c and d the function of mass vs time concurs with previous work for bisphenols and oxyanions guan et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 good agreement between dgt measurement and theoretical prediction not only confirmed the role of xad binding gel acting as an infinite sink but also supported the validity of eq 1 to calculate the dgt measured concentrations in this study i e c dgt dgt samplers were deployed in a series of synthetic solutions with different concentrations 20 2000 μg l 1 and ratios of pfoa and pfos even though the ratios of dgt measured to solution concentrations for pfoa and pfos slightly exceeded the acceptable limits 1 0 0 1 there was no significant difference p 0 05 among the simulated solutions table s3 this indicated the competition effects between pfoa and pfos were generally negligible though expected to be negligible considering the high capacities of dgt the possible competition effect among other pfass and organic pollutants in both freshwater and seawater is the subject of further work 3 9 field trial based on demonstrated good performance characteristics dgt technique was a robust tool for measuring pfass in natural waters to test the reliability of dgt in an aquatic environment and wastewaters the samplers were deployed in situ in a lake and an adjacent river and a municipal wwtp effluent for 12 33 d while water samples were actively collected every 2 4 d for analysis in the laboratory pfoa and pfos were detected by both the spot sampling method and dgt measurement figs 3 and 4 figs s5 and s6 concentrations of pfoa and pfos in the natural lake and river measured by the spot sampling approach ranged from 13 6 to 22 4 ng l 1 and 6 7 to 54 2 ng l 1 the values of pfoa were comparable to those reported for other rivers and lakes including huai river 6 2 47 ng l 1 yu et al 2013 lake taihu 11 37 ng l 1 and liao river n d 28 ng l 1 in china yang et al 2011 and the great lakes 11 34 ng l 1 in north america myers et al 2012 sinclair et al 2006 for pfos the values were comparable to those reported for other lakes and rivers such as the huai river 1 4 25 ng l 1 and lake taihu 8 5 21 ng l 1 yu et al 2013 and the great lakes 2 8 30 ng l 1 myers et al 2012 sinclair et al 2006 some concentration fluctuations of pfoa and especially pfos were observed using the spot sampling method figs 3 and 4 fig s5 with the relative standard deviations rsds for pfoa and pfos were 2 6 30 and 41 56 respectively the data demonstrated that during dgt deployment concentrations of pfass in water were fluctuating sakurai et al 2016 reported that the seasonal concentrations of pfos in tokyo bay were much lower than those of pfoa with higher concentrations of pfos in winter than other seasons sakurai et al 2010 the variation in sources for pfos in winter season may account for the fluctuations of pfos in waters of sampling sites 1 to 5 the solid lines in figs 3 and 4 and fig s5 show the average dgt measured concentrations for pfoa and pfos and the dotted lines show the maximum and minimum concentrations almost all lines had some overlap with the data points obtained by the spot sampling method demonstrating the accuracy of the time integrated concentrations of pfass measured by dgt it seems that there were concentration differences in pfass detected by dgt and grab samples figs s5 and s6 the ratios for pfass concentrations from passive vs spot sampling were compared with reported data table s4 in this study the ratios for pfoa in natural waters and wastewaters were 0 94 1 15 and 0 64 0 82 respectively whereas for pfos the values were 0 55 0 72 and 0 79 1 09 respectively these values were generally agreeable with reported ratios from pocis vs spot sampling kaserzon et al 2012 2013 li et al 2016 the slightly tighter ratio ranges provided by pocis probably resulted from the relatively small variation in the spot sampling measurements generally 23 with one exception kaserzon et al 2012 2013 compared to those in this study pocis based samplers have their advantage compared to dgt the sampling rates for pfoa and pfos by pocis based samplers were 0 12 0 16 l d 1 and 0 15 0 36 l d 1 respectively fedorova et al 2013 kaserzon et al 2012 for dgt assuming that c dgt c sol was 1 0 and the temperature was 25 c the sampling rate a d δg for pfoa and pfos was 0 011 and 0 013 l d 1 respectively this lower sampling rate for dgt indicated that a longer deployment time was needed to achieve the same detection limit however the rsds of dgt measured concentrations for pfoa and pfos were much smaller i e 2 3 31 and 4 2 38 respectively than those from spot sampling in this study variation in hydrodynamic conditions and chemical concentrations during long term deployment of dgt samplers in the field may explain the relatively large rsds 20 of dgt measured pfoa in one site site 6 fig s6 and pfos in four sites sites 1 3 4 and 6 figs s5 and s6 overall the data demonstrated the robustness of the developed dgt method for measurement of pfass in field although dgt has only been tested for the measurement of two pfass pfoa and pfos it is likely to be capable of measuring other pfass with further performance characterization in addition dgt can be potentially adopted to study the decomposition products of pfass development of the dgt technique on overall pfass will be particularly useful to utilize the dgt technique to assess the availability behavior fate and risks of fluorinated organic compounds in the environment 4 conclusions there is a trend of using passive samplers to monitor organic pollutants including pfass in the aquatic environment in this study we present a dgt passive sampling method to measure pfass and validated the device s performance for a wide range of environmental conditions i e ph 4 3 7 8 ionic strength 1 500 mmol l 1 nacl and dom concentrations 0 20 mg l 1 measurement of pre concentrated pfass in the eluates using high sensitivity lc ms ms simplifies the pretreatment of samples in the laboratory coupling dgt in situ sampling pre concentration technique with lc ms ms detection system is a promising method to measure pfass in nature waters and wastewaters compared to other passive sampling methods dgt has its unique feature firstly under typical water flow conditions 2 cm s 1 the calculation of dgt measured concentration relies mainly on the sampling time and temperature dependent diffusion coefficient d which can be easily corrected especially using accessible temperature data loggers therefore in situ calibration is no longer necessary for dgt deployment in field secondly measurement made by dgt samplers may be less affected by environmental hydrodynamic conditions i e water flow due to much thicker diffusive gel layer compared to the dbl diffusive boundary

19356,to better understand the environmental impact of ubiquitous perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in waters reliable and robust measurement techniques are needed as one of the most widely used passive sampling approaches diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is not only easy to handle but also provides time weighted analyte concentrations based on dgt with xad18 as a binding agent we developed a new methodology to measure two frequently detected pfass in surface waters and wastewaters i e perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos their diffusion coefficients in the diffusive gel measured using an independent diffusion cell were 4 37 10 6 and 5 08 10 6 cm2 s 1 at 25 c respectively dgt had a high capacity for pfoa and pfos at 196 and 246 μg per gel disk suggesting the dgt sampler was suitable for deployment of several weeks time integrated concentrations of pfoa and pfos in a natural lake and river and a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent using dgt samplers deployed in situ for 12 33 d were comparable to those measured by a solid phase extraction method coupled with high frequency grab sampling this study demonstrates that dgt is an effective tool for in situ monitoring of pfass in natural waters and wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords perfluoroalkyl substances diffusive gradients in thin films diffusion coefficients passive sampling surface waters wastewaters 1 introduction emerging contaminants perfluoroalkyl substances pfass have been produced and used for more than 60 years lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 due to their thermal stability and oxidative resistance pfass are widely used as surfactants and surface protectors in commercial products and industries including protective coatings and fire fighting foams giesy and kannan 2002 kusoglu and weber 2017 renner 2001 wu et al 2015 generally two sources account for the release of pfass into the environment one is direct sources such as the manufacturing of pfass and consumption of products containing pfass and the other is indirect sources like reaction impurities or degradation of precursors zareitalabad et al 2013 two long chain fully fluorinated pfass perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos are ubiquitously present in natural waters boulanger et al 2004 lindim et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 drinking water hu et al 2016 schwanz et al 2016 xiao et al 2013 and wastewater arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 kwon et al 2017 pan et al 2016 xiao et al 2012b at concentrations ranging from pg l 1 to μg l 1 levels krafft and riess 2015a zareitalabad et al 2013 besides it is generally accepted that they are persistent bioaccumulative and recalcitrant to removal by drinking water and municipal wastewater treatment xiao 2017 to reduce their emission pfos was listed on the stockholm convention as persistent organic pollutants in may 2009 whereas pfoa was proposed by european union to be listed in the stockholm convention in october 2015 lam et al 2017 the environmental quality standard expressed as an annual average value for pfos in freshwaters corresponding to the long term exposure scenario for human consumption of freshwater fish set by european commission is at 0 65 ng l 1 whereas a provisional threshold of 0 4 μg l 1 was proposed by us environmental protection agency usepa for pfoa in drinking waters valsecchi et al 2017 in 2016 usepa issued lifetime drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l 1 for the combined concentration of pfoa and pfos weber et al 2017 due to their relatively high polarity and moderate water solubility the majority of pfass are distributed in the liquid phase kaserzon et al 2012 li et al 2017 as such accurate determination of pfass concentrations in natural waters and wastewaters is necessary to better understand their biogeochemistry and to further evaluate their potential effect on aquatic organisms and human beings most strategies for pfass measurement need to collect large volume water samples through grab spot sampling which are sent back to laboratory for chemical pre concentration before quantitative analysis using high sensitive equipments such as liquid chromatography negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms richardson and kimura 2016 yu et al 2013 however the methodology provides only snapshots of pfass concentration at specific sampling time for periodical monitoring it can be time consuming and costly to screen pfass and capture the concentration dependent biogeochemical behavior of pfass in environments in situ analysis is preferable however field analysis of pfass were not feasible due to the non portability and non specification of instruments giesy and kannan 2002 therefore in situ preconcentration of pfass in passive sampling samplers followed by laboratorial analysis is an alternatively promising solution roll and halden 2016 vrana et al 2005 moreover this practice is a very common approach for many other groups of organic substances the advantages of passive sampling over traditional spot sampling include in situ time integrating and labor saving continuous monitoring lower detection limits cleaner sample matrices and easier sample storage based on polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis several passive samplers have been successfully used to monitor pfass alvarez et al 2007 fedorova et al 2013 kaserzon et al 2012 however a drawback of pocis based samplers is the necessity of in situ calibration of the sampling rates caused by the different field conditions from laboratory calibrations kaserzon et al 2014 hydrodynamic conditions such as flow rate temperature and turbulence could affect sampling rates thereby contributing to the uncertainty and variation in concentration estimates of pfass in water kaserzon et al 2013 2014 passive sampling technique based on diffusive gradients in thin films technique dgt is independent of water flow rate so it has the potential to provide concentrations with improved performance compared to other passive samplers sigg et al 2006 in the last 20 years dgt has been established to measure

diffusive gels and binding gels were prepared according to a previously published procedure chen et al 2012 guan et al 2017 the diffusive gel 0 75 mm thickness was prepared by dissolving 0 45 g agarose bio rad usa in 30 ml milli q water 18 2 mω cm millipore usa while being heated until the solution became transparent the hot gel solution was immediately pipetted into two preheated glass

were hydrated in milli q water and stored in 0 01 mol l 1 nacl solution 2 3 diffusion coefficient in the diffusive gel according to eq 1 diffusion coefficients d of pfoa and pfos were required for calculation of dgt measured concentrations and therefore were measured using both a previously described diffusion cell zhang and davison 1999 with minor modification and dgt samplers luo et al 2010 two pp compartments of the cell were connected by a 1 5 cm diameter circular window containing a 0 75 mm thick agarose based diffusive gel zheng et al 2015 the pes membrane was not included in the diffusion cell measurements both compartments were filled with 50 ml of 0 01 mol l 1 nacl solution and the source compartment contained additionally 2 mg l 1 pfoa or pfos the ph was the same in both the receptor and source compartments the solutions in both compartments were well stirred during the 4 h experiment aliquots of 0 2 ml of solution were collected from both compartments at intervals of 15 min for further lc ms ms analysis the slope of the linear plot of the measured mass of pfoa or pfos diffused into the receptor compartment versus experimental time was used to calculate the

with xad binding gel diffusive gel and pes membrane in 2 l of 0 01 mol l 1 nacl solution containing 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos for 24 h t and assuming that the dgt measured concentration equals to the solution concentration c sol the diffusion coefficient d dgt was obtained using eq 4 where m is the measured mass of pfoa or pfos absorbed by the xad binding gel within the dgt sampler obtained from

and f e a u is the elution efficiency of pfoa or pfos from the xad binding gel 2 4 kinetics of binding and elution efficiency to investigate the binding kinetics of the xad binding gels to pfoa and pfos xad binding gel discs 2 5 cm in diameter were loaded with a known amount of perfluoroalkyl substances by immersing them in 10 ml of 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos solution with a matrix of 0 01 mol l 1 nacl while being kept shaken for different time from 1 min to 24 h the concentrations of pfoa and pfos in the solutions before and after gel immersion were measured to obtain the elution efficiency f

the laboratory 2 5 1 effect of ph and ionic strength to study the effect of ph on dgt performance triplicate dgt samplers equipped with an xad binding gel a 0 75 mm thick agarose based diffusive gel and a pes filter membrane were immersed for 12 h in well stirred solution of 2 l of 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos with a matrix of 0 01 mol l 1 nacl at various ph 4 8 the ph was adjusted using 1 mol l 1 hcl or naoh solution similarly for investigating the effect of ionic strength triplicate dgt samplers were deployed for 12 h in well stirred solutions of 2 l of 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos and different concentrations of nacl ranging from 0 1 to 500 mmol l 1 at ph 6 5 0 1 here the xad binding gels were eluted using 10 ml of 100 methanol for at least 24 h and pfoa and pfos in the eluate were analyzed 2 5 2 effect of dom dom may affect the uptake of pfass by passive samplers li et al 2011 natural water contains typically 2 10 mg l 1 of dom drever 1997 xu and guo 2017 to determine its effect on dgt uptake triplicate dgt samplers were deployed for 12 h in 2 l well stirred solution containing 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos 0 01 mol l 1 nacl and 0 2 5 5 10 or 20 mg l 1 of humic acid at ph 6 0 0 5 2 5 3 capacity of dgt for a sampling technique based on diffusion and adsorption theory its binding capacity is a key factor for reliable measurement of target analyte adequate adsorption capacity makes it possible for dgt samplers to be deployed long term or in high concentration environments to evaluate the capacity of xad binding gels to adsorb pfoa or pfos dgt samplers equipped with xad binding gels were deployed for 10 h in 2 l of well stirred solutions containing pfoa or pfos at different concentrations 0 1 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 10 20 40 and 50 mg l 1 and 0 01 mol l 1 nacl the accumulated masses of pfoa and pfos increases linearly with the increasing concentrations in solution and fit the theoretical line calculated from the known deployment time using eq 1 the capacity of binding gels can be estimated at the point where the measured masses start to deviate from the theoretical line 2 5 4 effect of deployment time to test the effect of different deployment time on dgt performance dgt samplers were immersed in 6 l well stirred solution containing 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos and 0 01 mol l 1 nacl ph 6 5 0 1 triplicate samplers were retrieved at different time from 4 to 132 h if the accumulated mass of pfoa and pfos increases linearly with time and fits the theoretical line calculated from the known solution concentrations using eq 1 it indicates the dgt technique is suitable for measuring in situ pfoa and pfos concentrations 2 5 5 competition effects the competition effects between pfoa and pfos were assessed by deploying the dgt samplers for 12 h in 2 l of different well stirred solutions containing 0 01 mol l 1 nacl a pfoa and pfos set at 2000 and 20 μg l 1 b pfoa and pfos set at 200 and 20 μg l 1 c pfoa and pfos set at 20 and 200 μg l 1 d pfoa and pfos set at 20 and 2000 μg l 1 if the ratios of dgt measured to solution concentrations for pfoa and pfos were within the acceptable limits 1 0 0 1 there is no competition effect between the two chemicals 2 6 field trial to check the reproducibility and reliability of dgt measurements in natural waters dgt samplers were deployed in november and december 2015 in lake yueya a city lake in nanjing china and the city moat of nanjing which is connected with lake yueya sites 1 to 5 fig s1 the lake is located in the downtown and was surrounded by residential quarters water quality data of lake yueya and the city moat were provided in table s1 to extend the applicability of dgt samplers in wastewaters the samplers were tested in late may and early april 2017 in an effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in nanjing china site 6 a hexahedral unit assembled with six dgt samplers including button data loggers maxim integrated products usa set to record temperature at intervals of 3 h for calibrating temperature dependent diffusion coefficient zheng et al 2015 was placed in six sampling sites for 12 33 d table s2 upon retrieval dgt samplers were jet washed with milli q water and then stored in sealed clean plastic bag before removing the xad binding gels in the laboratory for further analysis no biofouling was visible on the filter membrane of the dgt samplers the retrieved xad

a pp membrane syringe filter acrodisc ghp 13 mm diameter 0 2 μm pore size waters for instrumental analysis water samples 1 0 3 8 l were collected every 2 4 d at each sampling site during dgt deployments table s2 using pp containers they were transferred to the laboratory within 12 h and were stored at 4 c in pp containers before analysis before pre concentration water samples were spiked with internal standards of 13c4 pfoa and 13c4 pfos 5 ng l 1 passed through 0 45 μm pes filters and extracted by the oasis wax cartridges 6 cc 150 mg 30 μm particle size waters which were pre cleaned and pre conditioned by 4 ml of methanol containing 0 1 nh4oh 4 ml of methanol and 4 ml of milli q water yu et al 2013 at a rate of 1 2 drops s 1 the cartridges were then washed with 4 ml of buffer 25 mmol l 1 acetic acid ammonium acetate ph 4 followed by 3 min centrifugation at 3000 r min 1 to remove residual water and the target compounds were eluted with 4 ml of methanol and 4 ml of methanol

qa qc to assess potential sorption of pfoa and pfos by diffusive gels filter membranes and dgt plastic moldings for housing the gels the adsorption experiment was performed diffusive gels made from agarose and pes filter membranes were soaked in 10 ml of 50 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos solutions and then shaken for 24 h dgt moldings were treated following the above procedure but with 50 ml solutions due to their large physical sizes the concentrations of pfoa or pfos in the solutions before and after exposure were determined to calculate the adsorption mass analytes were measured using agilent 1260 infinity high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with api4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer a pfas isolator column was placed in line between the solvent mixer and the injector to reduce the instrument background chromatographic separation of pfoa and pfos was performed using an xbridge beh c18 2 1 50 mm 2 6 μm column operated at 40 c the mobile phase consisted of a combination of two solvents solvent a 2 mmol l 1 ammonium acetate and solvent b methanol maintaining a flow rate of 300 μl min 1 the ratio of solvent a and b varied with the linear gradient program 0 5 min 5 b 0

electrospray ionization multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode two mrm reactions were acquired for pfoa 413 169 and 413 369 and pfos 499 80 and 499 99 reagent methanol blanks were run continuously between the samples to ensure that the column was clean and traces of analyte were not carried over between samples all fluorinated materials that could come into contact with the samples during sampling and extraction were removed to avoid contamination seven point internal standard curves ranging from 0 1 to 50 ng ml 1 were prepared for the quantification of individual pfoa pfos with coefficients of determination r 2 for all target analytes higher than 0 99 one procedural blank of spot sampling was analyzed to check for the contamination every 10 samples one matrix milli q water spike sample of spot sampling was analyzed to check for accuracy every 10 samples dgt blanks were assessed by analyzing the mass of pfoa and pfos on xad binding gels assembled into dgt samplers which were left for 168 h in moisturized plastic bags under room temperature without solution deployment limit of quantity loq was defined as the lowest point on the calibration curve that could be accurately measured within 20 of its theoretical value method detection limits mdls were evaluated from the loq by assuming a deployment time of 30 d at 25 c with a 0 75 mm thick diffusive gel and a 0 13 mm thick filter membrane 2 8 statistical analysis all dgt laboratory deployments were performed in at least triplicate and the results expressed as mean standard deviation statistical analysis was carried out using sas software statistically significant differences were established using analysis of variance anova and least significant difference lsd at the 5 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential sorption release of pfoa and pfos via dgt moldings diffusive gels and filter membranes to accurately measure pfoa and pfos their potential sorption onto materials used for dgt samplers should be negligible therefore pes filter membranes agarose based diffusive gels and acetonitrile butadiene styrene abs based dgt moldings were evaluated fig s2 shows the sorption of pfoa and pfos by these materials based on the difference between the amounts in solution before and after soaking the components in the solution little sorption onto pes based filter membranes agarose based diffusive gels and abs based dgt moldings 4 6 was observed it seems that the pes membrane and diffusion gel could release some pfos but insignificantly at 1 1 3 8 so in this study the pes based filter membranes agarose based diffusive gels and abs based dgt moldings were used for dgt development 3 2 dgt blanks and method detection limits the obtained dgt blanks of pfoa and pfos were 0 07 0 04 and 0 17 0 14 ng per sampler n 12 respectively the obtained mdls of pfoa and pfos were 0 31 and 0 95 ng l 1 respectively according to a recent review zareitalabad et al 2013 these mdls are lower than 75 of the reported concentrations n 475 of pfoa and pfos in surface water and almost 100 of those in wastewater treatment plant effluents n 70 these comparisons suggest that dgt coupled with lc ms ms analysis can provide sufficient sensitivity for in situ monitoring of pfoa and pfos in the environment if detection limits for dgt measured pfass were an issue a longer deployment time or samplers with a larger exposure window size could be adopted according to eq 1 this technique is particularly promising considering the much smaller exposure surface for a cylinder type dgt sampler 2 5 3 1 cm2 compared to pocis 42 cm2 even though the typical deployment time of dgt sampler is slightly longer than that 2 10 d of pocis kaserzon et al 2012 2013 li et al 2016 3 3 uptake kinetics of pfoa and pfos onto xad binding gels the performance of dgt is determined by the uptake kinetics of the binding gel about 65 of pfoa and pfos in solution were adsorbed by xad gels within 1 min fig s3 indicating fast and efficient binding of xad gels towards pfass krafft and riess 2015b the adsorption of pfoa by xad gel increased linearly with time for the first 20 min reaching 90 95 of the maximum adsorption of pfoa and pfos after 30 60 min fig s3 mean rates of binding to the resin gel in the first 10 min for pfoa and pfos were 2 86 3 65 ng cm 2 min 1 which were much higher than the theoretical binding rates 0 30 0 35 ng cm 2 min 1 calculated from eq 1 for the dgt device deployed in a solution containing a 100 μg l 1 pfoa or pfos at 25 c this suggests the binding rates were sufficiently rapid to ensure the uptake of the chemicals was efficient and effective the concentrations at the interface of the diffusive gel and binding gel were effectively zero to follow the principle of the dgt technique 3 4 elution efficiencies of pfoa and pfos consistent and quantitative elution efficiencies of pfoa and pfos from the loaded xad gels are required for accurate calculation of dgt measured concentrations previous studies showed methanol can effectively elute antibiotics from the xad binding gels chen et al 2012 2013 here methanol was used as eluent using two different procedures immersion of binding gels into 10 ml of methanol for 24 h or extraction of binding gels using two rounds of 5 ml of methanol in a sonication bath for 20 min each the obtained elution efficiencies of pfoa and pfos using methanol for 24 h were 0 95 0 07 and 1 04 0 09 respectively while 1 00 0 08 and 1 05 0 08 for elution with a sonication bath the data implied robust and consistent elution efficiencies using the two procedures the high elution efficiency 1 00 was similar to that of antibiotics from the binding gels reported by chen et al 2012 and higher than that of bisphenols 0 35 0 96 reported by zheng et al 2015 3 5 diffusion coefficients of pfoa and pfos in the agarose diffusive gels accurate measurement of diffusion coefficients of pfoa and pfos in the diffusive gels is necessary for calculating dgt measured concentrations using eq 1 the masses of pfoa and pfos diffused through the agarose diffusive gel increased linearly r 2 0 98 0 99 n 3 with time fig s4 the diffusion coefficients d cell of pfoa and pfos at 25 c were derived from the slopes of the linear plots in fig s4 and eq 2 d cell at 25 c of pfoa and pfos were 4 37 10 6 and 5 08 10 6 cm2 s 1 respectively similar to d dgt 4 58 10 6 and 4 71 10 6 cm2 s 1 respectively obtained from dgt measurement the difference between these values derived from two measurement approaches was 7 indicating reliable values of diffusion coefficients of pfoa and pfos for dgt calculation the measured d cell at 25 c was 89 and 108 of the theoretically predicted diffusion coefficients d water 4 9 10 6 and 4 7 10 6 cm2 s 1 respectively for pfoa and pfos in water pereira et al 2014 similar to the proportions of d cell versus d water of cationic and anionic metals luo et al 2010 pan et al 2015 zhang and davison 1995 the data implied that the diffusion of pfoa in the diffusive gel was slightly impeded by the structure of gel compared to water 3 6 effects of ph ionic strength and dom there are wide ranges of ph ionic strength and dom concentration in the environment so it is necessary to investigate their effects on the performance of dgt samplers for measuring pfoa and pfos the ratios of dgt measured concentrations c dgt of pfoa and pfos to deployment solution concentrations c sol under different ph ionic strengths and dom concentrations are shown in fig 1 with solution ph from 4 26 to 7 82 nacl concentrations from 0 1 to 500 mmol l 1 and humic acid concentrations from 0 to 20 mg l 1 the ratios of c dgt c sol for pfoa and pfos were 0 87 1 15 and 0 73 1 08 respectively the slightly lower ratio of 0 73 for pfos at the lowest ionic strength 0 1 mmol l 1 may be caused by the increasing repulsion interaction between the resin and anionic pfos at slightly acidic environment ph 6 5 davison 2016 similar low ratio of analytes at low ionic strength was reported elsewhere chen et al 2014 pescim et al 2012 warnken et al 2005 the results suggested that dgt samplers performed generally well for a wide range of environmental conditions i e ph 4 3 7 8 ionic strength 1 500 mmol l 1 nacl and dom concentrations 0 20 mg l 1 indicating that dgt can be used to measure pfoa and pfos in fresh water environment 3 7 capacity of dgt containing xad gels adequate capacity of the binding phase for pfass is necessary to ensure their accurate measurement by dgt when they are present at high concentrations or when long term monitoring is required the mass of pfoa and pfos bound onto the xad gel used in dgt measurements initially increased linearly with the solution concentration and followed theoretical prediction using dgt equation eq 1 fig 2 a and b the capacities of dgt for pfoa and pfos were at least 196 and 246 μg per disk respectively assuming that the concentration of pfoa or pfos in water was 100 μg l 1 the maximum deployment time is more than 10 weeks these high capacities implied that dgt was suitable for long time hours to weeks deployments to measure pfass 3 8 effect of deployment time and competition effect between pfoa and pfos the measured masses of pfoa and pfos accumulated by dgt increased linearly with deployment time t over 132 h fig 2c and d the function of mass vs time concurs with previous work for bisphenols and oxyanions guan et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 good agreement between dgt measurement and theoretical prediction not only confirmed the role of xad binding gel acting as an infinite sink but also supported the validity of eq 1 to calculate the dgt measured concentrations in this study i e c dgt dgt samplers were deployed in a series of synthetic solutions with different concentrations 20 2000 μg l 1 and ratios of pfoa and pfos even though the ratios of dgt measured to solution concentrations for pfoa and pfos slightly exceeded the acceptable limits 1 0 0 1 there was no significant difference p 0 05 among the simulated solutions table s3 this indicated the competition effects between pfoa and pfos were generally negligible though expected to be negligible considering the high capacities of dgt the possible competition effect among other pfass and organic pollutants in both freshwater and seawater is the subject of further work 3 9 field trial based on demonstrated good performance characteristics dgt technique was a robust tool for measuring pfass in natural waters to test the reliability of dgt in an aquatic environment and wastewaters the samplers were deployed in situ in a lake and an adjacent river and a municipal wwtp effluent for 12 33 d while water samples were actively collected every 2 4 d for analysis in the laboratory pfoa and pfos were detected by both the spot sampling method and dgt measurement figs 3 and 4 figs s5 and s6 concentrations of pfoa and pfos in the natural lake and river measured by the spot sampling approach ranged from 13 6 to 22 4 ng l 1 and 6 7 to 54 2 ng l 1 the values of pfoa were comparable to those reported for other rivers and lakes including huai river 6 2 47 ng l 1 yu et al 2013 lake taihu 11 37 ng l 1 and liao river n d 28 ng l 1 in china yang et al 2011 and the great lakes 11 34 ng l 1 in north america myers et al 2012 sinclair et al 2006 for pfos the values were comparable to those reported for other lakes and rivers such as the huai river 1 4 25 ng l 1 and lake taihu 8 5 21 ng l 1 yu et al 2013 and the great lakes 2 8 30 ng l 1 myers et al 2012 sinclair et al 2006 some concentration fluctuations of pfoa and especially pfos were observed using the spot sampling method figs 3 and 4 fig s5 with the relative standard deviations rsds for pfoa and pfos were 2 6 30 and 41 56 respectively the data demonstrated that during dgt deployment concentrations of pfass in water were fluctuating sakurai et al 2016 reported that the seasonal concentrations of pfos in tokyo bay were much lower than those of pfoa with higher concentrations of pfos in winter than other seasons sakurai et al 2010 the variation in sources for pfos in winter season may account for the fluctuations of pfos in waters of sampling sites 1 to 5 the solid lines in figs 3 and 4 and fig s5 show the average dgt measured concentrations for pfoa and pfos and the dotted lines show the maximum and minimum concentrations almost all lines had some overlap with the data points obtained by the spot sampling method demonstrating the accuracy of the time integrated concentrations of pfass measured by dgt it seems that there were concentration differences in pfass detected by dgt and grab samples figs s5 and s6 the ratios for pfass concentrations from passive vs spot sampling were compared with reported data table s4 in this study the ratios for pfoa in natural waters and wastewaters were 0 94 1 15 and 0 64 0 82 respectively whereas for pfos the values were 0 55 0 72 and 0 79 1 09 respectively these values were generally agreeable with reported ratios from pocis vs spot sampling kaserzon et al 2012 2013 li et al 2016 the slightly tighter ratio ranges provided by pocis probably resulted from the relatively small variation in the spot sampling measurements generally 23 with one exception kaserzon et al 2012 2013 compared to those in this study pocis based samplers have their advantage compared to dgt the sampling rates for pfoa and pfos by pocis based samplers were 0 12 0 16 l d 1 and 0 15 0 36 l d 1 respectively fedorova et al 2013 kaserzon et al 2012 for dgt assuming that c dgt c sol was 1 0 and the temperature was 25 c the sampling rate a d δg for pfoa and pfos was 0 011 and 0 013 l d 1 respectively this lower sampling rate for dgt indicated that a longer deployment time was needed to achieve the same detection limit however the rsds of dgt measured concentrations for pfoa and pfos were much smaller i e 2 3 31 and 4 2 38 respectively than those from spot sampling in this study variation in hydrodynamic conditions and chemical concentrations during long term deployment of dgt samplers in the field may explain the relatively large rsds 20 of dgt measured pfoa in one site site 6 fig s6 and pfos in four sites sites 1 3 4 and 6 figs s5 and s6 overall the data demonstrated the robustness of the developed dgt method for measurement of pfass in field although dgt has only been tested for the measurement of two pfass pfoa and pfos it is likely to be capable of measuring other pfass with further performance characterization in addition dgt can be potentially adopted to study the decomposition products of pfass development of the dgt technique on overall pfass will be particularly useful to utilize the dgt technique to assess the

aquatic environment in this study we present a dgt passive sampling method to measure pfass and validated the device s performance for a wide range of environmental conditions i e ph 4 3 7 8 ionic strength 1 500 mmol l 1 nacl and dom concentrations 0 20 mg l 1 measurement of pre concentrated pfass in the eluates using high sensitivity lc ms ms simplifies the pretreatment of samples in the laboratory coupling dgt in situ sampling pre concentration technique with lc ms ms detection system is a promising method to measure pfass in nature waters and wastewaters compared to other passive sampling methods dgt has its unique feature firstly under typical water flow conditions 2 cm s 1 the calculation of dgt measured concentration relies mainly on the sampling time and temperature dependent diffusion coefficient d which can be easily corrected especially using accessible temperature data loggers therefore in situ calibration is no longer necessary for dgt deployment in field secondly measurement made by dgt samplers may be less affected by environmental hydrodynamic conditions i e water flow due to much thicker diffusive gel layer compared to the dbl diffusive boundary

19357,seawater reverse osmosis swro is becoming an increasingly important source of potable water in arid and semi arid regions worldwide discharge of brine effluent from desalination facilities has been shown to significantly impact coastal marine ecosystems ranging from seagrass meadows to microbial communities in this study we examined the impacts of increased salinity 10 above ambient and presence of antiscalants 0 2 mg l 1 polyphosphonate based on three reef building coral species stylophora pistillata acropora tenuis and pocillopora verrucosa from the gulf of aqaba northern red sea our results indicate that the corals as well as associated bacteria and algae were significantly impaired by the elevated salinity and antiscalants leading to partial bleaching specifically the abundance of bacteria and symbiotic algae as well as calcification rates were typically lower 20 85 50 90 and 40 50 respectively following incubations with both amendments however the impact of desalination brine was often species specific thus we propose that the ecotoxicological criteria used for hard corals should be determined based on the sensitivity of key species in the community

desalination via reverse osmosis swro is becoming a frequent solution for supplying large volumes of potable water in arid and semi arid countries worldwide grady et al 2014 un wwap 2015 large scale swro plants draw coastal water as feed source and produce high salinity brine effluent as a by product which is typically discharged back into the coastal environment salinity measured in the mixing zone of swro discharge outfalls is reported to be 1 10 above ambient and in rare occasions 25 above ambient levels kress et al 2014 petersen et al 2018 concomitant with higher salinity swro effluent often contains chemicals that are used during the desalination process such as antiscalants and coagulants höpner and lattemann 2003 missimer and maliva 2017 roberts et al 2010 antiscalants are added in concentrations dictated by environmental regulations set by individual countries and are therefore not consistent between desalination plants greenlee et al 2009 jenkins et al 2012 in israel environmental legislation instructed a maximum antiscalant concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 to the feedwater belkin et al 2017 israel ministry of environmental protection 2013 these compounds are assumed to discharge with the brine into the environment at similar concentrations but are generally considered unavailable for biological processes refractory höpner and lattemann 2003 although desalination capacity has increased substantially worldwide the environmental impacts of brine effluent on coastal ecosystems have received little attention lattemann 2009 petersen et al 2018 roberts et al 2010

2017 sánchez lizaso et al 2008 these studies demonstrated that the response and sensitivity to brine exposure varies considerably between species sites brine concentration and exposure time to date only a handful of studies have investigated the impact of desalination brine on corals despite the fact that large scale desalination facilities are often situated near coral reefs lattemann and höpner 2008 mabrook 1994 muthiga and szmant 1987 röthig et al 2016 van der merwe et al 2014 since coral reefs are highly productive ecosystems with high biodiversity and biomass loss of coverage may have cascading effects on higher trophic levels in addition coral reefs support local economies through fishing and tourisms and are therefore considered to be important assets for coastal communities around such reefs including the northern gulf of aqaba goa red sea which borders israel jordan and egypt currently several large scale desalination facilities are planned to be constructed on the north shores of the gulf of aqaba yet impacts on native corals following brine discharge are unknown scleractinian corals hermatypic are a diverse group of marine invertebrates which are the key

subsequent reduction in coral coverage loss of coral coverage has previously been reported in the red sea in direct proximity of desalination plants mabrook 1994 yet a recent in situ study reported no mortality or measurable impact on the photosynthetic efficiency of the coral f granulosa in that region van der merwe et al 2014 however major restructuring of the tissue related microbiome of f granulosa has been observed in a related study following controlled incubations with elevated salinities röthig et al 2016 to date very little data are available on the various possible effects of swro desalination brine including the effects of higher salinity and specific chemicals that are associated with the brine on the physiology of reef building corals in this study we investigated the physiological responses of three key reef building coral species stylophora pistillata acropora tenuis and pocillopora verrucosa in the goa where construction and operation of several desalination facilities is expected in the near future to simulated brine discharge to this end collected coral specimens were grown for 2 4 weeks under elevated salinities 10 above ambient and elevated salinity with 0 2 mg l 1 polyphosphonate antiscalant added thus mimicking the expected exposure of corals to desalination brine in close proximity to an outfall these experiments were conducted in open aquaria

major builders of the coral reefs in the goa 2 material and methods 2 1 collection of corals and experimental setup colonies of stylophora pistillata acropora tenuis and pocillopora verrucosa were

fisher lsd post hoc analysis with significance of p 0 05 values and significance are reported in supporting information table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the appearance of reef building corals following exposure to experimental treatments images of s pistillata a tenuis and p verrucosa demonstrate clear signs of bleaching following incubation with elevated salinity and elevated salinity with the addition of antiscalants for four and two weeks respectively fig 1 concurrently coral tissue loss was recorded and the polyps of all three coral species in both treatments were highly retracted this negative response was mostly notable for p verrucosa and a tenuis and to a lesser extent for s pistillata fig 1 we attribute these responses to osmotic stress induced by the brine and note that the impact on corals as a holobiome is species specific severe impacts on coral health due to increased salinities 10 have been shown before ferrier pagès et al 1999 lirman and manzello 2009 muthiga and szmant 1987 however some studies suggest that corals may adapt and recover after weeks of exposure to enhanced salinity retraction of polyps is the first line of defense of corals to osmotic shock and since the polyps also allocate most of the energy needed for calcification anthony et al 2002 mayfield and gates 2007 a prolonged retraction can cause a decrease in coral growth 3 2 impact of experimental treatments on coral associated bacteria diverse microbial communities including heterotrophic bacteria archaea and cyanobacteria are associated with corals koren and rosenberg 2006 reshef et al 2006 in this study we focused mainly on the impact of brine on heterotrophic bacteria that are found in the coral tissue and mucus following incubations with elevated salinity and antiscalants the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria associated with s pistillata was decreased by up to 4 fold fig 2 a heterotrophic bacterial abundance of a tenuis decreased moderately following the sal and sal ant treatments 25 and 85 respectively fig 2b in contrast bacterial abundance associate with p verrucosa was higher following the sal incubation and lower in the sal ant treatment 70 fig 2c bacterial production rates were higher 2 25 fold for all three species following incubation with antiscalants compared to the control fig 2d f however for all three species no changes in bacterial production rates were found following incubation with elevated salinity alone this suggests that the polyphosphonate based antiscalant provided limiting nutrient s possibly p for the heterotrophic bacteria results from a recent study indicated that bacteria can utilize phosphonates resulting in enhanced activity dyhrman 2016 coral associated bacterial communities undergo restructuring following events of coral bleaching and rapid environmental changes brown and bythell 2005 ritchie 2006 shnit orland and kushmaro 2009 previous research show that upon prolonged exposure to high salinity the microbiome of f granulosa was significantly restructured to encompass bacterial species with higher osmolyte production röthig et al 2016 this change enables the coral to adapt to hyper saline conditions by up regulating genes related to osmotic stress röthig et al 2016 in addition it has also been shown that short term exposure to high salinities can lead to a reduction in benthic bacterial abundance possibly due to osmotic shock frank et al 2017 yet under the same conditions specific bacterial activity e g bacterial production per cell increased significantly it has been suggested that bacterial metabolism is increased to produce various osmoprotectant molecules frank et al 2017 in the past decade phosphonate has been recognized as an important source of phosphorous for marine bacteria tseng and tang 2014 xiaomin et al 2013 indeed a recent mesocosm study indicated that high concentrations of phosphonate based antiscalants can enhance planktonic bacterial productivity belkin et al 2017 thus we surmise that the coral associated bacteria in our study expressed osmotic shock in response to the short term exposure to salinity higher 10 than ambient and that this may have resulted in lower bacterial abundance many bacterial phylotypes may increase the metabolic rates and produce various osmo protective molecules concurrently it is likely that bacteria which can biodegrade phosphonate based antiscalants provide nutrients otherwise unavailable to the coral and other bacteria contributing to increased bacterial activity we suggest that addition of bioavailable phosphate via degradation of the polyphosphonate antiscalant could be an important nutrition source for microbial communities that are associated with corals in ultra oligotrophic environments such as the goa when such compounds are present in the water column 3 3 effects of experimental treatments on coral symbiotic algae symbiodinium abundance in s pistillata was significantly reduced following incubation in both the sal and sal ant treatments by 65 and 95 respectively compared to the control samples fig 3 a for the other two coral species the response differed between treatments symbiodinium abundance decreased for a tenuis by 90 in the sal treatment while for p verrucosa the decrease was maximal in the sal ant treatment by 90 fig 3b and c based on these results we suggest that the impact of desalination brine namely increased salinity and or antiscalants concentrations on symbiodinium differs between coral species i e species specific species of symbiodinium are identified in several genetic clades rowan 1998 which have been shown to vary between coral species and individuals on various temporal spatial and environmental scales baker et al 2013 lajeunesse et al 2010 it has further been suggested that corals may be able to incorporate several different clades of symbiodinium in their tissue thus providing strategic advantage in changing environmental conditions byler et al 2013 therefore each species and individual represented in this study likely had a unique assembly of symbiodinium clades this may explain the variability in symbiodinium abundances following the treatments fig 3a c as some corals could have an assembly of symbiodinium with a greater tolerance for high salinity alternative explanation may be related to the host tissue thickness and polyp microenvironment that can differ between the coral species and which may lead to different resilience within the time framework of this study wangpraseurt et al 2015 3 4 response of the coral holobiome following exposure to experimental treatments total protein measured in this study orientated from a combination of the host coral and symbiotic algal cells as well as the bacteria and archea consortium that make up the holobiome associated with the coral achituv et al 1994 rosenberg et al 2007 a linear correlation r2 0 6 and pval of 0 001 was found between total protein and symbiodinium abundance figure s3 but not between total protein and bacterial abundance thus we surmise that total protein extracted from the corals tissue and mucus mostly originated from the algal cells and the coral host tissue protein extracted from s pistillata in both the enhanced salinity and antiscalants treatments was significantly lower by 50 and 75 respectively than the control fig 4 a protein extract from a tenuis was also lower 30 and 50 respectively for both treatments fig 4b compared to the control in contrast a significant increase in protein was measured for p verrucosa in the sal treatment but not in the sal ant treatment fig 4c compared to the control correlation between protein content and symbiodinium abundance has been documented numerous times achituv et al 1994 fabricius 2005 although a fraction of total protein is associated with the coral tissue as well achituv et al 1994 it can therefore be assumed that both the loss of coral tissue fig 1 and decrease in symbiodinium abundance fig 3 contributed to the protein biomass loss in our study the relation between coral tissue mass and protein content has been suggested as a sensitive indicator of coral health as the tissue e g coral polyps allocates energy reserves for calcification anthony et al 2002 houlbreque 2004 hence the combination of loss of coral tissue reduction of symbiodinium abundances and of protein biomass indicate a significant decrease of coral health in response to the increase in salinity and or antiscalant tested in this study net o2 production co2 uptake and calcification rates measured for s pistillata and a tenuis decreased with time throughout the study period in all treatments including the unamended control however the average net o2 production rates in s pistillata were lower 40 in the experimental treatments compared to the control fig 5 a in contrast there was only a minor reduction in the overall average net o2 production rates in a tenuis in the experimental treatments compared to the control fig 5b overall average co2 uptake rates were lower 30 50 in the experimental treatments compared to the control in a tenuis as well as in s pistillata fig 5c and d addition of antiscalants reduced the overall average net co2 uptake by 50 55 for both coral species the average calcification rates in s pistillata following incubation with increased salinity exhibited no apparent response relative to the control fig 5e however incubation of s pistillata with antiscalants caused nearly a 50 reduction relative to the control fig 5e average calcification rates in a tenuis decreased by ca 30 in the sal treatment while in the antiscalants treatment calcification decreased by ca 50 relative to the control fig 5f values are reported in table s2 these results suggest that polyphosphonate antiscalants affect the coral calcification independently of increased salinity perhaps by poisoning crystal growth at the site of calcification dunn et al 2012 simkiss 1964a 1964b net rates of o2 production and co2 uptake measured in this study reflect the balance between photosynthetic activity and aerobic respiration by the coral holobiome low net production rates that were measured in previous studies following incubation with high salinities were attributed to loss of symbiodinium and or a retraction of the coral polyps due to osmotic shock ferrier pagès et al 1999 muthiga and szmant 1987 similarly a significant drop in net production was shown for the red sea coral f granulosa in higher than ambient salinity however the coral appeared to be able to acclimate to these conditions after 29 days of exposure röthig et al 2016 we assume that the decreases in net production measured in this study also occurred as a response to the significant decrease in symbiodinium abundance and to a certain extent the retraction of the coral polyps concurrently the low abundance of heterotrophic bacteria and the loss of protein indicate that the catabolic rates of the coral were highly impaired anthony et al 2002 taking all of the above into consideration although corals of the goa are adapted to high salinity up to 41 fine et al 2013 our results indicate that 10 salinity increase above ambient levels may cause osmotic stress as this reaches the limit of the physiological tolerance for corals without adaptation mayfield and gates 2007 however coral colonies of the same species can have distinct responses to stressors as seen in large bleaching events where responses of adjacent colonies of the same species are not identical barshis et al 2013 hughes et al 2003 palumbi et al 2014 this is mostly attributed to genetic variation in both the corals and their corresponding symbiodinium baums et al 2014 and could be an explanation to the large variability seen in our results to the best of our knowledge this is the first study published on the effects of polyphosphonate antiscalant on corals accordingly we compare our results to studies where increases in phosphate concentration were investigated assuming phosphonate could serve as a phosphate source tseng and tang 2014 van mooy et al 2009 previous studies on elevated phosphate concentrations around corals have not established any consistent trends in symbiodinium abundance and protein contents but have found reduced calcification and impaired reproduction fabricius 2005 harrison and ward 2001 johnson et al 1979 muller parker et al 2015 walker and ormond 1982 other studies have also shown no impacts or only slight decreases in calcification and symbiodinium abundances due to increased phosphate concentrations fabricius 2005 holcomb et al 2010 our results similarly to other studies indicate that the responses of hard corals to increased salinity and phosphate from antiscalants are species specific 4 conclusion water scarcity and the operation of large scale desalination facilities coincide with many regions where coral reefs are found yet only sparse and limited research has been carried out with focus on the impact of seawater desalination brine on reef building corals our results clearly indicate that desalination brine may negatively impact the scleractinian hard corals holobiont namely the coral and associated symbiodinium and microbial community we found that elevated salinity 10 above ambient altered coral physiology and visual appearance concurrently increased salinity together with the addition of polyphosphonate based antiscalant often resulted in a greater impact on all three coral species tested we suggest that this enhancement is due to a multi stressor effect namely osmotic shock and increased eutrophication moreover our data demonstrate that the impact of desalination brine on hard corals is species specific thus we suggest that the ecotoxicological criteria adapted for hard corals should be determined based on tests done on key organisms forming the local coral communities that dominate the area at which desalination discharge is expected taken together we suggest that special attention should be given to the discharge of swro brine from current and future desalination facilities in the goa red sea we propose that the brine from these facilities will be discharged via a diffuser system to increase brine dilution and minimize possible effects moreover it is possible that the impact of multi stressors such as osmotic shock and eutrophication would be greater in goa than in other aquatic environments due to the confined basin and oligotrophic conditions of this water body since coral reefs around the goa have considerable economic value to communities that reside in the area it is central to maintain the wellbeing of this unique ecosystem finally we recommend that future research on the effects of swro desalination on hard corals will also include changes in temperature and coagulants which are often used in swro desalination that were not investigated in this study

2017 sánchez lizaso et al 2008 these studies demonstrated that the response and sensitivity to brine exposure varies considerably between species sites brine concentration and exposure time to date only a handful of studies have investigated the impact of desalination brine on corals despite the fact that large scale desalination facilities are often situated near coral reefs lattemann and höpner 2008 mabrook 1994 muthiga and szmant 1987 röthig et al 2016 van der merwe et al 2014 since coral reefs are highly productive ecosystems with high biodiversity and biomass loss of coverage may have cascading effects on higher trophic levels in addition coral reefs support local economies through fishing and tourisms and are therefore considered to be important assets for coastal communities around such reefs including the northern gulf of aqaba goa red sea which borders israel jordan and egypt currently several large scale desalination facilities are planned to be constructed on the north shores of the gulf of aqaba yet impacts on native corals following brine discharge are unknown scleractinian corals hermatypic are a diverse group of marine invertebrates which are the key ecosystem engineers of coral reefs worldwide birkeland 2015 dubinsky and stambler 2011 scleractinians are essentially holobiomes including the coral itself endosymbiotic dinoflagellates symbiodinium and various prokaryotes that colonize the coral s tissue and mucus muller parker et al 2015 symbiodinium have a key biochemical role in coral physiology providing carbohydrates via photosynthesis in

stressors may cause coral bleaching i e loss of symbiodinium from the coral s tissue brown 1997 mayfield and gates 2007 muller parker et al 2015 resulting in many cases in coral host mortality and subsequent reduction in coral coverage loss of coral coverage has previously been reported in the red sea in direct proximity of desalination plants mabrook 1994 yet a recent in situ study reported no mortality or measurable impact on the photosynthetic efficiency of the coral f granulosa in that region van der merwe et al 2014 however major restructuring of the tissue related microbiome of f granulosa has been observed in a related study following controlled incubations with elevated salinities röthig et al 2016 to date very little data are available on the various possible effects of swro desalination brine including the effects of higher salinity and specific chemicals that are associated with the brine on the physiology of reef building corals in this study we investigated the physiological responses of three key reef building coral species stylophora pistillata acropora tenuis and pocillopora verrucosa in the goa where construction and operation of several desalination facilities is expected in the near future to simulated brine discharge to this end collected coral specimens were grown for 2 4 weeks under elevated salinities 10 above ambient and elevated salinity with 0 2 mg l 1 polyphosphonate antiscalant added thus mimicking the expected exposure of corals to desalination brine in close proximity to an outfall these experiments were conducted in open aquaria and corals grown under ambient seawater conditions were used for comparison unamended controls our results demonstrate the potential effects of desalination brine discharge on hard corals that are major builders of the coral reefs in the goa 2 material and methods 2 1 collection of corals and experimental setup colonies of stylophora pistillata acropora tenuis and pocillopora verrucosa were

protection permit regulation 19 6 2013 for the oligotrophic mediterranean sea belkin et al 2017 israel ministry of environmental protection 2013 treatment water used in the experiment sal and sal ant was prepared in 1 m3 tanks using ambient seawater to which salt and antiscalant were added the water in the tanks was stirred to ensure dissolution and homogenization of the salt and antiscalant tanks were kept in a large temperature controlled container and water in the tanks was replenished every 5 days figure s1 and s2 water flow sal sal ant and control from the tanks to the aquaria was maintained at 2 l h 1 using peristaltic pumps resulting in replacement of the aquaria water volume at least twice a day salinity temperature and ph were measured daily around 9 a m and 3 p m with a

treatment respectively herein we present and discuss the results at the end of the experiment comparing them to corals grown under control conditions results were compared using anova followed by a fisher lsd post hoc analysis with significance of p 0 05 values and significance are reported in supporting information table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the appearance of reef building corals following exposure to experimental treatments images of s pistillata a tenuis and p verrucosa demonstrate clear signs of bleaching following incubation with elevated salinity and elevated salinity with the addition of antiscalants for four and two weeks respectively fig 1 concurrently coral tissue loss was recorded and the polyps of all three coral species in both treatments were highly retracted this negative response was mostly notable for p verrucosa and a tenuis and to a lesser extent for s pistillata fig 1 we attribute these responses to osmotic stress induced by the brine and note that the impact on corals as a holobiome is species specific severe impacts on coral health due to increased salinities 10 have been shown before ferrier pagès et al 1999 lirman and manzello 2009 muthiga and szmant 1987 however some studies suggest that corals may adapt and recover after weeks of exposure to enhanced salinity retraction of polyps is the first line of defense of corals to osmotic shock and since the polyps also allocate most of the energy needed for calcification anthony et al 2002 mayfield and gates 2007 a prolonged retraction can cause a decrease in coral growth 3 2 impact of experimental treatments on coral associated bacteria diverse microbial communities including heterotrophic bacteria archaea and cyanobacteria are associated with corals koren and rosenberg 2006 reshef et al 2006 in this study we focused mainly on the impact of brine on heterotrophic bacteria that are found in the coral tissue and mucus following incubations with elevated salinity and antiscalants the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria associated with s pistillata was decreased by up to 4 fold fig 2 a heterotrophic bacterial abundance of a tenuis decreased moderately following the sal and sal ant treatments 25 and 85 respectively fig 2b in contrast bacterial abundance associate with p verrucosa was higher following the sal incubation and lower in the sal ant treatment 70 fig 2c bacterial production rates were higher 2 25 fold for all three species following incubation with antiscalants compared to the control fig 2d f however for all three species no changes in bacterial production rates were found following incubation with elevated salinity alone this suggests that the polyphosphonate based antiscalant provided limiting nutrient s possibly p for the heterotrophic bacteria results from a recent study indicated that bacteria can utilize phosphonates resulting in enhanced activity dyhrman 2016 coral associated bacterial communities undergo restructuring following events of coral bleaching and rapid environmental changes brown and bythell 2005 ritchie 2006 shnit orland and kushmaro 2009 previous research show that upon prolonged exposure to high salinity the microbiome of f granulosa was significantly restructured to encompass bacterial species with higher osmolyte production röthig et al 2016 this change enables the coral to adapt to hyper saline conditions by up regulating genes related to osmotic stress röthig et al 2016 in addition it has also been shown that short term exposure to high salinities can lead to a reduction in benthic bacterial abundance possibly due to osmotic shock frank et al 2017 yet under the same conditions specific bacterial activity e g bacterial production per cell increased significantly it has been suggested that bacterial metabolism is increased to produce various osmoprotectant molecules frank et al 2017 in the past decade phosphonate has been recognized as an important source of phosphorous for marine bacteria tseng and tang 2014 xiaomin et al 2013 indeed a recent mesocosm study indicated that high concentrations of phosphonate based antiscalants can enhance planktonic bacterial productivity belkin et al 2017 thus we surmise that the coral associated bacteria in our study expressed osmotic shock in response to the short term exposure to salinity higher 10 than ambient and that this may have resulted in lower bacterial abundance many bacterial phylotypes may increase the metabolic rates and produce various osmo protective molecules concurrently it is likely that bacteria which can biodegrade phosphonate based antiscalants provide nutrients otherwise unavailable to the coral and other bacteria contributing to increased bacterial activity we suggest that addition of bioavailable phosphate via degradation of the polyphosphonate antiscalant could be an important nutrition source for microbial communities that are associated with corals in ultra oligotrophic environments such as the goa when such compounds are present in the water column 3 3 effects of experimental treatments on coral symbiotic algae symbiodinium abundance in s pistillata was significantly reduced following incubation in both the sal and sal ant treatments by 65 and 95 respectively compared to the control samples fig 3 a for the other two coral species the response differed between treatments symbiodinium abundance decreased for a tenuis by 90 in the sal treatment while for p verrucosa the decrease was maximal in the sal ant treatment by 90 fig 3b and c based on these results we suggest that the impact of desalination brine namely increased salinity and or antiscalants concentrations on symbiodinium differs between coral species i e species specific species of symbiodinium are identified in several genetic clades rowan 1998 which have been shown to vary between coral species and individuals on various temporal spatial and environmental scales baker et al 2013 lajeunesse et al 2010 it has further been suggested that corals may be able to incorporate several different clades of symbiodinium in their tissue thus providing strategic advantage in changing environmental conditions byler et al 2013 therefore each species and individual represented in this study likely had a unique assembly of symbiodinium clades this may explain the variability in symbiodinium abundances following the treatments fig 3a c as some corals could have an assembly of symbiodinium with a greater tolerance for high salinity alternative explanation may be related to the host tissue thickness and polyp microenvironment that can differ between the coral species and which may lead to different resilience within the time framework of this study wangpraseurt et al 2015 3 4 response of the coral holobiome following exposure to experimental treatments total protein measured in this study orientated from a combination of the host coral and symbiotic algal cells as well as the bacteria and archea consortium that make up the holobiome associated with the coral achituv et al 1994 rosenberg et al 2007 a linear correlation r2 0 6 and pval of 0 001 was found between total protein and symbiodinium abundance figure s3 but not between total protein and bacterial abundance thus we surmise that total protein extracted from the corals tissue and mucus mostly originated from the algal cells and the coral host tissue protein extracted from s pistillata in both the enhanced salinity and antiscalants treatments was significantly lower by 50 and 75 respectively than the control fig 4 a protein extract from a tenuis was also lower 30 and 50 respectively for both treatments fig 4b compared to the control in contrast a significant increase in protein was measured for p verrucosa in the sal treatment but not in the sal ant treatment fig 4c compared to the control correlation between protein content and symbiodinium abundance has been documented numerous times achituv et al 1994 fabricius 2005 although a fraction of total protein is associated with the coral tissue as well achituv et al 1994 it can therefore be assumed that both the loss of coral tissue fig 1 and decrease in symbiodinium abundance fig 3 contributed to the protein biomass loss in our study the relation between coral tissue mass and protein content has been suggested as a sensitive indicator of coral health as the tissue e g coral polyps allocates energy reserves for calcification anthony et al 2002 houlbreque 2004 hence the combination of loss of coral tissue reduction of symbiodinium abundances and of protein biomass indicate a significant decrease of coral health in response to the increase in salinity and or antiscalant tested in this study net o2 production co2 uptake and calcification rates measured for s pistillata and a tenuis decreased with time throughout the study period in all treatments including the unamended control however the average net o2 production rates in s pistillata were lower 40 in the experimental treatments compared to the control fig 5 a in contrast there was only a minor reduction in the overall average net o2 production rates in a tenuis in the experimental treatments compared to the control fig 5b overall average co2 uptake rates were lower 30 50 in the experimental treatments compared to the control in a tenuis as well as in s pistillata fig 5c and d addition of antiscalants reduced the overall average net co2 uptake by 50 55 for both coral species the average calcification rates in s pistillata following incubation with increased salinity exhibited no apparent response relative to the control fig 5e however incubation of s pistillata with antiscalants caused nearly a 50 reduction relative to the control fig 5e average calcification rates in a tenuis decreased by ca 30 in the sal treatment while in the antiscalants treatment calcification decreased by ca 50 relative to the control fig 5f values are reported in table s2 these results suggest that polyphosphonate antiscalants affect the coral calcification independently of increased salinity perhaps by poisoning crystal growth at the site of calcification dunn et al 2012 simkiss 1964a 1964b net rates of o2 production and co2 uptake measured in this study reflect the balance between photosynthetic activity and aerobic respiration by the coral holobiome low net production rates that were measured in previous studies following incubation with high salinities were attributed to loss of symbiodinium and or a retraction of the coral polyps due to osmotic shock ferrier pagès et al 1999 muthiga and szmant 1987 similarly a significant drop in net production was shown for the red sea coral f granulosa in higher than ambient salinity however the coral appeared to be able to acclimate to these conditions after 29 days of exposure röthig et al 2016 we assume that the decreases in net production measured in this study also occurred as a response to the significant decrease in symbiodinium abundance and to a certain extent the retraction of the coral polyps concurrently the low abundance of heterotrophic bacteria and the loss of protein indicate that the catabolic rates of the coral were highly impaired anthony et al 2002 taking all of the above into consideration although corals of the goa are adapted to high salinity up to 41 fine et al 2013 our results indicate that 10 salinity increase above ambient levels may cause osmotic stress as this reaches the limit of the physiological tolerance for corals without adaptation mayfield and gates 2007 however coral colonies of the same species can have distinct responses to stressors as seen in large bleaching events where responses of adjacent colonies of the same species are not identical barshis et al 2013 hughes et al 2003 palumbi et al 2014 this is mostly attributed to genetic variation in both the corals and their corresponding symbiodinium baums et al 2014 and could be an explanation to the large variability seen in our results to the best of our knowledge this is the first study published on the effects of polyphosphonate antiscalant on corals accordingly we compare our results to studies where increases in phosphate concentration were investigated assuming phosphonate could serve as a phosphate source tseng and tang 2014 van mooy et al 2009 previous studies on elevated phosphate concentrations around corals have not established any consistent trends in symbiodinium abundance and protein contents but have found reduced calcification and impaired reproduction fabricius 2005 harrison and ward 2001 johnson et al 1979 muller parker et al 2015 walker and ormond 1982 other studies have also shown no impacts or only slight decreases in calcification and symbiodinium abundances due to increased phosphate concentrations fabricius 2005 holcomb et al 2010 our results similarly to other studies indicate that the responses of hard corals to increased salinity and phosphate from antiscalants are species specific 4 conclusion water scarcity and the operation of large scale desalination facilities coincide with many regions where coral reefs are found yet only sparse and limited research has been carried out with focus on the impact of seawater desalination brine on reef building corals our results clearly indicate that desalination brine may negatively impact the scleractinian hard corals holobiont namely the coral and associated symbiodinium and microbial community we found that elevated salinity 10 above ambient altered coral physiology and visual appearance concurrently increased salinity together with the addition of polyphosphonate based antiscalant often resulted in a greater impact on all three coral species tested we suggest that this enhancement is due to a multi stressor effect namely osmotic shock and increased eutrophication moreover our data demonstrate that the impact of desalination brine on hard corals is species specific thus we suggest that the ecotoxicological criteria adapted for hard corals should be determined based on tests done on key organisms forming the local coral communities that dominate the area at which desalination discharge is expected taken together we suggest that special attention should be given to the discharge of swro brine from current and future desalination facilities in the goa red sea we propose that the brine from these facilities will be discharged via a diffuser system to increase brine dilution and minimize possible effects moreover it is possible that the impact of multi stressors such as osmotic shock and eutrophication would be greater in goa than in other aquatic environments due to the confined basin and oligotrophic conditions of this water body since coral reefs around the goa have considerable economic value to communities that reside in the area it is central to maintain the wellbeing of this unique ecosystem finally we recommend that future research on the effects of swro desalination on hard corals will also include changes in temperature and coagulants which are often used in swro desalination that were not investigated in this study

19358,free living amoebae fla are phagocytic protozoa found in natural and engineered water systems they can form disinfectant resistant cysts which can harbor various human pathogenic bacteria therefore providing them with a means of environmental persistence and dispersion through water distribution and other engineered water systems the association of fla with human viruses has been raised but the limited data on the persistence of infectious virions within amoebae leaves this aspect unresolved enteroviruses can cause a wide range of illness and replicate in human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts both of which could be exposed through contact with contaminated waters if virus detection and removal are compromised by virion internalization in free living protozoa this is especially problematic for high risk contaminants such as coxsackieviruses representative members of the enterovirus genus that are likely infectious at low doses and cause a variety of symptoms to a vulnerable portion of the population particularly infants to investigate enterovirus persistence within free living amoebae we co cultured an infectious clinical coxsackievirus b5 cvb5 isolate with the commonly reported tap water amoeba vermamoeba vermiformis after which we tracked virus localization and persistence in co culture over time through a combination of advanced imaging molecular and cell culture assays our results clearly demonstrate that infectious cvb5 can persist in all life stages of the amoebae without causing any visible injury to them we also demonstrated that the amoeba generated vesicles containing virions that were expelled into the bulk liquid surroundings a finding previously described for fla bacteria interactions but not for fla and human pathogenic viruses therefore our findings suggest that the ability of cvb5 to persist in v vermiformis could be a novel waterborne risk pathway for the persistence and dispersion of infectious human enteric viruses through water systems keywords enterovirus free living amoebae expelled vesicles virus persistence and dispersion 1 introduction human enteric viruses are gastrointestinal pathogens transmitted through contaminated natural and engineered water systems as well as through the consumption of water contaminated food fong and lipp 2005 they are shed in faeces at high titers into sewage and are likely infectious at low doses qiu et al 2015 insufficiently treated wastewater can contaminate surface or ground waters and in addition leaking drinking water pipes can become intrusion points during pressure changes for sewage contaminating surrounding soil and porewaters teunis et al 2010 okoh et al 2010 enteric viruses tend to adsorb to organic particles and incorporate in water based biofilms where they are protected from chemical disinfectants and uv and as a result the infectious virions may persist in the environment for months fong and lipp 2005 storey and ashbolt 2003 charles et al 2008 flood and ashbolt 2000 prolonged environmental persistence can alter the surface charge of viral capsids due to exposure to sorbed compounds ph fluctuations and diverse ionic forces within different waters charles et al 2008 mayer et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 these changes affect the successful physical removal of viruses from waters which typically utilize enhanced coagulation water treatment methods qiu et al 2015 okoh et al 2010 charles et al 2008 mayer et al 2008 reference pathogen concentrations and human dose response relationships are key parameters in quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra both of which could reflect how virions are transmitted via water qmra is used to inform pathogen management of systems such as for drinking water safety plans a regulatory requirement in alberta canada and some 90 other countries worldwide petterson and ashbolt 2016 who 2017 enteroviruses and adenoviruses are most often used as model organisms for virus removal studies of which enteroviruses tend to be more chlorine resistant okoh et al 2010 mayer et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 adenoviruses more uv resistant beck et al 2016 and both groups considered environmentally resistant prevost et al 2016 coxsackieviruses are within the enterovirus genus and are included in the u s environmental protection agency epa candidate contaminant list ccl as high risk water contaminants of which the b subtype are considered the most infectious mayer et al 2008 sin et al 2015 type b coxsackieviruses cvb have been associated with paralysis aseptic meningitis encephalitis rhombencephalitis febrile illness acute cerebellum ataxia cranial nerve palsies cardiac disease mucocutaneous infections myocarditis pericarditis pleurodynia pancreatitis type 1 diabetes t1d as well as bronchopneumonia hand foot and mouth disease miscarriage and in genetically predisposed individuals to hepatitis sin et al 2015 alidjinou et al 2015 hwang et al 2014 euscher et al 2001 kaplan et al 1983 infectious coxsackievirus b cvb can be transmitted from mother to fetus and this can affect the neurological development of newborns in addition to the higher chance of miscarriage hwang et al 2014 euscher et al 2001 kaplan et al 1983 cvb infection in newborns is of particular concern kaplan et al 1983 as there is no available vaccine and treatment is mainly supportive sin et al 2015 coxsackieviruses are among the most chlorine resistant viruses known that could contaminate both surface waters and drinking water who 2016 prevost et al 2016 cvb have frequently been reported in large clinical studies for which it has also been reported that symptom severity in newborns is of particular concern for five days postpartum kaplan et al 1983 as health care and water treatment processes continuously improve over the years it can be difficult to estimate the exact burden of cvb infections due to the nature of the virus cvb can cause not only acute but also latent infections feuer et al 2004 depending on the cell status and therefore again result in severe outcomes such as type 1 diabetes pancreatitis myocarditis which could manifest at a much later stage post exposure it is no surprise that coxsackieviruses have been listed as high risk water contaminants by u s environmental protection agency mayer et al 2008 cvb can be transmitted through diverse environmental routes of exposure food water fomites aerosols and because of its clinical significance and absence of effective vaccine and treatment successful virus removal from waters is an essential aspect for effective water safety management mayer et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 petterson and ashbolt 2016 the overall success of pathogen detection and disinfection however can be largely impacted by complex microbial interactions within water biofilms where natural predators such as free living amoebae fla can shape microbial communities thomas and ashbolt 2011 huws et al 2005 one of the most commonly reported thermotolerant fla of in premise water systems is vermamoeba vermiformis formerly hartmannella vermiformis pagnier et al 2015 this amoeba is normally not pathogenic to humans although it has been associated with nosocomial infections and reportedly persists in hot water systems of hospitals as well as in drinking water thomas and ashbolt 2011 pagnier et al 2015 as with most fla it has two life stages an actively feeding trophozoite and a dormant cyst trophozoites feed on organic particles and smaller microorganisms including amoeba resistant human pathogens such as the opportunistic pathogen legionella pneumophila pagnier et al 2015 schoen and ashbolt 2011 persistence inside protozoan hosts can provide these opportunistic pathogens with protection from biocides and water disinfection processes as well as facilitate their dispersion to the human host via aerosols from in premise water systems buse et al 2012 other than bacteria human viruses may also be associated with free living amoebae an example is the giant virus mimivirus putative human pathogen which is naturally resident and replicates within acanthamoeba polyphaga as do other giant viruses in fla raoult et al 2007 balczun and scheid 2017 fla interactions with human viruses is poorly understood despite their common tendency to incorporate in water based biofilms and despite the ability of fla to aid the protection and dispersion of opportunistic bacterial pathogens ashbolt 2015 therefore virus fla interactions present an important knowledge gap of public health significance especially for high risk pathogens for which removal is the major means of avoiding outbreaks and fatalities among the most vulnerable in the population currently there are reports of adenovirus norovirus and coxsackievirus association with acanthamoeba spp including evidence of adenovirus protection from chlorine when internalized by fla scheid and schwarzenberger 2012 hsueh and gibson 2015 mattana et al 2006 alotaibi 2011 verani et al 2016 staggemeier et al 2016 however studies show contradictory findings when it comes to coxsackievirus internalization and persistence within amoebae mattana et al 2006 alotaibi 2011 in one study cvb3 was shown to persist as infectious titer in co culture with acanthamoeba castellanii mattana et al 2006 however quantitative data on virion count was missing in the same study cvb3 internalization in the fla was observed through fluorescence microscopy however given the ratios of fla to virus particles and their size differences the resulting strong fluorescence observed could be unspecific which was not addressed by the authors in another study alotaibi 2011 the author co cultured cvb3 with a castellanii by means of feeding the amoebae with infected mammalian cells after which virus internalization was assessed with fluorescence microscopy and non quantitative pcr quantification of infectious virus titer was performed for virus stocks but not for virus co cultured with the amoebae the author concluded that fla did not internalize freely suspended viruses which is in contradiction to the findings reported by mattana et al 2006 the two studies however used different methods to reach their conclusions on fla pinocytosis of virions from liquid culture and performed the co cultures in mammalian cell culture media instead of fla growth media that likely impacted amoebal activity therefore combined evidence of cvb localization within amoebae impact on fla activity viral replication as well as changes in specific viral infectivity over time is currently absent enteric viruses internalized by fla hosts may have been missed in various risk assessment studies and pathogen management strategies but could account for poorer disinfection of waters than expected from studies using viruses suspended in laboratory waters hence virus fla interactions may play an important unexplored pathway for waterborne virus infections in this study we investigated the persistence of an infectious clinical coxsackievirus b5 isolate cvb5 within v vermiformis atcc 50237 an isolate from a hospital cooling tower using a combination of imaging infectivity studies and molecular assays to explore whether enterovirus fla associations could pose a health risk 2 materials and methods 2 1 strains and culture conditions the clinical cvb5 isolate

cultures v vermiformis and cvb5 were co cultured at a ratio of 1 1000 amoebae to viral genomic equivalents the high ratio was required to ensure sufficient virus available for 24 h feeding of the

to eliminate uninternalized or unadsorbed virions at days 1 3 5 and 7 co culture samples were collected by washing once at 4000g for 5 min thus obtaining co culture supernatants and washed co cultured

seven days virus infectivity was calculated by two independent formulae on one hand the most probable number of infectious units per ml mpn iu ml was quantified based on a published algorithm jarvis et al 2010 while on the other hand the tissue culture infectious dose 50 tcid50 was calculated by the classical reed muench formula reed and muench 1938 the mpn data were used together with qpcr counts of total virus genome copy number in order to calculate the specific viral infectivity nr of virions comprising an infectious unit before input and over time in co culture with the amoebae equation 1 pcr based assays and cell culture assays used separately have important limitations because they could either detect deactivated virions or could quantify the number of infectious units without providing information on how many virions comprise an infectious unit the calculation of specific infectivity allows for better characterization of the infectious potential of a virus population and a more sensitive way to track changes in viral infectivity over time 1 ge ml mpn iu ml number of virus genome equivalents per infections unit equation 1 formula for the calculation of

confirmed by the measuring tool of the hitachi tem software 3 results 3 1 cvb5 persistence in co culture with v vermiformis to assess the ability of v vermiformis to internalize cvb5 as well as the subsequent virion persistence we quantified virus genomic equivalents over time from washed fla pellets we observed that the number of virions associated with washed v vermiformis pellets was about three log10 less as compared to input virus however approximately 1 106 cvb5 genomic equivalents were consistently detected from washed fla pellets throughout the entire duration of the experiment suggesting internalization or firm surface adherence fig 1 when we also assessed the infectivity of co cultured virions we observed that the infectious virus titer associated with washed fla pellets initially dropped as compared to the infectious titer of virus unexposed to the amoebae however fla associated virus had a consistent infectious titer throughout the duration of the experiments as calculated by two independent formulae fig 2 about 1 103 mpn infectious units were found to persist over several days with actively feeding amoebae fig 2a and our studies also showed that each infectious unit contained about 1 102 virus particles fig 3 this amount of undigested infectious virions is of public health concern if persisting in a ubiquitously found tap water amoebae especially given the low infectious doses of human enteric viruses qiu et al 2015 the majority of co cultured virions were detected in supernatant fractions of the fla co cultures possibly due to excretion within digestive vesicles of the feeding amoebae figs 1 and 4 as subtle changes in virus infectivity could go undetected we took our co culture assays one step further and combined rt qpcr data analysis with mpn infectivity data to assess the most likely number of virions per infectious unit which we refer to as specific viral infectivity fig 3 the specific infectivity of cvb5 exposed to or unexposed to the amoebae did not appear to have dropped or increased significantly p 0 05 other than expected variation due to the dynamic nature of fla feeding also the number of virions per infectious unit did not remain constant over time likely due to the dynamic nature of fla feeding and the resulting differences in number of digested inactivated virions fig 3 taken together our results suggest that cvb5 persisted over time as infectious titer internalized by or tightly adsorbed to the surface of v vermiformis trophozoites 3 2 cvb5 localization in v vermiformis and effects on the amoebae in addition to address the question of virus internalization by v vermiformis and hence the efficacy of fla virus interactions as vectors for virion transmission and persistence in waters we observed virus fluorescence signal igg fitc immediately after co culture and after 24 h fig 4 at day zero cvb5 appeared to be adsorbed to fla cysts fig 4a and 24 h later when the amoebae would start replicating and more actively feed cvb5 signal was detected from v vermiformis trophozoites expelled vesicles and within cysts fig 4b in order to also investigate cvb5 internalization we observed v vermiformis exposed to and unexposed to the virus with the help of transmission electron microscopy tem we observed virion like structures of about 30 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm of the fla fig 5 the structures appeared to form non linear virion aggregates attached to one another s edge were visibly larger than ribosome like structures 17 20 nm in diameter and were only observed for v vermiformis co cultured with cvb5 fig 6 in addition we also observed through independent imaging experiments that virus like particles were localized in v vermiformis vesicles either expelled or contained within larger vacuoles fig 7 tem images revealed not only that v vermiformis co cultured with cvb5 remained actively feeding differentiated pseudopods and ability to produce and expel digestive vesicles as shown in figs 5 7 but the amoebae also remained able to replicate fig a2 suggesting that cvb5 did not have any visible effect on the viability of the amoebae which internalized it and undigested virions could be packed and or expelled into the surrounding medium within expelled vesicles to investigate the presence of cytopathic effects cell injury cvb5 could have exerted on v vermiformis we also observed fla monolayers in the presence and absence of the virus together with quantifying changes in amoebae growth replication and encystment fig 8 and fig a3 we observed that neither the growth encystment nor general monolayer appearance of v vermiformis were visibly affected by the presence of internalized enterovirus as confirmed also by our tem images 4 discussion through a thorough analysis of virus quantification and infectivity we demonstrate that a highly infectious clinical coxsackievirus b5 isolate could persist in the commonly occurring tap water amoeba v vermiformis our findings also show that the presence of cvb5 does not appear to affect the growth encystment or appearance of the amoebae the fla were actively replicating and feeding for several days in media containing cvb5 or not noting that we utilized a medium optimized for amoeba not virus cell line media as used by others mattana et al 2006 alotaibi 2011 in addition to the best of our knowledge our results demonstrate for the first time the ability of free living amoebae to expel virions within vesicles to the surrounding medium hence virion uptake and packaging inside expelled fla vesicles was shown to occur with v vermiformis within the same time scale 24 h that the amoeba has been shown to colonize stagnant dental waterline units dillon et al 2014 where it could subsequently be mobilised and disperse downstream this is of potential public health concern because as our findings demonstrate infectious cvb5 could become localized in all life stages of the ubiquitous water amoeba v vermiformis where infectious virions could persist for about a week and possibly longer yet the time it takes the amoeba to colonize stagnant waters and disperse from such environs is much shorter as a result of this cvb5 and v vermiformis co occurrence is very likely to result in the dispersion of infectious virions via expelled virion protective amoebae vesicles in water systems the role of fla as a trojan horse for the enhanced persistence and dispersion of amoeba resisting human pathogenic bacteria is well described bowers and olszewski 1983 thomas et al 2006 bouyer et al 2007 schoen and ashbolt 2011 while in 2012 scheid and schwarzenberger also raised the question of whether fla could serve as trojan horses for human viruses such as adenoviruses our findings that this applied to highly infectious human enteric viruses via ubiquitous tap water amoebae such as v vermiformis and their expelled vesicles appears to be a previously unexplored mode of dispersion for enteric viruses in water systems fla association with human viruses are especially concerning due to frequent reports on v vermiformis isolation from hospital cooling towers hot water tanks and dental units where the amoeba could withstand a variety of harsh treatments including high temperatures chlorine and a variety of other chemical disinfectants rohr et al 1998 kuchta et al 1993 dillon et al 2014 coxsackieviruses target the most vulnerable portion of the population small children and immunocompromised individuals jubelt and lipton 2014 for newborns infections could be fatal and the outcome could depend on as little as days of age kaplan et al 1983 cvb5 infections could also lead to miscarriage hwang et al 2014 however symptoms are not always acute and the ability of cvb5 to also cause latent infections feuer et al 2004 further complicates virus risk assessments based on dose response relationship studies coxsackievirus risks are constantly lurking because seroprevalence is observed worldwide up to about 20 of the population in greece 60 80 among french canadians tested and about 50 in china sin et al 2015 enterovirus infections often go undetected however a large portion of patients with dilated cardiomyopathies are also positive for enterovirus rna sin et al 2015 in addition about 80 of patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus have turned positive for cv infections mena et al 2003 a risk assessment of waterborne coxsackievirus has shown that approximately 2 102 mpn cpu most probable number of cytopathic units of cv per 1 l of fresh water would likely result in infection and illness over the duration of five days mena et al 2003 in addition 1 3 103 infectious cv units have been shown to infect all subjects in a dose response study mena et al 2003 in the current study we demonstrate that about 1 103 mpn iu could persist in association with the ubiquitous free living water amoeba v vermiformis for a duration of the study period 7 days due to the absence of a widely used vaccine the main way of managing high risk water contaminants such as cvb is prevention therefore unexplored routes of environmental persistence and dispersion through water systems are of significant potential public health concern coxsackieviruses are not the only high risk virus contaminants in waters and as shown for fla bacteria interactions dey et al 2009 fla virus interactions may also be highly diverse and specific depending on the species and strains involved therefore further emphasizing the importance of research in the area because virus amoebae interactions could also be highly diverse what is even more concerning is the fact that environmental free living amoebae do rely on their bacterial prey for nutrition hence they depend on active grazing on pipe biofilms where they may also encounter virus particles thomas et al 2006 huws et al 2005 this could potentially lead to co existence of different amoeba resistant pathogens within the protozoa and subsequently concurrent dispersion to human hosts in the case of opportunistic bacterial pathogens concurrent infections could mean an increased likelihood for human tissue compromise and therefore this could potentially render human hosts more susceptible to infections by pathogens dispersed via fla from water systems brieland et al 1996 currently the management of enteric water contaminants such as coxsackieviruses is through water treatment jubelt and lipton 2014 the likely efficacy of such preventative approaches is increasingly being modeled via quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra who 2016 qmra rely on comprehensive scientific reports such as on pathogen detection physical removal concentration estimates and dose response to infect humans all of which could be influenced by virus internalization within larger protozoan hosts thomas and ashbolt 2011 because viruses are dependent on their host for survival and replication and because free living protozoa are difficult to grow using traditional mammalian culture conditions studies on mixed matrices involving protozoa and enteric viruses have proven challenging resulting in contradictory findings where researchers have used either infectivity studies alone or non quantitative pcr in each case performed in sub optimal fla growth media where amoebae are less likely to actively pinocytose nutrients or virions mattana et al 2006 alotaibi 2011 molecular assays and cell culture assays each have their limitations pcr based assays could detect nucleic acid targets from inactive virions while cell culture based infectivity assays could estimate the number of infectious units however they cannot quantify the number of virions which could comprise an infectious unit the quantification of that number specific infectivity can therefore detect more subtle changes in virus infectious titer our thorough analysis of virus quantification and infectivity from optimal fla culture conditions and multiple detection enumeration approaches could be applied to other studies in the field so as to provide consistent methodologies to derived data for enteric virus management associated with water systems of particular concern are water reuse applications where the high concentrations of fla and enteric viruses are expected within municipal biological wastewater treatment systems especially within biofilms where virus particles could become concentrated 100 fold flood and ashbolt 2000 providing similar ratios of predator to prey to those used in the current study our findings also raise the important question of whether human viruses could replicate within alternative environmental host cells and whether this could impact virus tropism and subsequent infectivity in humans however we did not observe any signs of cvb5 replication in co culture with v vermiformis also as cap independent cvb5 rna translation interferes with cap dependent rna translation of eukaryotic hosts through a variety of virion enzymes sean and semler 2008 coxsackieviruses tend to be highly lytic but in the current study we did not observe any visible signs of fla cell injury resulting from cvb5 internalization cvb has also been shown to cause latent infections in cells that are not actively replicating becoming lytic as soon as the cells become active again feuer et al 2004 our tem images demonstrate that v vermiformis co cultured with the virus remained able to form pseudopods largely remain unencysted produce and expel digestive vesicles and trophozoites replicated therefore the absence of cytopathic effects seems unlikely to be a result of dormant or inactive amoebae cells and we therefore concluded that cvb5 was not lytic to the protozoa tested here in some cases coxsackieviruses have been shown to exploit the autophagic machinery to exit cells via autophagosomes or similar vesicular structures xin et al 2014 interestingly here we also observed virions expelled in vesicular structures of v vermiformis although due to the absence of visible cell injury we speculate that this is not due to exploitation of autophagy but is rather part of the natural ability of the amoebae to expel undigested material in the case of highly infectious human pathogenic viruses vesicles would increase the probability of an infective dose likely to disperse as aerosols from water distribution systems what is even more intriguing about members of the enterovirus genus is their rapid mutation rate which could result in the accumulation of multiple lethal mutations domingo et al 2008 in natural hosts such as mammalian cells mutations are negatively selected should replication of the virus occur in an environmental host it could result in the accumulation of unnecessary mutations and consequently could affect the infectivity and or tropism of the virus our findings however show that cvb5 only persisted as an infectious titre over the duration of the co culture experiments therefore the persistence of virions inside amoebae likely as accidental prey could simply be an alternative route of environmental persistence of virions environmental exposure to stressors and disinfectants could affect the infectivity of virions through physical effects on virus capsids charles et al 2008 mayer et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 the ability of infectious virions to persist without replicating in fla points to a possible new route for virion preservation protection in environmental waters that needs further assessment altogether our findings demonstrate a previously unexplored potential route for enteric virus persistence and dispersion such as in the ubiquitous tap water amoebae v vermiformis in this study we demonstrate the persistence of infectious cvb5 at doses likely to cause infection for a duration of time which is enough for v vermiformis to colonize new environments and disperse from them the virus was associated with all life stages of the amoebae including expelled vesicles which has not been previously demonstrated for human viruses in association with fla our findings also provide a methodology which could address existing knowledge gaps in future studies of virus fla interactions which address various challenges associated with their co culture 5 conclusions a clinical cvb5 isolate persisted as quantified genomic equivalents and remain infectious in liquid co cultures with the tap water amoeba vermamoeba vermiformis the virus was localized in all life stages of the amoeba and did not cause any visible cell injury to the protozoan to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of human virus expulsion within vesicles of free living amoebae a previously unexplored potential route for virion persistence and or dispersion through liquid aerosol pathways our methods allowed for thorough analysis of virus infectivity within optimally grown and active protozoa and could be used in

19358,free living amoebae fla are phagocytic protozoa found in natural and engineered water systems they can form disinfectant resistant cysts which can harbor various human pathogenic bacteria therefore providing them with a means of environmental persistence and dispersion through water distribution and other engineered water systems the association of fla with human viruses has been raised but the limited data on the persistence of infectious virions within amoebae leaves this aspect unresolved enteroviruses can cause a wide range of illness and replicate in human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts both of which could be exposed through contact with contaminated waters if virus detection and removal are compromised by virion internalization in free living protozoa this is especially problematic for high risk contaminants such as coxsackieviruses representative members of the enterovirus genus that are likely infectious at low doses and cause a variety of symptoms to a vulnerable portion of the population particularly infants to investigate enterovirus persistence within free living amoebae we co cultured an infectious clinical coxsackievirus b5 cvb5 isolate with the commonly reported tap water amoeba vermamoeba vermiformis after which we tracked virus localization and persistence in co culture over time through a combination of advanced imaging molecular and cell culture assays our results clearly demonstrate that infectious cvb5 can persist in all life stages of the amoebae without causing any visible injury to them we also demonstrated that the amoeba generated vesicles containing virions that were expelled into the bulk liquid surroundings a finding previously described for fla bacteria interactions but not for fla and human pathogenic viruses therefore our findings suggest that the ability of cvb5 to persist in v vermiformis could be a novel waterborne risk pathway for the persistence and dispersion of infectious human enteric viruses through water systems keywords enterovirus free living amoebae expelled vesicles virus persistence and dispersion 1 introduction human enteric viruses are gastrointestinal pathogens transmitted through contaminated natural and engineered water systems as well as through the consumption of water contaminated food fong and lipp 2005 they are shed in faeces at high titers into sewage and are likely infectious at low doses qiu et al 2015 insufficiently treated wastewater can contaminate surface or ground waters and in addition leaking drinking water pipes can become intrusion points during pressure changes for sewage contaminating surrounding soil and porewaters teunis et al 2010 okoh et al 2010 enteric viruses tend to adsorb to organic particles and incorporate in water based biofilms where they are protected from chemical disinfectants and uv and as a result the infectious virions may persist in the environment for months fong and lipp 2005 storey and ashbolt 2003 charles et al 2008 flood and ashbolt 2000 prolonged environmental persistence can alter the surface charge of viral capsids due to exposure to sorbed compounds ph fluctuations and diverse ionic forces within different waters charles et al 2008 mayer et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 these changes affect the successful physical removal of viruses from waters which typically utilize enhanced coagulation water treatment methods qiu et al 2015 okoh et al 2010 charles et al 2008 mayer et al 2008 reference pathogen concentrations and human dose response relationships are key parameters in quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra both of which could reflect how virions are transmitted via water qmra is used to inform pathogen management of systems such as for drinking water safety plans a

kaplan et al 1983 infectious coxsackievirus b cvb can be transmitted from mother to fetus and this can affect the neurological development of newborns in addition to the higher chance of miscarriage hwang et al 2014 euscher et al 2001 kaplan et al 1983 cvb infection in newborns is of particular concern kaplan et al 1983 as there is no available vaccine and treatment is mainly supportive sin et al 2015 coxsackieviruses are among the most chlorine resistant viruses known that could contaminate both surface waters and drinking water who 2016 prevost et al 2016 cvb have frequently been reported in large clinical studies for which it has also been reported that symptom severity in newborns is of particular concern for five days postpartum kaplan et al 1983 as health care and water treatment processes continuously improve over the years it can be difficult to estimate the exact burden of cvb infections due to the nature of the virus cvb can cause not only acute but also latent infections feuer et al 2004 depending on the cell status and therefore again result in severe outcomes such as type 1 diabetes pancreatitis myocarditis which could manifest at a much later stage post exposure it is no surprise that coxsackieviruses have been listed as high risk water contaminants by u s environmental protection agency mayer et al 2008 cvb can be transmitted through diverse environmental routes of exposure food water fomites aerosols and because of its clinical significance and absence of effective vaccine and treatment successful virus removal from waters is an essential aspect for effective water safety management mayer et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 petterson and ashbolt 2016 the overall success of pathogen detection and disinfection however can be largely impacted by complex microbial interactions within water biofilms where natural predators such as free living amoebae fla can shape microbial communities thomas and ashbolt 2011 huws et al 2005 one of the most commonly reported thermotolerant fla of in premise water systems is vermamoeba vermiformis formerly hartmannella vermiformis pagnier et al 2015 this amoeba is normally not pathogenic to humans although it has been associated with nosocomial infections and reportedly persists in hot water systems of hospitals as well as in drinking water thomas and ashbolt 2011 pagnier et al 2015 as with most fla it has two life stages an actively feeding trophozoite and a dormant cyst trophozoites feed on organic particles and smaller microorganisms including amoeba resistant human pathogens such as the opportunistic pathogen legionella pneumophila pagnier et al 2015 schoen and ashbolt 2011 persistence inside protozoan hosts can provide these opportunistic pathogens with protection from biocides and water disinfection processes as well as facilitate their dispersion to the human host via aerosols from in premise water systems buse et al 2012 other than bacteria human viruses may also be associated with free living amoebae an example is the giant virus mimivirus putative human pathogen which is naturally resident and replicates within acanthamoeba polyphaga as do other giant viruses in fla raoult et al 2007 balczun and scheid 2017 fla interactions with human viruses is poorly understood despite their common tendency to incorporate in water based biofilms and despite the ability of fla to aid the protection and dispersion of opportunistic bacterial pathogens ashbolt 2015 therefore virus fla interactions present an important knowledge gap of public health significance especially for high risk pathogens for which removal is the major means of avoiding outbreaks and fatalities among the most vulnerable in the population currently there are reports of adenovirus norovirus and coxsackievirus association with acanthamoeba spp including evidence of adenovirus protection from chlorine when internalized by fla scheid and schwarzenberger 2012 hsueh and gibson 2015 mattana et al 2006 alotaibi 2011 verani et al 2016 staggemeier et al 2016 however studies show contradictory findings when it comes to coxsackievirus internalization and persistence within amoebae mattana et al 2006 alotaibi 2011 in one study cvb3 was shown to persist as infectious titer in co culture with acanthamoeba castellanii mattana et al 2006 however quantitative data on virion count was missing in the same study cvb3 internalization in the fla was observed through fluorescence microscopy however given the ratios of fla to virus particles and their size differences the resulting strong fluorescence observed could be unspecific which was not addressed by the authors in another study alotaibi 2011 the author co cultured cvb3 with a castellanii by means of feeding the amoebae with infected mammalian cells after which virus internalization was assessed with fluorescence microscopy and non quantitative pcr quantification of infectious virus titer was performed for virus stocks but not for virus co cultured with the amoebae the author concluded that fla did not internalize freely suspended viruses which is in contradiction to the findings reported by mattana et al 2006 the two studies however used different methods to reach their conclusions on fla pinocytosis of virions from liquid culture and performed the co cultures in mammalian cell culture media instead of fla growth media that likely impacted amoebal activity therefore combined evidence of cvb localization within amoebae impact on fla activity viral replication as well as changes in specific viral infectivity over time is currently absent enteric viruses internalized by fla hosts may have been missed in various risk assessment studies and pathogen management strategies but could account for poorer disinfection of waters than expected from studies using viruses suspended in laboratory waters hence virus fla interactions may play an important unexplored pathway for waterborne virus infections in this study we investigated the persistence of an infectious clinical coxsackievirus b5 isolate cvb5 within v vermiformis atcc 50237 an isolate from a hospital cooling tower using a combination of imaging infectivity studies and molecular assays to explore whether enterovirus fla associations could pose a health risk 2 materials and methods 2 1 strains and culture conditions the clinical cvb5 isolate

cultures v vermiformis and cvb5 were co cultured at a ratio of 1 1000 amoebae to viral genomic equivalents the high ratio was required to ensure sufficient virus available for 24 h feeding of the amoebae after which the co cultures were washed by centrifugation at 4000 g for 5 min to remove uninternalized virus following the initial washing step at the beginning of the experiment which aimed to eliminate uninternalized or unadsorbed virions at days 1 3 5 and 7 co culture samples were collected by washing once at 4000g for 5 min thus obtaining co culture supernatants and washed co cultured

were serially diluted in ma104 maintenance medium at dilutions of 10 1 10 10 each dilution was used to infect ma104 cells in quadruplicates in 24 well plates cytopathic effects were observed daily for seven days virus infectivity was calculated by two independent formulae on one hand the most probable number of infectious units per ml mpn iu ml was quantified based on a published algorithm jarvis et al 2010 while on the other hand the tissue culture infectious dose 50 tcid50 was calculated by the classical reed muench formula reed and muench 1938 the mpn data were used together with qpcr counts of total virus genome copy number in order to calculate the specific viral infectivity nr of virions comprising an infectious unit before input and over time in co culture with the amoebae equation 1 pcr based assays and cell culture assays used separately have important limitations because they could either detect deactivated virions or could quantify the number of infectious units without providing information on how many virions comprise an infectious unit the calculation of specific infectivity allows for better characterization of the infectious potential of a virus population and a more sensitive way to track changes in viral infectivity over time 1 ge ml mpn iu ml number of virus genome equivalents per infections unit equation 1 formula for the calculation of

confirmed by the measuring tool of the hitachi tem software 3 results 3 1 cvb5 persistence in co culture with v vermiformis to assess the ability of v vermiformis to internalize cvb5 as well as the subsequent virion persistence we quantified virus genomic equivalents over time from washed fla pellets we observed that the number of virions associated with washed v vermiformis pellets was about three log10 less as compared to input virus however approximately 1 106 cvb5 genomic equivalents were consistently detected from washed fla pellets throughout the entire duration of the experiment suggesting internalization or firm surface adherence fig 1 when we also assessed the infectivity of co cultured virions we observed that the infectious virus titer associated with washed fla pellets initially dropped as compared to the infectious titer of virus unexposed to the amoebae however fla associated virus had a consistent infectious titer throughout the duration of the experiments as calculated by two independent formulae fig 2 about 1 103 mpn infectious units were found to persist over several days with actively feeding amoebae fig 2a and our studies also showed that each infectious unit contained about 1 102 virus particles fig 3 this amount of undigested infectious virions is of public health concern if persisting in a ubiquitously found tap water amoebae especially given the low infectious doses of human enteric viruses qiu et al 2015 the majority of co cultured virions were detected in supernatant fractions of the fla co cultures possibly due to excretion within digestive vesicles of the feeding amoebae figs 1 and 4 as subtle changes in virus infectivity could go undetected we took our co culture assays one step further and combined rt qpcr data analysis with mpn infectivity data to assess the most likely number of virions per infectious unit which we refer to as specific viral infectivity fig 3 the specific infectivity of cvb5 exposed to or unexposed to the amoebae did not appear to have dropped or increased significantly p 0 05 other than expected variation due to the dynamic nature of fla feeding also the number of virions per infectious unit did not remain constant over time likely due to the dynamic nature of fla feeding and the resulting differences in number of digested inactivated virions fig 3 taken together our results suggest that cvb5 persisted over time as infectious titer internalized by or tightly adsorbed to the surface of v vermiformis trophozoites 3 2 cvb5 localization in v vermiformis and effects on the amoebae in addition to address the question of virus internalization by v vermiformis and hence the efficacy of fla virus interactions as vectors for virion transmission and persistence in waters we observed virus fluorescence signal igg fitc immediately after co culture and after 24 h fig 4 at day zero cvb5 appeared to be adsorbed to fla cysts fig 4a and 24 h later when the amoebae would start replicating and more actively feed cvb5 signal was detected from v vermiformis trophozoites expelled vesicles and within cysts fig 4b in order to also investigate cvb5 internalization we observed v vermiformis exposed to and unexposed to the virus with the help of transmission electron microscopy tem we observed virion like structures of about 30 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm of the fla fig 5 the structures appeared to form non linear virion aggregates attached to one another s edge were visibly larger than ribosome like structures 17 20 nm in diameter and were only observed for v vermiformis co cultured with cvb5 fig 6 in addition we also observed through independent imaging experiments that virus like particles were localized in v vermiformis vesicles either expelled or contained within larger vacuoles fig 7 tem images revealed not only that v vermiformis co cultured with cvb5 remained actively feeding differentiated pseudopods and ability to produce and expel digestive vesicles as shown in figs 5 7 but the amoebae also remained able to replicate fig a2 suggesting that cvb5 did not have any visible effect on the viability of the amoebae which internalized it and undigested virions could be packed and or expelled into the surrounding medium within expelled vesicles to investigate the presence of cytopathic effects cell injury cvb5 could have exerted on v vermiformis we also observed fla monolayers in the presence and absence of the virus together with quantifying changes in amoebae growth replication and encystment fig 8 and fig a3 we observed that neither the growth encystment nor general monolayer appearance of v vermiformis were visibly affected by the presence of internalized enterovirus as confirmed also by our tem images 4 discussion through a thorough analysis of virus quantification and infectivity we demonstrate that a highly infectious clinical coxsackievirus b5 isolate could persist in the commonly occurring tap water amoeba v vermiformis our findings also show that the presence of cvb5 does not appear to affect the growth encystment or appearance of the amoebae the fla were actively replicating and feeding for several days in media containing cvb5 or not noting that we utilized a medium optimized for amoeba not virus cell line media as used by others mattana et al 2006 alotaibi 2011 in addition to the best of our knowledge our results demonstrate for the first time the ability of free living amoebae to expel virions within vesicles to the surrounding medium hence virion uptake and packaging inside expelled fla vesicles was shown to occur with v vermiformis within the same time scale 24 h that the amoeba has been shown to colonize stagnant dental waterline units dillon et al 2014 where it could subsequently be mobilised and disperse downstream this is of potential public health concern because as our findings demonstrate infectious cvb5 could become localized in all life stages of the ubiquitous water amoeba v vermiformis where infectious virions could persist for about a week and possibly longer yet the time it takes the amoeba to colonize stagnant waters and disperse from such environs is much shorter as a result of this cvb5 and v vermiformis co occurrence is very likely to result in the dispersion of infectious virions via expelled virion protective amoebae vesicles in water systems the role of fla as a trojan horse for the enhanced persistence and dispersion of amoeba resisting human pathogenic bacteria is well described bowers and olszewski 1983 thomas et al 2006 bouyer et al 2007 schoen and ashbolt 2011 while in 2012 scheid and schwarzenberger also raised the question of whether fla could serve as trojan horses for human viruses such as adenoviruses our findings that this applied to highly infectious human enteric viruses via ubiquitous tap water amoebae such as v vermiformis and their expelled vesicles appears to be a previously unexplored mode of dispersion for enteric viruses in water systems fla association with human viruses are especially concerning due to frequent reports on v vermiformis isolation from hospital cooling towers hot water tanks and dental units where the amoeba could withstand a variety of harsh treatments including high temperatures chlorine and a variety of other chemical disinfectants rohr et al 1998 kuchta et al 1993 dillon et al 2014 coxsackieviruses target the most vulnerable portion of the population small children and immunocompromised individuals jubelt and lipton 2014 for newborns infections could be fatal and the outcome could depend on as little as days of age kaplan et al 1983 cvb5 infections could also lead to miscarriage hwang et al 2014 however symptoms are not always acute and the ability of cvb5 to also cause latent infections feuer et al 2004 further complicates virus risk assessments based on dose response relationship studies coxsackievirus risks are constantly lurking because seroprevalence is observed worldwide up to about 20 of the population in greece 60 80 among french canadians tested and about 50 in china sin et al 2015 enterovirus infections often go undetected however a large portion of patients with dilated cardiomyopathies are also positive for enterovirus rna sin et al 2015 in addition about 80 of patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus have turned positive for cv infections mena et al 2003 a risk assessment of waterborne coxsackievirus has shown that approximately 2 102 mpn cpu most probable number of cytopathic units of cv per 1 l of fresh water would likely result in infection and illness over the duration of five days mena et al 2003 in addition 1 3 103 infectious cv units have been shown to infect all subjects in a dose response study mena et al 2003 in the current study we demonstrate that about 1 103 mpn iu could persist in association with the ubiquitous free living water amoeba v vermiformis for a duration of the study period 7 days due to the absence of a widely used vaccine the main way of managing high risk water contaminants such as cvb is prevention therefore unexplored routes of environmental persistence and dispersion through water systems are of significant potential public health concern coxsackieviruses are not the only high risk virus contaminants in waters and as shown for fla bacteria interactions dey et al 2009 fla virus interactions may also be highly diverse and specific depending on the species and strains involved therefore further emphasizing the importance of research in the area because virus amoebae interactions could also be highly diverse what is even more concerning is the fact that environmental free living amoebae do rely on their bacterial prey for nutrition hence they depend on active grazing on pipe biofilms where they may also encounter virus particles thomas et al 2006 huws et al 2005 this could potentially lead to co existence of different amoeba resistant pathogens within the protozoa and subsequently concurrent dispersion to human hosts in the case of opportunistic bacterial pathogens concurrent infections could mean an increased likelihood for human tissue compromise and therefore this could potentially render human hosts more susceptible to infections by pathogens dispersed via fla from water systems brieland et al 1996 currently the management of enteric water contaminants such as coxsackieviruses is through water treatment jubelt and lipton 2014 the likely efficacy of such preventative approaches is increasingly being modeled via quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra who 2016 qmra rely on comprehensive scientific reports such as on pathogen detection physical removal concentration estimates and dose response to infect humans all of which could be influenced by virus internalization within larger protozoan hosts thomas and ashbolt 2011 because viruses are dependent on their host for survival and replication and because free living protozoa are difficult to grow using traditional mammalian culture conditions studies on mixed matrices involving protozoa and enteric viruses have proven challenging resulting in contradictory findings where researchers have used either infectivity studies alone or non quantitative pcr in each case performed in sub optimal fla growth media where amoebae are less likely to actively pinocytose nutrients or virions mattana et al 2006 alotaibi 2011 molecular assays and cell culture assays each have their limitations pcr based assays could detect nucleic acid targets from inactive virions while cell culture based infectivity assays could estimate the number of infectious units however they cannot quantify the number of virions which could comprise an infectious unit the quantification of that number specific infectivity can therefore detect more subtle changes in virus infectious titer our thorough analysis of virus quantification and infectivity from optimal fla culture conditions and multiple detection enumeration approaches could be applied to other studies in the field so as to provide consistent methodologies to derived data for enteric virus management associated with water systems of particular concern are water reuse applications where the high concentrations of fla and enteric viruses are expected within municipal biological wastewater treatment systems especially within biofilms where virus particles could become concentrated 100 fold flood and ashbolt 2000 providing similar ratios of predator to prey to those used in the current study our findings also raise the important question of whether human viruses could replicate within alternative environmental host cells and whether this could impact virus tropism and subsequent infectivity in humans however we did not observe any signs of cvb5 replication in co culture with v vermiformis also as cap independent cvb5 rna translation interferes with cap dependent rna translation of eukaryotic hosts through a variety of virion enzymes sean and semler 2008 coxsackieviruses tend to be highly lytic but in the current study we did not observe any visible signs of fla cell injury resulting from cvb5 internalization cvb has also been shown to cause latent infections in cells that are not actively replicating becoming lytic as soon as the cells become active again feuer et al 2004 our tem images demonstrate that v vermiformis co cultured with the virus remained able to form pseudopods largely remain unencysted produce and expel digestive vesicles and trophozoites replicated therefore the absence of cytopathic effects seems unlikely to be a result of dormant or inactive amoebae cells and we therefore concluded that cvb5 was not lytic to the protozoa tested here in some cases coxsackieviruses have been shown to exploit the autophagic machinery to exit cells via autophagosomes or similar vesicular structures xin et al 2014 interestingly here we also observed virions expelled in vesicular structures of v vermiformis although due to the absence of visible cell injury we speculate that this is not due to exploitation of autophagy but is rather part of the natural ability of the amoebae to expel undigested material in the case of highly infectious human pathogenic viruses vesicles would increase the probability of an infective dose likely to disperse as aerosols from water distribution systems what is even more intriguing about members of the enterovirus genus is their rapid mutation rate which could result in the accumulation of multiple lethal mutations domingo et al 2008 in natural hosts such as mammalian cells mutations are negatively selected should replication of the virus occur in an environmental host it could result in the accumulation of unnecessary mutations and consequently could affect the infectivity and or tropism of the virus our findings however show that cvb5 only persisted as an infectious titre over the duration of the co culture experiments therefore the persistence of virions inside amoebae likely as accidental prey could simply be an alternative route of environmental persistence of virions environmental exposure to stressors and disinfectants could affect the infectivity of virions through physical effects on virus capsids charles et al 2008 mayer et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 the ability of infectious virions to persist without replicating in fla points to a possible new route for virion preservation protection in environmental waters that needs further assessment altogether our findings demonstrate a previously unexplored potential route for enteric virus persistence and dispersion such as in the ubiquitous tap water amoebae v vermiformis in this study we demonstrate the persistence of infectious cvb5 at doses likely to cause infection for a duration of time which is enough for v vermiformis to colonize new environments and disperse from them the virus was associated with all life stages of the amoebae including expelled vesicles which has not been previously demonstrated for human viruses in association with fla our findings also provide a methodology which could address existing knowledge gaps in future studies of virus fla interactions which address various challenges associated with their co culture 5 conclusions a clinical cvb5 isolate persisted as quantified genomic equivalents and remain infectious in liquid co cultures with the tap water amoeba vermamoeba vermiformis the virus was localized in all life stages of the amoeba and did not cause any visible cell injury to the protozoan to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of human virus expulsion within vesicles of free living amoebae a previously unexplored potential route for virion persistence and or dispersion through liquid aerosol pathways our methods allowed for thorough analysis of virus infectivity within optimally grown and active protozoa and could be used in

unfortunately the employment of photocatalysts remains a practical challenge in terms of high cost low efficiency secondary pollution and unexploited water matrices influence this study investigated the feasibility of photocatalysis to both treat water and produce hydrogen with practical water systems polymeric carbon nitride foam cnf with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation the reaction kinetics mechanisms and effect of natural water matrices and wastewater on cnf based photocatalytic removal of tetracycline hydrochloride tc hcl were systematically investigated furthermore the efficiency of clean hydrogen energy from natural water matrices and wastewater was also evaluated it was found that the photocatalytic performance of cnf for tc hcl removal was principally affected by calcination temperature in the presence of nh4cl the degradation rates of cnf 4 calcined at 550 c were approximately 1 84 2 49 and 7 47 times than that of the cnf 2 calcined at 600 c cnf 1 calcined at 500 c and gcn without nh4cl respectively results indicate that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to the large specific surface area increased availability of exposed active sites and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier based on electron spin resonance chemical trapping experiment and density functional theory calculation photoinduced oxidizing species o2 and holes initially attacked the c n c fragment of tc molecules which were finally mineralized to co2 water and inorganic matters under the synergistic influence of water constituents including acidity and alkalinity ion species and dissolved organic substances various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of tc hcl with the highest removal efficiency of 78 9 in natural seawater followed by reservoir water 75 0 tap

high amounts 1 428 107 p cm3 restricted removal due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction moreover the photocatalysts were able over repeated usage notably the hydrogen yields

band gap 2 7 ev environmental friendliness higher stability lower cost and tunable features which correspondingly has attracted much attention for utilization in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction wang et al 2015a the π conjugated graphene like porous structure in carbon nitride confers unique electron transfer properties and outstanding physical chemical stability ong et al 2016 the physicochemical characteristics of bulk graphite carbon nitride g c3n4 can be ameliorated to increase the specific surface area and slow the recombination of photoinduced carriers to this end various design strategies in nanoarchitectures have been proposed from zero dimensional 0d one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d to three dimensional 3d structures ong et al 2016 for instance wang et al reported a thermal chemical etching process of bulk g c3n4 for the preparation of 0d graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots cnqds wang et al 2014 the cnqds had strong blue emission as well as upconversion behavior which enhanced the visible light driven photocatalytic activity by at least 2 87 times when used as universal energy transfer components similar results were also obtained in our previous study wang et al 2016b xie et al obtained carbon nitride nanowires nanofibers with a diameter of 10 20 nm and a length of several hundreds of nanometers and demonstrated improved photocatalytic degradation performance due to the unique 1d structure high specific surface area good light harvesting properties and low recombination rate of electron hole pairs xie et al 2016 meng et al designed 2d atomically thin porous polymeric carbon nitrogen with significant hydrophilicity and lewis basicity to dramatically enhance the photocatalytic activity performance with a h2 evolution rate of 20 9 mmol h 1 g 1 using pt as a cocatalyst under am1 5g solar irradiation meng et al 2018 tian et al described a precursor reforming integrated calcination strategy to construct 3d mesoporous ultrathin g c3n4 which resulted in an apparent quantum efficiency of 27 8 at 420 nm which is far beyond the general g c3n4 photocatalysts tian et al 2017 although polymeric carbon nitride with stacked layered structures dominated by van der waals forces have intrinsically poor conductivity 3d nanoporous g c3n4 with an interconnected framework showed faster carrier transfer and separation than that of bulk g c3n4 with a loosened structure tian et al 2017 the electrical conductivity of 3d carbon nitride was shown to increase by a factor of 104 as compared to bulk g c3n4 10 11 zhang et al 2010 1d tubular graphitic carbon nitride with more nitrogen atoms at edge sites was found to exhibit much better overall conductivity than that of carbon nitride nanofibers muhammad et al 2015 meanwhile carbon nitride nanowire bundles also displayed more efficient charge separation compared with that of individual g c3n4 quantum dots zhang et al 2016a b these fascinating results suggest that the design of new 3d structures from 2d polymeric carbon nitride sheets may be a promising strategy to restrain the aggregation or stacking of subunits so as to accomplish sheet to sheet connectivity and provide large accessible surface area with more exposed active sites this forms the motivation of the current study notably a 3d structure achieves longer range order between individual carbon nitride sheets compared with bulk carbon nitride and have more space for mass transportation or storage for electron ion gas and liquid wang et al 2015b such superior structure characteristics endow favorable light trapping and efficient separation of charge carrier during the photocatalytic process therefore constructing 3d carbon nitride with ordered porous structure for the removal of antibiotics in wastewater is promising in practical applications the photocatalytic elimination efficiency of contaminants can be significantly affected by natural water constituents ubiquitously present in water because of the formation and consumption of strongly oxidized radicals the change in the physical chemical properties of the photocatalyst and the preferential reaction in parallel green energy production like h2 from wastewater which is also a capability of the photocatalysts further addresses the sustainability issue however no report is available on the bubble template fabrication of 3d polymeric carbon nitride foam for simultaneous antibiotic treatment and hydrogen generation from natural water and wastewater this is the focus of the current study specifically in this study a sugar blowing approach was adopted to prepare 3d foaming polymeric carbon nitride using ammonium chloride as the bubbling agent with tunable synthesis conditions e g polymerization temperature and heating rates to optimize the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride tc hcl in aqueous solution then we assessed the feasibility of degrading tc hcl in different natural water matrices namely tap water tw real seawater sw real reservoir water rw pharmaceutical wastewater pw and reverse osmosis concentrate roc in order to gain insights into how degradation may be affected by water constituents the degradation kinetics and the effect of different parameters including ph inorganic species photocatalyst dosage organic substance species and microplastics were investigated additionally photocatalytic degradation mechanisms were proposed based on experimental and theoretical results from spectroscopy measurement electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculation the potential for simultaneous water treatment and hydrogen energy generation via polymeric carbon nitride foam photocatalyst from natural water and wastewater was verified in this study 2 experiments detailed experiments had been added in supporting information sampling locations of various real water matrices with the corresponding characterization were shown in fig s2 and table 1 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization figs s3a and s3b show the pxrd patterns of gcn cnf 1 cnf 4 and cnf 2 all of them had similar diffraction patterns with typically polymeric carbon nitride phase the peak located at 13 4 and 27 9 were respectively indexed as the 100 and 002 planes corresponding to the in plane structure packing of aromatic systems and the interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic systems wang et al 2009 compared with pure gcn the presence of ammonium chloride strongly decreased the intensity of the 002 peak resulting from the reduced length of interlayer periodicity liang et al 2015 this proves the formation of loose foam like morphology of 3d foaming polymeric carbon nitride to some extent which is consistent with the photograph in fig s3c the density of cnf 4 was estimated to be 0 112 g cm3 and the zero potential of cnf 4 phpzc was 4 5 fig s3d with the increase of heating temperature the 002 peak slightly shifted to higher diffraction angles applying the higher degree of polymerization and the formation of more condensed interlayer stacking structure therefore it can be inferred that the formation of nh3 and hcl bubbles from the decomposition of ammonium chloride during the thermal condensation modulates the hierarchical 3d layer structure and morphological looseness as depicted by the sem and tem images respectively in fig 1 a and e gcn had compact agglomerate and lamellar structures in contrast to the bulk gcn the cnf obtained at 500 c cnf 1 fig 1c and g 550 c cnf 4 fig 1d and h and 600 c cnf 2 fig 1d and h had loose foam like structures of several micrometers specifically cnf 1 fig 1b and f was less porous and had rough surfaces due to the relatively low polymerization degree cnf 4 fig 1c and g exhibited thin smooth multi layered sheet while cnf 2 fig 1d and e had abundant defects on the surface of the sheets energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy results in fig 1j and k demonstrate the existence of c n and o elements uniformly distributed throughout the sheets in cnf 4 as shown in table 2 the ratios of c n for cnf 1 cnf 4 and cnf 2 are 1 23 0 79 and 0 86 respectively which indicate inadequate polymerization complete polymerization and the generation of atomic level defects with increased reaction temperature the composition and chemical state of gcn and cnf 4 were investigated by xps in fig s4a the c 1s spectrum displays four peaks centered at 284 4 286 1 288 1 and 288 8 ev which are ascribed to the sp2 bonded carbon c c bond c n c c n 3 groups and o c o species respectively wu et al 2018a the n 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into four peaks fig s4b namely c n c at 398 6 ev n c 3 at 399 7 ev graphitic n species at 401 2 ev and positive charge localization in heterocycles or π excitation at 404 6 ev li et al 2017 wu et al 2018b between gcn and cnf 4 the binding energy shifts in the c 1s and n 1s spectra are negligible suggesting that the chemical states were the same even in the presence of nh4cl via the sugar blowing effect the optical properties and semiconductor valence band potentials of gcn and cnf were determined by uv vis drs pl spectra and valence xps as shown in fig 2 a all photocatalysts had visible light absorption edges the optical gap of the cnf samples slightly blue shifts to lower wavelength because the multiple atom layer interconnected flaks of cnf reduced the length of interlayer periodicity and weakened the π conjugated system with the increased polymerization temperature the absorption edges of cnf were firstly red shifted and then blue shifted which may result in different generated content of electron hole pairs fig s5 shows that the e g values of gcn cnf 1 cnf 4 and cnf 2 are 2 87 2 99 2 94 and 3 05 ev respectively which indicate varying photocatalytic performance fig 2b shows that the valence band maximum vbm of gcn and cnf 4 were 1 93 ev and 1 95 ev respectively for cnf 4 the vbm mostly originated from the lone pair of n 2p orbitals which are not hybridized with the carbon thus the difference of vbm values between gcn and cnf 4 is presumably because of the decline in the energy level of the lone pair states with the change of the local electric field accordingly the conductor band maximum cbm of gcn and cnf 4 predominated by c n antibonding orbitals in the π conjugated system were calculated to be 0 94 ev and 0 99 ev respectively this phenomenon can be explained by the blowing effect of nh4cl which distorted the heptazine plane and further affected the π conjugated electronic states to some extent guo et al 2017 pl spectra were recorded at the excitation source of 315 nm and the results are shown in fig 2c both gcn and the cnf samples exhibited similar emitting behavior revealing that cnf maintained the optoelectronics character of the bulk gcn the emission peak center of gcn located at 437 nm may correlate with the π π electronic transitions in the π conjugated polymeric or s triazine tri s triazine units lu et al 2015 in contrast to gcn the wavelengths corresponding to the peak intensities of the cnf samples were longer and the full width at half maximum fwhm also became wider this is related to the change of π conjugated electronic states due to the modulation of microstructure via the blowing effect of nh4cl which is consistent with the results reported by zhang et al 2013 3 2 removal kinetics studies of various photocatalyst fig 2d showcases the performance of gcn cnf 1 cnf 2 cnf 3 cnf 4 and cnf 5 for tc hcl removal ph 4 2 over 70 min under visible light illumination before the photodegradation reaction the adsorption desorption equilibrium of tc hcl on the photocatalysts was attained after 60 min in the absence of visible light the no catalyst curve in fig 2d which represents the absence of any photocatalyst indicates negligible degradation of tc hcl over 70 min of irradiation in the presence of photocatalysts the concentrations of tc hcl decreased fastest for the cnf samples obtained at 550 c i e cnf 3 4 and 5 followed by cnf 1 then cnf 2 then gcn among the cnf samples obtained at 550 c with different heating rates cnf 4 showed the highest removal efficiency 64 2 followed by cnf 3 60 9 then cnf 5 60 2 this indicates that the heating rate during the cnf preparation had only a slight influence on the photocatalytic tc hcl removal efficiency the degradation kinetics based on pseudo first order model is quantified in fig s6 the rate constants were the highest for cnf 4 0 0142 min 1 followed by cnf 5 0 0131 min 1 cnf 3 0 0127 min 1 cnf 2 0 0077 min 1 cnf 1 0 0057 min 1 and finally gcn 0 0019 min 1 the degradation rates of cnf 4 were almost 1 84 2 49 and 7 47 times that of cnf 2 cnf 1 and gcn respectively this reveals that the tc hcl removal performance was mainly affected by the calcination temperature of cnf in the presence of nh4cl the photocatalytic activity of gcn was very low because it suffers from serious bulk recombination due to the lack of charge carrier transport channel from bulk to surface the higher photocatalytic tc hcl degradation performance of foaming cnf is predominantly due to the larger specific surface area ssa figs s7a and s7b show that the ssa of gcn cnf 1 cnf 4 and cnf 2 with mesoporous features were 9 5 13 5 54 6 and 85 2 m2 g 1 respectively this reflects the significant role of bubbles in increasing the multiple atom layer interconnected flakes to form loose foam like structures and thereby enhance the ssa the higher the heating temperature is the larger the ssa becomes and thereby more available exposed active sites for the photocatalytic reaction and more space for mass transport furthermore the improved electronic property of the multiple atom layer interconnected flakes in cnf may also contribute to high electron mobility and relocalization of photoexcited electrons in the surface terminal sites for enhanced photocatalytic performance taking the comparison between gcn and cnf 4 for example steady state pl spectra fig s7c indicate that the emission peak density of cnf 4 at 450 nm was lower than that of gcn implying that the recombination of photo excited charge carriers was efficiently suppressed furthermore the photocurrent density of cnf 4 fig s7d was higher than that of gcn directly reflecting the enhanced transport efficiency of the photogenerated carrier at the same heating rate of 7 c min the relatively lower photocatalytic performance of cnf 1 500 c relative to cnf 4 550 c is attributed to the short range atomic ordered carbon nitride caused by the blocked thermal polycondensation in the presence of sugar blowing guo et al 2017 as the temperature increased to 600 c cnf 2 thermal oxidation etching process may appear to enhance the degree of defect i e carbon vacancy as evident in the sem and tem images fig 1 and surface atomic ratio of c to n table 2 these defects may become the recombination center of the photogenerated carriers thereby reducing the photocatalytic performance 3 3 proposed photocatalytic reaction mechanisms in cnf 4 system photocatalytic pollutant degradation is related to the surface redox reaction catalyzed by the reactive sites abundant oxidative species emerge upon the redox reaction between the exciton in reactive sites and the water medium including h2o o2 and even organic species esr spin trap experiments were conducted using the cnf 4 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 3 a b the intensity of dmpo o2 in methanol dispersion or dmpo oh in water was negligible in the dark i e 0 min but became greater with longer durations of visible light irradiation similar trends were observed with temp as the trapping agent fig 3c these results suggest the photoinduced generation of o2 oh and 1o2 fig 3d shows one single lorentzian line at the g value of 1 9993 attributed to the unpaired electrons in the aromatic rings of carbon atoms the boosted intensity under visible light irradiation attests to a greater delocalization and mobility of the spins leading to higher charge carrier density su and zhang 2017 the production of active oxygen species involved in energy transfer singlet oxygen 1o2 and electron transfer o2 and oh are illustrated in fig 3e based on the electronic structures and band gap analysis the vb and cb potential of cnf 4 were 1 95 ev and 0 99 ev respectively under visible light irradiation the photoinduced electrons were localized at the c1 and n4 positions fig 3e of melem zheng et al 2018 the potentials of the accumulated electrons are more negative than that of the o2 reduction to o2 e o2 o2 0 046 ev correspondingly the adsorbed o2 molecule captures a photogenerated electron to generate o2 which is quickly reduced by another electron at the para position of melem to readily form h2o2 with the aid of h the presence of h2o2 was verified by a pl emission spectrum with the center at 406 nm because of the two electron reduction process of o2 as shown in fig s8 the vb potential of cnf 4 was more positive than e oh oh 1 99 v vs nhe and e oh h2o 2 27 v vs nhe and thus the way to generate oh via the oxidization of h2o is thermodynamically impossible the generated oh mainly originate from o2 and h2o2 the residual holes h in vb may oxidize water into o2 1 23 v vs nhe or directly degrade the tc hcl molecule the contribution of o2 oh and h to tc hcl photodegradation can be estimated via trapping experiments using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt 1 mm edta 2na h scavenger l ascorbic acid 1 mm laa o2 scavenger terephthalic acid 1 mm ta oh scavengers or ar flow excluding o2 as shown in fig 3g the photocatalytic degradation of tc hcl was apparently restrained after the injection of laa edta 2na or anaerobic condition nevertheless the addition of ta did not suppress the photocatalytic degradation performance it is suggested that the tc hcl degradation was principally dependent on the oxidative species of o2 or h or both frontier electron densities feds were calculated to predict the initial reactive sites of the tc molecule for radical species attack optimized tc molecular configuration and frontier electron densities of lumo and homo of tc are shown in fig 3h and i the detailed information for the theoretical calculation is listed in table 3 from table 3 the positions at o 23 n 29 c 8 o 32 c 4 o 25 and o 19 showed higher fed2 homo values revealing that the photogenerated holes prefer to oxidize these positions o 23 c 15 c 8 and n 29 also showed higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo values indicating that the o 23 c 15 c 8 and n 29 might be possibly attacked by o2 in addition based on the chemisorption pattern of cnf 4 c 15 and c 8 with the positive point charges were easily attacked due to the negative surface charge of cnf 4 at ph 4 5 o 23 and n 29 with the negative point charges were easily attacked due to the positive surface charge of cnf 4 at ph 4 5 an et al 2011 xie et al 2018 it may be inferred that the c c o fragment or c n c fragment the circled parts in fig 3h become the initial attack sites further hplc ms was employed precisely to identify reactive intermediates as shown in fig s9 it demonstrated that the intensity of the tc peak at m z 445 decreased with the process of the reaction the intensity of intermediates peaks firstly increased and then decreased with the presence and absence of new peaks during the degradation process main intermediates had been shown in table s1 the intermediate with the m z 416 was produced by losing the n methyl group of tc molecule suggesting the c n c fragment was the initially attacked sites subsequently the tc molecule could be finally degraded into other products via hydroxylation dealkylation dehydration and ring opening reaction xie et al 2018 total organic carbon toc tests showed a toc removal of 42 9 after 70 min of visible light irradiation demonstrating that part of tc was mineralized to co2 and water a proposed photocatalytic degradation pathway of tc over cnf 4 was revealled in fig s10 3 4 application of real wastewater treatment and influence of various factors in order to evaluate the feasibility of applying cnf 4 to degrade tc hcl via photocatalysis to real waters in the environment various natural water and real wastewater were tested table 1 as a benchmark deionized water dw with tc hcl was also included fig 4 a displays the effects of six water matrices on the degradation of tc hcl over the time period of 70 min the degradation efficiency at 70 min was the best for sw 78 9 followed by rw 75 0 tw 62 3 dw 49 8 roc 32 7 and finally pw 18 9 therefore compared to deionized water dw the degradation of tc hcl was inhibited in pw and roc but improved in sw rw and tw similar trends are revealed in fig 4b with the maximum degradation rate of 0 04841 min 1 for sw the removal efficiencies of total organic carbon toc for tc contaminated sw rw tw roc pw and dw deionized water were 20 1 15 6 10 9 32 7 17 5 and 42 9 respectively notably although the toc removal efficiencies for tc contaminated roc and pw were lower compared to tc contaminated dw the carbon mass removed was significantly higher than that in dw due to the different initial toc values moreover the difference in the removal efficiency of diverse water sources is also most likely a result of the combined action of many factors including solution ph inorganic ion species and dissolved organic substance which will be studied in detail in the following sections 3 4 1 effect of solution ph what is striking about solution ph in photocatalytic degradation process is the transformation of tetracycline speciation via the protonation deprotonation reaction the surface charge of the photocatalyst as well as the formation and stability of active intermediates responsible for decomposition wang et al 2017e the tc molecule can form three molecular species including cationic species ph 3 3 zwitterionic species 3 3 ph 7 68 and anionic species ph 7 68 wang et al 2016a depending on the zeta potential of cnf 4 different ph exerts different surface charge properties thus influencing the adsorptive interactions between tc hcl and the surface of cnf 4 fig 4c demonstrates that the degradation efficiency of tc hcl increased with the augmentation of ph 65 of tc hcl was removed after 70 min at a degradation rate of 0 01458 min 1 at the ph of 9 5 whereas only 45 6 was removed at a degradation rate of 0 00861 min 1 at the ph of 3 3 this implies that the competitive sorption of the various tetracycline species onto the cnf 4 surface accounts underlies the effect of ph on tc degradation based on the evolution pathway of the radical species fig 3e at the low ph value the o2 may prefer to combine with h to generate h2o2 which inhibits the degradation of tc dong et al 2018 the relatively higher degradation at ph 9 5 may be due to the higher photolysis of tc molecule under alkaline conditions hailili et al 2018 moreover the solution ph decreased after the photocatalytic degradation fig s11 and the change in ph increased as the initial ph value increased the decrease in ph may be related to the generation of by products like organic acids species which have been observed and demonstrated in our previous results wang et al 2016a 3 4 2 effect of ion species and ionic strength since surface water and real industrial effluents commonly contain inorganic anions and cations cl so4 2 no3 na k and mg2 it is necessary to systematically evaluate the influence of their presence on the degradation of tc hcl the unadjusted solution ph 4 2 was employed and the different ions mgso4 nacl and kno3 were added separately to the tetracycline solution at concentrations of 3 5 mm 7 0 mm or 14 0 mm as fig 5 a b and 5d show 3 5 mm of mgso4 or nacl negligibly affected the photocatalytic efficiency while higher concentrations improved photocatalytic removal of tc hcl on the other hand in the presence of kno3 fig 5c and d the lowest concentration of 3 5 mm gave the best removal efficiency these results confirm that different ion species influenced the photocatalytic removal process differently due to a possible generation of additional oxidizing species such as dichloride radical anion e g cl2 and sulfate radical anion e g so4 duta et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 3 4 3 effect of dissolved natural organics and protein tetracyclines typically coexist with natural dissolved organics or protein in natural water and wastewater like livestock wastewater accordingly humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa were adopted to investigate the influence of the coexisting organic substances bsa was used at concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l while ha at 5 10 20 and 40 mg l fig 6 a and c indicates that the removal efficiency of tc hcl was unaffected by lower concentrations 5 and 10 mg l of bsa but decreased at the highest concentration investigated of 20 mg l which is attributable to the competitive interaction with the oxidized radicals and the hydrophobic binding interaction between tetracyclines and bsa joseph et al 1973 wang et al 2018b furthermore fig 6b and c shows that compared to that in the absence of ha lower concentrations of ha between 5 mg l and 20 mg l improved the tc removal efficiency but the highest concentration of 40 mg l diminished the degradation rate from 49 7 to 39 7 as a photosensitizer in natural water ha can be excited to 3ha which further induced either the direct degradation of tc via energy transferring or the formation of reactive species li et al 2016 and thus markedly enhanced the degradation efficiency of tc hcl however excessive ha simultaneously served as the light filter and radical scavenger thereby attenuating tc photocatalysis zhu et al 2014 3 4 4 effect of microplastics plastic debris and artificial solid residues of micro or nano size including polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps have been detected in oceans and surface waters worldwide to evaluate the impact of microplastics polystyrene ps particles 0 88 μm as seen in fig 7 a were added into the reaction system at different concentrations interestingly fig 7b shows slight improvements in the removal efficiency with the increment of ps concentrations in the range of 1 428 102 1 428 106 p cm3 relative to that without ps particles however when the concentration of ps particles further increased to 1 428 107 p cm3 the degradation efficiency of tc was significantly impeded this stems from the light absorption by ps and the intrinsic adsorption interaction between tc and ps rochman et al 2013 liu et al 2017 3 4 5 cost cutting methods during practical application optimal photocatalyst dosage and photocatalyst stability over repeated use are advantageous for cost effectiveness from a practical perspective the effect of cnf 4 dosage between 50 and 200 mg was evaluated at the tc hcl concentration of 21 mg l and the results are shown in fig 7c and d it is apparent that the removal efficiency of tc increased then declined with the increased addition of cnf 4 fig 7c a similar trend is reflected in the degradation rate fig 7d the non monotonic relationship between cnf 4 concentration and degradation rate is because while more photocatalysts provided more active sites for the generation of strongly oxidized radicals to improve the tc degradation further increases of cnf 4 increased the turbidity of the solution and thereby reduced light penetration throughout the solution seyed dorraji et al 2017 the intermediate cnf 4 dosage of 100 mg l was therefore the optimum dosage that gave a degradation rate of 0 02058 min 1 moreover fig s12a shows that after four repeated degradation experiments the tc removal efficiency was sustained at about 70 indicating good stability and reuseability the crystallinity fig s12b of cnf 4 also changed negligibly after photocatalytic reactions demonstrating the excellent stability 3 5 reclamation of green energy hydrogen energy from natural waters and wastewater to evaluate the feasibility of generating hydrogen energy from natural waters and wastewater cnf 4 was used as the visible light responsive photocatalysts to evaluate the performance of hydrogen evolution via water splitting under visible light irradiation fig 7e shows that the cumulative h2 generally increased with reaction time the generated h2 at the end of 4 h was the greatest for dw tc 131 6 μmol followed by dw 101 2 μmol sw 70 3 μmol pw 60 0 μmol rw 37 0 μmol and tw 18 9 μmol which corresponded to respective average h2 production rates of 657 9 μmol g h 505 8 μmol g h 352 2 μmol g h 299 8 μmol g h 184 9 μmol g h and 94 3 μmol g h fig 7f note that compared with pure dw tc dw slightly improved the h2 generation amount because the tc hcl 40 3 removal efficiency consumed photoinduced holes leaving more photogenerated electrons for h2 formation particularly natural waters and wastewater constituents strongly inhibited the h2 production due to the concurrent consumption of photoinduced electron on the surface of photocatalyst however the hydrogen production rate of cnf 4 at the tc concentration of 210 mg l was much lower than that at the tc concentration of 21 mg l fig s13 likely because the higher tc concentration and the corresponding by products may change the solution ph and affect the charge properties of the photocatalyst as well as the triethanolamine oxidation further decreasing the hydrogen evolution rate the influence of ph on h2 evolution rate was also investigated fig s14 shows that solution ph had a notable effect on hydrogen generation using cnf 4 the rate of hydrogen generation was 512 4 μmol g 1 h 1 at the ph of 10 2 which is about 6 times that at the ph of 6 4 i e 84 4 μmol g 1 h 1 the suppressed effect is ascribed to the changes in the charge properties of the photocatalyst and the triethanolamine ionization pankaj et al 2015 considering the energy crisis and environmental concerns this study provides a new possibility for the reclamation of hydrogen energy simultaneously with water environmental remediation note that the effect of the complex constituents in actual waters on photocatalytic water splitting needs to be further investigated 4 conclusion 3d polymeric carbon nitride foam cnf with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation it was found to be efficient for the degradation of tc hcl in aqueous solution the photocatalytic performance of cnf for tc hcl removal was mainly affected by the calcination temperature of cnf in the presence of nh4cl the degradation rate of cnf 4 calcined at 550 c was almost 1 84 2 49 and 7 47 times than that of the cnf 2 600 c cnf 1 500 c and gcn without nh4cl respectively it was demonstrated that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to large specific surface area more available exposed active sites and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier photoinduced oxidizing species o2 and holes initially attacked the c n c fragment of tc molecules which were finally mineralized to co2 water and inorganic matters because of the difference in water constitutents including acidity and alkalinity ions species and strength and dissolved organic substances various water matrices greatly influenced the degradation rate of tc hcl with the highest removal efficiency of 78 9 in natural seawater followed by reservoir water 75 0 tap water 62 3 deionized water 49 8 reverse osmosis concentrate 32 7 then pharmaceutical wastewater 18 9 interestingly low amounts of microplastics can slightly improve tc removal but impede at higher concentrations 1 428 107 p cm3 due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction this kind of photocatalyst had excellent recyclability and stability with the optimum dosage of 100 mg l based on the trade off between availability of active sites and turbidity impeding light penetration moreover the 3d polymeric carbon nitride foam was proven to be an excellent photocatalyst for hydrogen generation from natural waters and wastewater this study presents new possibilities on simultaneously purifying wastewater and converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy based on a nonmetal porous photocatalyst acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge

19359,water and energy are key sustainability issues that need to be addressed photocatalysis represents an attractive means to not only remediate polluted waters but also harness solar energy unfortunately the employment of photocatalysts remains a practical challenge in terms of high cost low efficiency secondary pollution and unexploited water matrices influence this study investigated the feasibility of photocatalysis to both treat water and produce hydrogen with practical water systems polymeric carbon nitride foam cnf with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation the reaction kinetics mechanisms and effect of natural water matrices and wastewater on cnf based photocatalytic removal of tetracycline hydrochloride tc hcl were systematically investigated furthermore the efficiency of clean hydrogen energy from natural water matrices and wastewater was also evaluated it was found that the photocatalytic performance of cnf for tc hcl removal was principally affected by calcination temperature in the presence of nh4cl the degradation rates of cnf 4 calcined at 550 c were approximately 1 84 2 49 and 7 47 times than that of the cnf 2 calcined at 600 c cnf 1 calcined at 500 c and gcn without nh4cl respectively results indicate that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to the large specific surface area increased availability of exposed active sites and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier based on electron spin resonance chemical trapping experiment and density functional theory calculation photoinduced oxidizing species o2 and holes initially attacked the c n c fragment of tc molecules which were finally mineralized to co2 water and inorganic matters under the synergistic influence of water constituents including acidity and alkalinity ion species and dissolved organic substances various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of tc hcl with the highest removal efficiency of 78 9 in natural seawater followed by reservoir water 75 0 tap water 62 3 deionized water 49 8 reverse osmosis concentrate 32 7 and pharmaceutical wastewater 18 9 interestingly low amounts of the emerging microplastics slightly improved tc hcl removal whereas high amounts 1 428 107 p cm3 restricted removal due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction moreover the photocatalysts were able over repeated usage notably the hydrogen yields rates of polymeric carbon nitride foam were 352 2 299 8 184 9 and 94 3 μmol g h in natural seawater pharmaceutical wastewater water from reservoir and tap water respectively this study proves the potential of novel nonmetal porous photocatalyst to simultaneously treat wastewater while converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy keywords resourcelization photocatalysis polymeric carbon nitride foam microplastics hydrogen generation 1 introduction persistent organic pollutants with high toxicity solubility and carcinogenicity in the aquatic ecosystem are severe environmental issues wang et al 2016a li et al 2015 increasing amounts of pharmaceutically active compounds in groundwater drinking water surface water and aquatic marine environments have been detected which raises grave concerns regarding the impact on human health and the ecosystem balance gao et al 2016 based on a survey in 2015 an alarming total of 53 800 tons of 36 detectable antibiotics mainly tetracyclines macrolides chloramphenicols and lincomycin existed in china zhang et al 2015 this has provoked anxiety about the adverse effects on human health and the proliferation of multi resistant bacterial strains that reduce the therapeutic potential of antibiotics reardon 2014 antibiotics like tetracyclines tcs have been widely used for treating infectious diseases in human health animal husbandry and fish farming saadati et al 2016 towards the elimination of tetracycline in water and wastewater many effective and economical technologies have been developed to date including adsorption microbial degradation electrolysis photocatalysis and membrane separation peiris et al 2017 yang et al 2016 lu et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 among these methods photocatalytic degradation is superior in terms of easy operation low cost sustainable and ability to degrade and mineralize tetracycline tc into co2 and h2o under mild conditions using solar energy jiang et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 in the past few years five main kinds of photocatalysts that can harness solar energy namely tio2 based materials wang et al 2017a metal sulfide deng et al 2017 wang et al 2017b bismuth based semiconductor wang et al 2017c carbon nitride based photocatalyst jiang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a b and perovskite like mediums hailili et al 2018 these photocatalysts can surpass the band gap energy for producing the reductive electrons e and oxidizing holes h with favorable potential that react respectively with dissolved oxygen and hydroxyl ions oh in water for the generation of strong oxidants oh h2o2 and o2 which further for degrade the organics wang et al 2017d 2018a in contrast to the metal based photocatalyst two dimensional and metal free polymeric carbon nitride are promising with respect to narrow band gap 2 7 ev environmental friendliness higher stability lower cost and tunable features which correspondingly has attracted much attention for utilization in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction wang et al 2015a the π conjugated graphene like porous structure in carbon nitride confers unique electron transfer properties and outstanding physical chemical stability ong et al 2016 the physicochemical characteristics of bulk graphite carbon nitride g c3n4 can be ameliorated to increase the specific surface area and slow the recombination of photoinduced carriers to this end various design strategies in nanoarchitectures have been proposed from zero dimensional 0d one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d to three dimensional 3d structures ong et al 2016 for instance wang et al reported a thermal chemical etching process of bulk g c3n4 for the preparation of 0d graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots cnqds wang et al 2014 the cnqds had strong blue emission as well as upconversion behavior which enhanced the visible light driven photocatalytic activity by at least 2 87 times when used as universal energy transfer components similar results were also obtained in our previous study wang et al 2016b xie et al obtained carbon nitride nanowires nanofibers with a diameter of 10 20 nm and a length of several hundreds of nanometers and demonstrated improved photocatalytic degradation performance due to the unique 1d structure high specific surface area good light harvesting properties and low recombination rate of electron hole pairs xie et al 2016 meng et al designed 2d atomically thin porous polymeric carbon nitrogen with significant hydrophilicity and lewis basicity to dramatically enhance the photocatalytic activity performance with a h2 evolution rate of 20 9 mmol h 1 g 1 using pt as a cocatalyst under am1 5g solar irradiation meng et al 2018 tian et al described a precursor reforming integrated calcination strategy to construct 3d mesoporous ultrathin g c3n4 which resulted in an apparent quantum efficiency of 27 8 at 420 nm which is far beyond the general g c3n4 photocatalysts tian et al 2017 although polymeric carbon nitride with stacked layered structures dominated by van der waals forces have intrinsically poor conductivity 3d nanoporous g c3n4 with an interconnected framework showed faster carrier transfer and separation than that of bulk g c3n4 with a loosened structure tian et al 2017 the electrical conductivity of 3d carbon nitride was shown to increase by a factor of 104 as compared to bulk g c3n4 10 11 zhang et al 2010 1d tubular graphitic carbon nitride with more nitrogen atoms at edge sites was found to exhibit much better overall conductivity than that of carbon nitride nanofibers muhammad et al 2015 meanwhile carbon nitride nanowire bundles also displayed more efficient charge separation compared with that of individual g c3n4 quantum dots zhang et al 2016a b these fascinating results suggest that the design of new 3d structures from 2d polymeric carbon nitride sheets may be a promising strategy to restrain the aggregation or stacking of subunits so as to accomplish sheet to sheet connectivity and provide large accessible surface area with more exposed active sites this forms the motivation of the current study notably a 3d structure achieves longer range order between individual carbon nitride sheets compared with bulk carbon nitride and have more space for mass transportation or storage for electron ion gas and liquid wang et al 2015b such superior structure characteristics endow favorable light trapping and efficient separation of charge carrier during the photocatalytic process therefore constructing 3d carbon nitride with ordered porous structure for the removal of antibiotics in wastewater is promising in practical applications the photocatalytic elimination efficiency of contaminants can be significantly affected by natural water constituents ubiquitously present in water because of the formation and consumption of strongly oxidized radicals the change in the physical chemical properties of the photocatalyst and the preferential reaction in parallel green energy production like h2 from wastewater which is also a capability of the photocatalysts further addresses the sustainability issue however no report is available on the bubble template fabrication of 3d polymeric carbon nitride foam for simultaneous antibiotic treatment and hydrogen generation from natural water and wastewater this is the focus of the current study specifically in this study a sugar blowing approach was adopted to prepare 3d foaming polymeric carbon nitride using ammonium chloride as the bubbling agent with tunable synthesis conditions e g polymerization temperature and heating rates to optimize the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride tc hcl in aqueous solution then we assessed the feasibility of degrading tc hcl in different natural water matrices namely tap water tw real seawater sw real reservoir water rw pharmaceutical wastewater pw and reverse osmosis concentrate roc in order to gain insights into how degradation may be affected by water constituents the degradation kinetics and the effect of different parameters including ph inorganic species photocatalyst dosage organic substance species and microplastics were investigated additionally photocatalytic degradation mechanisms were proposed based on experimental and theoretical results from spectroscopy measurement electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculation the potential for simultaneous water treatment and hydrogen energy generation via polymeric carbon nitride foam photocatalyst from natural water and wastewater was verified in this study 2 experiments detailed experiments had been added in supporting information sampling locations of various real water matrices with the corresponding characterization were shown in fig s2 and table 1 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization figs s3a and s3b show the pxrd patterns of gcn cnf 1 cnf 4 and cnf 2 all of them had similar diffraction patterns with typically polymeric carbon nitride phase the peak located at 13 4 and 27 9 were respectively indexed as the 100 and 002 planes corresponding to the in plane structure packing of aromatic systems and the interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic systems wang et al 2009 compared with pure gcn the presence of ammonium chloride strongly decreased the intensity of the 002 peak resulting from the reduced length of interlayer periodicity liang et al 2015 this proves the formation of loose foam like morphology of 3d foaming polymeric carbon nitride to some extent which is consistent with the photograph in fig s3c the density of cnf 4 was estimated to be 0 112 g cm3 and the zero potential of cnf 4 phpzc was 4 5 fig s3d with the increase of heating temperature the 002 peak slightly shifted to higher diffraction angles applying the higher degree of polymerization and the formation of more condensed interlayer stacking structure therefore it can be inferred that the formation of nh3 and hcl bubbles from the decomposition of ammonium chloride during the thermal condensation modulates the hierarchical 3d layer structure and morphological looseness as depicted by the sem and tem images respectively in fig 1 a and e gcn had compact agglomerate and lamellar structures in contrast to the bulk gcn the cnf obtained at 500 c cnf 1 fig 1c and g 550 c cnf 4 fig 1d and h and 600 c cnf 2 fig 1d and h had loose foam like structures of several micrometers specifically cnf 1 fig 1b and f was less porous and had rough surfaces due to the relatively low polymerization degree cnf 4 fig 1c and g exhibited thin smooth multi layered sheet while cnf 2 fig 1d and e had abundant defects on the surface of the sheets energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy results in fig 1j and k demonstrate the existence of c n and o elements uniformly distributed throughout the sheets in cnf 4 as shown in table 2 the ratios of c n for cnf 1 cnf 4 and cnf 2 are 1 23 0 79 and 0 86 respectively which indicate inadequate polymerization complete polymerization and the generation of atomic level defects with increased reaction temperature the composition and chemical state of gcn and cnf 4 were investigated by xps in fig s4a the c 1s spectrum displays four peaks centered at 284 4 286 1 288 1 and 288 8 ev which are ascribed to the sp2 bonded carbon c c bond c n c c n 3 groups and o c o species respectively wu et al 2018a the n 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into four peaks fig s4b namely c n c at 398 6 ev n c 3 at 399 7 ev graphitic n species at 401 2 ev and positive charge localization in heterocycles or π excitation at 404 6 ev li et al 2017 wu et al 2018b between gcn and cnf 4 the binding energy shifts in the c 1s and n 1s spectra are negligible suggesting that the chemical states were the same even in the presence of nh4cl via the sugar blowing effect the optical properties and semiconductor valence band potentials of gcn and cnf were determined by uv vis drs pl spectra and valence xps as shown in fig 2 a all photocatalysts had visible light absorption edges the optical gap of the cnf samples slightly blue shifts to lower wavelength because the multiple atom layer interconnected flaks of cnf reduced the length of interlayer periodicity and weakened the π conjugated system with the increased polymerization temperature the absorption edges of cnf were firstly red shifted and then blue shifted which may result in different generated content of electron hole pairs fig s5 shows that the e g values of gcn cnf 1 cnf 4 and cnf 2 are 2 87 2 99 2 94 and 3 05 ev respectively which indicate varying photocatalytic performance fig 2b shows that the valence band maximum vbm of gcn and cnf 4 were 1 93 ev and 1 95 ev respectively for cnf 4 the vbm mostly originated from the lone pair of n 2p orbitals which are not hybridized with the carbon thus the difference of vbm values between gcn and cnf 4 is presumably because of the decline in the energy level of the lone pair states with the change of the local electric field accordingly the conductor band maximum cbm of gcn and cnf 4 predominated by c n antibonding orbitals in the π conjugated system were calculated to be 0 94 ev and 0 99 ev respectively this phenomenon can be explained by the blowing effect of nh4cl which distorted the heptazine plane and further affected the π conjugated electronic states to some extent guo et al 2017 pl spectra were recorded at the excitation source of 315 nm and the results are shown in fig 2c both gcn and the cnf samples exhibited similar emitting behavior revealing that cnf maintained the optoelectronics character of the bulk gcn the emission peak center of gcn located at 437 nm may correlate with the π π electronic transitions in the π conjugated polymeric or s triazine tri s triazine units lu et al 2015 in contrast to gcn the wavelengths corresponding to the peak intensities of the cnf samples were longer and the full width at half maximum fwhm also became wider this is related to the change of π conjugated electronic states due to the modulation of microstructure via the blowing effect of nh4cl which is consistent with the results reported by zhang et al 2013 3 2 removal kinetics studies of various photocatalyst fig 2d showcases the performance of gcn cnf 1 cnf 2 cnf 3 cnf 4 and cnf 5 for tc hcl removal ph 4 2 over 70 min under visible light illumination before the photodegradation reaction the adsorption desorption equilibrium of tc hcl on the photocatalysts was attained after 60 min in the absence of visible light the no catalyst curve in fig 2d which represents the absence of any photocatalyst indicates negligible degradation of tc hcl over 70 min of irradiation in the presence of photocatalysts the concentrations of tc hcl decreased fastest for the cnf samples obtained at 550 c i e cnf 3 4 and 5 followed by cnf 1 then cnf 2 then gcn among the cnf samples obtained at 550 c with different heating rates cnf 4 showed the highest removal efficiency 64 2 followed by cnf 3 60 9 then cnf 5 60 2 this indicates that the heating rate during the cnf preparation had only a slight influence on the photocatalytic tc hcl removal efficiency the degradation kinetics based on pseudo first order model is quantified in fig s6 the rate constants were the highest for cnf 4 0 0142 min 1 followed by cnf 5 0 0131 min 1 cnf 3 0 0127 min 1 cnf 2 0 0077 min 1 cnf 1 0 0057 min 1 and finally gcn 0 0019 min 1 the degradation rates of cnf 4 were almost 1 84 2 49 and 7 47 times that of cnf 2 cnf 1 and gcn respectively this reveals that the tc hcl removal performance was mainly affected by the calcination temperature of cnf in the presence of nh4cl the photocatalytic activity of gcn was very low because it suffers from serious bulk recombination due to the lack of charge carrier transport channel from bulk to surface the higher photocatalytic tc hcl degradation performance of foaming cnf is predominantly due to the larger specific surface area ssa figs s7a and s7b show that the ssa of gcn cnf 1 cnf 4 and cnf 2 with mesoporous features were 9 5 13 5 54 6 and 85 2 m2 g 1 respectively this reflects the significant role of bubbles in increasing the multiple atom layer interconnected flakes to form loose foam like structures and thereby enhance the ssa the higher the heating temperature is the larger the ssa becomes and thereby more available exposed active sites for the photocatalytic reaction and more space for mass transport furthermore the improved electronic property of the multiple atom layer interconnected flakes in cnf may also contribute to high electron mobility and relocalization of photoexcited electrons in the surface terminal sites for enhanced photocatalytic performance taking the comparison between gcn and cnf 4 for example steady state pl spectra fig s7c indicate that the emission peak density of cnf 4 at 450 nm was lower than that of gcn implying that the recombination of photo excited charge carriers was efficiently suppressed furthermore the photocurrent density of cnf 4 fig s7d was higher than that of gcn directly reflecting the enhanced transport efficiency of the photogenerated carrier at the same heating rate of 7 c min the relatively lower photocatalytic performance of cnf 1 500 c relative to cnf 4 550 c is attributed to the short range atomic ordered carbon nitride caused by the blocked thermal polycondensation in the presence of sugar blowing guo et al 2017 as the temperature increased to 600 c cnf 2 thermal oxidation etching process may appear to enhance the degree of defect i e carbon vacancy as evident in the sem and tem images fig 1 and surface atomic ratio of c to n table 2 these defects may become the recombination center of the photogenerated carriers thereby reducing the photocatalytic performance 3 3 proposed photocatalytic reaction mechanisms in cnf 4 system photocatalytic pollutant degradation is related to the surface redox reaction catalyzed by the reactive sites abundant oxidative species emerge upon the redox reaction between the exciton in reactive sites and the water medium including h2o o2 and even organic species esr spin trap experiments were conducted using the cnf 4 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 3 a b the intensity of dmpo o2 in methanol dispersion or dmpo oh in water was negligible in the dark i e 0 min but became greater with longer durations of visible light irradiation similar trends were observed with temp as the trapping agent fig 3c these results suggest the photoinduced generation of o2 oh and 1o2 fig 3d shows one single lorentzian line at the g value of 1 9993 attributed to the unpaired electrons in the aromatic rings of carbon atoms the boosted intensity under visible light irradiation attests to a greater delocalization and mobility of the spins leading to higher charge carrier density su and zhang 2017 the production of active oxygen species involved in energy transfer singlet oxygen 1o2 and electron transfer o2 and oh are illustrated in fig 3e based on the electronic structures and band gap analysis the vb and cb potential of cnf 4 were 1 95 ev and 0 99 ev respectively under visible light irradiation the photoinduced electrons were localized at the c1 and n4 positions fig 3e of melem zheng et al 2018 the potentials of the accumulated electrons are more negative than that of the o2 reduction to o2 e o2 o2 0 046 ev correspondingly the adsorbed o2 molecule captures a photogenerated electron to generate o2 which is quickly reduced by another electron at the para position of melem to readily form h2o2 with the aid of h the presence of h2o2 was verified by a pl emission spectrum with the center at 406 nm because of the two electron reduction process of o2 as shown in fig s8 the vb potential of cnf 4 was more positive than e oh oh 1 99 v vs nhe and e oh h2o 2 27 v vs nhe and thus the way to generate oh via the oxidization of h2o is thermodynamically impossible the generated oh mainly originate from o2 and h2o2 the residual holes h in vb may oxidize water into o2 1 23 v vs nhe or directly degrade the tc hcl molecule the contribution of o2 oh and h to tc hcl photodegradation can be estimated via trapping experiments using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt 1 mm edta 2na h scavenger l ascorbic acid 1 mm laa o2 scavenger terephthalic acid 1 mm ta oh scavengers or ar flow excluding o2 as shown in fig 3g the photocatalytic degradation of tc hcl was apparently restrained after the injection of laa edta 2na or anaerobic condition nevertheless the addition of ta did not suppress the photocatalytic degradation performance it is suggested that the tc hcl degradation was principally dependent on the oxidative species of o2 or h or both frontier electron densities feds were calculated to predict the initial reactive sites of the tc molecule for radical species attack optimized tc molecular configuration and frontier electron densities of lumo and homo of tc are shown in fig 3h and i the detailed information for the theoretical calculation is listed in table 3 from table 3 the positions at o 23 n 29 c 8 o 32 c 4 o 25 and o 19 showed higher fed2 homo values revealing that the photogenerated holes prefer to oxidize these positions o 23 c 15 c 8 and n 29 also showed higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo values indicating that the o 23 c 15 c 8 and n 29 might be possibly attacked by o2 in addition based on the chemisorption pattern of cnf 4 c 15 and c 8 with the positive point charges were easily attacked due to the negative surface charge of cnf 4 at ph 4 5 o 23 and n 29 with the negative point charges were easily attacked due to the positive surface charge of cnf 4 at ph 4 5 an et al 2011 xie et al 2018 it may be inferred that the c c o fragment or c n c fragment the circled parts in fig 3h become the initial attack sites further hplc ms was employed precisely to identify reactive intermediates as shown in fig s9 it demonstrated that the intensity of the tc peak at m z 445 decreased with the process of the reaction the intensity of intermediates peaks firstly increased and then decreased with the presence and absence of new peaks during the degradation process main intermediates had been shown in table s1 the intermediate with the m z 416 was produced by losing the n methyl group of tc molecule suggesting the c n c fragment was the initially attacked sites subsequently the tc molecule could be finally degraded into other products via hydroxylation dealkylation dehydration and ring opening reaction xie et al 2018 total organic carbon toc tests showed a toc removal of 42 9 after 70 min of visible light irradiation demonstrating that part of tc was mineralized to co2 and water a proposed photocatalytic degradation pathway of tc over cnf 4 was revealled in fig s10 3 4 application of real wastewater treatment and influence of various factors in order to evaluate the feasibility of applying cnf 4 to degrade tc hcl via photocatalysis to real waters in the environment various natural water and real wastewater were tested table 1 as a benchmark deionized water dw with tc hcl was also included fig 4 a displays the effects of six water matrices on the degradation of tc hcl over the time period of 70 min the degradation efficiency at 70 min was the best for sw 78 9 followed by rw 75 0 tw 62 3 dw 49 8 roc 32 7 and finally pw 18 9 therefore compared to deionized water dw the degradation of tc hcl was inhibited in pw and roc but improved in sw rw and tw similar trends are revealed in fig 4b with the maximum degradation rate of 0 04841 min 1 for sw the removal efficiencies of total organic carbon toc for tc contaminated sw rw tw roc pw and dw deionized water were 20 1 15 6 10 9 32 7 17 5 and 42 9 respectively notably although the toc removal efficiencies for tc contaminated roc and pw were lower compared to tc contaminated dw the carbon mass removed was significantly higher than that in dw due to the different initial toc values moreover the difference in the removal efficiency of diverse water sources is also most likely a result of the combined action of many factors including solution ph inorganic ion species and dissolved organic substance which will be studied in detail in the following sections 3 4 1 effect of solution ph what is striking about solution ph in photocatalytic degradation process is the transformation of tetracycline speciation via the protonation deprotonation reaction the surface charge of the photocatalyst as well as the formation and stability of active intermediates responsible for decomposition wang et al 2017e the tc molecule can form three molecular species including cationic species ph 3 3 zwitterionic species 3 3 ph 7 68 and anionic species ph 7 68 wang et al 2016a depending on the zeta potential of cnf 4 different ph exerts different surface charge properties thus influencing the adsorptive interactions between tc hcl and the surface of cnf 4 fig 4c demonstrates that the degradation efficiency of tc hcl increased with the augmentation of ph 65 of tc hcl was removed after 70 min at a degradation rate of 0 01458 min 1 at the ph of 9 5 whereas only 45 6 was removed at a degradation rate of 0 00861 min 1 at the ph of 3 3 this implies that the competitive sorption of the various tetracycline species onto the cnf 4 surface accounts underlies the effect of ph on tc degradation based on the evolution pathway of the radical species fig 3e at the low ph value the o2 may prefer to combine with h to generate h2o2 which inhibits the degradation of tc dong et al 2018 the relatively higher degradation at ph 9 5 may be due to the higher photolysis of tc molecule under alkaline conditions hailili et al 2018 moreover the solution ph decreased after the photocatalytic degradation fig s11 and the change in ph increased as the initial ph value increased the decrease in ph may be related to the generation of by products like organic acids species which have been observed and demonstrated in our previous results wang et al 2016a 3 4 2 effect of ion species and ionic strength since surface water and real industrial effluents commonly contain inorganic anions and cations cl so4 2 no3 na k and mg2 it is necessary to systematically evaluate the influence of their presence on the degradation of tc hcl the unadjusted solution ph 4 2 was employed and the different ions mgso4 nacl and kno3 were added separately to the tetracycline solution at concentrations of 3 5 mm 7 0 mm or 14 0 mm as fig 5 a b and 5d show 3 5 mm of mgso4 or nacl negligibly affected the photocatalytic efficiency while higher concentrations improved photocatalytic removal of tc hcl on the other hand in the presence of kno3 fig 5c and d the lowest concentration of 3 5 mm gave the best removal efficiency these results confirm that different ion species influenced the photocatalytic removal process differently due to a possible generation of additional oxidizing species such as dichloride radical anion e g cl2 and sulfate radical anion e g so4 duta et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 3 4 3 effect of dissolved natural organics and protein tetracyclines typically coexist with natural dissolved organics or protein in natural water and wastewater like livestock wastewater accordingly humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa were adopted to investigate the influence of the coexisting organic substances bsa was used at concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l while ha at 5 10 20 and 40 mg l fig 6 a and c indicates that the removal efficiency of tc hcl was unaffected by lower concentrations 5 and 10 mg l of bsa but decreased at the highest concentration investigated of 20 mg l which is attributable to the competitive interaction with the oxidized radicals and the hydrophobic binding interaction between tetracyclines and bsa joseph et al 1973 wang et al 2018b furthermore fig 6b and c shows that compared to that in the absence of ha lower concentrations of ha between 5 mg l and 20 mg l improved the tc removal efficiency but the highest concentration of 40 mg l diminished the degradation rate from 49 7 to 39 7 as a photosensitizer in natural water ha can be excited to 3ha which further induced either the direct degradation of tc via energy transferring or the formation of reactive species li et al 2016 and thus markedly enhanced the degradation efficiency of tc hcl however excessive ha simultaneously served as the light filter and radical scavenger thereby attenuating tc photocatalysis zhu et al 2014 3 4 4 effect of microplastics plastic debris and artificial solid residues of micro or nano size including polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps have been detected in oceans and surface waters worldwide to evaluate the impact of microplastics polystyrene ps particles 0 88 μm as seen in fig 7 a were added into the reaction system at different concentrations interestingly fig 7b shows slight improvements in the removal efficiency with the increment of ps concentrations in the range of 1 428 102 1 428 106 p cm3 relative to that without ps particles however when the concentration of ps particles further increased to 1 428 107 p cm3 the degradation efficiency of tc was significantly impeded this stems from the light absorption by ps and the intrinsic adsorption interaction between tc and ps rochman et al 2013 liu et al 2017 3 4 5 cost cutting methods during practical application optimal photocatalyst dosage and photocatalyst stability over repeated use are advantageous for cost effectiveness from a practical perspective the effect of cnf 4 dosage between 50 and 200 mg was evaluated at the tc hcl concentration of 21 mg l and the results are shown in fig 7c and d it is apparent that the removal efficiency of tc increased then declined with the increased addition of cnf 4 fig 7c a similar trend is reflected in the degradation rate fig 7d the non monotonic relationship between cnf 4 concentration and degradation rate is because while more photocatalysts provided more active sites for the generation of strongly oxidized radicals to improve the tc degradation further increases of cnf 4 increased the turbidity of the solution and thereby reduced light penetration throughout the solution seyed dorraji et al 2017 the intermediate cnf 4 dosage of 100 mg l was therefore the optimum dosage that gave a degradation rate of 0 02058 min 1 moreover fig s12a shows that after four repeated degradation experiments the tc removal efficiency was sustained at about 70 indicating good stability and reuseability the crystallinity fig s12b of cnf 4 also changed negligibly after photocatalytic reactions demonstrating the excellent stability 3 5 reclamation of green energy hydrogen energy from natural waters and wastewater to evaluate the feasibility of generating hydrogen energy from natural waters and wastewater cnf 4 was used as the visible light responsive photocatalysts to evaluate the performance of hydrogen evolution via water splitting under visible light irradiation fig 7e shows that the cumulative h2 generally increased with reaction time the generated h2 at the end of 4 h was the greatest for dw tc 131 6 μmol followed by dw 101 2 μmol sw 70 3 μmol pw 60 0 μmol rw 37 0 μmol and tw 18 9 μmol which corresponded to respective average h2 production rates of 657 9 μmol g h 505 8 μmol g h 352 2 μmol g h 299 8 μmol g h 184 9 μmol g h and 94 3 μmol g h fig 7f note that compared with pure dw tc dw slightly improved the h2 generation amount because the tc hcl 40 3 removal efficiency consumed photoinduced holes leaving more photogenerated electrons for h2 formation particularly natural waters and wastewater constituents strongly inhibited the h2 production due to the concurrent consumption of photoinduced electron on the surface of photocatalyst however the hydrogen production rate of cnf 4 at the tc concentration of 210 mg l was much lower than that at the tc concentration of 21 mg l fig s13 likely because the higher tc concentration and the corresponding by products may change the solution ph and affect the charge properties of the photocatalyst as well as the triethanolamine oxidation further decreasing the hydrogen evolution rate the influence of ph on h2 evolution rate was also investigated fig s14 shows that solution ph had a notable effect on hydrogen generation using cnf 4 the rate of hydrogen generation was 512 4 μmol g 1 h 1 at the ph of 10 2 which is about 6 times that at the ph of 6 4 i e 84 4 μmol g 1 h 1 the suppressed effect is ascribed to the changes in the charge properties of the photocatalyst and the triethanolamine ionization pankaj et al 2015 considering the energy crisis and environmental concerns this study provides a new possibility for the reclamation of hydrogen energy simultaneously with water environmental remediation note that the effect of the complex constituents in actual waters on photocatalytic water splitting needs to be further investigated 4 conclusion 3d polymeric carbon nitride foam cnf with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation it was found to be efficient for the degradation of tc hcl in aqueous solution the photocatalytic performance of cnf for tc hcl removal was mainly affected by the calcination temperature of cnf in the presence of nh4cl the degradation rate of cnf 4 calcined at 550 c was almost 1 84 2 49 and 7 47 times than that of the cnf 2 600 c cnf 1 500 c and gcn without nh4cl respectively it was demonstrated that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to large specific surface area more available exposed active sites and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier photoinduced oxidizing species o2 and holes initially attacked the c n c fragment of tc molecules which were finally mineralized to co2 water and inorganic matters because of the difference in water constitutents including acidity and alkalinity ions species and strength and dissolved organic substances various water matrices greatly influenced the degradation rate of tc hcl with the highest removal efficiency of 78 9 in natural seawater followed by reservoir water 75 0 tap water 62 3 deionized water 49 8 reverse osmosis concentrate 32 7 then pharmaceutical wastewater 18 9 interestingly low amounts of microplastics can slightly improve tc removal but impede at higher concentrations 1 428 107 p cm3 due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction this kind of photocatalyst had excellent recyclability and stability with the optimum dosage of 100 mg l based on the trade off between availability of active sites and turbidity impeding light penetration moreover the 3d polymeric carbon nitride foam was proven to be an excellent photocatalyst for hydrogen generation from natural waters and wastewater this study presents new possibilities on simultaneously purifying wastewater and converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy based on a nonmetal porous photocatalyst acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge
