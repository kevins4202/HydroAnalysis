1800,in the rainfall nowcasting various error sources cause high uncertainty and bias of rainfall nowcasts this study proposes a novel user friendly and post processing approach for rainfall nowcast bias correction from the perspective of hydrological users and operators of flood nowcasting system this study first shows how the novel approach called the biward tracking bit technique is applied effectively for real time bias correction of the rainfall nowcast targeting 1 hour lead time and then verifies the applicability to the storm events occurred in korea the technique presented here consists of two steps first the bias correction ratio is derived from backward tracking which is then applied to the rainfall nowcast searched by applying forward tracking a simple and effective pattern correlation method is used for real time storm tracking as example applications this study considers the six largest storm events that occurred in korea from 2019 to 2021 this study uses the rainfall nowcasts generated by the maple radar based nowcasting system that contains a set of 36 nowcasts with a 10 minute interval covering the entire territory of korea with a total of 1 050 1 050 grids with 0 5 0 5 km2 grid size and the rain gauge data observed at over 580 stations the derived results are then compared with those based on the conventional bias correction method all the findings in this study confirm that the bit based method outperforms the conventional method that is the correction ratios determined by the bit based method are all found to be within reasonable range without any serious outliers also the bias corrected rainfall nowcasts are found to be close to the ground observations on the other hand the conventional method produces many overestimated outliers including more than 36 mm h even worse than the uncorrected rainfall nowcasts keywords rainfall nowcast bias correction storm tracking biward tracking pattern correlation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the flash flood is a typical pluvial hazard which can increase the stream water level in a short time and lead to fatal results with large casualties and property damage angelakis et al 2020 many countries are preparing for flash floods by introducing warning systems to minimize possible causalities the flash flood alarm system ffas which was developed in the 1970 s by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws may be the first of these mogil et al 1978 more flexible application of the flash flood guidance ffg was tried sweeney 1992 and radar information was also used to improve the spatial resolution of the input rainfall data carpenter et al 1999 application of the flash flood warning system to ungauged basins was also tried georpakakos 2006 recent studies cover various issues that include the quality improvement of input data real time applications scale issues and uncertainty analysis modrick et al 2017 ruti et al 2020 georgakakos et al 2022 flash flood warning systems have been developed in many countries for example the european flood alert system efas was developed to minimize the flash flood risk in trans national river basins thielen et al 2009 bartholmes et al 2009 the soil water index swi based tank model was used to predict the flash flood in japan saito and matsuyama 2015 in taiwan the nowcasting of debris flow was the main issue of the flash flood jan and lee 2004 in korea the flash flood monitoring and prediction model f2map was developed by the ministry of land and transportation affairs kim et al 2007 and the korean ffg koffg by the korea meteorological administration korea meteorological administration kma 2006 also the national disaster management research institute ndmi developed the flash flood warning system for mountain areas ndmi 2010 as the flash flood warning system is asked to secure sufficient lead time the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf is generally used as input for the system the precipitation forecast can be produced by directly applying the numerical weather prediction nwp model or by numerically analyzing the radar data for example the flooded locations and simulated hydrographs flash project in the u s can use the qpf data from the advective statistical adstat system and the qpf data from the high resolution rapid refresh hrrr model gourley et al 2017 the 24 h qpf data were used for the southeast river forecast center serfc and the lower mississippi river forecast center lmrfc of the nws nws 2010 similarly the 24 h qpf data from the consortimum for small scale model cosmo were used for the prevention information and early warning preview system covering all of europe vincendon et al 2009 the ensemble qpf from the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ensemble prediction system ecmwf eps was used as input for the efas of the european commission s joint research centre jrc demeritt et al 2013 also as the input for the flood warnings in england the blending of the 6 h nimrod qpf and the nwp of the uk met office was used smith and austin 2000 the road inundation warning system riws in france used the qpf data as input provided by meteo france and the service de prevention des crues versini 2012 the ffws in korea also used the qpf data as input generated by the mcgill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by lagrangian extrapolation maple ndmi 2010 ndmi 2016 however the low quality of the qpf frequently leads to false alarms which deteriorates the reliability of the flash flood warning system the predictive uncertainty of rainfall has been one of the main quality issues of the qpf the predictive uncertainty of radar based rainfall nowcasting originates from 1 errors in the estimation of the current state of the rain and motion fields initial state errors and 2 limitations of lagrangian persistence on which the maple is based to extrapolate the evolution of the rain fields model errors pulkkinen et al 2019 the main sources of initial state errors are related to the radar observation such as spatiotemporal variability of the vertical profile of reflectivity uncertainty in the conversions from the reflectivity to the rain rate radar qpe partial and total beam blockage attenuation of radar waves sampling errors etc ciach et al 2000 bech et al 2003 fabry and seed 2009 villarini and krajewski 2010 kirstetter et al 2015 seo and krajewski 2015 errors or uncertainties mentioned above are highly prone to be turned into the inaccuracy of rainfall nowcasts as the radar cannot capture the true current rain field as well as the advection method based on lagrangian persistence extrapolates rainfall intensity that already contains errors model errors are related to the nowcasting algorithm s imperfections and the atmospheric state s persistence assumption foresti et al 2019 they include the inaccuracies of the motion field retrieval algorithm the diffusion of the advection scheme the assumption of stationarity of the motion field tracking errors growth and decay errors and systematic biases due to orographic effect wilson et al 1998 ebert and mcbride 2000 germann et al 2006 foresti and seed 2015 tomaz et al 2020 these errors and uncertainties incur discrepancies in the properties of rainfall nowcasts such as mean and variance between observations and nowcasts under or overestimation of rainfall intensity the displacement of rainfall parcels and features etc in addition the lagrangian persistence doesn t represent the growth and decay of rainfall features and thus it cannot provide useful radar qpf for longer lead times shehu and haberlandt 2021 most previous studies have been conducted to improve each component of the rainfall nowcasting system targeting different error sources for example efforts to improve the initial state errors have been made to enhance the quality of radar qpe input data to the rainfall nowcasting system as an accurate radar qpe is critical for the rainfall qpf quality and is one of the most important drivers for hydrological nowcasts fabry and seed 2009 germann et al 2009 foresti et al 2019 many studies have been conducted to improve the quality of radar observation based on merging with other precipitation information like rain gauge satellite and an orographic precipitation climatology zhang et al 2014 shehu and haberlandt 2021 shao et al 2021 or correct biases using ground rain gauge data chen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 improving model errors normally aims to reflect the chaotic nature of the atmosphere to model components instead of relying only on the consequent radar echo fields and assuming their persistence within a few hours radhakrishna et al 2012 more improved motion vector generation and extrapolation approaches have been applied based on machine learning foresti et al 2019 filling the absence of source sink terms or merging nowcasts with the corresponding nwp lin et al 2005 baldauf et al 2011 seed et al 2013 foresti et al 2016 bechini and chandrasekar 2017 sideris et al 2020 as the maple which is used in the korean ffws cannot represent the growth and decay of rainfall and nonstationary advection vector fields several researchers have attempted to consider growth and decay terms in nowcasting models by employing the advection diffusion equation with nonstationary motion vectors mueller et al 2003 radhakrishna et al 2012 tang and matyas 2018 ryu et al 2020 in particular to account for the systematic biases due to orographic forcing a variety of techniques incorporated localized systematic growth and decay into the computation of nowcasts which is especially useful for alpine terrain foresti and seed 2015 foresti et al 2018 sideris et al 2020 to consider the predictive uncertainty due to model errors mentioned above it has been attempted to characterize the uncertainty via ensemble approaches based on stochastic simulation in which correlated noise fields are used to perturb a deterministic nowcast bowler et al 2006 germann et al 2009 berenguer et al 2011 seed et al 2013 foresti et al 2016 nerini et al 2017 however a post processing approach that can reduce the bias of rainfall nowcasts containing model errors has been highly limited to be applied to the best of our knowledge the bias of the qpf is another serious problem for the accuracy of the flash flood warning system this problem should be overcome by improving the rainfall nowcasting model itself however at this time it is impossible to expect the bias free qpf in the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe procedure the mean field bias correction is a necessary step to correct the difference between the estimated and observed precipitation vasiloff et al 2007 kim and yoo 2014 kim et al 2018 jozaghi et al 2019 the quantile mapping technique is an example which matches the statistical moments of both data to remove the bias andres et al 2016 song et al 2021 however it is rare to find cases where this kind of post processing technique was applied to the qpf to remove the bias only a few cases are found in the literature for example sikder and hossain 2019 applied the delta change method to correct the 7 day qpf of nwp to be used as input for monsoon flood forecasting in the south and southeast asia region fuentes barrios and sierra lorenzo 2021 used the artificial neural network for the bias correction of the qpf of the national meteorological service of cuba recently jabbari and bae 2020 applied the combined method of total least squares and dynamic weighting to correct the 6 to 72 h nwp qpf however their application was found to insufficient for real time bias correction veenhuis and brill 2022 used accumulation and disaggregation experiments to correct the 6 and 24 h qpf bias with their focus mainly on the rainfall occurrence timing just as in other countries the real time bias correction of qpf in korea is another practical issue in particular a simple and fast technique is required if the qpf is applied to the flash flood nowcasting simply put the available time for bias correction in the flash flood warning system is very short the flash flood warning system in korea is composed of three components of the production of qpf system operation and warning and evacuation ndmi 2011 first it used to be about 30 min min to produce the qpf using the maple but recently the required time has been shortened to about 10 min by introducing the new composite field production method of hybrid surface rainfall hsr in 2018 son et al 2018 the second step of system operation and warning includes the hydrological modeling with the input qpf and the warning based on the resulting runoff information it takes about 5 min for the system operation and another 10 min to issue the warning the last step evacuation requires about 30 min for small basins ndmi 2011 as a result a 1 h qpf is required for this flash flood warning system which is the target of the flash flood warning system in korea the 1 h qpf should have adequate quality to be used as system input ministry of land 2016 and only 5 min is given for the bias correction of the 1 h qpf this study proposes a user friendly post processing bias correction method using generated rainfall nowcasts only from the perspective of hydrological users and flood nowcasting warning system operators basically it is assumed that a variety of errors in the nowcasting process of the rainfall nowcasting system are turned into the biases of rainfall nowcast output referring to foresti and seed 2015 the bias correction method proposed in this study can correct the tracking errors and the systematic biases due to the orographic effect the tracking error consists of an error in the nowcasted location of a rainfall feature and an error in the rainfall intensity change over a lead time tomaz et al 2020 as the chaotic nature of the atmosphere does not obey the lagrangian persistence assumption indicating that the intensity of rainfall features in the current state remains constant over the lead time the tracking error is likely to be contained in the bias of maple nowcasts with a high probability the approach proposed in this study partly addresses the tracking error by multiplying the correction ratio to rainfall nowcasts to reduce discrepancies in rainfall intensity between observations and nowcasts in addition more than 70 of korea s land territory is covered by the mountainous areas this causes the inclusion of systematic biases due to orographic forcing into the maple rainfall nowcasts the bias correction method applied in this study can also consider decreasing the orographic errors causing the under or overestimation of rainfall intensity by reducing the rainfall nowcast bias the method proposed in this study has several novelties most previous studies focusing on the quality of radar based rainfall nowcasts have attempted to improve the quality of initial state errors induced by imperfect estimation of the current states of rainfall and motion fields foresti et al 2015 woo and wong 2017 chen et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020a imhoff et al 2020b kim et al 2021 shehu and haberlandt 2021 or model errors related to tracking or growth and decay of rainfall features in the extrapolation process li et al 1995 mecklenburg et al 2000 bowler et al 2004 radhakrishna et al 2012 foresti et al 2019 pulkkinen et al 2019 ryu et al 2020 pulkkinen et al 2021 unlike the previous studies this study proposes a novel post processing approach that can reduce the bias of rainfall nowcasts including both initial and model errors after they are generated in particular the method proposed in this study is user friendly as it is quite simple and easy to implement using rain fields only and the computation time is short additionally the storm tracking method proposed in this study is suitable for the purpose of flash flood nowcasting and warning for small mountainous basins while the conventional optical flow tracking approach is based on the motion of precipitation parcels at each grid turner et al 2004 bellon et al 2010 storm tracking for flood nowcasting would be better to focus on the movement of a specific storm or a window containing multiple rainfall features rather than individual rainfall intensity at each grid under consideration of the purpose of this study the pattern recognition based approach is appropriate to track storms or windows more efficiently whereas it is hard to determine window locations based on the conventional point based approach due to an unsteady and non uniform motion of rainfall intensity at each grid lastly the storm tracking method of this study is motivated from the tracking radar echoes by correlation trec but is applied for a completely different purpose the trec only applies pattern recognition technique based on the cross correlation coefficient to advect nowcast storms rinehart and garvey 1978 li et al 1995 however this study alters its purpose to determine and apply the bias correction ratio to enhance the quality of rainfall nowcasts this study aims to apply the biward tracking bit technique for the real time bias correction of the 1 h qpf as the given time for real time bias correction is very short the correction factor is derived by analyzing the past present relation of the precipitation field which is then to be applied to the future precipitation field i e the present future relation in both procedures to define the past present relation and present future relations storm tracking should be applied as the storm tracking is applied two times at every time step of real time correction one being backward and the other forward it is called the biward tracking in this study the pattern correlation method is used for storm tracking in na and yoo 2018 where only the backward tracking bt was considered the pattern correlation method was found to be simple easy and effective the correction factor is derived based on comparison of the present nowcasted and past observed which is then to be applied to the 1 h nowcast this study will apply this bias correction method based on the biward tracking method every 10 min this study will consider the six largest storm events that occurred in korea from 2019 to 2021 the qpf based on the maple and the precipitation measurements from automatic weather stations awss are used in this study 2 methodology the bit based bias correction method is applied to the rainfall nowcasts generated by the maple which advects precipitation echoes based on the storm moving vectors and the lagrangian persistence assumption the maple is the rainfall nowcasting system operated by the kma in korea a storm tracking technique considering the similarity of spatial rainfall patterns is implemented to search the location of the storm to be corrected and the correction ratio is determined based on the concept of the g r ratio the determined correction ratio is sequentially applied to the rainfall nowcasts with 1 h lead time in real time the performance of the proposed bias correction method is assessed with two statistical metrics 2 1 storm tracking method storm tracking methods are used to identify the moving characteristics of a storm by searching its location continuously in time this method provides information about both the direction of movement and velocity of a storm based on its locations at two successive time steps it is also possible to predict the future location of the storm using the derived information of the storm trajectory na and yoo 2018 in the past the methods using ground gauge observations were popular clayton and deacon 1971 marshall 1980 niemczynowicz 1987 however as the use of weather radar has become prevalent the methods using radar echoes or rain field images have been highly suggested austin and bellon 1974 rinehart and garvey 1978 for example the tracking of radar echoes with correlation trec technique can track the storm trajectory by comparing the correlations of rain echoes this trec technique has also been improved to predict the pathways of storms lai 1998 han et al 2008 liang et al 2010 this study employed the storm tracking method based on the pattern correlation coefficient hilst and russo 1960 cheng et al 1998 han et al 2009 shah et al 2015 to estimate the pattern correlation coefficient the size of local window blue box in fig 1 and the spatial range of tracking red circle in fig 1 should be determined here the local window indicates the region where the storm tracking starts with a calculation of the pattern correlation coefficient the spatial range of tracking is the circular area within which the storm tracking is implemented the pattern correlation coefficient is calculated for every window within this range in this study the tracking radius of the range and window size were determined to be 150 km and 40 km respectively to consider the local sized basins and fast moving storms that mostly cause flash floods based on the trial and error similar to sideris et al 2020 the determined window size was large enough to cover the maximum size of more than 300 mountainous basins that were selected to be vulnerable to flash flood by the national disaster management institute 2010 the pattern correlation based storm tracking in this study also assumed that there is no change in the spatial pattern of the storm during a tracking interval δt which is a maximum 70 min reinhart and garvey 1978 novák et al 2009 wang et al 2013 the storm tracking in this study was done over three steps first the local window in which the flash flood is expected to occur in the future is determined over the nowcasted rainfall field blue box in fig 1 a next the pattern correlation coefficient is calculated for all possible windows located within the tracking range from the local window the windows ① ⑦ in fig 1 b indicate a few of them among them the target window is selected as the one for which the highest pattern correlation coefficient is calculated in the example of fig 1 window ⑦ is selected as the target window the result of storm tracking presents the storm that was located in the local window in the past at time t δt fig 1 a will be moved to window ⑦ in the future after the time interval δt passes this study proposes a novel method which is called the biward tracking bit system the bit is a mixture of backward tracking na and yoo 2018 which applies the storm tracking method reversely in time for example from t to t δt and forward tracking which is applied in the normal direction of time for example from t δt to t the pattern correlation coefficient pcc follows the general correlation coefficient calculation process but the only difference is that it uses two dimensional spatial data eq 1 is an equation for the pattern correlation coefficient between the local window at time t δt and any window within the tracking range at time t 1 pcc m 1 m n 1 n p m n t δ t p t δ t q m n t q t m 1 m n 1 n p m n t δ t p t δ t 2 m 1 m n 1 n q m n t q t 2 where p m n t δ t is the nowcasted rain rate at grid m n in the local window at time t δt and q m n t is the nowcasted rain rate at the same location but in any other window within the tracking range at time t the m and n values are both 80 as the window size was 40 km 40 km and the spatial resolution of the rainfall nowcast was 0 5 0 5 km2 in this study the p t δ t term is the mean nowcasted rain rate over the local window at time t δt and q t is the same but over any window within the tracking range at time t the pattern correlation coefficient has the value 1 to 1 the closer to 1 or 1 the better the two data are correlated but the closer to 0 the more uncorrelated they are that is if the pattern correlation coefficient is near 1 or 1 the spatial patterns of storm at time t δt and at time t are similar to each other but if it is close to 0 there is a high possibility that the two storms are not the same 2 2 bias correction ratio this study applied the so called g r ratio to estimate the bias of rainfall nowcasts this ratio has been used to correct the mean field bias of radar rain rate anagnostou et al 1999 seo et al 1999 this method has been mainly applied to the bias correction of radar or satellite observations borga et al 2002 chumchean et al 2006a chumchean et al 2006b tesfagiorgis et al 2011 kim and yoo 2014 the g r ratio can be simply estimated by dividing the ground rain rate by the radar rain rate simple calculation of the g r ratio enables biases to be corrected rapidly which is suitable for the purpose of flash flood warning under the limit of time it is also possible to apply a kalman filter model for the real time correction of the mean field bias using the g r ratio smith and krajewski 1991 seo et al 1999 chumchean et al 2006a yoo et al 2011 ground gauge rainfall data is commonly used as ground truth in the estimation of mean field bias correction ratio the g r ratio in this study seo and breidenbach 2002 šálek et al 2004 chumchean et al 2006a yoo et al 2014 kim et al 2018 even though a few studies assume the radar qpe to be the true rainfall intensity for the evaluation of the rainfall nowcasts imhoff et al 2020a imhoff et al 2020b imhoff et al 2022 and korea has a dense radar network yoon and lim 2022 the radar qpe is well known to come with substantial uncertainty and biases foresti and seed 2015 germann et al 2006 hazenberg et al 2011 van de beek et al 2016 yoo et al 2014 lee et al 2015 kim et al 2018 lee and song 2020 in this study the g r ratio represents the amount of ground rainfall relative to the rainfall nowcast which can be calculated as follows 2 g r i 1 n g i i 1 n r i where g r indicates the g r ratio n is the number of ground and nowcast data pairs in the target window which is searched by the bt at each time step with a 10 min interval and n equals five when five ground gauges are located in the target window the gi term indicates the ground gauge rain rate and ri is the nowcasted rain rate at a grid where the ground gauge is located if the g r ratio is 1 0 it is assumed that no bias exists in the rainfall nowcasts the values of the g r ratio from 0 0 to 1 0 mean that the nowcasts overestimate the ground rain rate in general the g r ratio is estimated to be higher than 1 0 which indicates that the rainfall nowcast underestimates the ground observation the g r ratio is applied as a uniform correction factor to all non zero ground rain rates located in the alarm window 2 3 bias correction of rainfall nowcasts 2 3 1 limitations of the conventional method the bias correction approach adopted in the conventional flash flood warning system in korea follows the process shown in fig 2 in this figure t 0 indicates the current time in this t 60 and t 60 are 60 min before and after the current time respectively first the bias correction ratio is determined using the ground rain rate observed at the current time t 0 and the nowcasted rain rate of 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast which was generated 60 min ahead of the current time t 60 then the bias of rainfall nowcast generated at the current time which predicts rain rate at the future time t 60 is corrected by applying the correction ratio determined at the current time the most critical limitation of the conventional method is that the movement of storms is not considered that is the determination and application of the bias correction ratio are implemented at the same location local window this approach can cause the problems shown in fig 3 the first problematic situation is that there could be no storm in the local window blue box in fig 3 when determining the bias correction ratio the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 00 on july 25 2019 predicts that a storm will arrive at the local window after an hour fig 3 b however 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 17 00 which was used to determine the bias correction ratio that will be applied to the rain rate in fig 3 b shows that no rain will occur in the local window at that time fig 3 a this problem stems from the assumption of spatially continuous storm movement therefore the bias correction ratio determined in this situation is highly prone to being overestimated or underestimated or it cannot even be determined when the nowcasted rain rate is zero which indicates the conventional method could have a high chance of large errors even if a storm is located in the local window another problem can occur when the bias of 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast in the local window generated at 19 00 on july 25 2019 is corrected fig 3 c the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 00 is used fig 3 b however the storms in the local window of fig 3 b and c are not the same in more detail the storm of fig 3 b has already passed by the local window to another location at the time of fig 3 c and another storm has arrived in the local window of fig 3 c that is the storm considered for the determination of bias correction ratio is different from the storm to be bias corrected which includes another significant amount of error this problem also stems from the movement of storm 2 3 2 proposed method based on the biward tracking bit the bias correction method based on the biward tracking bit in this study can overcome the limitations of the conventional method this study applied the bit method to correct the bias of 1 h qpf in real time fig 4 the storm tracking used in the bit method enables the movement of storm to be considered which in the conventional method has not been considered fig 3 a new method proposed in this study is based on the object tracking with pattern recognition and consists of five steps figs 4 5 as the first step a local window is determined at which the spatial sum of rainfall intensity at every grid in a given window is the highest conditioned on the rainfall nowcast at t 60 generating rainfall over the basin of interest or a storm at any location fig 5 a the step 2 is implementing the backward tracking bt applying using 10 and 70 min lead time rainfall nowcasts t0 and t 60 respectively generated at 10 min before the current time t 10 fig 5 b the bt searches where the storm which will arrive at the local window after an hour t 60 is located at the current time t0 based on the similarity of storm patterns determined from the rain fields of 10 and 70 min lead time t0 and t 60 respectively generated at t 10 fig 4 that is the target window for which the bias correction ratio the g r ratio is determined is searched to be where the highest correlation coefficient is calculated by the bt the reason for using the rainfall nowcasts generated 10 min before the current time not at the current time is to determine the bias correction ratio in advance and allow the bias correction to be applied in real time next the bias correction ratio is determined as the step 3 in the target window searched by the bt using the ground rain rate observed at the current time t0 and the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcasts t0 generated at the previous time t 10 fig 5 c this correction ratio is applied to the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast t 60 generated at the current time t0 to reduce the bias as the step 4 the forward tracking ft is implemented before the application of the ratio to search the alarm window where flash flood will occur after an hour t 60 fig 5 d the ft is employed under the same procedure as the bt but forward in time like advection which is done reversely in the bt therefore the pattern correlation coefficient is estimated from the target window in the ft in this case the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated t0 at 10 min before the current time t 10 and the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast t 60 generated at the current time t0 are used fig 4 finally after searching the alarm window based on the ft the step 5 is applying the pre determined correction ratio to the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast in the alarm window t 60 the bias of rainfall nowcast is corrected in real time by applying the bit method sequentially every 10 min fig 4 fig 5 shows an application example of the bit method in this example the current time is assumed to be 18 20 on july 25 2019 the 70 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 10 predicts that a storm will occur in the local window blue box in fig 5 a first the bt is applied using the 10 and 70 min lead time rainfall nowcasts generated at 18 10 to search the target window where the bias correction ratio is determined the target window blue box with solid line in fig 5 b is selected as the window to provide the largest pattern correlation coefficient next the ft is employed to search the alarm window where the flash flood will occur for the ft application the pattern correlation coefficient is also calculated between the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast in the target window generated at 18 10 blue box in fig 5 c and the available windows located within the tracking range of 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 20 current time the window with the largest pattern correlation coefficient is determined to be the alarm window blue box with solid line in fig 5 d and the bias of rainfall nowcast in the alarm window is corrected by applying the correction ratio 2 4 evaluation measures of the bias correction results this study evaluates the performance of the bit based bias correction method by comparing the corrected nowcasts to rain gauge measurements on the ground that is the bias corrected rainfall nowcast at grids where ground gauges are located were selected and compared to the ground rain rate root mean square error rmse and relative bias rbias were considered as measures for quantitative evaluation the rmse is the absolute value of the average difference between the ground rain rate and the nowcasted rain rate the rbias is the average ratio of the ground rain rate to the difference between the nowcasted and ground rain rate for both rmse and rbias the closer to 0 the smaller the discrepancy between the ground rain rate and the nowcasted rain rate the sign of the rbias indicates that the rainfall nowcasts are underestimated negative or overestimated positive which is different from rmse which cannot have a negative sign eqs 3 and 4 present how to calculate the rmse and rbias respectively 3 rmse i 1 n r i g i 2 n 4 rbias i 1 n r i g i i 1 n g i where n is the number of ground and nowcast data pairs at each time step with a 10 min interval and r and g indicate the nowcasted rain rate and the ground rain rate respectively 3 data and storm events this study used the rainfall nowcasts generated by the maple and the rain gauge data the maple is a very short range rainfall nowcasting system first developed by germann and zawadzki 2002 it provides the nowcasts of precipitation echoes which are made using storm moving vectors the storm moving vectors are derived from past and current radar reflectivity images by applying the variational echo tracking vet technique the korea meteorological administration kma ministry of environment in korea currently utilizes the maple for the purpose of flood nowcasting hwang et al 2020 the maple is composed of a total of 1 050 1 050 grids with a size of 0 5 km 0 5 km covering the entire territory of korea red box of fig 6 its lead time ranges 10 to 360 min i e six hours that is each maple rainfall nowcast contains a set of observation and 36 nowcasts with a 10 min interval rain gauge data are available every minute at over 580 stations across the korean peninsula the rain gauge data are also managed by the kma the 1 min rain gauge data were aggregated every 10 mininutes which is the time resolution of maple nowcasts so that they could be used to apply the storm tracking and bias correction a total of six storm events that occurred in korea from 2019 to 2021 were selected in this study that is the bit based bias correction method was applied to these events table 1 summarizes the basic characteristics of the storm events the first and second events that occurred on july 25 26 2019 were a convective storm with high speed and intense rainfall that can occur flash flood with a high probability this storm induced locally high rainfall intensity mostly in central korea kma 2019 an abnormally longer period of monsoon which was recorded as the longest monsoon after 1973 in korea that occurred on august 7 8 2020 caused the third and fourth storm events an average daily rainfall of more than 30 mm continuously occurred during these events in the central and southern region of korea this sequential rainfall events caused flash floods in the mountainous regions like chuncheon and choerwon with a few casualties kma 2020 the remaining two events that occurred in 2021 correspond to a typhoon the fifth event which occurred on august 21 2021 grew linearly from north to south and moved rapidly along with the westerly wind causing strong rainfall over the korean peninsula the last storm event that occurred on august 24 2021 was caused by typhoon omais and induced heavy rain in the southern part of the korean peninsula with flood victims more than 100 people kma 2021 table 1 provides more detailed information of the six storm events 4 results and discussions 4 1 example application to an event 1 this section illustrates an example how the bit based bias correction method was applied to rainfall nowcasts the application region local window of this example was daejeon located in the central part of the korean peninsula blue box of fig 6 the targeted time was 18 20 on july 25 2019 both the bit based method proposed in this study and the conventional method were applied for the comparison the conventional method derived the correction ratio using the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 17 20 and the ground rainfall observed at 18 20 this correction ratio was then applied to the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 20 since the conventional method did not consider the movement of storm events the region where the correction ratio was derived became the same as the local window where the correction ratio was applied on the other hand the bit based bias correction method derived the correction ratio in the target window the result of the bt application using the 10 and 70 min lead time nowcasts generated at 18 10 this ratio was then applied to the 60 min lead time nowcast generated at 18 20 for bias correction first the correction ratio was derived by applying the conventional method fig 8 shows the scatter plot between the ground rain rates observed at 18 20 on july 25 2019 and the 60 min nowcasted rain rates generated at 17 20 both in the local window fig 7 a within this window a total of nine ground gauges are located the scatter plot shows that the nowcasted rain rate was much smaller than the ground rain rate overall while the ground rain rates were distributed between 0 and 2 5 mm h the nowcasted rain rates were mostly less than 0 5 mm h the correction ratio based on eq 2 for this case was determined to be 8 90 this correction ratio is also the same as the reciprocal of the slope of the regression line in fig 8 different from the conventional method the bit based method determines the correction ratio in the target window searched by the bt in this example the bt was applied to the 10 and 70 min lead time rainfall nowcasts both generated at 18 10 on july 25 fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 a there will be a severe storm in the local window of the 70 min lead time rainfall nowcast now by applying the bt the location of this storm was searched in fig 7 b the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast as a result of applying the bt the target window was finally determined that is the storm in the target window the blue box in fig 7 b will arrive in the local window the blue box in fig 7 a after 60 min the pattern correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0 823 between these local and target windows next the correction ratio was determined in the target window blue box in fig 7 b the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 10 on july 25 and the ground observed rainfall gauged at 18 20 were used to determine the correction ratio as in fig 8 b the dots represent the pair of ground rain rates observed at 18 20 in the target window and the 10 min lead time nowcasted rain rates generated at 18 10 the ground rain rates were 50 mm h or less and the nowcasted rain rates were 20 mm h or less this result was different from the result of the conventional method the dots were located closer to the 1 to 1 line the regression line was also found to be close to the 1 to 1 line the correction ratio the reciprocal of the slope of the regression line was in this case determined to be 2 25 this value was far smaller than that of the conventional method simply put the bit based method can avoid the possible overestimation or underestimation of the correction ratio and also provide a more reasonable estimate of the correction ratio by considering the storm movement bias correction was conducted by applying the correction ratio determined in the previous step in the conventional method as the storm tracking was not involved in the local window the target window and the alarm window were the same simply put the correction ratio determined is derived and applied at the same local window however in the bit based method the forward tracking ft should be applied to search the alarm window in which the storm is expected to cause the flash flood in the future fig 9 a shows the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 10 on july 25 2019 while fig 9 b shows the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 20 the ft in this section used these two data as a result of applying the ft to the possible windows within the tracking range around the target window the alarm window blue box in fig 9 b could be searched the pattern correlation coefficient between the target window blue box in fig 9 a and the alarm window was estimated to be 0 712 this alarm window becomes the target for the bias correction that is the storm located in the target window fig 9 a will move to the alarm window fig 9 b after 60 min which may cause a severe flash flood now the bias of rainfall nowcast in the alarm window is going to be corrected by applying the correction ratio determined in the previous step finally the correction ratios determined in the last step based on the conventional and bit based method were applied to the rainfall nowcast the corrected rainfall nowcast was evaluated by comparing the bias corrected rainfall nowcast to the ground observation the evaluation for this example was conducted at 19 20 on july 25 2019 that is the bias corrected 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 20 was compared to the ground rainfall observed at 19 20 fig 10 shows the scatter plot comparing the ground observation and three different rainfall nowcasts a without any bias correction original b bias corrected by the conventional method bc conv and c bias corrected by the bit based method bc bit as can be seen in this figure the nowcasted rain rates corrected by the bit based method were found to be located much closer to the 1 to 1 line than the other two cases on the other hand the conventional method showed over corrected results including more than 100 mm h even worse than the uncorrected rainfall nowcasts quantitative evaluation using the rbias and rmse was also performed in the case of the bit base method the rbias was 0 18 and the rmse was 3 31 which means the smallest difference from the ground observation rainfall in the case of the conventional method the rbias and rmse were 2 21 and 34 00 respectively indicating that the rainfall nowcast was corrected to the excessively high value compared to the ground rain rate the nowcasting quality was even lower than the case without bias correction of which the rbias and rmse were 0 64 and 8 42 respectively based on the evaluation results of this example it was found that the conventional method can even lower the quality of rainfall nowcasting whereas the bit based method has improved the quality by adequately correcting the bias 4 2 bias correction for all storm events in this section the bit based method was applied to all the six storm events following the same procedure as in the example application in the previous section as the real time nowcast was made every 10 min the entire procedure was also repeated every 10 min summarizing the results first the pattern correlation coefficient of the bt was determined to be 0 7 or higher in most storm events this result indicates that the target window was searched well by the bt fig 11 summarizes the correction ratios determined every 10 min in all six storm events from this figure it was found that the correction ratios determined by the bit based method were all within the range of about 2 to 7 overall whereas those by the conventional method contained many exceptions like 10 or more the difference between these two cases was more significant in the events on july 25 2019 and august 7 2020 in particular the bit based method also worked well for the simple and large storms especially in the two events in 2021 the correction ratios were determined to be near 1 or less in fact the conventional method was also good at providing similar correction ratios by chance as the region of influence under intense rainfall was too broad that is if the size of the storm is huge high rainfall intensities are prone to stay in the local window within 1 h a period between correction ratio determination and application even if the storm moves however the storm considered for the determination of bias correction ratio is different from the storm to be bias corrected which includes another significant amount of error hence it is also true that when the conventional method was applied more outliers were found the derived bias correction ratios were then applied to correct rainfall nowcasts the effect of bias correction of rainfall nowcasts was first verified through the time series of mean rainfall intensity at the alarm windows for six events fig 12 first it was found that rainfall nowcasts underestimated ground observation in the first to fourth events or overestimated in the fifth and sixth events grey lines in fig 12 even if the conventional method not considering the movement of storms partially addressed the problem of rainfall intensity underestimation it corrected the rainfall intensity to extremely large values in the first and third events red lines in fig 12 a and c in fact there were many time steps when the correction gave excessive rainfall intensity of 100 mm h or more in the first heavy rain event red lines in fig 12 a on the other hand the bit based method corrected the rainfall nowcasts to a similar extent to the ground rainfall intensity while addressing the underestimation problem blue lines in fig 12 it was found that the bit based method corrects the rainfall nowcasts similarly to the ground rainfall intensity in the fifth and sixth events as well the scatter plots between radar nowcasts and ground observation enable more clear comparison the black dots blue crosses and red x s in fig 13 indicate the original maple rainfall nowcasts without correction the rainfall nowcasts corrected by the conventional method and the rainfall nowcasts corrected by the biward tracking in the alarm windows targeted as bias correction every 10 min respectively as can be seen in fig 13 the application results for the six storm events were found to be consistent for example in the two events in 2019 the role of the bias correction was not so clear even though those underestimated nowcasted rain rates were corrected they seemed not so consistent with the observed the two events in 2020 show the potential of the bias correction obviously the bias corrected nowcasts were found to be much better than the original nowcasts which were also concentrated around the 1 to 1 line however it was not easy to distinguish any better method finally the two events in 2021 showed the clear advantage of applying the bias correction method most of the bias corrected nowcasts were found near the 1 to 1 line in these events the better performance of the bit based method could also be confirmed fig 14 presents the box plots of the ground rainfall intensity which is assumed to be true rainfall intensity original rainfall nowcasts without correction and rainfall nowcasts corrected by the conventional and biward tracking methods in most events the ground rainfall intensity s box and rainfall intensity corrected by bit s box appeared similar the original rainfall nowcast without correction ori was found to have a limitation of underestimating the ground rainfall intensity for the first to fourth events the conventional method which does not consider the movement of storms partially addressed the problem of rainfall intensity underestimation but often corrected the rainfall intensity into extremely high values such as the first and third events fig 14 a and c on the other hand the bit based method solved the underestimation problem as well as corrected the rainfall nowcasts to a similar extent to the ground rainfall intensity fig 14 a and c while outliers were included but not that much like the conventional method fig 14 c and d the bit based method was also found to correct the rainfall nowcasts similarly to ground rainfall intensity for the fifth and sixth events fig 14 e and f finally the performance of the conventional method and the bit based method was quantitatively evaluated using the metrics like rbias and rmse rainfall nowcasts without any bias correction ori the bias corrected case by the conventional method conv and the bias corrected case by the bit based method bit were all compared in this comparison the ground rain rates of 0 10 and 20 mm h were set as thresholds the use of these thresholds was to evaluate the correction efficiency depending on the target rainfall intensity in most flash flood warning systems the target rainfall intensity is far higher than 10 mm h table 2 summarizes the result as can be seen in table 2 the rbias for the case without any bias correction ori were found mostly negative indicating significant underestimation this problem was alleviated by applying the conventional method conv as well as the bit based method bit in some events the conventional method worked better than the bit based method however it is also found that after the conventional method was applied the rbias could become worse overall the bit based method was found better simply the mean of the absolute values of rbias was found to be far smaller than that of the conventional method application the rbias value itself was also found to be near zero to indicate the good bias correction ability of the bit based method the effect of the threshold rainfall intensity was also found to be strong the rbias became smaller when higher threshold was applied in fact this result is expectable as when rather high rainfall intensity was considered in its calculation the extremely low or high correction ratio could be avoided different from rbias it was not so easy to decrease the rmse even after the bias correction this is because as the correction ratio is higher than 1 0 in most cases the bias correction has increased the variability in the applications of this study the same result was also derived however it could also be a serious problem to have larger rmse after the bias correction these rather extreme cases can be found in the application of the conventional bias correction method in particular in the events in 2019 and 2020 the rmses of the convention method application were found to be much higher than the case even without the bias correction this result is mainly due to many over corrected outliers however in the case of the 2021 events the rmse after bias correction was relatively stable which is because the rainfall nowcasts were good to be similar to the observed 4 3 discussions on the bias correction results one of the major findings of this study can be found from the analysis on very high rainfall intensity it was clearly demonstrated that the bias correction method proposed in this study can also improve the quality of the highest rainfall intensity occurred in six storm events as flash flood is highly probable to be induced when rainfall intensity is high the bias correction method proposed in this study can be considered as an appropriate approach table 3 compares the mean values of ground observation original rainfall nowcast without correction and rainfall nowcasts corrected by the conventional and biward tracking method at gauges in the alarm window when the maximum rainfall intensity occurred the more similar to the mean ground rainfall intensity value the better the nowcasting quality the mean rainfall forecast corrected by the biward tracking method showed the most similar results to the ground rainfall intensity among three radar nowcasts without correction corrected by the conventional method and corrected by the biward tracking method the results can be understood that the bit based correction method is more efficient when the rainfall intensity is high on the other hand the conventional method corrected the nowcasts to too high 1st and 3rd events or low 5th event values the bit based bias correction method was also found to have superior skill in predicting the nowcast error suppose the correction ratio or its estimation method is skilled in predicting the model error in that case the nowcast error of the corrected rainfall nowcasts will be smaller than that of the original rainfall nowcasts without correction it can also be expected that the correction ratio s temporal variability or variance is reduced which can be understood as an increase of temporal consistency of the correction ratio that can induce the stable rainfall nowcast correction table 4 summarizes the temporal variability of correction ratios and the errors of radar qpe and radar nowcasts with or without bias correction first of all the radar qpe error was found to be the main source of the nowcast error in all six events fabry and seed 2009 a significant portion of the radar qpe error was included in the nowcast error of the original maple even in the sixth event the errors of radar qpe and original rainfall nowcasts were almost the same next the error of the rainfall nowcasts corrected by the biward tracking method proposed in this study was the smallest on average and the errors of the original nowcasts were the next smallest the conventional method worked badly even increasing the nowcast error of original rainfall nowcasts this result indicates the proposal of the biward tracking method in this study is suitable for predicting the nowcast error as the temporal variability of the correction ratio was also smaller than that of the conventional method additionally the proposed bias correction method was able to reduce the nowcast error the most in the case of typhoon which showed clear moving trajectories of storms events 5 and 6 on the other hand in the case of a convective storm event 1 where the growth and decay of storms occur frequently there may be limits in reducing the nowcast error because it is difficult to determine the correction ratio properly the effect of the noise of correction ratio on bias correction performance was further analyzed in this section the noise was quantified by a standard deviation of the ratios the correction ratio determined at every 10 min time step for each of the six rainfall events was used to calculate the noise standard deviation and compared with performance metrics rmse and rbias fig 15 shows that the values of performance metrics gradually increase as the noise of correction ratio increases for both the conventional and bit based methods in other words the rainfall nowcast correction effect gradually decreases as the noise of the correction ratio increases it was found that the proposed method may be less effective for rainfall events with the large noise of correction ratio due to the rapid or abrupt movement of storms however the conventional method was more sensitive to the noise of correction ratio than the bit based method therefore it can be concluded that the bit based method is less influenced by the noise of correction ratio compared to the conventional method which means it has a more robust performance in bias correction although the bit based method was found to be able to reduce the bias or increase the quality of rainfall nowcasts this study has the limitation of not considering a few error sources causing biases of rainfall nowcasts like initial state error growth and decay error tracking error regarding the displacement of rainfall features etc since the maple used in this study extrapolates rainfall intensity based on lagrangian persistence it inherently cannot predict the growth and decay of rainfall features turner et al 2004 pulkkinen et al 2019 shehu and haberlandt 2021 as the convective storms are likely to be dissipated or newly generated within an hour the growth and decay errors are dominant in the convective storm events therefore the method proposed in this study needs to be expanded to the rainfall nowcasting systems capable of simulating growth and decay for convective storms even if the bias correction method applied in this study can increase or decrease the rainfall intensity of the rainfall nowcasts but has the limitation of being unable to displace rain in the wrong place that is the proposed method is hard to overcome the case when it is predicted to be no rain at a certain grid from the 1 hour rainfall nowcast but it rains in real which corresponds to the tracking error nevertheless the results of this study showed that the bit based method could reduce the bias of rainfall nowcasts for various types of rain events such as convective stratiform and cyclonic 5 conclusions this study applied the biward tracking bit method for the real time bias correction of the 1 h qpf that is the bias correction ratio was derived based on the backward tracking which was then applied to the rainfall nowcast searched by applying the forward tracking in this study the pattern correlation method was used for the storm tracking which was also found to be simple and effective in na and yoo 2018 the correction factor was derived based on the comparison of the present 545 nowcasted and past observed which was then applied to the 1 h nowcast this study considered the six largest storm events that occurred in korea from 2019 to 2021 the results derived in this study were then compared with those based on the conventional bias correction method the findings in this study can be summarized as follow first the storm tracking method using the pattern correlation coefficient was found to be easy and effective in this application as the spatial range of tracking and the window size were reasonably determined by considering the storm movement velocity and the storm size itself the computation burden for the storm tracking could be minimized the tracking radius of the range and window size were determined to be 150 km and 40 km in this study the correction ratios determined by the bit based method were all found to be within reasonable range without any serious outliers on the other hand the conventional method produced many extreme correction ratios which could not be easily applied for the correction of the rainfall nowcasts it was also found that the performance of the bit based method was especially good for the simple and large storms this result is due to a limitation from the natural properties of the maple that cannot consider the growth and decay of convective storms also the performance of the tracking method used in this study was superior for the storms with less changing in scale and clearer trajectories as it was based on pattern recognition the metrics of the first and second storm events which are convective storms showed relatively lower performance compared to the rest which correspond to monsoon or typhoon the bias corrected rainfall nowcast with the correction ratio derived by the bit based method was found to be much closer to the ground observation than that based on the conventional method on the other hand the conventional method showed many over corrected results including more than 100 mm h even worse than the uncorrected rainfall nowcasts the above result could also be confirmed with some quantitative measures like the rbias and rmse in particular the rbias value was found to become very small near zero after the bias correction to indicate the good bias correction ability of the bit based method also the rmses in the cases of bit based method were found to be smaller than those based on the conventional method however it should be mentioned that different from rbias the rmse was not decreased significantly even after the bias correction based on the bit based method this was because the bias correction increased the variability of the rainfall field as the correction ratio was in most cases higher than 1 0 the above findings in this study support that the bit based method outperformed the conventional method the bit based method proved that it could properly correct the bias in the rainfall nowcast also the bias correction was very stable the performance was even reliable when stronger

1800,in the rainfall nowcasting various error sources cause high uncertainty and bias of rainfall nowcasts this study proposes a novel user friendly and post processing approach for rainfall nowcast bias correction from the perspective of hydrological users and operators of flood nowcasting system this study first shows how the novel approach called the biward tracking bit technique is applied effectively for real time bias correction of the rainfall nowcast targeting 1 hour lead time and then verifies the applicability to the storm events occurred in korea the technique presented here consists of two steps first the bias correction ratio is derived from backward tracking which is then applied to the rainfall nowcast searched by applying forward tracking a simple and effective pattern correlation method is used for real time storm tracking as example applications this study considers the six largest storm events that occurred in korea from 2019 to 2021 this study uses the rainfall nowcasts generated by the maple radar based nowcasting system that contains a set of 36 nowcasts with a 10 minute interval covering the entire territory of korea with a total of 1 050 1 050 grids with 0 5 0 5 km2 grid size and the rain gauge data observed at over 580 stations the derived results are then compared with those based on the conventional bias correction method all the findings in this study confirm that the bit based method outperforms the conventional method that is the correction ratios determined by the bit based method are all found to be within reasonable range without any serious outliers also the bias corrected rainfall nowcasts are found to be close to the ground observations on the other hand the conventional method produces many overestimated outliers including more than 36 mm h even worse than the uncorrected rainfall nowcasts keywords rainfall nowcast bias correction storm tracking biward tracking pattern correlation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the flash flood is a typical pluvial hazard which can increase the stream water level in a short time and lead to fatal results with large casualties and property damage angelakis et al 2020 many countries are preparing for flash floods by introducing warning systems to minimize possible causalities the flash flood alarm system ffas which was developed in the 1970 s by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws may be the first of these mogil et al 1978 more flexible application of the flash flood guidance ffg was tried sweeney 1992 and radar information was also used to improve the spatial resolution of the input rainfall data carpenter et al 1999 application of the flash flood warning system to ungauged basins was also tried georpakakos 2006 recent studies cover various issues that include the quality improvement of input data real time applications scale issues and uncertainty analysis modrick et al 2017 ruti et al 2020 georgakakos et al 2022 flash flood warning systems have been developed in many countries for example the european flood alert system efas was developed to minimize the flash flood risk in trans national river basins thielen et al 2009 bartholmes et al 2009 the soil water index swi based tank model was used to predict the flash flood in japan saito and matsuyama 2015 in taiwan the nowcasting of debris flow was the main issue of the flash flood jan and lee 2004 in korea the flash flood monitoring and prediction model f2map was developed by the ministry of land and transportation affairs kim et al 2007 and the korean ffg koffg by the korea meteorological administration korea meteorological administration kma 2006 also the national disaster management research institute ndmi developed the flash flood warning system for mountain areas ndmi 2010 as the flash flood warning system is asked to secure sufficient lead time the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf is generally used as input for the system the precipitation forecast can be produced by directly applying the numerical weather prediction nwp model or by numerically analyzing the radar data for example the flooded locations and simulated hydrographs flash project in the u s can use the qpf data from the advective statistical adstat system and the qpf data from the high resolution rapid refresh hrrr model gourley et al 2017 the 24 h qpf data were used for the southeast river forecast center serfc and the lower mississippi river forecast center lmrfc of the nws nws 2010 similarly the 24 h qpf data from the consortimum for small scale model cosmo were used for the prevention information and early warning preview system covering all of europe vincendon et al 2009 the ensemble qpf from the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ensemble prediction system ecmwf eps was used as input for the efas of the european commission s joint research centre jrc demeritt et al 2013 also as the input for the flood warnings in england the blending of the 6 h nimrod qpf and the nwp of the uk met office was used smith and austin 2000 the road inundation warning system riws in france used the qpf data as input provided by meteo france and the service de prevention des crues versini 2012 the ffws in korea also used the qpf data as input generated by the mcgill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by lagrangian extrapolation maple ndmi 2010 ndmi 2016 however the low quality of the qpf frequently leads to false alarms which deteriorates the reliability of the flash flood warning system the predictive uncertainty of rainfall has been one of the main quality issues of the qpf the predictive uncertainty of radar based rainfall nowcasting originates from 1 errors in the estimation of the current state of the rain and motion fields initial state errors and 2 limitations of lagrangian persistence on which the maple is based to extrapolate the evolution of the rain fields model errors pulkkinen et al 2019 the main sources of initial state errors are related to the radar observation such as spatiotemporal variability of the vertical profile of reflectivity uncertainty in the conversions from the reflectivity to the rain rate radar qpe partial and total beam blockage attenuation of radar waves sampling errors etc ciach et al 2000 bech et al 2003 fabry and seed 2009 villarini and krajewski 2010 kirstetter et al 2015 seo and krajewski 2015 errors or uncertainties mentioned above are highly prone to be turned into the inaccuracy of rainfall nowcasts as the radar cannot capture the true current rain field as well as the advection method based on lagrangian persistence extrapolates rainfall intensity that already contains errors model errors are related to the nowcasting algorithm s imperfections and the atmospheric state s persistence assumption foresti et al 2019 they include the inaccuracies of the motion field retrieval algorithm the diffusion of the advection scheme the assumption of stationarity of the motion field tracking errors growth and decay errors and systematic biases due to orographic effect wilson et al 1998 ebert and mcbride 2000 germann et al 2006 foresti and seed 2015 tomaz et al 2020 these errors and uncertainties incur discrepancies in the properties of rainfall nowcasts such as mean and variance between observations and nowcasts under or overestimation of rainfall intensity the displacement of rainfall parcels and features etc in addition the lagrangian persistence doesn t represent the growth and decay of rainfall features and thus it cannot provide useful radar qpf for longer lead times shehu and haberlandt 2021 most previous studies have been conducted to improve each component of the rainfall nowcasting system targeting different error sources for example efforts to improve the initial state errors have been made to enhance the quality of radar qpe input data to the rainfall nowcasting system as an accurate radar qpe is critical for the rainfall qpf quality and is one of the most important drivers for hydrological nowcasts fabry and seed 2009 germann et al 2009 foresti et al 2019 many studies have been conducted to improve the quality of radar observation based on merging with other precipitation information like rain gauge satellite and an orographic precipitation climatology zhang et al 2014 shehu and haberlandt 2021 shao et al 2021 or correct biases using ground rain gauge data chen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 improving model errors normally aims to reflect the chaotic nature of the atmosphere to model components instead of relying only on the consequent radar echo fields and assuming their persistence within a few hours radhakrishna et al 2012 more improved motion vector generation and extrapolation approaches have been applied based on machine learning foresti et al 2019 filling the absence of source sink terms or merging nowcasts with the corresponding nwp lin et al 2005 baldauf et al 2011 seed et al 2013 foresti et al 2016 bechini and chandrasekar 2017 sideris et al 2020 as the maple which is used in the korean ffws cannot represent the growth and decay of rainfall and nonstationary advection vector fields several researchers have attempted to consider growth and decay terms in nowcasting models by employing the advection diffusion equation with nonstationary motion vectors mueller et al 2003 radhakrishna et al 2012 tang and matyas 2018 ryu et al 2020 in particular to account for the systematic biases due to orographic forcing a variety of techniques incorporated localized systematic growth and decay into the computation of nowcasts which is especially useful for alpine terrain foresti and seed 2015 foresti et al 2018 sideris et al 2020 to consider the predictive uncertainty due to model errors mentioned above it has been attempted to characterize the uncertainty via ensemble approaches based on stochastic simulation in which correlated noise fields are used to perturb a deterministic nowcast bowler et al 2006 germann et al 2009 berenguer et al 2011 seed et al 2013 foresti et al 2016 nerini et al 2017 however a post processing approach that can reduce the bias of rainfall nowcasts containing model errors has been highly limited to be applied to the best of our knowledge the bias of the qpf is another serious problem for the accuracy of the flash flood warning system this problem should be overcome by improving the rainfall nowcasting model itself however at this time it is impossible to expect the bias free qpf in the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe procedure the mean field bias correction is a necessary step to correct the difference between the estimated and observed precipitation vasiloff et al 2007 kim and yoo 2014 kim et al 2018 jozaghi et al 2019 the quantile mapping technique is an example which matches the statistical moments of both data to remove the bias andres et al 2016 song et al 2021 however it is rare to find cases where this kind of post processing technique was applied to the qpf to remove the bias only a few cases are found in the literature for example sikder and hossain 2019 applied the delta change method to correct the 7 day qpf of nwp to be used as input for monsoon flood forecasting in the south and southeast asia region fuentes barrios and sierra lorenzo 2021 used the artificial neural network for the bias correction of the qpf of the national meteorological service of cuba recently jabbari and bae 2020 applied the combined method of total least squares and dynamic weighting to correct the 6 to 72 h nwp qpf however their application was found to insufficient for real time bias correction veenhuis and brill 2022 used accumulation and disaggregation experiments to correct the 6 and 24 h qpf bias with their focus mainly on the rainfall occurrence timing just as in other countries the real time bias correction of qpf in korea is another practical issue in particular a simple and fast technique is required if the qpf is applied to the flash flood nowcasting simply put the available time for bias correction in the flash flood warning system is very short the flash flood warning system in korea is composed of three components of the production of qpf system operation and warning and evacuation ndmi 2011 first it used to be about 30 min min to produce the qpf using the maple but recently the required time has been shortened to about 10 min by introducing the new composite field production method of hybrid surface rainfall hsr in 2018 son et al 2018 the second step of system operation and warning includes the hydrological modeling with the input qpf and the warning based on the resulting runoff information it takes about 5 min for the system operation and another 10 min to issue the warning the last step evacuation requires about 30 min for small basins ndmi 2011 as a result a 1 h qpf is required for this flash flood warning system which is the target of the flash flood warning system in korea the 1 h qpf should have adequate quality to be used as system input ministry of land 2016 and only 5 min is given for the bias correction of the 1 h qpf this study proposes a user friendly post processing bias correction method using generated rainfall nowcasts only from the perspective of hydrological users and flood nowcasting warning system operators basically it is assumed that a variety of errors in the nowcasting process of the rainfall nowcasting system are turned into the biases of rainfall nowcast output referring to foresti and seed 2015 the bias correction method proposed in this study can correct the tracking errors and the systematic biases due to the orographic effect the tracking error consists of an error in the nowcasted location of a rainfall feature and an error in the rainfall intensity change over a lead time tomaz et al 2020 as the chaotic nature of the atmosphere does not obey the lagrangian persistence assumption indicating that the intensity of rainfall features in the current state remains constant over the lead time the tracking error is likely to be contained in the bias of maple nowcasts with a high probability the approach proposed in this study partly addresses the tracking error by multiplying the correction ratio to rainfall nowcasts to reduce discrepancies in rainfall intensity between observations and nowcasts in addition more than 70 of korea s land territory is covered by the mountainous areas this causes the inclusion of systematic biases due to orographic forcing into the maple rainfall nowcasts the bias correction method applied in this study can also consider decreasing the orographic errors causing the under or overestimation of rainfall intensity by reducing the rainfall nowcast bias the method proposed in this study has several novelties most previous studies focusing on the quality of radar based rainfall nowcasts have attempted to improve the quality of initial state errors induced by imperfect estimation of the current states of rainfall and motion fields foresti et al 2015 woo and wong 2017 chen et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020a imhoff et al 2020b kim et al 2021 shehu and haberlandt 2021 or model errors related to tracking or growth and decay of rainfall features in the extrapolation process li et al 1995 mecklenburg et al 2000 bowler et al 2004 radhakrishna et al 2012 foresti et al 2019 pulkkinen et al 2019 ryu et al 2020 pulkkinen et al 2021 unlike the previous studies this study proposes a novel post processing approach that can reduce the bias of rainfall nowcasts including both initial and model errors after they are generated in particular the method proposed in this study is user friendly as it is quite simple and easy to implement using rain fields only and the computation time is short additionally the storm tracking method proposed in this study is suitable for the purpose of flash flood nowcasting and warning for small mountainous basins while the conventional optical flow tracking approach is based on the motion of precipitation parcels at each grid turner et al 2004 bellon et al 2010 storm tracking for flood nowcasting would be better to focus on the movement of a specific storm or a window containing multiple rainfall features rather than individual rainfall intensity at each grid under consideration of the purpose of this study the pattern recognition based approach is appropriate to track storms or windows more efficiently whereas it is hard to determine window locations based on the conventional point based approach due to an unsteady and non uniform motion of rainfall intensity at each grid lastly the storm tracking method of this study is motivated from the tracking radar echoes by correlation trec but is applied for a completely different purpose the trec only applies pattern recognition technique based on the cross correlation coefficient to advect nowcast storms rinehart and garvey 1978 li et al 1995 however this study alters its purpose to determine and apply the bias correction ratio to enhance the quality of rainfall nowcasts this study aims to apply the biward tracking bit technique for the real time bias correction of the 1 h qpf as the given time for real time bias correction is very short the correction factor is derived by analyzing the past present relation of the precipitation field which is then to be applied to the future precipitation field i e the present future relation in both procedures to define the past present relation and present future relations storm tracking should be applied as the storm tracking is applied two times at every time step of real time correction one being backward and the other forward it is called the biward tracking in this study the pattern correlation method is used for storm tracking in na and yoo 2018 where only the backward tracking bt was considered the pattern correlation method was found to be simple easy and effective the correction factor is derived based on comparison of the present nowcasted and past observed which is then to be applied to the 1 h nowcast this study will apply this bias correction method based on the biward tracking method every 10 min this study will consider the six largest storm events that occurred in korea from 2019 to 2021 the qpf based on the maple and the precipitation measurements from automatic weather stations awss are used in this study 2 methodology the bit based bias correction method is applied to the rainfall nowcasts generated by the maple which advects precipitation echoes based on the storm moving vectors and the lagrangian persistence assumption the maple is the rainfall nowcasting system operated by the kma in korea a storm tracking technique considering the similarity of spatial rainfall patterns is implemented to search the location of the storm to be corrected and the correction ratio is determined based on the concept of the g r ratio the determined correction ratio is sequentially applied to the rainfall nowcasts with 1 h lead time in real time the performance of the proposed bias correction method is assessed with two statistical metrics 2 1 storm tracking method storm tracking methods are used to identify the moving characteristics of a storm by searching its location continuously in time this method provides information about both the direction of movement and velocity of a storm based on its locations at two successive time steps it is also possible to predict the future location of the storm using the derived information of the storm trajectory na and yoo 2018 in the past the methods using ground gauge observations were popular clayton and deacon 1971 marshall 1980 niemczynowicz 1987 however as the use of weather radar has become prevalent the methods using radar echoes or rain field images have been highly suggested austin and bellon 1974 rinehart and garvey 1978 for example the tracking of radar echoes with correlation trec technique can track the storm trajectory by comparing the correlations of rain echoes this trec technique has also been improved to predict the pathways of storms lai 1998 han et al 2008 liang et al 2010 this study employed the storm tracking method based on the pattern correlation coefficient hilst and russo 1960 cheng et al 1998 han et al 2009 shah et al 2015 to estimate the pattern correlation coefficient the size of local window blue box in fig 1 and the spatial range of tracking red circle in fig 1 should be determined here the local window indicates the region where the storm tracking starts with a calculation of the pattern correlation coefficient the spatial range of tracking is the circular area within which the storm tracking is implemented the pattern correlation coefficient is calculated for every window within this range in this study the tracking radius of the range and window size were determined to be 150 km and 40 km respectively to consider the local sized basins and fast moving storms that mostly cause flash floods based on the trial and error similar to sideris et al 2020 the determined window size was large enough to cover the maximum size of more than 300 mountainous basins that were selected to be vulnerable to flash flood by the national disaster management institute 2010 the pattern correlation based storm tracking in this study also assumed that there is no change in the spatial pattern of the storm during a tracking interval δt which is a maximum 70 min reinhart and garvey 1978 novák et al 2009 wang et al 2013 the storm tracking in this study was done over three steps first the local window in which the flash flood is expected to occur in the future is determined over the nowcasted rainfall field blue box in fig 1 a next the pattern correlation coefficient is calculated for all possible windows located within the tracking range from the local window the windows ① ⑦ in fig 1 b indicate a few of them among them the target window is selected as the one for which the highest pattern correlation coefficient is calculated in the example of fig 1 window ⑦ is selected as the target window the result of storm tracking presents the storm that was located in the local window in the past at time t δt fig 1 a will be moved to window ⑦ in the future after the time interval δt passes this study proposes a novel method which is called the biward tracking bit system the bit is a mixture of backward tracking na and yoo 2018 which applies the storm tracking method reversely in time for example from t to t δt and forward tracking which is applied in the normal direction of time for example from t δt to t the pattern correlation coefficient pcc follows the general correlation coefficient calculation process but the only difference is that it uses two dimensional spatial data eq 1 is an equation for the pattern correlation coefficient between the local window at time t δt and any window within the tracking range at time t 1 pcc m 1 m n 1 n p m n t δ t p t δ t q m n t q t m 1 m n 1 n p m n t δ t p t δ t 2 m 1 m n 1 n q m n t q t 2 where p m n t δ t is the nowcasted rain rate at grid m n in the local window at time t δt and q m n t is the nowcasted rain rate at the same location but in any other window within the tracking range at time t the m and n values are both 80 as the window size was 40 km 40 km and the spatial resolution of the rainfall nowcast was 0 5 0 5 km2 in this study the p t δ t term is the mean nowcasted rain rate over the local window at time t δt and q t is the same but over any window within the tracking range at time t the pattern correlation coefficient has the value 1 to 1 the closer to 1 or 1 the better the two data are correlated but the closer to 0 the more uncorrelated they are that is if the pattern correlation coefficient is near 1 or 1 the spatial patterns of storm at time t δt and at time t are similar to each other but if it is close to 0 there is a high possibility that the two storms are not the same 2 2 bias correction ratio this study applied the so called g r ratio to estimate the bias of rainfall nowcasts this ratio has been used to correct the mean field bias of radar rain rate anagnostou et al 1999 seo et al 1999 this method has been mainly applied to the bias correction of radar or satellite observations borga et al 2002 chumchean et al 2006a chumchean et al 2006b tesfagiorgis et al 2011 kim and yoo 2014 the g r ratio can be simply estimated by dividing the ground rain rate by the radar rain rate simple calculation of the g r ratio enables biases to be corrected rapidly which is suitable for the purpose of flash flood warning under the limit of time it is also possible to apply a kalman filter model for the real time correction of the mean field bias using the g r ratio smith and krajewski 1991 seo et al 1999 chumchean et al 2006a yoo et al 2011 ground gauge rainfall data is commonly used as ground truth in the estimation of mean field bias correction ratio the g r ratio in this study seo and breidenbach 2002 šálek et al 2004 chumchean et al 2006a yoo et al 2014 kim et al 2018 even though a few studies assume the radar qpe to be the true rainfall intensity for the evaluation of the rainfall nowcasts imhoff et al 2020a imhoff et al 2020b imhoff et al 2022 and korea has a dense radar network yoon and lim 2022 the radar qpe is well known to come with substantial uncertainty and biases foresti and seed 2015 germann et al 2006 hazenberg et al 2011 van de beek et al 2016 yoo et al 2014 lee et al 2015 kim et al 2018 lee and song 2020 in this study the g r ratio represents the amount of ground rainfall relative to the rainfall nowcast which can be calculated as follows 2 g r i 1 n g i i 1 n r i where g r indicates the g r ratio n is the number of ground and nowcast data pairs in the target window which is searched by the bt at each time step with a 10 min interval and n equals five when five ground gauges are located in the target window the gi term indicates the ground gauge rain rate and ri is the nowcasted rain rate at a grid where the ground gauge is located if the g r ratio is 1 0 it is assumed that no bias exists in the rainfall nowcasts the values of the g r ratio from 0 0 to 1 0 mean that the nowcasts overestimate the ground rain rate in general the g r ratio is estimated to be higher than 1 0 which indicates that the rainfall nowcast underestimates the ground observation the g r ratio is applied as a uniform correction factor to all non zero ground rain rates located in the alarm window 2 3 bias correction of rainfall nowcasts 2 3 1 limitations of the conventional method the bias correction approach adopted in the conventional flash flood warning system in korea follows the process shown in fig 2 in this figure t 0 indicates the current time in this t 60 and t 60 are 60 min before and after the current time respectively first the bias correction ratio is determined using the ground rain rate observed at the current time t 0 and the nowcasted rain rate of 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast which was generated 60 min ahead of the current time t 60 then the bias of rainfall nowcast generated at the current time which predicts rain rate at the future time t 60 is corrected by applying the correction ratio determined at the current time the most critical limitation of the conventional method is that the movement of storms is not considered that is the determination and application of the bias correction ratio are implemented at the same location local window this approach can cause the problems shown in fig 3 the first problematic situation is that there could be no storm in the local window blue box in fig 3 when determining the bias correction ratio the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 00 on july 25 2019 predicts that a storm will arrive at the local window after an hour fig 3 b however 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 17 00 which was used to determine the bias correction ratio that will be applied to the rain rate in fig 3 b shows that no rain will occur in the local window at that time fig 3 a this problem stems from the assumption of spatially continuous storm movement therefore the bias correction ratio determined in this situation is highly prone to being overestimated or underestimated or it cannot even be determined when the nowcasted rain rate is zero which indicates the conventional method could have a high chance of large errors even if a storm is located in the local window another problem can occur when the bias of 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast in the local window generated at 19 00 on july 25 2019 is corrected fig 3 c the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 00 is used fig 3 b however the storms in the local window of fig 3 b and c are not the same in more detail the storm of fig 3 b has already passed by the local window to another location at the time of fig 3 c and another storm has arrived in the local window of fig 3 c that is the storm considered for the determination of bias correction ratio is different from the storm to be bias corrected which includes another significant amount of error this problem also stems from the movement of storm 2 3 2 proposed method based on the biward tracking bit the bias correction method based on the biward tracking bit in this study can overcome the limitations of the conventional method this study applied the bit method to correct the bias of 1 h qpf in real time fig 4 the storm tracking used in the bit method enables the movement of storm to be considered which in the conventional method has not been considered fig 3 a new method proposed in this study is based on the object tracking with pattern recognition and consists of five steps figs 4 5 as the first step a local window is determined at which the spatial sum of rainfall intensity at every grid in a given window is the highest conditioned on the rainfall nowcast at t 60 generating rainfall over the basin of interest or a storm at any location fig 5 a the step 2 is implementing the backward tracking bt applying using 10 and 70 min lead time rainfall nowcasts t0 and t 60 respectively generated at 10 min before the current time t 10 fig 5 b the bt searches where the storm which will arrive at the local window after an hour t 60 is located at the current time t0 based on the similarity of storm patterns determined from the rain fields of 10 and 70 min lead time t0 and t 60 respectively generated at t 10 fig 4 that is the target window for which the bias correction ratio the g r ratio is determined is searched to be where the highest correlation coefficient is calculated by the bt the reason for using the rainfall nowcasts generated 10 min before the current time not at the current time is to determine the bias correction ratio in advance and allow the bias correction to be applied in real time next the bias correction ratio is determined as the step 3 in the target window searched by the bt using the ground rain rate observed at the current time t0 and the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcasts t0 generated at the previous time t 10 fig 5 c this correction ratio is applied to the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast t 60 generated at the current time t0 to reduce the bias as the step 4 the forward tracking ft is implemented before the application of the ratio to search the alarm window where flash flood will occur after an hour t 60 fig 5 d the ft is employed under the same procedure as the bt but forward in time like advection which is done reversely in the bt therefore the pattern correlation coefficient is estimated from the target window in the ft in this case the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated t0 at 10 min before the current time t 10 and the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast t 60 generated at the current time t0 are used fig 4 finally after searching the alarm window based on the ft the step 5 is applying the pre determined correction ratio to the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast in the alarm window t 60 the bias of rainfall nowcast is corrected in real time by applying the bit method sequentially every 10 min fig 4 fig 5 shows an application example of the bit method in this example the current time is assumed to be 18 20 on july 25 2019 the 70 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 10 predicts that a storm will occur in the local window blue box in fig 5 a first the bt is applied using the 10 and 70 min lead time rainfall nowcasts generated at 18 10 to search the target window where the bias correction ratio is determined the target window blue box with solid line in fig 5 b is selected as the window to provide the largest pattern correlation coefficient next the ft is employed to search the alarm window where the flash flood will occur for the ft application the pattern correlation coefficient is also calculated between the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast in the target window generated at 18 10 blue box in fig 5 c and the available windows located within the tracking range of 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 20 current time the window with the largest pattern correlation coefficient is determined to be the alarm window blue box with solid line in fig 5 d and the bias of rainfall nowcast in the alarm window is corrected by applying the correction ratio 2 4 evaluation measures of the bias correction results this study evaluates the performance of the bit based bias correction method by comparing the corrected nowcasts to rain gauge measurements on the ground that is the bias corrected rainfall nowcast at grids where ground gauges are located were selected and compared to the ground rain rate root mean square error rmse and relative bias rbias were considered as measures for quantitative evaluation the rmse is the absolute value of the average difference between the ground rain rate and the nowcasted rain rate the rbias is the average ratio of the ground rain rate to the difference between the nowcasted and ground rain rate for both rmse and rbias the closer to 0 the smaller the discrepancy between the ground rain rate and the nowcasted rain rate the sign of the rbias indicates that the rainfall nowcasts are underestimated negative or overestimated positive which is different from rmse which cannot have a negative sign eqs 3 and 4 present how to calculate the rmse and rbias respectively 3 rmse i 1 n r i g i 2 n 4 rbias i 1 n r i g i i 1 n g i where n is the number of ground and nowcast data pairs at each time step with a 10 min interval and r and g indicate the nowcasted rain rate and the ground rain rate respectively 3 data and storm events this study used the rainfall nowcasts generated by the maple and the rain gauge data the maple is a very short range rainfall nowcasting system first developed by germann and zawadzki 2002 it provides the nowcasts of precipitation echoes which are made using storm moving vectors the storm moving vectors are derived from past and current radar reflectivity images by applying the variational echo tracking vet technique the korea meteorological administration kma ministry of environment in korea currently utilizes the maple for the purpose of flood nowcasting hwang et al 2020 the maple is composed of a total of 1 050 1 050 grids with a size of 0 5 km 0 5 km covering the entire territory of korea red box of fig 6 its lead time ranges 10 to 360 min i e six hours that is each maple rainfall nowcast contains a set of observation and 36 nowcasts with a 10 min interval rain gauge data are available every minute at over 580 stations across the korean peninsula the rain gauge data are also managed by the kma the 1 min rain gauge data were aggregated every 10 mininutes which is the time resolution of maple nowcasts so that they could be used to apply the storm tracking and bias correction a total of six storm events that occurred in korea from 2019 to 2021 were selected in this study that is the bit based bias correction method was applied to these events table 1 summarizes the basic characteristics of the storm events the first and second events that occurred on july 25 26 2019 were a convective storm with high speed and intense rainfall that can occur flash flood with a high probability this storm induced locally high rainfall intensity mostly in central korea kma 2019 an abnormally longer period of monsoon which was recorded as the longest monsoon after 1973 in korea that occurred on august 7 8 2020 caused the third and fourth storm events an average daily rainfall of more than 30 mm continuously occurred during these events in the central and southern region of korea this sequential rainfall events caused flash floods in the mountainous regions like chuncheon and choerwon with a few casualties kma 2020 the remaining two events that occurred in 2021 correspond to a typhoon the fifth event which occurred on august 21 2021 grew linearly from north to south and moved rapidly along with the westerly wind causing strong rainfall over the korean peninsula the last storm event that occurred on august 24 2021 was caused by typhoon omais and induced heavy rain in the southern part of the korean peninsula with flood victims more than 100 people kma 2021 table 1 provides more detailed information of the six storm events 4 results and discussions 4 1 example application to an event 1 this section illustrates an example how the bit based bias correction method was applied to rainfall nowcasts the application region local window of this example was daejeon located in the central part of the korean peninsula blue box of fig 6 the targeted time was 18 20 on july 25 2019 both the bit based method proposed in this study and the conventional method were applied for the comparison the conventional method derived the correction ratio using the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 17 20 and the ground rainfall observed at 18 20 this correction ratio was then applied to the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 20 since the conventional method did not consider the movement of storm events the region where the correction ratio was derived became the same as the local window where the correction ratio was applied on the other hand the bit based bias correction method derived the correction ratio in the target window the result of the bt application using the 10 and 70 min lead time nowcasts generated at 18 10 this ratio was then applied to the 60 min lead time nowcast generated at 18 20 for bias correction first the correction ratio was derived by applying the conventional method fig 8 shows the scatter plot between the ground rain rates observed at 18 20 on july 25 2019 and the 60 min nowcasted rain rates generated at 17 20 both in the local window fig 7 a within this window a total of nine ground gauges are located the scatter plot shows that the nowcasted rain rate was much smaller than the ground rain rate overall while the ground rain rates were distributed between 0 and 2 5 mm h the nowcasted rain rates were mostly less than 0 5 mm h the correction ratio based on eq 2 for this case was determined to be 8 90 this correction ratio is also the same as the reciprocal of the slope of the regression line in fig 8 different from the conventional method the bit based method determines the correction ratio in the target window searched by the bt in this example the bt was applied to the 10 and 70 min lead time rainfall nowcasts both generated at 18 10 on july 25 fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 a there will be a severe storm in the local window of the 70 min lead time rainfall nowcast now by applying the bt the location of this storm was searched in fig 7 b the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast as a result of applying the bt the target window was finally determined that is the storm in the target window the blue box in fig 7 b will arrive in the local window the blue box in fig 7 a after 60 min the pattern correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0 823 between these local and target windows next the correction ratio was determined in the target window blue box in fig 7 b the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 10 on july 25 and the ground observed rainfall gauged at 18 20 were used to determine the correction ratio as in fig 8 b the dots represent the pair of ground rain rates observed at 18 20 in the target window and the 10 min lead time nowcasted rain rates generated at 18 10 the ground rain rates were 50 mm h or less and the nowcasted rain rates were 20 mm h or less this result was different from the result of the conventional method the dots were located closer to the 1 to 1 line the regression line was also found to be close to the 1 to 1 line the correction ratio the reciprocal of the slope of the regression line was in this case determined to be 2 25 this value was far smaller than that of the conventional method simply put the bit based method can avoid the possible overestimation or underestimation of the correction ratio and also provide a more reasonable estimate of the correction ratio by considering the storm movement bias correction was conducted by applying the correction ratio determined in the previous step in the conventional method as the storm tracking was not involved in the local window the target window and the alarm window were the same simply put the correction ratio determined is derived and applied at the same local window however in the bit based method the forward tracking ft should be applied to search the alarm window in which the storm is expected to cause the flash flood in the future fig 9 a shows the 10 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 10 on july 25 2019 while fig 9 b shows the 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 20 the ft in this section used these two data as a result of applying the ft to the possible windows within the tracking range around the target window the alarm window blue box in fig 9 b could be searched the pattern correlation coefficient between the target window blue box in fig 9 a and the alarm window was estimated to be 0 712 this alarm window becomes the target for the bias correction that is the storm located in the target window fig 9 a will move to the alarm window fig 9 b after 60 min which may cause a severe flash flood now the bias of rainfall nowcast in the alarm window is going to be corrected by applying the correction ratio determined in the previous step finally the correction ratios determined in the last step based on the conventional and bit based method were applied to the rainfall nowcast the corrected rainfall nowcast was evaluated by comparing the bias corrected rainfall nowcast to the ground observation the evaluation for this example was conducted at 19 20 on july 25 2019 that is the bias corrected 60 min lead time rainfall nowcast generated at 18 20 was compared to the ground rainfall observed at 19 20 fig 10 shows the scatter plot comparing the ground observation and three different rainfall nowcasts a without any bias correction original b bias corrected by the conventional method bc conv and c bias corrected by the bit based method bc bit as can be seen in this figure the nowcasted rain rates corrected by the bit based method were found to be located much closer to the 1 to 1 line than the other two cases on the other hand the conventional method showed over corrected results including more than 100 mm h even worse than the uncorrected rainfall nowcasts quantitative evaluation using the rbias and rmse was also performed in the case of the bit base method the rbias was 0 18 and the rmse was 3 31 which means the smallest difference from the ground observation rainfall in the case of the conventional method the rbias and rmse were 2 21 and 34 00 respectively indicating that the rainfall nowcast was corrected to the excessively high value compared to the ground rain rate the nowcasting quality was even lower than the case without bias correction of which the rbias and rmse were 0 64 and 8 42 respectively based on the evaluation results of this example it was found that the conventional method can even lower the quality of rainfall nowcasting whereas the bit based method has improved the quality by adequately correcting the bias 4 2 bias correction for all storm events in this section the bit based method was applied to all the six storm events following the same procedure as in the example application in the previous section as the real time nowcast was made every 10 min the entire procedure was also repeated every 10 min summarizing the results first the pattern correlation coefficient of the bt was determined to be 0 7 or higher in most storm events this result indicates that the target window was searched well by the bt fig 11 summarizes the correction ratios determined every 10 min in all six storm events from this figure it was found that the correction ratios determined by the bit based method were all within the range of about 2 to 7 overall whereas those by the conventional method contained many exceptions like 10 or more the difference between these two cases was more significant in the events on july 25 2019 and august 7 2020 in particular the bit based method also worked well for the simple and large storms especially in the two events in 2021 the correction ratios were determined to be near 1 or less in fact the conventional method was also good at providing similar correction ratios by chance as the region of influence under intense rainfall was too broad that is if the size of the storm is huge high rainfall intensities are prone to stay in the local window within 1 h a period between correction ratio determination and application even if the storm moves however the storm considered for the determination of bias correction ratio is different from the storm to be bias corrected which includes another significant amount of error hence it is also true that when the conventional method was applied more outliers were found the derived bias correction ratios were then applied to correct rainfall nowcasts the effect of bias correction of rainfall nowcasts was first verified through the time series of mean rainfall intensity at the alarm windows for six events fig 12 first it was found that rainfall nowcasts underestimated ground observation in the first to fourth events or overestimated in the fifth and sixth events grey lines in fig 12 even if the conventional method not considering the movement of storms partially addressed the problem of rainfall intensity underestimation it corrected the rainfall intensity to extremely large values in the first and third events red lines in fig 12 a and c in fact there were many time steps when the correction gave excessive rainfall intensity of 100 mm h or more in the first heavy rain event red lines in fig 12 a on the other hand the bit based method corrected the rainfall nowcasts to a similar extent to the ground rainfall intensity while addressing the underestimation problem blue lines in fig 12 it was found that the bit based method corrects the rainfall nowcasts similarly to the ground rainfall intensity in the fifth and sixth events as well the scatter plots between radar nowcasts and ground observation enable more clear comparison the black dots blue crosses and red x s in fig 13 indicate the original maple rainfall nowcasts without correction the rainfall nowcasts corrected by the conventional method and the rainfall nowcasts corrected by the biward tracking in the alarm windows targeted as bias correction every 10 min respectively as can be seen in fig 13 the application results for the six storm events were found to be consistent for example in the two events in 2019 the role of the bias correction was not so clear even though those underestimated nowcasted rain rates were corrected they seemed not so consistent with the observed the two events in 2020 show the potential of the bias correction obviously the bias corrected nowcasts were found to be much better than the original nowcasts which were also concentrated around the 1 to 1 line however it was not easy to distinguish any better method finally the two events in 2021 showed the clear advantage of applying the bias correction method most of the bias corrected nowcasts were found near the 1 to 1 line in these events the better performance of the bit based method could also be confirmed fig 14 presents the box plots of the ground rainfall intensity which is assumed to be true rainfall intensity original rainfall nowcasts without correction and rainfall nowcasts corrected by the conventional and biward tracking methods in most events the ground rainfall intensity s box and rainfall intensity corrected by bit s box appeared similar the original rainfall nowcast without correction ori was found to have a limitation of underestimating the ground rainfall intensity for the first to fourth events the conventional method which does not consider the movement of storms partially addressed the problem of rainfall intensity underestimation but often corrected the rainfall intensity into extremely high values such as the first and third events fig 14 a and c on the other hand the bit based method solved the underestimation problem as well as corrected the rainfall nowcasts to a similar extent to the ground rainfall intensity fig 14 a and c while outliers were included but not that much like the conventional method fig 14 c and d the bit based method was also found to correct the rainfall nowcasts similarly to ground rainfall intensity for the fifth and sixth events fig 14 e and f finally the performance of the conventional method and the bit based method was quantitatively evaluated using the metrics like rbias and rmse rainfall nowcasts without any bias correction ori the bias corrected case by the conventional method conv and the bias corrected case by the bit based method bit were all compared in this comparison the ground rain rates of 0 10 and 20 mm h were set as thresholds the use of these thresholds was to evaluate the correction efficiency depending on the target rainfall intensity in most flash flood warning systems the target rainfall intensity is far higher than 10 mm h table 2 summarizes the result as can be seen in table 2 the rbias for the case without any bias correction ori were found mostly negative indicating significant underestimation this problem was alleviated by applying the conventional method conv as well as the bit based method bit in some events the conventional method worked better than the bit based method however it is also found that after the conventional method was applied the rbias could become worse overall the bit based method was found better simply the mean of the absolute values of rbias was found to be far smaller than that of the conventional method application the rbias value itself was also found to be near zero to indicate the good bias correction ability of the bit based method the effect of the threshold rainfall intensity was also found to be strong the rbias became smaller when higher threshold was applied in fact this result is expectable as when rather high rainfall intensity was considered in its calculation the extremely low or high correction ratio could be avoided different from rbias it was not so easy to decrease the rmse even after the bias correction this is because as the correction ratio is higher than 1 0 in most cases the bias correction has increased the variability in the applications of this study the same result was also derived however it could also be a serious problem to have larger rmse after the bias correction these rather extreme cases can be found in the application of the conventional bias correction method in particular in the events in 2019 and 2020 the rmses of the convention method application were found to be much higher than the case even without the bias correction this result is mainly due to many over corrected outliers however in the case of the 2021 events the rmse after bias correction was relatively stable which is because the rainfall nowcasts were good to be similar to the observed 4 3 discussions on the bias correction results one of the major findings of this study can be found from the analysis on very high rainfall intensity it was clearly demonstrated that the bias correction method proposed in this study can also improve the quality of the highest rainfall intensity occurred in six storm events as flash flood is highly probable to be induced when rainfall intensity is high the bias correction method proposed in this study can be considered as an appropriate approach table 3 compares the mean values of ground observation original rainfall nowcast without correction and rainfall nowcasts corrected by the conventional and biward tracking method at gauges in the alarm window when the maximum rainfall intensity occurred the more similar to the mean ground rainfall intensity value the better the nowcasting quality the mean rainfall forecast corrected by the biward tracking method showed the most similar results to the ground rainfall intensity among three radar nowcasts without correction corrected by the conventional method and corrected by the biward tracking method the results can be understood that the bit based correction method is more efficient when the rainfall intensity is high on the other hand the conventional method corrected the nowcasts to too high 1st and 3rd events or low 5th event values the bit based bias correction method was also found to have superior skill in predicting the nowcast error suppose the correction ratio or its estimation method is skilled in predicting the model error in that case the nowcast error of the corrected rainfall nowcasts will be smaller than that of the original rainfall nowcasts without correction it can also be expected that the correction ratio s temporal variability or variance is reduced which can be understood as an increase of temporal consistency of the correction ratio that can induce the stable rainfall nowcast correction table 4 summarizes the temporal variability of correction ratios and the errors of radar qpe and radar nowcasts with or without bias correction first of all the radar qpe error was found to be the main source of the nowcast error in all six events fabry and seed 2009 a significant portion of the radar qpe error was included in the nowcast error of the original maple even in the sixth event the errors of radar qpe and original rainfall nowcasts were almost the same next the error of the rainfall nowcasts corrected by the biward tracking method proposed in this study was the smallest on average and the errors of the original nowcasts were the next smallest the conventional method worked badly even increasing the nowcast error of original rainfall nowcasts this result indicates the proposal of the biward tracking method in this study is suitable for predicting the nowcast error as the temporal variability of the correction ratio was also smaller than that of the conventional method additionally the proposed bias correction method was able to reduce the nowcast error the most in the case of typhoon which showed clear moving trajectories of storms events 5 and 6 on the other hand in the case of a convective storm event 1 where the growth and decay of storms occur frequently there may be limits in reducing the nowcast error because it is difficult to determine the correction ratio properly the effect of the noise of correction ratio on bias correction performance was further analyzed in this section the noise was quantified by a standard deviation of the ratios the correction ratio determined at every 10 min time step for each of the six rainfall events was used to calculate the noise standard deviation and compared with performance metrics rmse and rbias fig 15 shows that the values of performance metrics gradually increase as the noise of correction ratio increases for both the conventional and bit based methods in other words the rainfall nowcast correction effect gradually decreases as the noise of the correction ratio increases it was found that the proposed method may be less effective for rainfall events with the large noise of correction ratio due to the rapid or abrupt movement of storms however the conventional method was more sensitive to the noise of correction ratio than the bit based method therefore it can be concluded that the bit based method is less influenced by the noise of correction ratio compared to the conventional method which means it has a more robust performance in bias correction although the bit based method was found to be able to reduce the bias or increase the quality of rainfall nowcasts this study has the limitation of not considering a few error sources causing biases of rainfall nowcasts like initial state error growth and decay error tracking error regarding the displacement of rainfall features etc since the maple used in this study extrapolates rainfall intensity based on lagrangian persistence it inherently cannot predict the growth and decay of rainfall features turner et al 2004 pulkkinen et al 2019 shehu and haberlandt 2021 as the convective storms are likely to be dissipated or newly generated within an hour the growth and decay errors are dominant in the convective storm events therefore the method proposed in this study needs to be expanded to the rainfall nowcasting systems capable of simulating growth and decay for convective storms even if the bias correction method applied in this study can increase or decrease the rainfall intensity of the rainfall nowcasts but has the limitation of being unable to displace rain in the wrong place that is the proposed method is hard to overcome the case when it is predicted to be no rain at a certain grid from the 1 hour rainfall nowcast but it rains in real which corresponds to the tracking error nevertheless the results of this study showed that the bit based method could reduce the bias of rainfall nowcasts for various types of rain events such as convective stratiform and cyclonic 5 conclusions this study applied the biward tracking bit method for the real time bias correction of the 1 h qpf that is the bias correction ratio was derived based on the backward tracking which was then applied to the rainfall nowcast searched by applying the forward tracking in this study the pattern correlation method was used for the storm tracking which was also found to be simple and effective in na and yoo 2018 the correction factor was derived based on the comparison of the present 545 nowcasted and past observed which was then applied to the 1 h nowcast this study considered the six largest storm events that occurred in korea from 2019 to 2021 the results derived in this study were then compared with those based on the conventional bias correction method the findings in this study can be summarized as follow first the storm tracking method using the pattern correlation coefficient was found to be easy and effective in this application as the spatial range of tracking and the window size were reasonably determined by considering the storm movement velocity and the storm size itself the computation burden for the storm tracking could be minimized the tracking radius of the range and window size were determined to be 150 km and 40 km in this study the correction ratios determined by the bit based method were all found to be within reasonable range without any serious outliers on the other hand the conventional method produced many extreme correction ratios which could not be easily applied for the correction of the rainfall nowcasts it was also found that the performance of the bit based method was especially good for the simple and large storms this result is due to a limitation from the natural properties of the maple that cannot consider the growth and decay of convective storms also the performance of the tracking method used in this study was superior for the storms with less changing in scale and clearer trajectories as it was based on pattern recognition the metrics of the first and second storm events which are convective storms showed relatively lower performance compared to the rest which correspond to monsoon or typhoon the bias corrected rainfall nowcast with the correction ratio derived by the bit based method was found to be much closer to the ground observation than that based on the conventional method on the other hand the conventional method showed many over corrected results including more than 100 mm h even worse than the uncorrected rainfall nowcasts the above result could also be confirmed with some quantitative measures like the rbias and rmse in particular the rbias value was found to become very small near zero after the bias correction to indicate the good bias correction ability of the bit based method also the rmses in the cases of bit based method were found to be smaller than those based on the conventional method however it should be mentioned that different from rbias the rmse was not decreased significantly even after the bias correction based on the bit based method this was because the bias correction increased the variability of the rainfall field as the correction ratio was in most cases higher than 1 0 the above findings in this study support that the bit based method outperformed the conventional method the bit based method proved that it could properly correct the bias in the rainfall nowcast also the bias correction was very stable the performance was even reliable when stronger

1801,water quality prediction in the spatially heterogeneous environment is challenging as the importance of water quality parameters wqps and the performance of prediction models may vary across space thus this study proposed spatially adaptive machine learning models to predict water quality status in hong kong first spatial clusters with relatively homogeneous water quality were adaptively detected using dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning then the optimal prediction models were constructed for each cluster by locally evaluating the prediction performance of six standalone machine learning models including multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn support vector machine svm random forest rf extremely randomized tree et extreme gradient boosting xgboost and categorical gradient boosting catboost as well as four novel hybrid models mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and xgboost catboost finally a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the minimum sets of indicative wqps to achieve more cost efficient water quality prediction based on locally optimal prediction models the results revealed that the water quality in the study area was spatially heterogeneous and four spatially contiguous clusters were identified mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and cabboost performed best in cluster 1 to cluster 4 with r2 values of 0 917 0 906 0 901 and 0 937 and rmse values of 1 978 0 843 2 020 and 1 572 respectively the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that acceptable local prediction results can be obtained using fewer wqps it is conducive to issuing timely water quality warnings and striving for more time for water pollution remediation keywords water quality prediction spatially adaptive strategy locally optimal models machine learning performance evaluation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction with increasing pollution pressures from industrialization urbanization and agriculture river water quality is suffering from continuous deterioration zeinalzadeh and rezaei 2017 wang et al 2022a a large amount of river pollution from point and non point sources has become a significant environmental problem bui et al 2020 the regulation and self purification functions of the aquatic environment will be destroyed to a certain extent when the carrying capability of a river is overloaded which will have extensive impacts on human health and sustainable development recently water contamination has been commonly reported around the world especially in developing countries bashir et al 2020 due to rapid economic development rivers in these countries are receiving increased amounts of pollution wastes which may result in a shortage crisis on the freshwater resource actually the outbreak of water pollution accidents can be found as a result of a lack of information management lu and ma 2020 remediation measures for improving water quality are generally taken after the occurrence of water pollution incidents due to the absence of timely warnings therefore water quality prediction is an imperative task for the effective management of water resources so that authorities can effectively implement certain interventional measures to ensure that the degree of pollution is controlled within acceptable limits at present as artificial intelligence has extensively been applied in various fields in recent years min 2010 battina 2015 hamet and tremblay 2017 zhang and lu 2021 machine learning techniques based on black box operations have also been gradually introduced to predict water quality liu and lu 2014 li et al 2019 chen et al 2021 machine learning methods mainly emphasize the mapping relationships between input data and desired output responses rather than the complicated process mechanisms by learning from abundant historical data including data from dynamic evolutionary processes certain nonlinear relationships can be precisely identified with no prior knowledge deng et al 2021 water quality prediction models can be established using historical monitoring data to train machine learning algorithms and then the water quality prediction results can be obtained based on the constructed models when fed into new testing dataset these imply the applicability of using machine learning methods to accurately predict water quality variations the advantage of machine learning for prediction lies in that it leverages statistical models to enable algorithms to learn rules from large quantities of input data and then the constructed models that can effectively recognize dataset patterns are used to predict and characterize new data presently four types of machine learning models are widely used for water quality prediction artificial neural networks tree based models kernel based models and gradient boosting models lu and ma 2020 haghiabi et al 2018 najafzadeh and ghaemi 2019 najafzadeh and niazmardi 2021 for example multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn has been proven to be an effective method for water quality prediction najah et al 2012 self adaptive and powerful nonlinear approximation capabilities of mlpnn allow it to efficiently map the relationship between input data and anticipated output chen et al 2020 have successfully utilized random forest rf to construct the high performance models for water quality prediction and classification rf can effectively handle the noise data and are not prone to over fitting thus providing a high level of accuracy in predicting water quality it has been found that support vector machine svm as a kernel based model is able to minimize the complexity and noise of network structures and improve the generalization performance in the network elkiran et al 2019 in the research of deng et al 2021 svm has exemplary accuracy and applicability for predicting and analyzing marine water quality in tolo harbor hong kong categorical gradient boosting catboost has the ability to effectively handle category type features and resolve frequent gradient bias and prediction shift issues which makes the model more accurate and generalizable grbčić et al 2022 have obtained reliable prediction results for escherichia coli and enterococci in the rijeka croatia by using the catboost algorithm in addition compared with standalone algorithms the hybrid machine learning algorithm which is combinations of multiple standalone algorithms is able to handle noise and missing data more flexibly and identify the nonlinear relationship between input data and desired output data more easily yin et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 utilized a voting strategy to incorporate seven widely applied machine learning techniques to establish a hybrid model which outperformed standalone classifiers in prediction analysis lu and ma 2020 adopted two hybrid tree based models to predict six water quality parameters and achieved satisfactory prediction performance song et al s findings 2021 showed that the hybrid model had the best prediction ability among peer models based on dataset from two monitoring stations and the prediction results provided decision making foundation for water quality management and pollution control in the studied basin notably the hybrid algorithms generally can combine the advantages of standalone algorithms and overcome some of their respective limitations li et al 2022 thus to construct the optimal prediction models in our study it is worth further comparing and analyzing the accuracy and robustness between standalone and hybrid machine learning algorithms after establishing the water quality prediction models sensitivity analysis is a useful process to handle sudden water quality accident specifically the influences of parameters on water quality were determined based on the relative importance of parameters in sensitivity analysis and the acceptable accuracy of water quality prediction can be probed by progressively reducing the effective parameters in the order of the relative importance ahmed et al 2019 dawood et al 2021 that is to say when an emergent pollution incidence occurs in a river the acceptable prediction results can be acquired with fewer but indicative parameters which will effectively improve the prediction efficiency and earn more time for experts to remediate water contamination the application of machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in water quality prediction in recent years but it is still challenging to develop a global prediction model to characterize the multi station water quality properties due to the spatial heterogeneity of water quality data even if all monitoring datasets from multiple stations were used as input data to successfully model such a model might exhibit low prediction performance or unbalanced prediction capability for different monitoring stations thus to construct high performance prediction models it is necessary to adaptively regionalize the study area and then perform local water quality prediction modelling however there is limited information available concerning spatially adaptive strategy for developing locally optimal water quality prediction models against this backdrop four main tasks were explored in this study 1 to adaptively cluster monitoring stations with homogeneous water quality in space using regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning 2 to determine input combination of key wqps for different clusters 3 to construct the locally optimal prediction models by comparing the prediction performances of standalone and new hybrid models and 4 to explore minimum indicative wqps to acquire acceptable local prediction results 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and water quality data the four water control zones tolo harbour and channel port shelter junk bay and victoria harbour considered in this study are located in the east central region of hong kong the surface water system in hong kong covers a wide range of surface water genres including catchments streams tributaries and rivers most of which are less than five miles in length the upstream sections of the rivers enter ponds to provide drinkable water and water in the downstream sections is utilized to irrigate fields and to maintain aquatic creatures and vegetation the study area is characterized by the subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of approximately 23 3 c the annual rainfall changes considerably from area to area averaging about 1400 mm and reaching a maximum of 3000 mm about 80 of precipitation appears from may to september the months with the greatest precipitation are june and august whereas january and december receive the least precipitation wqps are generally categorized as physical indicators chemical indicators biological indicators bacteriological indicators and radioactive indicators lu and ma 2020 valdivia garcia et al 2019 for different analysis targets different parameters are used to evaluate water quality for example algal boom events mainly focus on 5 day

kong from 2010 to 2019 notably there are altogether 18 data lost at the kn2 kn3 and kn4 stations these stations are distributed along 17 watercourses including ten brooks in the tolo harbor and channel three watercourses in the port shelter one watercourse in the junk bay and three watercourses in the victoria harbor the detailed geographical locations of these stations are illustrated in fig 1 the dataset of 5022 observations was split into two subsets water quality data from 2010 to 2017 80 used for the training phase and water quality data from 2018 to 2019 20 for the testing phase 2 2 method description this study developed spatially adaptive machine learning models to predict water quality levels in the spatially heterogeneous environment the overall structure of water quality prediction was shown in fig 2 which consists of four stages spatially adaptive clustering extraction of crucial wqps local prediction modeling and sensitivity analysis the water quality assessment method spatially adaptive clustering method and machine learning models used in this research were depicted in the following sections 2 2 1 water quality index wqi wqi can transfer multiple water quality parameters into a single dimensionless number and provide an entire picture of the scenario regarding water quality status ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 wang et al 2019 in this study water quality was evaluated by wqi proposed by pesce and wunderlin 2000 which enjoys great popularity among the studies of water quality analysis nong et al 2020 varol 2020a wang et al 2022b the wqi values can be obtained with the following formula 1 wqi i 1 n c i p i i 1 n p i where c i denotes the normalized value for parameter i and p i is the relative weight given to each parameter which reflects the relative importance to water quality multiple publications pesce and wunderlin 2000 debels et al 2005 koçer and sevgili 2014 varol 2020b nong et al 2020 have revised the normalized values which were listed in table s1 p i ranges from 1 to 4 the most significant parameters are those with p i values of 4 such as do and as while the least significant parameters are those with p i values of 1 e g wt and tp the wqi is unitless and varies from 0 to 100 with higher values signifying better water quality water quality levels can be categorized into five grades based on wqi values extremely bad 0 wqi 25 bad 25 wqi 50 medium 50 wqi 70 good 70 wqi 90 and excellent 90 wqi 100 jonnalagadda and mhere 2001 tyagi et al 2013 2 2 2 regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning redcap this study provided brief introduction about redcap and readers can discover the additional details of the algorithm in the research by guo 2008 redcap includes two steps 1 using a contiguity constrained clustering method to establish a spatially contiguous tree and 2 partitioning the tree to derive some subtrees each of which corresponds to a spatially continuous region redcap can cluster and partition multiple stations using three hierarchical clustering methods single linkage average linkage and complete linkage and two contiguity constraining strategies the first order and full order constraining thus forming six new contiguity constrained clustering methods in this research the full order constrained average linkage clustering full order alk technique was applied to obtain heterogeneous clustered regions because of its better performance in four quality evaluation the overall heterogeneity internal variation region size balance and the data distribution preservation guo 2008 the average linkage cluster alk defines the distance between two regions as the mean dissimilarity between all cross region pairs of data points 2 d alk lm 1 lm u l v m d uv where l and m represent clusters l and m represent the number of the data points in the clusters and duv represent the dissimilarity between u and v then a large number of spatial subtrees can be obtained by partitioning the spatially contiguous trees determined in step one boluwade 2019 the partitioning process includes the optimization of the objective function to minimize the overall heterogeneity in all regions guo 2008 the optimal subtree to cut at each step is that which owns the greatest homogeneity gain which can be computed as follows 3 h g r m a x h r h r a h r b where r denotes a region h r denotes its heterogeneity h g denotes the homogeneity gain or heterogeneity loss of the tree r after the optimal cut and ra and rb denote the two subtrees from a possible cut of r the sum of squared deviation sdd is used as the heterogeneity measure and can be calculated as 4 h r j 1 d i 1 n r x ij x j 2 where r and h r are as defined in equation 3 d stands for the number of attributes nr stands for the number of objects in region xij stands for the value of the jth attribute of the ith object and xj stands for the average value of the jth attribute of all objects in the region the overall heterogeneity hk can be determined as the total of the k heterogeneity values and the equation is defined as 5 h k j 1 k h r j different from the regionalization developed by non spatial clustering technology redcap directly integrates the spatial continuity constraint into the traditional hierarchical clustering method yielding the continuous region with optimized homogeneity kupfer et al 2012 redcap requires every cluster at each hierarchical level to be continuous in space spatial contiguity is ensured through clustering and optimization processes to produce more consistent and efficient derived regions then a spatially contiguous tree is established by iteratively merging the most similar units connected in space 2 2 3 machine learning models the structures and descriptions of the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn support vector machine svm random forest rf extremely randomized tree et extreme gradient boosting xgboost and categorical gradient boosting catboost were presented in the supplementary materials hybrid techniques have been proved to improve the accuracy of prediction results ouma et al 2022 song et al 2021 lu and ma 2020 in this study to overcome some limitations of standalone machine learning models a novel hybrid model based on the voting strategy is proposed to forecast water quality levels after comparing the prediction accuracy of the above six machine learning models the two locally high performance models were selected as the basic models to construct a hybrid model based on the voting strategy voting combination utilized the principle of majority voting to acquire more correct results by constructing multiple homogeneous or heterogeneous classifiers this approach can greatly reduce the variance in the model and improve the model performance 2 3 performance metrics for model evaluation to evaluate the prediction performance of the models one goodness of fit measure and five different statistical error metrics were employed to compare the output values with the measured values huai et al 2018 saberi movahed et al 2020 najafzadeh et al 2021 these performance metrics included the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae mean discrepancy ratio dr scatter index si and maximum relative error mre the corresponding calculation formulas were shown as follows 6 r 2 1 i 1 n m i p i 2 i 1 n m i m i 2 7 rmse i 1 n p i m i 2 n 8 mae 1 n i 1 n p i m i 9 dr 1 n i 1 n log 10 p i m i 10 si i 1 n p i m i 2 n i 1 n m i n 11 mre m a x p i m i m i 100 where p i and m i denote the predicted wqi values and measured wqi values respectively and m i denotes the average of the measured wqi values 3 results 3 1 water quality analysis the basic statistical information for wqps and the wqi from 2010 to 2017 was shown in table 1 the results of kruskal wallis test indicated that during the monitoring period most of the wqps concentrations displayed significant interannual variations p 0 05 whereas the concentrations of nh3 n no2 n and cl slightly fluctuated from year to year p 0 05 the annual mean values of the wqi were higher than 80 suggesting that the water quality was good overall and there were significant interannual differences in water quality p 0 05 as shown in fig 3 out of a total of 42 monitoring stations 5 stations around 12 were classified as excellent water quality levels 90 wqi 100 and 21 stations around 50 were categorized as good or excellent water quality levels 70 wqi 100 monitoring stations with medium or good water quality levels had 16 stations accounting for approximately 38 50 wqi 90 it is worth noting that stations tr6 tr12i tr12 tr12c tr20b tr17 pr1 jr3 jr6 kn7 and kw3 exhibited good water quality status in most cases and medium water quality status in a few cases stations kn1 kn2 kn3 kn4 and kn5 displayed medium wqi values more often than good wqi values combination the topographic structure fig 1 and spatial variations of wqi fig 3 it can be found that higher wqi values were mainly distributed in the northwestern and central parts of the study area whereas lower wqi values were recorded in the southern region 3 2 spatially adaptive clustering and homogeneity analysis in this study 42 monitoring stations were adaptively clustered based on spatial coordinates longitude and latitude and thematic attributes of monitoring stations wqi values a total of five divisions were performed on water quality data of 42 stations from 2010 to 2017 and each division yielded a new clustering result taking into account the overall heterogeneity and internal variation dividing the study area into four clusters yielded a good spatial clustering result therefore the regionalization structure from the 3rd division was selected and visualized in fig 4 each color denoted a cluster and cluster 1 orange cluster 2 green cluster 3 red and cluster 4 blue contained 4 12 18 and 8 contiguous stations respectively the homogeneity of the spatial clusters included geographical locations water quality levels and possible pollution source the monitoring stations in each cluster were contiguous and close in geographical locations fig 4 in accordance with the water quality distribution of monitoring stations fig 3 it can be seen that cluster 2 and cluster 3 exhibited better water quality levels than cluster 1 and cluster 4 to illustrate the primary pollution sources in the four clusters two representative stations from each cluster were chosen to demonstrate their surrounding land use conditions the land use around cluster 1 mainly includes farming and transportation so the main pollution may come from agricultural irrigation and traffic exhaust fig 5 residential communities and governmental institutions are located in the vicinity of the cluster 2 monitoring stations suggesting that domestic sewage is the primary pollutant based on the distribution of land use around cluster 3 industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation domestic sewage and traffic exhaust contributed the most to water contamination the land use conditions in cluster 4 indicate that regional pollution can be attributed to traffic exhaust and domestic sewage 3 3 selection of crucial water quality parameters the determination of input parameters for four clusters mainly counted on statistical analysis and prior knowledge correlation analysis can effectively uncover potential associations cai and kwan 2022 and have been proved to be straightforward and effective method to select crucial wqps for wqi prediction bui et al 2020 meng et al 2021 herein the correlations between 21wqps and wqi were measured by pearson s correlation coefficient and were presented in the table s3 wqps with relatively strong positive or negative correlations with the wqi were considered when establishing the water quality prediction models as they can enhance the prediction capability to some extent additionally stepwise regression analysis was utilized to provide some reference information about the contribution rate of wqps to the wqi table s4 considering the correlations and the contributions of wqps to the wqi the input combinations of crucial wqps for modeling were identified as shown in table 2 the different combinations of input wqps for the four clusters highlight the need for spatially adaptive clustering in water quality prediction modeling 3 4 performance evaluation of local models for water quality prediction the water quality prediction results of six standalone and four novel hybrid machine learning models were evaluated and compared in this section five error metrics and the coefficient of determination were employed to quantify the effectiveness and performance of different models 3 4 1 prediction performance of standalone models the fitting degree and error range between the measured and predicted wqi values in the four clusters during the training and testing phases were shown in table 3 in terms of goodness of fit all standalone models performed well in the four clusters r2 0 75 bui et al 2020 but the best performing models differed in each cluster svm performed best in cluster 1 and catboost performed best in cluster 2 cluster 3 and cluster 4 based on the computed r2 values in accordance with four error metrics rmse mae d r and si the prediction performance of models in cluster 1 ranked as follows best to worst svm mlpnn et catboost rf and xgboost similarly the accuracy in cluster 2 ranked from the lowest to the highest catboost et rf svm mlpnn and xgboost moreover the prediction performance in cluster 3 and cluster 4 was in the descending order catboost mlpnn et xgboost rf and svm and catboost xgboost svm rf et and mlpnn respectively it can be seen that the analysis results of goodness of fit corresponded with those of four error metrics svm is more prominent in predicting wqi values in cluster 1 while catboost was superior to the other models in cluster 2 to cluster 4 fig 6 a d depicted the time series of the measured and predicted values with two locally prominent standalone models in the training and testing phases svm and mlpnn in cluster 1 catboost and et in cluster 2 catboost and mlpnn in cluster 3 as well as catboost and xgboost in cluster 4 respectively on the whole the two selected models in four clusters performed well and were able to accurately capture the increasing and decreasing trends and the magnitude variations of the wqi values in all datasets this suggested that the models constructed in the four clusters did not suffer from overfitting or underfitting problems and can effectively predict water quality levels 3 4 2 prediction performance of novel hybrid models to improve the overall prediction performance the novel hybrid models were developed based on voting strategy and basic models basic models were from standalone models with outstanding prediction capability svm and mlpnn in cluster 1 et and catboost in cluster 2 mlpnn and catboost in cluster 3 and catboost and xgboost in cluster 4 they were also considered as the benchmark models in four clusters to provide the effective comparison the novel hybrid models in cluster 1 to cluster 4 were mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and xgboost catboost respectively fig 7 intuitively displayed the prediction capability of the hybrid and basic models when the output values were greater than the measured values the points were plotted above the diagonal line and vice versa the best performing prediction model was the one that produced the most points on or near the diagonal line meng et al 2021 as shown in fig 7a and fig 8 a mlpnn svm outperformed the other two standalone basic models with the highest goodness of fit r2 0 917 and the lowest error metrics rmse 1 978 mae 1 569 and mre 6 5 similar findings were obtained that et catboost in cluster 2 and mlpnn catboost in cluster 3 exhibited better prediction capabilities than the basic models with the largest r2 values and the lowest rmse and mae values despite the hybrid models not having the minimum mre values fig 7b c and fig 8b c this is because mre simply reflects the maximum error of individual points rather than overall error notably for cluster 4 the prediction results demonstrated that catboost was superior to xgboost catboost with the highest fitting levels and lowest four error metrics r2 0 937 rmse 1 572 mae 1 222 and mre 7 6 fig 7d and fig 8d to further test and verify the prediction accuracy of the standalone and hybrid learning models taylor diagram was used to statistically quantify the similarity between the measured and predicted wqi values in this approach the correlation coefficient cc centered root mean square error crmse and standard deviation sd are ingeniously integrated into a polar coordinate diagram based on the triangular cosine relationship among them elkiran et al 2019 taylor 2001 the prediction results were analyzed in accordance with the distribution of three evaluation metrics in taylor diagram mlpnn svm et catboost and mlpnn catboost models demonstrated optimal prediction performance in cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 respectively fig 9 a c however the best prediction results in cluster 4 were obtained with catboost fig 9d this finding was consistent with the above analysis results which affirmed that the hybrid models yielded more accurate prediction results than the standalone models in the first three clusters but the standalone model outperformed the hybrid model in the fourth cluster 3 5 sensitivity analysis of locally optimal models for water quality prediction the permutation feature importance was employed to investigate the influence of crucial wqps on the prediction performance of the locally optimal models the computed importance score denotes the relative importance of each input wqp from the same model which is helpful for quantifying the contributions of input parameters to the prediction model the parameters with high importance scores are considered to be comparatively more useful the results of relative importance were exhibited in fig 10 a d specifically the importance score values showed that the relative importance of the wqps in cluster 1 were f bod5 do no2 n tss cod and as in the descending order in cluster 2 it can be seen that the rank high to low of the wqps importance was nh3 n cond tss f cod bod5 and no2 n similarly the importance of the wqps were ranked in the decreasing order cond ton f tur no2 n cu and as in cluster 3 as well as cond bod5 ton no2 n do cod and tur in cluster 4 mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and catboost models trained with seven wqps all exhibited the best performance and accuracy fig 11 moreover as the number of wqps decreased the prediction capability of the models displayed a downward trend in the training and testing phases note should be taken that the number of wqps was sequentially reduced based on the rank of relative importance in the locally optimal models in cluster 1 the prediction result of mlpnn svm trained with a set of five parameters f bod5 do no2 n and tss was not as good as that in the case of seven parameters whereas its prediction accuracy still was acceptable with r2 0 904 and rmse 1 791 in the training dataset and r2 0 898 and rmse 2 191 in the testing dataset fig 11a likewise when et catboost mlpnn catboost and catboost were trained with the sets of six parameters nh3 n cond tss f cod and bod5 four parameters cond ton f and tur and three parameters cond bod5 and ton respectively the relatively good prediction performance can be also obtained in cluster 2 to cluster 4 fig 11b d thereinto for the training dataset the r2 values in cluster 2 to cluster 4 were 0 997 0 951 and 0 969 and the rmse values were 0 264 1 500 and 1 095 respectively for the testing dataset the r2 values were 0 883 0 854 and 0 857 and the rmse values were 0 941 2 451 and 2 369 respectively it can be concluded that the input combinations of minimum wqps for acceptable local prediction results in cluster 1 to cluster 4 were the sets of five six four and three parameters respectively 4 discussion accurate and stable water quality prediction results are beneficial for providing a scientific and reliable theoretical basis for water quality warning and pollution control the performance of water quality prediction models depends not only on the input dataset but also on the model features chen et al 2020 however due to the presence of spatial heterogeneity in water quality data cai et al 2021 golmohammadi et al 2020 it is difficult to establish an overall model for water quality prediction in this study a spatially adaptive strategy was proposed to construct locally optimal water quality prediction models in the spatially heterogeneous environment moreover the acceptable prediction results for each locally optimal prediction models were further probed to improve the prediction efficiency 1 spatially adaptive clustering multi station spatial clustering is a crucial procedure before constructing water quality prediction models antanasijević et al 2020 liu et al 2018 2021 2022 considering the spatial heterogeneity of water quality data our study adopted redcap algorithm to adaptively divide the numerous monitoring stations into different clusters the water quality hierarchy clustering of redcap allows monitoring stations with similar water quality levels and spatially contiguous location to be clustered together maximizing homogeneity of water quality and spatial location attributes within the same cluster and maximizing heterogeneity of these attributes among different clusters guo 2008 guo and wang 2011 in this study an objective classification with four spatially contiguous clusters can be obtained based on the redcap algorithm the monitoring stations within the same cluster showed the homogeneity of water quality levels spatial locations land use and possible pollution source it can be found that spatially adaptive clustering for multiple stations was conducive to mining the hidden features and patterns in the dataset and then constructing an appropriate local model for water quality prediction 2 locally optimal water quality prediction modeling in fact machine learning models for water quality prediction using a small number of crucial parameters as inputs have enjoyed great popularity mainly because these models can mine the internal features of historical data to identify the complicated relationships between inputs and expected outputs for example in the research of chen et al 2020 four wqps do nh3 n ph and codmn datasets were used to train ten machine learning models and decision tree dt random forest rf and deep cascade forest dcf showed better accuracy and robustness in water quality prediction one potential reason for the superior performance of dt may be that it has a nonlinear classifier and is highly adaptable to imbalanced datasets furthermore rf and dcf are ensemble models constructed based on dt therefore it is of great importance to choose suitable models to capture the mapping relationships between input data and expected outputs considering the non linear and unstable characteristics of water quality data in time series this paper applied mlpnn svm and four decision tree based ensemble models catboost xgboost et and rf to mine the relationships between inputs and desired outputs and high performance prediction water quality models were then constructed in the four clusters the analysis results in section 3 3 1 presented that the six models in different clusters exhibited different prediction abilities in cases with the same input dataset the optimal model was svm in cluster 1 and catboost in cluster 2 to cluster 4 this finding was associated with the inherent characteristics of these models svm leverages the radial basis function as kernel function to map the low dimensional input space to a high dimensional feature space thus a high order model is actually trained in the original input space this approach not only retains the advantages of simple models such as the fast training speed and low variance but also encompassed the advantages of more complex models in terms of enhanced mapping and reduced deviations the overwhelming superiority of catboost is that it can efficiently and reasonably solve the common gradient bias and prediction shift problems thus improving the accuracy and generalization capability of the model although standalone models have yielded good modeling results in water quality prediction more accurate prediction techniques are worthy of further exploration bui et al s 2020 findings demonstrated that hybridization can significantly improve prediction performance similarly lu and ma 2020 compared the prediction capabilities of different individual models with those of two hybrid decision tree based models and found that the hybrid models can partly enhance the accuracy and robustness of water quality prediction in this case study a voting ensemble learning method was implemented to hybridize two standalone models with relatively better performance the results of the analysis indicated that compared to the standalone models the hybrid models can enhance water quality prediction performance to a certain extent but this is not always the case these can be attributed to the fact that some hybrid models can combine the advantages of standalone models and overcome their limitations however when standalone models have sufficiently good prediction capability hybridizing them with others may not enhance the prediction accuracy because of the difficulty in choosing base learners not all voting based hybrid models can improve prediction performance compared with the respective base classifiers li et al 2022 hence it can be found that there are no models that can always yield best performance and robustness in all situations the prediction accuracy of multiple standalone models and the voting based hybrid models should be investigated to construct the locally optimal prediction models in specific cases 3 exploration of future work in this study the spatial heterogeneity of water quality was identified and the locally optimal models for water quality prediction were adaptively constructed in four spatially contiguous clusters in fact seasonal variations of water quality over time should also be further explored therefore the future research will verify whether seasonal differences have an impact on water quality prediction results 5 conclusion this study aimed to predict the water quality status in the spatially heterogeneous environment due to regional differences in water quality distribution we proposed spatially adaptive machine learning models to predict water quality levels and explore acceptable local prediction results with the minimum number of wqps possible the conclusions were drawn as follows 1 spatially adaptive clustering is an essential process for establishing effective local prediction models the study area was regionalized into four spatially contiguous clusters based on water quality data and geographic locations using redcap each cluster was associated with a different combination of crucial input parameters for water quality prediction 2 the novel hybrid models were superior to the standalone models in water quality prediction in the first three clusters but the standalone model performed better than the hybrid model in cluster 4 the locally optimal prediction models were identified as mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and catboost in cluster 1 to cluster 4 respectively 3 the sensitivity analysis revealed the relative importance of crucial parameters to wqi values for the four clusters acceptable water quality prediction can be achieved with the locally optimal prediction models using 5 6 4 and 3 indicative wqps as input combinations in cluster 1 to cluster 4 respectively the findings of this study can broaden the research scope of water quality prediction in the spatially heterogeneous environment specifically the proposed spatially adaptive machine learning models can be used to effectively predict the local water quality status in multi station area study moreover when sudden water pollution occurs authorities can quickly understand the water quality levels and take measures to control pollution in accordance with the

1801,water quality prediction in the spatially heterogeneous environment is challenging as the importance of water quality parameters wqps and the performance of prediction models may vary across space thus this study proposed spatially adaptive machine learning models to predict water quality status in hong kong first spatial clusters with relatively homogeneous water quality were adaptively detected using dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning then the optimal prediction models were constructed for each cluster by locally evaluating the prediction performance of six standalone machine learning models including multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn support vector machine svm random forest rf extremely randomized tree et extreme gradient boosting xgboost and categorical gradient boosting catboost as well as four novel hybrid models mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and xgboost catboost finally a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the minimum sets of indicative wqps to achieve more cost efficient water quality prediction based on locally optimal prediction models the results revealed that the water quality in the study area was spatially heterogeneous and four spatially contiguous clusters were identified mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and cabboost performed best in cluster 1 to cluster 4 with r2 values of 0 917 0 906 0 901 and 0 937 and rmse values of 1 978 0 843 2 020 and 1 572 respectively the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that acceptable local prediction results can be obtained using fewer wqps it is conducive to issuing timely water quality warnings and striving for more time for water pollution remediation keywords water quality prediction spatially adaptive strategy locally optimal models machine learning performance evaluation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction with increasing pollution pressures from industrialization urbanization and agriculture river water quality is suffering from continuous deterioration zeinalzadeh and rezaei 2017 wang et al 2022a a large amount of river pollution from point and non point sources has become a significant environmental problem bui et al 2020 the regulation and self purification functions of the aquatic environment will be destroyed to a certain extent when the carrying capability of a river is overloaded which will have extensive impacts on human health and sustainable development recently water contamination has been commonly reported around the world especially in developing countries bashir et al 2020 due to rapid economic development rivers in these countries are receiving increased amounts of pollution wastes which may result in a shortage crisis on the freshwater resource actually the outbreak of water pollution accidents can be found as a result of a lack of information management lu and ma 2020 remediation measures for improving water quality are generally taken after the occurrence of water pollution incidents due to the absence of timely warnings therefore water quality prediction is an imperative task for the effective management of water resources so that authorities can effectively implement certain interventional measures to ensure that the degree of pollution is controlled within acceptable limits at present as artificial intelligence has extensively been applied in various fields in recent years min 2010 battina 2015 hamet and tremblay 2017 zhang and lu 2021 machine learning techniques based on black box operations have also been gradually introduced to predict water quality liu and lu 2014 li et al 2019 chen et al 2021 machine learning methods mainly emphasize the mapping relationships between input data and desired output responses rather than the complicated process mechanisms by learning from abundant historical data including data from dynamic evolutionary processes certain nonlinear relationships can be precisely identified with no prior knowledge deng et al 2021 water quality prediction models can be established using historical monitoring data to train machine learning algorithms and then the water quality prediction results can be obtained based on the constructed models when fed into new testing dataset these imply the applicability of using machine learning methods to accurately predict water quality variations the advantage of machine learning for prediction lies in that it leverages statistical models to enable algorithms to learn rules from large quantities of input data and then the constructed models that can effectively recognize dataset patterns are used to predict and characterize new data presently four types of machine learning models are widely used for water quality prediction artificial neural networks tree based models kernel based models and gradient boosting models lu and ma 2020 haghiabi et al 2018 najafzadeh and ghaemi 2019 najafzadeh and niazmardi 2021 for example multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn has been proven to be an effective method for water quality prediction najah et al 2012 self adaptive and powerful nonlinear approximation capabilities of mlpnn allow it to efficiently map the relationship between input data and anticipated output chen et al 2020 have successfully utilized random forest rf to construct the high performance models for water quality prediction and classification rf can effectively handle the noise data and are not prone to over fitting thus providing a high level of accuracy in predicting water quality it has been found that support vector machine svm as a kernel based model is able to minimize the complexity and noise of network structures and improve the generalization performance in the network elkiran et al 2019 in the research of deng et al 2021 svm has exemplary accuracy and applicability for predicting and analyzing marine water quality in tolo harbor hong kong categorical gradient boosting catboost has the ability to effectively handle category type features and resolve frequent gradient bias and prediction shift issues which makes the model more accurate and generalizable grbčić et al 2022 have obtained reliable prediction results for escherichia coli and enterococci in the rijeka croatia by using the catboost algorithm in addition compared with standalone algorithms the hybrid machine learning algorithm which is combinations of multiple standalone algorithms is able to handle noise and missing data more flexibly and identify the nonlinear relationship between input data and desired output data more easily yin et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 utilized a voting strategy to incorporate seven widely applied machine learning techniques to establish a hybrid model which outperformed standalone classifiers in prediction analysis lu and ma 2020 adopted two hybrid tree based models to predict six water quality parameters and achieved satisfactory prediction performance song et al s findings 2021 showed that the hybrid model had the best prediction ability among peer models based on dataset from two monitoring stations and the prediction results provided decision making foundation for water quality management and pollution control in the studied basin notably the hybrid algorithms generally can combine the advantages of standalone algorithms and overcome some of their respective limitations li et al 2022 thus to construct the optimal prediction models in our study it is worth further comparing and analyzing the accuracy and robustness between standalone and hybrid machine learning algorithms after establishing the water quality prediction models sensitivity analysis is a useful process to handle sudden water quality accident specifically the influences of parameters on water quality were determined based on the relative importance of parameters in sensitivity analysis and the acceptable accuracy of water quality prediction can be probed by progressively reducing the effective parameters in the order of the relative importance ahmed et al 2019 dawood et al 2021 that is to say when an emergent pollution incidence occurs in a river the acceptable prediction results can be acquired with fewer but indicative parameters which will effectively improve the prediction efficiency and earn more time for experts to remediate water contamination the application of machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in water quality prediction in recent years but it is still challenging to develop a global prediction model to characterize the multi station water quality properties due to the spatial heterogeneity of water quality data even if all monitoring datasets from multiple stations were used as input data to successfully model such a model might exhibit low prediction performance or unbalanced prediction capability for different monitoring stations thus to construct high performance prediction models it is necessary to adaptively regionalize the study area and then perform local water quality prediction modelling however there is limited information available concerning spatially adaptive strategy for developing locally optimal water quality prediction models against this backdrop four main tasks were explored in this study 1 to adaptively cluster monitoring stations with homogeneous water quality in space using regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning 2 to determine input combination of key wqps for different clusters 3 to construct the locally optimal prediction models by comparing the prediction performances of standalone and new hybrid models and 4 to explore minimum indicative wqps to acquire acceptable local prediction results 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and water quality data the four water control zones tolo harbour and channel port shelter junk bay and victoria harbour considered in this study are located in the east central region of hong kong the surface water system in hong kong covers a wide range of surface water genres including catchments streams tributaries and rivers most of which are less than five miles in length the upstream sections of the rivers enter ponds to provide drinkable water and water in the downstream sections is utilized to irrigate fields and to maintain aquatic creatures and vegetation the study area is characterized by the subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of approximately 23 3 c the annual rainfall changes considerably from area to area averaging about 1400 mm and reaching a maximum of 3000 mm about 80 of precipitation appears from may to september the months with the greatest precipitation are june and august whereas january and december receive the least precipitation wqps are generally categorized as physical indicators chemical indicators biological indicators bacteriological indicators and radioactive indicators lu and ma 2020 valdivia garcia et al 2019 for different analysis targets different parameters are used to evaluate water quality for example algal boom events mainly focus on 5 day

po4 p conductivity cond chloride cl fluoride f copper cu zinc zn and arsenic as a total of 5022 water quality data were collected monthly at 42 monitoring stations in four water control zones in hong kong from 2010 to 2019 notably there are altogether 18 data lost at the kn2 kn3 and kn4 stations these stations are distributed along 17 watercourses including ten brooks in the tolo harbor and channel three watercourses in the port shelter one watercourse in the junk bay and three watercourses in the victoria harbor the detailed geographical locations of these stations are illustrated in fig 1 the dataset of 5022 observations was split into two subsets water quality data from 2010 to 2017 80 used for the training phase and water quality data from 2018 to 2019 20 for the testing phase 2 2 method description this study developed spatially adaptive machine learning models to predict water quality levels in the spatially heterogeneous environment the overall structure of water quality prediction was shown in fig 2 which consists of four stages spatially adaptive clustering extraction of crucial wqps local prediction modeling and sensitivity analysis the water quality assessment method spatially adaptive clustering method and machine learning models used in this research were depicted in the following sections 2 2 1 water quality index wqi wqi can transfer multiple water quality parameters into a single dimensionless number and provide an entire picture of the scenario regarding water quality status ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 wang et al 2019 in this study water quality was evaluated by wqi proposed by pesce and wunderlin 2000 which enjoys great popularity among the studies of water quality analysis nong et al 2020 varol 2020a wang et al 2022b the wqi values can be obtained with the following formula 1 wqi i 1 n c i p i i 1 n p i where c i denotes the normalized value for parameter i and p i is the relative weight given to each parameter which reflects the relative importance to water quality multiple publications pesce and wunderlin 2000 debels et al 2005 koçer and sevgili 2014 varol 2020b nong et al 2020 have revised the normalized values which were listed in table s1 p i ranges from 1 to 4 the most significant parameters are those with p i values of 4 such as do and as while the least significant parameters are those with p i values of 1 e g wt and tp the wqi is unitless and varies from 0 to 100 with higher values signifying better water quality water quality levels can be categorized into five grades based on wqi values extremely bad 0 wqi 25 bad 25 wqi 50 medium 50 wqi 70 good 70 wqi 90 and excellent 90 wqi 100 jonnalagadda and mhere 2001 tyagi et al 2013 2 2 2 regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning redcap this study provided brief introduction about redcap and readers can discover the additional details of the algorithm in the research by guo 2008 redcap includes two steps 1 using a contiguity constrained clustering method to establish a spatially contiguous tree and 2 partitioning the tree to derive some subtrees each of which corresponds to a spatially continuous region redcap can cluster and partition multiple stations using three hierarchical clustering methods single linkage average linkage and complete linkage and two contiguity constraining strategies the first order and full order constraining thus forming six new contiguity constrained clustering methods in this research the full order constrained average linkage clustering full order alk technique was applied to obtain heterogeneous clustered regions because of its better performance in four quality evaluation the overall heterogeneity internal variation region size balance and the data distribution preservation guo 2008 the average linkage cluster alk defines the distance between two regions as the mean dissimilarity between all cross region pairs of data points 2 d alk lm 1 lm u l v m d uv where l and m represent clusters l and m represent the number of the data points in the clusters and duv represent the dissimilarity between u and v then a large number of spatial subtrees can be obtained by partitioning the spatially contiguous trees determined in step one boluwade 2019 the partitioning process includes the optimization of the objective function to minimize the overall heterogeneity in all regions guo 2008 the optimal subtree to cut at each step is that which owns the greatest homogeneity gain which can be computed as follows 3 h g r m a x h r h r a h r b where r denotes a region h r denotes its heterogeneity h g denotes the homogeneity gain or heterogeneity loss of the tree r after the optimal cut and ra and rb denote the two subtrees from a possible cut of r the sum of squared deviation sdd is used as the heterogeneity measure and can be calculated as 4 h r j 1 d i 1 n r x ij x j 2 where r and h r are as defined in equation 3 d stands for the number of attributes nr stands for the number of objects in region xij stands for the value of the jth attribute of the ith object and xj stands for the average value of the jth attribute of all objects in the region the overall heterogeneity hk can be determined as the total of the k heterogeneity values and the equation is defined as 5 h k j 1 k h r j different from the regionalization developed by non spatial clustering technology redcap directly integrates the spatial continuity constraint into the traditional hierarchical clustering method yielding the continuous region with optimized homogeneity kupfer et al 2012 redcap requires every cluster at each hierarchical level to be continuous in space spatial contiguity is ensured through clustering and optimization processes to produce more consistent and efficient derived regions then a spatially contiguous tree is established by iteratively merging the most similar units connected in space 2 2 3 machine learning models the structures and descriptions of the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn support vector machine svm random forest rf extremely randomized tree et extreme gradient boosting xgboost and categorical gradient boosting catboost were presented in the supplementary materials hybrid techniques have been proved to improve the accuracy of prediction results ouma et al 2022 song et al 2021 lu and ma 2020 in this study to overcome some limitations of standalone machine learning models a novel hybrid model based on the voting strategy is proposed to forecast water quality levels after comparing the prediction accuracy of the above six machine learning models the two locally high performance models were selected as the basic models to construct a hybrid model based on the voting strategy voting combination utilized the principle of majority voting to acquire more correct results by constructing multiple homogeneous or heterogeneous classifiers this approach can greatly reduce the variance in the model and improve the model performance 2 3 performance metrics for model evaluation to evaluate the prediction performance of the models one goodness of fit measure and five different statistical error metrics were employed to compare the output values with the measured values huai et al 2018 saberi movahed et al 2020 najafzadeh et al 2021 these performance metrics included the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae mean discrepancy ratio dr scatter index si and maximum relative error mre the corresponding calculation formulas were shown as follows 6 r 2 1 i 1 n m i p i 2 i 1 n m i m i 2 7 rmse i 1 n p i m i 2 n 8 mae 1 n i 1 n p i m i 9 dr 1 n i 1 n log 10 p i m i 10 si i 1 n p i m i 2 n i 1 n m i n 11 mre m a x p i m i m i 100 where p i and m i denote the predicted wqi values and measured wqi values respectively and m i denotes the average of the measured wqi values 3 results 3 1 water quality analysis the basic statistical information for wqps and the wqi from 2010 to 2017 was shown in table 1 the results of kruskal wallis test indicated that during the monitoring period most of the wqps concentrations displayed significant interannual variations p 0 05 whereas the concentrations of nh3 n no2 n and cl slightly fluctuated from year to year p 0 05 the annual mean values of the wqi were higher than 80 suggesting that the water quality was good overall and there were significant interannual differences in water quality p 0 05 as shown in fig 3 out of a total of 42 monitoring stations 5 stations around 12 were classified as excellent water quality levels 90 wqi 100 and 21 stations around 50 were categorized as good or excellent water quality levels 70 wqi 100 monitoring stations with medium or good water quality levels had 16 stations accounting for approximately 38 50 wqi 90 it is worth noting that stations tr6 tr12i tr12 tr12c tr20b tr17 pr1 jr3 jr6 kn7 and kw3 exhibited good water quality status in most cases and medium water quality status in a few cases stations kn1 kn2 kn3 kn4 and kn5 displayed medium wqi values more often than good wqi values combination the topographic structure fig 1 and spatial variations of wqi fig 3 it can be found that higher wqi values were mainly distributed in the northwestern and central parts of the study area whereas lower wqi values were recorded in the southern region 3 2 spatially adaptive clustering and homogeneity analysis in this study 42 monitoring stations were adaptively clustered based on spatial coordinates longitude and latitude and thematic attributes of monitoring stations wqi values a total of five divisions were performed on water quality data of 42 stations from 2010 to 2017 and each division yielded a new clustering result taking into account the overall heterogeneity and internal variation dividing the study area into four clusters yielded a good spatial clustering result therefore the regionalization structure from the 3rd division was selected and visualized in fig 4 each color denoted a cluster and cluster 1 orange cluster 2 green cluster 3 red and cluster 4 blue contained 4 12 18 and 8 contiguous stations respectively the homogeneity of the spatial clusters included geographical locations water quality levels and possible pollution source the monitoring stations in each cluster were contiguous and close in geographical locations fig 4 in accordance with the water quality distribution of monitoring stations fig 3 it can be seen that cluster 2 and cluster 3 exhibited better water quality levels than cluster 1 and cluster 4 to illustrate the primary pollution sources in the four clusters two representative stations from each cluster were chosen to demonstrate their surrounding land use conditions the land use around cluster 1 mainly includes farming and transportation so the main pollution may come from agricultural irrigation and traffic exhaust fig 5 residential communities and governmental institutions are located in the vicinity of the cluster 2 monitoring stations suggesting that domestic sewage is the primary pollutant based on the distribution of land use around cluster 3 industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation domestic sewage and traffic exhaust contributed the most to water contamination the land use conditions in cluster 4 indicate that regional pollution can be attributed to traffic exhaust and domestic sewage 3 3 selection of crucial water quality parameters the determination of input parameters for four clusters mainly counted on statistical analysis and prior knowledge correlation analysis can effectively uncover potential associations cai and kwan 2022 and have been proved to be straightforward and effective method to select crucial wqps for wqi prediction bui et al 2020 meng et al 2021 herein the correlations between 21wqps and wqi were measured by pearson s correlation coefficient and were presented in the table s3 wqps with relatively strong positive or negative correlations with the wqi were considered when establishing the water quality prediction models as they can enhance the prediction capability to some extent additionally stepwise regression analysis was utilized to provide some reference information about the contribution rate of wqps to the wqi table s4 considering the correlations and the contributions of wqps to the wqi the input combinations of crucial wqps for modeling were identified as shown in table 2 the different combinations of input wqps for the four clusters highlight the need for spatially adaptive clustering in water quality prediction modeling 3 4 performance evaluation of local models for water quality prediction the water quality prediction results of six standalone and four novel hybrid machine learning models were evaluated and compared in this section five error metrics and the coefficient of determination were employed to quantify the effectiveness and performance of different models 3 4 1 prediction performance of standalone models the fitting degree and error range between the measured and predicted wqi values in the four clusters during the training and testing phases were shown in table 3 in terms of goodness of fit all standalone models performed well in the four clusters r2 0 75 bui et al 2020 but the best performing models differed in each cluster svm performed best in cluster 1 and catboost performed best in cluster 2 cluster 3 and cluster 4 based on the computed r2 values in accordance with four error metrics rmse mae d r and si the prediction performance of models in cluster 1 ranked as follows best to worst svm mlpnn et catboost rf and xgboost similarly the accuracy in cluster 2 ranked from the lowest to the highest catboost et rf svm mlpnn and xgboost moreover the prediction performance in cluster 3 and cluster 4 was in the descending order catboost mlpnn et xgboost rf and svm and catboost xgboost svm rf et and mlpnn respectively it can be seen that the analysis results of goodness of fit corresponded with those of four error metrics svm is more prominent in predicting wqi values in cluster 1 while catboost was superior to the other models in cluster 2 to cluster 4 fig 6 a d depicted the time series of the measured and predicted values with two locally prominent standalone models in the training and testing phases svm and mlpnn in cluster 1 catboost and et in cluster 2 catboost and mlpnn in cluster 3 as well as catboost and xgboost in cluster 4 respectively on the whole the two selected models in four clusters performed well and were able to accurately capture the increasing and decreasing trends and the magnitude variations of the wqi values in all datasets this suggested that the models constructed in the four clusters did not suffer from overfitting or underfitting problems and can effectively predict water quality levels 3 4 2 prediction performance of novel hybrid models to improve the overall prediction performance the novel hybrid models were developed based on voting strategy and basic models basic models were from standalone models with outstanding prediction capability svm and mlpnn in cluster 1 et and catboost in cluster 2 mlpnn and catboost in cluster 3 and catboost and xgboost in cluster 4 they were also considered as the benchmark models in four clusters to provide the effective comparison the novel hybrid models in cluster 1 to cluster 4 were mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and xgboost catboost respectively fig 7 intuitively displayed the prediction capability of the hybrid and basic models when the output values were greater than the measured values the points were plotted above the diagonal line and vice versa the best performing prediction model was the one that produced the most points on or near the diagonal line meng et al 2021 as shown in fig 7a and fig 8 a mlpnn svm outperformed the other two standalone basic models with the highest goodness of fit r2 0 917 and the lowest error metrics rmse 1 978 mae 1 569 and mre 6 5 similar findings were obtained that et catboost in cluster 2 and mlpnn catboost in cluster 3 exhibited better prediction capabilities than the basic models with the largest r2 values and the lowest rmse and mae values despite the hybrid models not having the minimum mre values fig 7b c and fig 8b c this is because mre simply reflects the maximum error of individual points rather than overall error notably for cluster 4 the prediction results demonstrated that catboost was superior to xgboost catboost with the highest fitting levels and lowest four error metrics r2 0 937 rmse 1 572 mae 1 222 and mre 7 6 fig 7d and fig 8d to further test and verify the prediction accuracy of the standalone and hybrid learning models taylor diagram was used to statistically quantify the similarity between the measured and predicted wqi values in this approach the correlation coefficient cc centered root mean square error crmse and standard deviation sd are ingeniously integrated into a polar coordinate diagram based on the triangular cosine relationship among them elkiran et al 2019 taylor 2001 the prediction results were analyzed in accordance with the distribution of three evaluation metrics in taylor diagram mlpnn svm et catboost and mlpnn catboost models demonstrated optimal prediction performance in cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 respectively fig 9 a c however the best prediction results in cluster 4 were obtained with catboost fig 9d this finding was consistent with the above analysis results which affirmed that the hybrid models yielded more accurate prediction results than the standalone models in the first three clusters but the standalone model outperformed the hybrid model in the fourth cluster 3 5 sensitivity analysis of locally optimal models for water quality prediction the permutation feature importance was employed to investigate the influence of crucial wqps on the prediction performance of the locally optimal models the computed importance score denotes the relative importance of each input wqp from the same model which is helpful for quantifying the contributions of input parameters to the prediction model the parameters with high importance scores are considered to be comparatively more useful the results of relative importance were exhibited in fig 10 a d specifically the importance score values showed that the relative importance of the wqps in cluster 1 were f bod5 do no2 n tss cod and as in the descending order in cluster 2 it can be seen that the rank high to low of the wqps importance was nh3 n cond tss f cod bod5 and no2 n similarly the importance of the wqps were ranked in the decreasing order cond ton f tur no2 n cu and as in cluster 3 as well as cond bod5 ton no2 n do cod and tur in cluster 4 mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and catboost models trained with seven wqps all exhibited the best performance and accuracy fig 11 moreover as the number of wqps decreased the prediction capability of the models displayed a downward trend in the training and testing phases note should be taken that the number of wqps was sequentially reduced based on the rank of relative importance in the locally optimal models in cluster 1 the prediction result of mlpnn svm trained with a set of five parameters f bod5 do no2 n and tss was not as good as that in the case of seven parameters whereas its prediction accuracy still was acceptable with r2 0 904 and rmse 1 791 in the training dataset and r2 0 898 and rmse 2 191 in the testing dataset fig 11a likewise when et catboost mlpnn catboost and catboost were trained with the sets of six parameters nh3 n cond tss f cod and bod5 four parameters cond ton f and tur and three parameters cond bod5 and ton respectively the relatively good prediction performance can be also obtained in cluster 2 to cluster 4 fig 11b d thereinto for the training dataset the r2 values in cluster 2 to cluster 4 were 0 997 0 951 and 0 969 and the rmse values were 0 264 1 500 and 1 095 respectively for the testing dataset the r2 values were 0 883 0 854 and 0 857 and the rmse values were 0 941 2 451 and 2 369 respectively it can be concluded that the input combinations of minimum wqps for acceptable local prediction results in cluster 1 to cluster 4 were the sets of five six four and three parameters respectively 4 discussion accurate and stable water quality prediction results are beneficial for providing a scientific and reliable theoretical basis for water quality warning and pollution control the performance of water quality prediction models depends not only on the input dataset but also on the model features chen et al 2020 however due to the presence of spatial heterogeneity in water quality data cai et al 2021 golmohammadi et al 2020 it is difficult to establish an overall model for water quality prediction in this study a spatially adaptive strategy was proposed to construct locally optimal water quality prediction models in the spatially heterogeneous environment moreover the acceptable prediction results for each locally optimal prediction models were further probed to improve the prediction efficiency 1 spatially adaptive clustering multi station spatial clustering is a crucial procedure before constructing water quality prediction models antanasijević et al 2020 liu et al 2018 2021 2022 considering the spatial heterogeneity of water quality data our study adopted redcap algorithm to adaptively divide the numerous monitoring stations into different clusters the water quality hierarchy clustering of redcap allows monitoring stations with similar water quality levels and spatially contiguous location to be clustered together maximizing homogeneity of water quality and spatial location attributes within the same cluster and maximizing heterogeneity of these attributes among different clusters guo 2008 guo and wang 2011 in this study an objective classification with four spatially contiguous clusters can be obtained based on the redcap algorithm the monitoring stations within the same cluster showed the homogeneity of water quality levels spatial locations land use and possible pollution source it can be found that spatially adaptive clustering for multiple stations was conducive to mining the hidden features and patterns in the dataset and then constructing an appropriate local model for water quality prediction 2 locally optimal water quality prediction modeling in fact machine learning models for water quality prediction using a small number of crucial parameters as inputs have enjoyed great popularity mainly because these models can mine the internal features of historical data to identify the complicated relationships between inputs and expected outputs for example in the research of chen et al 2020 four wqps do nh3 n ph and codmn datasets were used to train ten machine learning models and decision tree dt random forest rf and deep cascade forest dcf showed better accuracy and robustness in water quality prediction one potential reason for the superior performance of dt may be that it has a nonlinear classifier and is highly adaptable to imbalanced datasets furthermore rf and dcf are ensemble models constructed based on dt therefore it is of great importance to choose suitable models to capture the mapping relationships between input data and expected outputs considering the non linear and unstable characteristics of water quality data in time series this paper applied mlpnn svm and four decision tree based ensemble models catboost xgboost et and rf to mine the relationships between inputs and desired outputs and high performance prediction water quality models were then constructed in the four clusters the analysis results in section 3 3 1 presented that the six models in different clusters exhibited different prediction abilities in cases with the same input dataset the optimal model was svm in cluster 1 and catboost in cluster 2 to cluster 4 this finding was associated with the inherent characteristics of these models svm leverages the radial basis function as kernel function to map the low dimensional input space to a high dimensional feature space thus a high order model is actually trained in the original input space this approach not only retains the advantages of simple models such as the fast training speed and low variance but also encompassed the advantages of more complex models in terms of enhanced mapping and reduced deviations the overwhelming superiority of catboost is that it can efficiently and reasonably solve the common gradient bias and prediction shift problems thus improving the accuracy and generalization capability of the model although standalone models have yielded good modeling results in water quality prediction more accurate prediction techniques are worthy of further exploration bui et al s 2020 findings demonstrated that hybridization can significantly improve prediction performance similarly lu and ma 2020 compared the prediction capabilities of different individual models with those of two hybrid decision tree based models and found that the hybrid models can partly enhance the accuracy and robustness of water quality prediction in this case study a voting ensemble learning method was implemented to hybridize two standalone models with relatively better performance the results of the analysis indicated that compared to the standalone models the hybrid models can enhance water quality prediction performance to a certain extent but this is not always the case these can be attributed to the fact that some hybrid models can combine the advantages of standalone models and overcome their limitations however when standalone models have sufficiently good prediction capability hybridizing them with others may not enhance the prediction accuracy because of the difficulty in choosing base learners not all voting based hybrid models can improve prediction performance compared with the respective base classifiers li et al 2022 hence it can be found that there are no models that can always yield best performance and robustness in all situations the prediction accuracy of multiple standalone models and the voting based hybrid models should be investigated to construct the locally optimal prediction models in specific cases 3 exploration of future work in this study the spatial heterogeneity of water quality was identified and the locally optimal models for water quality prediction were adaptively constructed in four spatially contiguous clusters in fact seasonal variations of water quality over time should also be further explored therefore the future research will verify whether seasonal differences have an impact on water quality prediction results 5 conclusion this study aimed to predict the water quality status in the spatially heterogeneous environment due to regional differences in water quality distribution we proposed spatially adaptive machine learning models to predict water quality levels and explore acceptable local prediction results with the minimum number of wqps possible the conclusions were drawn as follows 1 spatially adaptive clustering is an essential process for establishing effective local prediction models the study area was regionalized into four spatially contiguous clusters based on water quality data and geographic locations using redcap each cluster was associated with a different combination of crucial input parameters for water quality prediction 2 the novel hybrid models were superior to the standalone models in water quality prediction in the first three clusters but the standalone model performed better than the hybrid model in cluster 4 the locally optimal prediction models were identified as mlpnn svm et catboost mlpnn catboost and catboost in cluster 1 to cluster 4 respectively 3 the sensitivity analysis revealed the relative importance of crucial parameters to wqi values for the four clusters acceptable water quality prediction can be achieved with the locally optimal prediction models using 5 6 4 and 3 indicative wqps as input combinations in cluster 1 to cluster 4 respectively the findings of this study can broaden the research scope of water quality prediction in the spatially heterogeneous environment specifically the proposed spatially adaptive machine learning models can be used to effectively predict the local water quality status in multi station area study moreover when sudden water pollution occurs authorities can quickly understand the water quality levels and take measures to control pollution in accordance with the

1802,rapid urbanization has led to water stagnation by temporal and spatial imbalances of the hydrodynamics in urban river networks which further entails environmental risks to drinking and recreational water supplies the establishment of a succinct hydraulic potential dissipation hpd index to indicate the spatiotemporal stagnant water environmental risks quickly and intuitively is of vital significance to urban river networks with complicated water regimes and diversified water diversion measures on this basis an integrated stagnant water environmental risk analysis model iswera was established by coupling the process based model and stochastic process to comprehensively and accurately assess risks which has been calibrated and validated against the real data of 11 monitoring stations from may 3 to may 11 in 2017 and november 28 to december 10 in 2020 respectively to represent the rationality of stagnant water environmental risks assessment using hpd iswera was used to evaluate the temporal and spatial varying stagnant water environmental risk intensity and probability of 270 water diversion schemes formed by the combination of water diversion duration flow route and potential in the changzhou urban river network along the yangtze river for time varying results it revealed that cumulative risk intensity was reduced by nearly 15 and risk probability was significantly reduced by nearly 50 with the increase of diversion duration to 5 days in general for spatial varying results most of the rivers reached the low risk grade under the optimized diversion duration flow route and potential while the rivers adjacent to densely populated areas still presented a moderate risk state the positive correlation was significant between hpd and stagnant water environmental risk intensity and probability results with r2 0 86 and 0 74 respectively when the hpd of upstream channels are below 63 4 74 1 and 57 7 and the downstream hpd of s1 to t1 s2 to t2 s2 to t3 and s3 to t4 are below 40 6 32 9 22 4 and 19 1 respectively the stagnant water environmental risk is lower arguably this study could provide a scientific reference and foundation for water environmental management of similar urban stagnant water systems keywords risk assessment water diversion urban river network stagnant water environment management water quality hydraulic potential dissipation data availability all data reported in this paper can be accessed in supporting information 1 introduction with the urbanization course proceeding the impact of human intervention on rivers is becoming more and more conspicuous exploitation and utilization of the rivers for urban benefits will greatly modify the course characteristics or flow and even bring some inadvertent negative effects sekharan et al 2022 puchol salort et al 2022 anthropogenic interventions disrupt the natural water flow resulting in river retardation and weakening that can form stagnant water further the stagnant water easily becomes black and odorous which could trigger a series of water environmental problems brandeler et al 2019 tang et al 2022 especially for urban river networks with temporal and spatial imbalances of the hydrodynamics because of flat terrain and low water potential many rivers in these areas have suffered excessive transformation industrial pollutants discharge and wastewater discharge ultimately resulting in the damaged water environment of stagnant water that imposes risks to drinking and recreational water supplies in urban areas neale and moffett 2016 aithani et al 2020 dalu et al 2020 therefore it is of essence to address stagnant water management to prevent and control water environmental risk in the urban river network traditional water diversion ideas typically include introducing clear and abundant water resources to dilute the contaminated water in order to improve the water environment berhanu and bisrat 2020 kirby et al 2014 tang et al 2022 one reasonable and effective measure to improve stagnant water environmental risks for urban river networks with a relatively complete water conservancy system involves allocating water resources optimally by regulating pump stations sluices and other small scale water infrastructure that combine different water diversion conditions that lead to suitable spatiotemporal hydrodynamics distribution fu et al 2022 several factors contribute to the improvement of the water environment following water diversion including diversion flow fornarelli and antenucci 2011 kraus et al 2011 morrison and stone 2015 diversion routes li et al 2013 liu et al 2014 diversion duration gibbins et al 2000 and diversion projects management hudak 2011 due to the complicated river network and diversified pump and sluice scheduling mode of urban areas it is necessary to explore a unified standard related to hydrodynamics to measure the improvement of stagnant water environmental risks by complex water diversion schemes under different combinations of water diversion conditions in urban river networks many studies have explored the impact of a water diversion project on the water environment mainly relying on long term historical data analysis without enough consideration of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes shah et al 2020 garcía gil et al 2022 zhang et al 2023 restricted by specific projects and monitoring data the consequences of different operations of water diversion measures for the water environment are neglected yang et al 2021 the process based model can overcome the above limitations by investigating multi factor stagnant water environmental risk for both temporal and spatial variations under different combinations of water diversion conditions by superimposing various physical processes morrison and stone 2014 assessment of stagnant water environmental risk often requires the analysis by synthesis of a large number of indicators zhang et al 2021 the water quality index wqi provides a scientific reference for evaluating the environmental status of water bodies by fully utilizing water quality parameters khouri and ai moufti 2022 lobato et al 2015 our previous studies have proved that copula could be used to conduct risk analysis for the water environment when faced with continuous and multiple environmental indicators yu and zhang 2021 besides that other models have been widely used in the assessment of the water environment which could provide a single number that expresses the total stagnant water environmental risk state chen et al 2012 zelenakova et al 2021 however particular variables may have multiple states and different weights which is difficult to be solved by the traditional static risk analysis method to address the uncertainty and randomness of stagnant water environmental risk the stochastic processes could be introduced to reduce subjectivity to improve the accuracy of process based models therefore it is worth studying how to assess stagnant water environmental risks by the integration of a process based model and stochastic process how to intuitively measure temporal and spatial varying stagnant water environmental risks with a unified hydrodynamic based standard is a central question of sustainable water environmental management in a stagnant urban river network yu and zhang 2021 therefore this study aims to propose a novel hydraulic potential dissipation hpd index as an accessible metric that reflects the state of stagnant water environmental risk for different combinations of water diversion conditions under the spatiotemporal variation of an urban river network the objectives are as follows 1 to construct a risk analysis model by combining a process based model and stochastic process to analyze temporal and spatial variations of stagnant water environmental risks under different water diversion schemes 2 to identify the optimized water diversion scheme in an urban river network area of the yangtze river 3 to propose an hpd index that reflects stagnant water environmental risk intuitively and rapidly in urban river networks with relatively complex hydrological conditions this study can not only be applied to the actual risk assessment of urban river networks but can also reflect the feasibility and availability of water diversion schemes by hpd which could provide a theoretical reference for environmental management decisions of similar stagnant water systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the changzhou river network located on the southern yangtze river delta plain has many characteristics that are common among urban river networks in china fig 1 the urban river network of changzhou has variegated and developed river systems comprising 113 rivers with a total length of approximately 285 km covering an area of 179 2 km2 the climate of the study area is relatively mild and humid the annual average temperature is 16 5 and the mean annual precipitation is about 1037 1164 mm where 50 60 of precipitation falls in summer for developed agriculture and industries and numerous people in changzhou the river network structure connectivity and water environment of changzhou city are significantly affected by human activities these rapid urbanization driven activities have led to silting drainage clogging black and odorous water due to stagnancy this has a notable negative influence on the water environment of the urban open channel networks in changzhou ai et al 2022 according to the i v classification standards recommended by the national surface water quality standard of china gb3838 2002 the water quality grade of changzhou city was mainly water quality standard iv grade the main pollutions in the study area are ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total phosphorus tp and permanganate index codmn to improve urban water environmental quality the government proposed a clean water diversion scheme in changzhou city including making use of the high quality water source of the yangtze river adopting the desheng river and zaogang river as clear water channels building four new movable overflow weirs and forming three stage water levels fig 1 2 2 the integrated stagnant water environmental risk analysis model iswera iswera is proposed for the accurate analysis of unordered unsteady and non equilibrium water environmental systems with multiple formative risk factors and superposing physical processes by synthesizing the process based hydrodynamics and water quality model and the catastrophe theory coupled with the random forest model ctrf iswera can be used to describe different operations of water diversion schemes and the complex interaction of risk indicators in addition iswera can be used to quantify the range in the uncertainty of stagnant water environmental risk more precisely and comprehensively fig 2 iswera simulates different water diversion schemes by first inputting geometric hydrological and water quality data into a 1 d process based hydrodynamic and water quality model the 1 d hydrodynamic model adopted st venant s unsteady flow equations of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum eqs 1 and 2 1 a t q x 0 2 q t v q x g a z x s f 0 where a represents the total flow area m2 q represents the discharge m3 s v represents the flow rate m s t is time s z is the elevation of the water surface above the datum line m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 s f is the friction slope the 1 d water quality model adopted the convection diffusion equation birkhoff et al 1990 eq 3 3 c t u c x e d 2 c x 2 s i where c represents the concentration of water quality variables mg l s i represents the source and sink of water quality variables mg l d e d is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient km2 d secondly ctrf was used to assess the risk of complex water environmental systems with uncertain internal functions the catastrophe theory was proposed to describe the qualitative change process of discontinuous changes constrained using a high order probability density function thom 1975 wagenmalers et al 2005 gao et al 2019 in this theory the potential function could describe the system behavior through state variables and control variables as the research object the evaluated dynamic system needs to be categorized into sub systems to solve complex problems and each sub system should have indicators composed of a number for the assessment kaur et al 2020 our paper involves only one dimensional state variables including the fold catastrophe model the cusp catastrophe model and the swallowtail catastrophe model thom 1975 the energy function eq 4 and normalization formula eq 5 of the fold catastrophe model are 4 v x fold 1 3 x 3 a x 5 x a a 1 2 the energy function eq 6 and normalization formula eq 7 of the cusp catastrophe model are 6 v x cusp 1 4 x 4 1 2 a x 2 b x 7 x a a 1 2 x b b 1 3 the energy function eq 8 and normalization formula eq 9 of the swallowtail catastrophe model are 8 v x swallowtail 1 5 x 5 1 3 a x 3 1 2 b x 2 c x 9 x a a 1 2 x b b 1 3 x c c 1 3 where x represents the energy function x is the state variable which will be the lowest value of a system i e x m i n x a x b x c a b and c are the control variables of a system considering traditional catastrophe theory typically requires sorting indexes by the researchers which greatly increases the uncertainty and instability of the model to reduce the above subjectivity random forests could be used to determine the index order instead of human operation in catastrophe theory random forests can be used to resort to the variables by calculating feature importance the steps in the random forest for indicator ranking involve i building n decision trees to generate out of bag sample data ii calculating the out of bag error of each decision tree iii adding random noise disturbance into training sample data iv recalculating the out of bag error of each tree formed by new samples breiman 2001 the importance of the indicator could be verified by the mean decreased accuracy value obtained from calculating its impact on the accuracy of the model 10 is σ e r r o r b 2 e r r o r b 1 n where is represents the importance of the indicator the bigger the value the higher the importance of the indicator e r r o b 1 and e r r o b 2 are the out of bag error before and after adding random noise disturbance respectively n is the number of decision trees 2 3 the calibration and verification of iswera stagnant water environmental risk is a statistical index and unavailable for measurement directly but could be quantified by comprehensively considering the risk intensity and risk probability based on the hydrological and water quality indicators therefore as the basic part composed of the measurable geometric hydrological and water quality data the process based hydrodynamic and water quality model is the dominant error source in iswera in this paper the 1 d process based hydrodynamic and water quality model was developed based on existing real data on the urban river network in changzhou fig s1 hourly water level monitor data from may 3 to may 11 in 2017 of 6 monitoring stations and daily water quality monitor data form may 4 to may 11 were used to calibrate iswera similarly every three hours of water level data of 3 monitoring stations and every two days of water quality data of 2 monitoring stations were used to validate the model calibration and validation details were shown in supplementary material s 1 for the water level calibration and verification results the average absolute errors mae and the root mean squares error rmse are both less than 8 cm the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is more than 0 75 and the relative error re is less than 3 tables s2 and s3 figs s2 and s4 for the water quality calibration and verification results the mae value and the rmse value are both less than 0 3 mg l the nse is more than 0 80 mostly and the re is less than 20 tables s2 and s3 figs s3 and s5 thus all of the above proves iswera is reliable 2 4 water environment risk grade hydrodynamic indicators flow velocity and water quality indicators codmn nh3 n and tp were quantitatively assessed to characterize the stagnant water environmental risk of the urban river network of changzhou for the hydrodynamic indicator five risk index levels of flow velocity can be determined according to the annual average flow velocity range in changzhou city for water quality indicators five risk index levels of codmn nh3 n and tp according to the i v classification standards recommended by gb3838 2002 the resulting stagnant water environmental risk index for each of the five risk index levels from the ctrf model is provided in table 1 the higher the stagnant water environmental risk index the higher the risk using grade iii as the risk limit namely when the risk index is higher than 15 68 it is assumed that the system of the urban river network in changzhou has stagnant water environmental risk to synthetically and comprehensively quantify the stagnant water environmental risk we consider two factors risk intensity r and risk probability p to define the stagnant water environmental risk grade r denotes the degree of risks which is represented by the stagnant water environmental risk index p represents the probability of generating risks in this paper the ratio of the number of sections where the stagnant water environmental risk index is greater than the risk limit and the total number of sections under each simulation scheme is regarded as stagnant water environmental risk probability eq 11 11 p g i i l g t where i represents the stagnant water environmental risk index i l represents stagnant water environmental risk limit namely 15 68 g i i l denotes the number of sections where the risk index is greater than the risk limit g t is the total number of all the sections based on the computational risk intensity and risk probability results a matrix of stagnant water environmental risk grades can be formed the water environment risk intensity of the urban river network in changzhou can be divided into four levels based on the risk index level risk probability is divided into five levels according to the preliminary calculation results of simulated diversion schemes by developing iswera in the study area the risk intensity value at each river section of each scheme and the risk probability of each scheme could be calculated according to the risk intensity and probability value the risk grade of the specific river could be identified by table 2 notably the average risk intensity of all sections on a river is considered the risk intensity of the river and it should lie in the range 0 100 then accumulating the values of all 101 river sections represents the risk intensity of a certain scheme theoretically it could reach 10 100 under extremely risky conditions 2 5 hydraulic potential dissipation hpd gentle terrain and flat bottom of the plain area lead to insufficient water mobility low environmental capacity and low self purification ability in urban river networks their weak hydrodynamic characteristics will result in serious and complex water related risks that occur in urban river networks tang et al 2022 therefore forming stage water levels through the construction of a series of flowing water projects will significantly increase river mobility and enhance hydrodynamics in the urban area the water level variations caused by diversion projects could be called hydraulic potential to assess the stagnant water environmental risk of diversion schemes from multiple perspectives hydraulic potential dissipation was proposed in this paper to describe the influence on hydraulic potential or water mobility of diversion schemes based on the above definition we constructed the formulas below 12 α h upstream h downstream l 13 δ i 1 n α β i α i α β i n where α is the hydraulic potential of a certain river reach h upstream and h downstream represent the water depth of the upstream section and the downstream section of the river reach m l represents the river reach length m δ denotes the hydraulic potential dissipation of a certain diversion scheme n is the number of total river reaches in the study area α i and α β i are the hydraulic potentials of a certain river reach in the evaluated diversion scheme and reference diversion scheme respectively higher hpd is more likely to indicate a greater stagnant water environmental risk of the diversion scheme 2 6 the formation of water diversion schemes based on current hydraulic engineering conditions various water diversion schemes could be formulated by composing different water diversion routes wr water diversion flow wq water diversion potential wp and water diversion duration wd wr represents water diversion lines formed by different pump opening and closing systems which include no pumping cailinggang pumping and dayunhe pumping wq represents the different combinations of water diversion volumes pumped by the desheng river and zaogang river wp represents different three stage water levels regulated by the four movable overflow weirs in the study area the three stage water levels denote the changzhou city entrance of the zaogang river the jinghang canal and the new jinghang canal respectively fig 1 wd represents the different duration of pumping the yangtze river into changzhou city on this basis 270 water diversion schemes could be formed by the combination of 3 wr conditions 4 wq conditions 6 wp conditions and 10 wd conditions described in table 3 it should be noted that only when water diversion flow adopts wq4 the movable overflow weirs could be adjusted due to limited water volume in wq1 wq2 and wq3 conditions the water diversion potential can only be wp0 depending on different wr conditions the diversion schemes could be divided into 3 scheme groups with each scheme group containing all 10 diversion duration conditions table s2 wrnsm was used to represent the name of the diversion scheme groups where n could be 1 2 and 3 representing the no pumping scheme group cailinggang pumping scheme group and dayunhe pumping scheme group and m could be 1 to 9 representing the combination of wq wp and wd conditions for example wr1s1 is the scheme group containing 10 schemes by combing wr1 wq1 wp0 and wd0 5 to wd5 respectively 3 results 3 1 time varying distribution of stagnant water environmental risk under different diversion schemes the time varying distributions of risk intensity and risk probability of all 270 diversion schemes are presented in fig 3 by contrasting the risk intensity and the risk probability of each scheme group under the same diversion duration we found that the risks of wrns1 wrns2 and wrns3 were significantly higher than those in other scheme groups it s primarily because the water diversion flow adopts the desheng river pump 30 m3 s and the zaogang river pump 40 m3 s to provide abundant flow volume to the urban river network in wrns4 to wrns9 which greatly reduces the stagnant water environmental risk of the study area additionally since the only difference between wrns2 and wrns3 is diversion flow condition and they both pump 60 m3 s total from the yangtze river the risk intensity and risk probability of the two schemes are similar the risk intensity and risk probability of wrns4 to wrns9 show a decreasing tendency which is caused by the increasing water diversion potential thus it can be seen ensuring adequate water diversion flow could greatly reduce the overall stagnant water environmental risks in the urban river network on this premise duly adjusting the water diversion potential could be adopted for further improvement by contrasting the risk intensity and the risk probability of wr1s wr2s and wr3s an apparent decline in stagnant water environmental risk of wr2s and wr3s could be found compared with that in wr1s the mean cumulative risk intensity of wr1s reached 1300 while that of wr2s and wr3s remain around 1100 the risk probability of wr1s is mostly between 0 5 and 0 6 and that of wr2s and wr3s were from 0 4 to 0 5 while the difference in risk is insignificant between wr2s and wr3s the improvement effect on stagnant water environmental risk of wr2s is slightly higher than that of wr3s the results indicate that the water diversion route that adopts wr3s namely dayunhe pumping could reach the best water environment improvement effect on the whole however for the options of the optimized water diversion scheme it is necessary to consider the spatial varying distribution results of the stagnant water environmental risks by comparing the risk intensity and the risk probability of each diversion duration under the same scheme group it indicates that both the risk intensity and the risk probability were significantly reduced with the increase of diversion duration in general temporally the risk intensity shows a trend of slightly increasing at first and then decreasing moreover the changes in risk intensity and risk probability area are barely measurable from the third day onward irrespective of the scheme group considering the cost saving requirement a 3 day diversion duration namely wd3 could be initially identified as the optimized water diversion duration condition 3 2 spatial varying distribution of stagnant water environmental risk under different diversion schemes to illustrate the influence of different diversion measures on stagnant water environmental risk and screen out the optimized water diversion measures we plotted the spatial varying risk grade distribution of the changzhou river network under different diversion measures fig 4 for ease of reference only the dominant water diversion condition was varied while the other conditions are consistent for the water diversion flow condition this paper takes the schemes wr1s1 wr1s2 wr1s3 and wr1s4 under the optimized diversion duration wd3 to form schemes fwq1 fwq2 fwq3 and fwq4 respectively when adopting fwq1 pumping 50 m3 s totally from the yangtze river results in low flow distributed to each river and gently flowing water causing a high risk state on the whole spatial scale for fwq2 and fwq3 although the pumping volume is the same and the cumulative risk intensity and risk probability are not very different fig 3 the spatial varying risk grade distribution is quite different it can be seen that when the pumping volume of the zaogang river is higher the risk grade of the zaogang river and shi river decreases from high risk to moderate risk it can also be seen that increasing the pumping volume of the zaogang river will be more effective when the total diversion flow is constant with the pumping volume of the zaogang river further increasing in fwq4 the risk grades of the lower river decrease therefore wq4 could be identified as the optimized water diversion flow condition for the water diversion route condition this paper takes the schemes wr1s4 wr2s4 and wr3s4 under the optimized diversion duration wd3 to form schemes swr1 swr2 and swr3 respectively relative to fwr1 the stagnant water environmental risk of fwr2 and fwr3 has been greatly reduced on the whole spatial scale while some high risk rivers remain in addition when adopting cailinggang pumping the shutdown of the dayunhe pump station makes the stagnant water environmental risk downstream of the jinghang river higher while when the cailinggang pump station stops working under dayunhe pumping conditions the stagnant water in the cailing river will lead to a higher risk of the river relatively the area that can be improved by dayunhe pumping is larger than that of cailinggang pumping which is more consistent with the drainage demand of changzhou city therefore dayunhe pumping namely wr3 could be regarded as the optimized water diversion route condition however in the specific application the diversion route should vary according to the drainage demand for the water diversion potential condition this paper takes the schemes wr3s4 to wr3s9 under the optimized diversion duration wd3 to form schemes twp0 to twp5 respectively it appears that the risk grade is significantly reduced with the rise of the water level of the zaogang river at the entrance of changzhou city and when the water level of the zaogang river s city entrance reached 3 95 m and 4 00 m no river across the study area reached high risk levels arguably it could be determined that the optimized water diversion potential is wp5 based on the above results this paper considered the scheme wr3s9 under the optimized diversion duration as the reference diversion scheme 3 3 the relationship between hpd and stagnant water environmental risks the cumulative risk intensity and risk probability of all diversion schemes were used to explore the relations between hpd and stagnant water environmental risk by adopting the nonlinear approach fig 5 the coefficient of determination r2 was used to describe the intensity of the relationship between two variables when the r squared is more than 0 6 it could be considered a strong relationship generally the non linear regression results showed that the hpd results are consistent with the changing trend of both the cumulative risk intensity and the risk probability and positive correlation was significant for them with r2 0 86 and 0 74 respectively the established relationship predictions for hpd and risk intensity and probability denote that it could be feasible to make a rough estimate of stagnant water environmental risks by determining the hpd value as a whole the hpd of the no pumping scheme is higher than that of cailinggang pumping and dayunhe pumping specifically the hpd values of no pumping schemes remain from 40 0 to 80 0 and that of cailinggang pumping and dayunhe pumping schemes are mostly lower than 55 0 meanwhile the hpd of dayunhe pumping is slightly lower than cailinggang pumping the trend is in accordance with the stagnant water environmental risk trend fig 3 the range of hpd can be evaluated to roughly estimate the risk grade of a specific river under a diversion scheme for the main longitudinal rivers among three stage water levels hpd under different stagnant water environmental risk grades were approximated according to the results of 270 diversion schemes fig 6 taking the river from f1 to s1 namely the desheng river as an example it could be considered the low risk grade moderate risk grade and high risk grade when the hpd value is between about 0 to 49 8 49 8 63 4 and 63 4 83 7 respectively besides it is noticeable that the upstream rivers between the first stage water level and the second stage water level have a relatively lower risk than the downstream rivers between the second stage water level and the third stage water level especially for the downstream rivers from s2 to t2 s2 to t3 and s3 to t4 there is even no low risk range owing to the limited improvement of the existing water diversion measures this further illustrates that more diversion measures such as gates pump stations and weirs need to be considered for development in these rivers in future water diversion projects 4 discussion 4 1 analysis and suggestions for improvement of water diversion measures on stagnant water environmental risk diversion duration flow route and potential are key hydraulic regulation measures that could promote water flow improve water quality and mitigate stagnant water environmental risk through reasonable and scientific methods li et al 2013 gu et al 2017 xiao et al 2021 this study quantified the improvement in stagnant water environmental risk of the changzhou river network under different combinations of these water diversion measures the time varying stagnant water environmental risk distribution results denote that the risk intensity and probability show a trend of slightly increasing at first then decreasing and tending towards stability from the third day fig 3 the reason for this phenomenon is that a high concentration of pollutants in the upper reaches scoured the urban river network after the implementation of diversion measures which increased the concentration of pollutants in the study area however as diversion duration increases the negative effect of pollutants brought from upstream will be gradually offset and then the pollutant concentration drops until steady that could be called pollutant concentration rebound the spatial varying stagnant water environmental risk distribution results show that a part of the river course in the urban river network still represents considerable risks although the most optimized water diversion measures are adopted fig 4 the major cause of these risks lies in that these rivers are adjacent to densely populated areas and accept a large number of domestic and industrial wastewater and other pollutants causing relative low flow velocity and high initial concertation of water quality indicators of these rivers bu et al 2022 furthermore most of these rivers with relative risk are medium and small rivers the narrow shallow trench made in poor river flow which leads to high stagnant water environmental risk kumar et al 2013 in specific applications some targeted hydraulic regulations should be taken to reduce the stagnant water environmental risks of designated rivers 4 2 mechanism and feasibility of using hpd to reflect urban stagnant water environmental risk the proposed parameter hpd could be regarded as the key indicator to reflect urban stagnant water environmental risk and be used to indicate the feasibility and availability of any water diversion scheme under relatively complex hydrological conditions our results showed that hpd had a good performance in reflecting stagnant water environmental risks fig 5 the stagnant water environmental risk still existed when hpd reached 0 it could be seen that the cumulative risk intensity and risk probability were respectively around 950 and 0 42 when hpd was 0 namely the intercept of the longitudinal axis actually according to our definition of hpd the intercepts denote the risk intensity and risk probability of the reference diversion scheme in this paper it represents the stagnant water environmental risks of the scheme wr3s9 under the 3 day diversion duration therefore it s validated to be viable to evaluate water diversion schemes by hpd by the rough scope of hpd under different risk grades it will be more intuitive and rapid to obtain the risk grade only using the water level data of the diversion scheme to substitute the complex risk analysis method fig 6 for example when implementing any water diversion scheme we just need to adjust the upstream hpd between first stage and second stage water level of the main channels namely f1 to s1 f2 to s2 and f3 to s3 keep below 63 4 74 1 and 57 7 and the downstream hpd between second stage and third stage water level of the main channels namely s1 to t1 s2 tot2 s2 tot3 and s3 to t4 keep below 40 6 32 9 22 4 and 19 1 to ensure the water environmental security the previous research revealed that increasing the hydraulic potential by using sluices pumping stations overflow weirs and other artificial structures will result in the fast passage of diversion water discharge reducing the diversion water retention time in low lying areas and enhancing diversion water flow velocity burian and edwards 2002 nardini and miguez 2016 tang et al 2022 especially for urban river networks with the characteristic of low lying areas gentle bed slopes and stagnant water flow converting water potential energy into kinetic energy by precise water diversion measures in the river network area generates the desired temporal and spatial distribution of hydrodynamic forces this can decrease stagnant water environmental risk and improve urban water environment enormously horne et al 2016 4 3 application challenges and future work of iswera in stagnant water environmental management compared with the stagnant water environmental risk analysis method proposed in our previous research yu and zhang 2021 iswera adopted the process based hydrodynamic and water quality model to characterize the physical processes and complex interactions of risk indicators with rapid responses and easy accessibility by adjusting the order of the basic risk indicators according to their importance using the random forest model iswera could accurately and flexibly reflect the stagnant water environmental risk however the use of the random forest model is bound to increase the uncertainties of iswera schoppa et al 2020 wang et al 2021 departed findings indicated that the number of random model runs run will affect the results while it has no significant impact on results when run 4000 beck 1987 zheng and keller 2007 since the number of random trees to grow was adopted by 10 000 in our paper the uncertainties caused by the random forest model could be negligible furthermore the framework needs to select the risk indicators and determine the hierarchy and classification of these indicators by water environmental managers that means these decisions rely on the criteria and responsibility of the managers which may lead to different risk assessment results for different managers despite some inadequacies iswera still has wide application prospects by using iswera more types of risk indicators such as phytoplankton zooplankton and even bacterial community indicators in water systems and various process based hydraulic regulations and diversion measures could be considered to further establish a more complete evaluation system in our future work 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed a novel hydraulic potential dissipation hpd index as a unified and accessible metric to reflect the spatiotemporal stagnant water environmental risks of heterogeneous water diversion schemes quickly and intuitively taking the application of stagnant water environmental risk assessment for an urban river network along the yangtze river as an example an integrated stagnant water environmental risk analysis model iswera was constructed by coupling the process based model and stochastic process to assess stagnant water environmental risk under various water diversion measures and complex water environment index systems iswera was used to assess the temporal and spatial varying stagnant water environmental risk of 270 water diversion schemes formed by the combination of different water diversion measures to identify the optimized water diversion scheme the hpd index was proposed to reflect stagnant water environmental risk intuitively and rapidly it provided good evidence that hpd could not only be used to reflect urban stagnant water environmental risk more simply but indicate the feasibility and availability of any water diversion scheme under relatively complex hydrological conditions considering the quickening step of urbanization and inevitable stagnant environmental pollution hpd will be of great use and necessity in urban river networks in the future declaration of competing interest the

1802,rapid urbanization has led to water stagnation by temporal and spatial imbalances of the hydrodynamics in urban river networks which further entails environmental risks to drinking and recreational water supplies the establishment of a succinct hydraulic potential dissipation hpd index to indicate the spatiotemporal stagnant water environmental risks quickly and intuitively is of vital significance to urban river networks with complicated water regimes and diversified water diversion measures on this basis an integrated stagnant water environmental risk analysis model iswera was established by coupling the process based model and stochastic process to comprehensively and accurately assess risks which has been calibrated and validated against the real data of 11 monitoring stations from may 3 to may 11 in 2017 and november 28 to december 10 in 2020 respectively to represent the rationality of stagnant water environmental risks assessment using hpd iswera was used to evaluate the temporal and spatial varying stagnant water environmental risk intensity and probability of 270 water diversion schemes formed by the combination of water diversion duration flow route and potential in the changzhou urban river network along the yangtze river for time varying results it revealed that cumulative risk intensity was reduced by nearly 15 and risk probability was significantly reduced by nearly 50 with the increase of diversion duration to 5 days in general for spatial varying results most of the rivers reached the low risk grade under the optimized diversion duration flow route and potential while the rivers adjacent to densely populated areas still presented a moderate risk state the positive correlation was significant between hpd and stagnant water environmental risk intensity and probability results with r2 0 86 and 0 74 respectively when the hpd of upstream channels are below 63 4 74 1 and 57 7 and the downstream hpd of s1 to t1 s2 to t2 s2 to t3 and s3 to t4 are below 40 6 32 9 22 4 and 19 1 respectively the stagnant water environmental risk is lower arguably this study could provide a scientific reference and foundation for water environmental management of similar urban stagnant water systems keywords risk assessment water diversion urban river network stagnant water environment management water quality hydraulic potential dissipation data availability all data reported in this paper can be accessed in supporting information 1 introduction with the urbanization course proceeding the impact of human intervention on rivers is becoming more and more conspicuous exploitation and utilization of the rivers for urban benefits will greatly modify the course characteristics or flow and even bring some inadvertent negative effects sekharan et al 2022 puchol salort et al 2022 anthropogenic interventions disrupt the natural water flow resulting in river retardation and weakening that can form stagnant water further the stagnant water easily becomes black and odorous which could trigger a series of water environmental problems brandeler et al 2019 tang et al 2022 especially for urban river networks with temporal and spatial imbalances of the hydrodynamics because of flat terrain and low water potential many rivers in these areas have suffered excessive transformation industrial pollutants discharge and wastewater discharge ultimately resulting in the damaged water environment of stagnant water that imposes risks to drinking and recreational water supplies in urban areas neale and moffett 2016 aithani et al 2020 dalu et al 2020 therefore it is of essence to address stagnant water management to prevent and control water environmental risk in the urban river network traditional water diversion ideas typically include introducing clear and abundant water resources to dilute the contaminated water in order to improve the water environment berhanu and bisrat 2020 kirby et al 2014 tang et al 2022 one reasonable and effective measure to improve stagnant water environmental risks for urban river networks with a relatively complete water conservancy system involves allocating water resources optimally by regulating pump stations sluices and other small scale water infrastructure that combine different water diversion conditions that lead to suitable spatiotemporal hydrodynamics distribution fu et al 2022 several factors contribute to the improvement of the water environment following water diversion including diversion flow fornarelli and antenucci 2011 kraus et al 2011 morrison and stone 2015 diversion routes li et al 2013 liu et al 2014 diversion duration gibbins et al 2000 and diversion projects management hudak 2011 due to the complicated river network and diversified pump and sluice scheduling mode of urban areas it is necessary to explore a unified standard related to hydrodynamics to measure the improvement of stagnant water environmental risks by complex water diversion schemes under different combinations of water diversion conditions in urban river networks many studies have explored the impact of a water diversion project on the water environment mainly relying on long term historical data analysis without enough consideration of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes shah et al 2020 garcía gil et al 2022 zhang et al 2023 restricted by specific projects and monitoring data the consequences of different operations of water diversion measures for the water environment are neglected yang et al 2021 the process based model can overcome the above limitations by investigating multi factor stagnant water environmental risk for both temporal and spatial variations under different combinations of water diversion conditions by superimposing various physical processes morrison and stone 2014 assessment of stagnant water environmental risk often requires the analysis by synthesis of a large number of indicators zhang et al 2021 the water quality index wqi provides a scientific reference for evaluating the environmental status of water bodies by fully utilizing water quality parameters khouri and ai moufti 2022 lobato et al 2015 our previous studies have proved that copula could be used to conduct risk analysis for the water environment when faced with continuous and multiple environmental indicators yu and zhang 2021 besides that other models have been widely used in the assessment of the water environment which could provide a single number that expresses the total stagnant water environmental risk state chen et al 2012 zelenakova et al 2021 however particular variables may have multiple states and different weights which is difficult to be solved by the traditional static risk analysis method to address the uncertainty and randomness of stagnant water environmental risk the stochastic processes could be introduced to reduce subjectivity to improve the accuracy of process based models therefore it is worth studying how to assess stagnant water environmental risks by the integration of a process based model and stochastic process how to intuitively measure temporal and spatial varying stagnant water environmental risks with a unified hydrodynamic based standard is a central question of sustainable water environmental management in a stagnant urban river network yu and zhang 2021 therefore this study aims to propose a novel hydraulic potential dissipation hpd index as an accessible metric that reflects the state of stagnant water environmental risk for different combinations of water diversion conditions under the spatiotemporal variation of an urban river network the objectives are as follows 1 to construct a risk analysis model by combining a process based model and stochastic process to analyze temporal and spatial variations of stagnant water environmental risks under different water diversion schemes 2 to identify the optimized water diversion scheme in an urban river network area of the yangtze river 3 to propose an hpd index that reflects stagnant water environmental risk intuitively and rapidly in urban river networks with relatively complex hydrological conditions this study can not only be applied to the actual risk assessment of urban river networks but can also reflect the feasibility and availability of water diversion schemes by hpd which could provide a theoretical reference for environmental management decisions of similar stagnant water systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the changzhou river network located on the southern yangtze river delta plain has many characteristics that are common among urban river networks in china fig 1 the urban river network of changzhou has variegated and developed river systems comprising 113 rivers with a total length of approximately 285 km covering an area of 179 2 km2 the climate of the study area is relatively mild and humid the annual average temperature is 16 5 and the mean annual precipitation is about 1037 1164 mm where 50 60 of precipitation falls in summer for developed agriculture and industries and numerous people in changzhou the river network structure connectivity and water environment of changzhou city are significantly affected by human activities these rapid urbanization driven activities have led to silting drainage clogging black and odorous water due to stagnancy this has a notable negative influence on the water environment of the urban open channel networks in changzhou ai et al 2022 according to the i v classification standards recommended by the national surface water quality standard of china gb3838 2002 the water quality grade of changzhou city was mainly water quality standard iv grade the main pollutions in the study area are ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total phosphorus tp and permanganate index codmn to improve urban water environmental quality the government proposed a clean water diversion scheme in changzhou city including making use of the high quality water source of the yangtze river adopting the desheng river and zaogang river as clear water channels building four new movable overflow weirs and forming three stage water levels fig 1 2 2 the integrated stagnant water environmental risk analysis model iswera iswera is proposed for the accurate analysis of unordered unsteady and non equilibrium water environmental systems with multiple formative risk factors and superposing physical processes by synthesizing the process based hydrodynamics and water quality model and the catastrophe theory coupled with the random forest model ctrf iswera can be used to describe different operations of water diversion schemes and the complex interaction of risk indicators in addition iswera can be used to quantify the range in the uncertainty of stagnant water environmental risk more precisely and comprehensively fig 2 iswera simulates different water diversion schemes by first inputting geometric hydrological and water quality data into a 1 d process based hydrodynamic and water quality model the 1 d hydrodynamic model adopted st venant s unsteady flow equations of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum eqs 1 and 2 1 a t q x 0 2 q t v q x g a z x s f 0 where a represents the total flow area m2 q represents the discharge m3 s v represents the flow rate m s t is time s z is the elevation of the water surface above the datum line m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 s f is the friction slope the 1 d water quality model adopted the convection diffusion equation birkhoff et al 1990 eq 3 3 c t u c x e d 2 c x 2 s i where c represents the concentration of water quality variables mg l s i represents the source and sink of water quality variables mg l d e d is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient km2 d secondly ctrf was used to assess the risk of complex water environmental systems with uncertain internal functions the catastrophe theory was proposed to describe the qualitative change process of discontinuous changes constrained using a high order probability density function thom 1975 wagenmalers et al 2005 gao et al 2019 in this theory the potential function could describe the system behavior through state variables and control variables as the research object the evaluated dynamic system needs to be categorized into sub systems to solve complex problems and each sub system should have indicators composed of a number for the assessment kaur et al 2020 our paper involves only one dimensional state variables including the fold catastrophe model the cusp catastrophe model and the swallowtail catastrophe model thom 1975 the energy function eq 4 and normalization formula eq 5 of the fold catastrophe model are 4 v x fold 1 3 x 3 a x 5 x a a 1 2 the energy function eq 6 and normalization formula eq 7 of the cusp catastrophe model are 6 v x cusp 1 4 x 4 1 2 a x 2 b x 7 x a a 1 2 x b b 1 3 the energy function eq 8 and normalization formula eq 9 of the swallowtail catastrophe model are 8 v x swallowtail 1 5 x 5 1 3 a x 3 1 2 b x 2 c x 9 x a a 1 2 x b b 1 3 x c c 1 3 where x represents the energy function x is the state variable which will be the lowest value of a system i e x m i n x a x b x c a b and c are the control variables of a system considering traditional catastrophe theory typically requires sorting indexes by the researchers which greatly increases the uncertainty and instability of the model to reduce the above subjectivity random forests could be used to determine the index order instead of human operation in catastrophe theory random forests can be used to resort to the variables by calculating feature importance the steps in the random forest for indicator ranking involve i building n decision trees to generate out of bag sample data ii calculating the out of bag error of each decision tree iii adding random noise disturbance into training sample data iv recalculating the out of bag error of each tree formed by new samples breiman 2001 the importance of the indicator could be verified by the mean decreased accuracy value obtained from calculating its impact on the accuracy of the model 10 is σ e r r o r b 2 e r r o r b 1 n where is represents the importance of the indicator the bigger the value the higher the importance of the indicator e r r o b 1 and e r r o b 2 are the out of bag error before and after adding random noise disturbance respectively n is the number of decision trees 2 3 the calibration and verification of iswera stagnant water environmental risk is a statistical index and unavailable for measurement directly but could be quantified by comprehensively considering the risk intensity and risk probability based on the hydrological and water quality indicators therefore as the basic part composed of the measurable geometric hydrological and water quality data the process based hydrodynamic and water quality model is the dominant error source in iswera in this paper the 1 d process based hydrodynamic and water quality model was developed based on existing real data on the urban river network in changzhou fig s1 hourly water level monitor data from may 3 to may 11 in 2017 of 6 monitoring stations and daily water quality monitor data form may 4 to may 11 were used to calibrate iswera similarly every three hours of water level data of 3 monitoring stations and every two days of water quality data of 2 monitoring stations were used to validate the model calibration and validation details were shown in supplementary material s 1 for the water level calibration and verification results the average absolute errors mae and the root mean squares error rmse are both less than 8 cm the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is more than 0 75 and the relative error re is less than 3 tables s2 and s3 figs s2 and s4 for the water quality calibration and verification results the mae value and the rmse value are both less than 0 3 mg l the nse is more than 0 80 mostly and the re is less than 20 tables s2 and s3 figs s3 and s5 thus all of the above proves iswera is reliable 2 4 water environment risk grade hydrodynamic indicators flow velocity and water quality indicators codmn nh3 n and tp were quantitatively assessed to characterize the stagnant water environmental risk of the urban river network of changzhou for the hydrodynamic indicator five risk index levels of flow velocity can be determined according to the annual average flow velocity range in changzhou city for water quality indicators five risk index levels of codmn nh3 n and tp according to the i v classification standards recommended by gb3838 2002 the resulting stagnant water environmental risk index for each of the five risk index levels from the ctrf model is provided in table 1 the higher the stagnant water environmental risk index the higher the risk using grade iii as the risk limit namely when the risk index is higher than 15 68 it is assumed that the system of the urban river network in changzhou has stagnant water environmental risk to synthetically and comprehensively quantify the stagnant water environmental risk we consider two factors risk intensity r and risk probability p to define the stagnant water environmental risk grade r denotes the degree of risks which is represented by the stagnant water environmental risk index p represents the probability of generating risks in this paper the ratio of the number of sections where the stagnant water environmental risk index is greater than the risk limit and the total number of sections under each simulation scheme is regarded as stagnant water environmental risk probability eq 11 11 p g i i l g t where i represents the stagnant water environmental risk index i l represents stagnant water environmental risk limit namely 15 68 g i i l denotes the number of sections where the risk index is greater than the risk limit g t is the total number of all the sections based on the computational risk intensity and risk probability results a matrix of stagnant water environmental risk grades can be formed the water environment risk intensity of the urban river network in changzhou can be divided into four levels based on the risk index level risk probability is divided into five levels according to the preliminary calculation results of simulated diversion schemes by developing iswera in the study area the risk intensity value at each river section of each scheme and the risk probability of each scheme could be calculated according to the risk intensity and probability value the risk grade of the specific river could be identified by table 2 notably the average risk intensity of all sections on a river is considered the risk intensity of the river and it should lie in the range 0 100 then accumulating the values of all 101 river sections represents the risk intensity of a certain scheme theoretically it could reach 10 100 under extremely risky conditions 2 5 hydraulic potential dissipation hpd gentle terrain and flat bottom of the plain area lead to insufficient water mobility low environmental capacity and low self purification ability in urban river networks their weak hydrodynamic characteristics will result in serious and complex water related risks that occur in urban river networks tang et al 2022 therefore forming stage water levels through the construction of a series of flowing water projects will significantly increase river mobility and enhance hydrodynamics in the urban area the water level variations caused by diversion projects could be called hydraulic potential to assess the stagnant water environmental risk of diversion schemes from multiple perspectives hydraulic potential dissipation was proposed in this paper to describe the influence on hydraulic potential or water mobility of diversion schemes based on the above definition we constructed the formulas below 12 α h upstream h downstream l 13 δ i 1 n α β i α i α β i n where α is the hydraulic potential of a certain river reach h upstream and h downstream represent the water depth of the upstream section and the downstream section of the river reach m l represents the river reach length m δ denotes the hydraulic potential dissipation of a certain diversion scheme n is the number of total river reaches in the study area α i and α β i are the hydraulic potentials of a certain river reach in the evaluated diversion scheme and reference diversion scheme respectively higher hpd is more likely to indicate a greater stagnant water environmental risk of the diversion scheme 2 6 the formation of water diversion schemes based on current hydraulic engineering conditions various water diversion schemes could be formulated by composing different water diversion routes wr water diversion flow wq water diversion potential wp and water diversion duration wd wr represents water diversion lines formed by different pump opening and closing systems which include no pumping cailinggang pumping and dayunhe pumping wq represents the different combinations of water diversion volumes pumped by the desheng river and zaogang river wp represents different three stage water levels regulated by the four movable overflow weirs in the study area the three stage water levels denote the changzhou city entrance of the zaogang river the jinghang canal and the new jinghang canal respectively fig 1 wd represents the different duration of pumping the yangtze river into changzhou city on this basis 270 water diversion schemes could be formed by the combination of 3 wr conditions 4 wq conditions 6 wp conditions and 10 wd conditions described in table 3 it should be noted that only when water diversion flow adopts wq4 the movable overflow weirs could be adjusted due to limited water volume in wq1 wq2 and wq3 conditions the water diversion potential can only be wp0 depending on different wr conditions the diversion schemes could be divided into 3 scheme groups with each scheme group containing all 10 diversion duration conditions table s2 wrnsm was used to represent the name of the diversion scheme groups where n could be 1 2 and 3 representing the no pumping scheme group cailinggang pumping scheme group and dayunhe pumping scheme group and m could be 1 to 9 representing the combination of wq wp and wd conditions for example wr1s1 is the scheme group containing 10 schemes by combing wr1 wq1 wp0 and wd0 5 to wd5 respectively 3 results 3 1 time varying distribution of stagnant water environmental risk under different diversion schemes the time varying distributions of risk intensity and risk probability of all 270 diversion schemes are presented in fig 3 by contrasting the risk intensity and the risk probability of each scheme group under the same diversion duration we found that the risks of wrns1 wrns2 and wrns3 were significantly higher than those in other scheme groups it s primarily because the water diversion flow adopts the desheng river pump 30 m3 s and the zaogang river pump 40 m3 s to provide abundant flow volume to the urban river network in wrns4 to wrns9 which greatly reduces the stagnant water environmental risk of the study area additionally since the only difference between wrns2 and wrns3 is diversion flow condition and they both pump 60 m3 s total from the yangtze river the risk intensity and risk probability of the two schemes are similar the risk intensity and risk probability of wrns4 to wrns9 show a decreasing tendency which is caused by the increasing water diversion potential thus it can be seen ensuring adequate water diversion flow could greatly reduce the overall stagnant water environmental risks in the urban river network on this premise duly adjusting the water diversion potential could be adopted for further improvement by contrasting the risk intensity and the risk probability of wr1s wr2s and wr3s an apparent decline in stagnant water environmental risk of wr2s and wr3s could be found compared with that in wr1s the mean cumulative risk intensity of wr1s reached 1300 while that of wr2s and wr3s remain around 1100 the risk probability of wr1s is mostly between 0 5 and 0 6 and that of wr2s and wr3s were from 0 4 to 0 5 while the difference in risk is insignificant between wr2s and wr3s the improvement effect on stagnant water environmental risk of wr2s is slightly higher than that of wr3s the results indicate that the water diversion route that adopts wr3s namely dayunhe pumping could reach the best water environment improvement effect on the whole however for the options of the optimized water diversion scheme it is necessary to consider the spatial varying distribution results of the stagnant water environmental risks by comparing the risk intensity and the risk probability of each diversion duration under the same scheme group it indicates that both the risk intensity and the risk probability were significantly reduced with the increase of diversion duration in general temporally the risk intensity shows a trend of slightly increasing at first and then decreasing moreover the changes in risk intensity and risk probability area are barely measurable from the third day onward irrespective of the scheme group considering the cost saving requirement a 3 day diversion duration namely wd3 could be initially identified as the optimized water diversion duration condition 3 2 spatial varying distribution of stagnant water environmental risk under different diversion schemes to illustrate the influence of different diversion measures on stagnant water environmental risk and screen out the optimized water diversion measures we plotted the spatial varying risk grade distribution of the changzhou river network under different diversion measures fig 4 for ease of reference only the dominant water diversion condition was varied while the other conditions are consistent for the water diversion flow condition this paper takes the schemes wr1s1 wr1s2 wr1s3 and wr1s4 under the optimized diversion duration wd3 to form schemes fwq1 fwq2 fwq3 and fwq4 respectively when adopting fwq1 pumping 50 m3 s totally from the yangtze river results in low flow distributed to each river and gently flowing water causing a high risk state on the whole spatial scale for fwq2 and fwq3 although the pumping volume is the same and the cumulative risk intensity and risk probability are not very different fig 3 the spatial varying risk grade distribution is quite different it can be seen that when the pumping volume of the zaogang river is higher the risk grade of the zaogang river and shi river decreases from high risk to moderate risk it can also be seen that increasing the pumping volume of the zaogang river will be more effective when the total diversion flow is constant with the pumping volume of the zaogang river further increasing in fwq4 the risk grades of the lower river decrease therefore wq4 could be identified as the optimized water diversion flow condition for the water diversion route condition this paper takes the schemes wr1s4 wr2s4 and wr3s4 under the optimized diversion duration wd3 to form schemes swr1 swr2 and swr3 respectively relative to fwr1 the stagnant water environmental risk of fwr2 and fwr3 has been greatly reduced on the whole spatial scale while some high risk rivers remain in addition when adopting cailinggang pumping the shutdown of the dayunhe pump station makes the stagnant water environmental risk downstream of the jinghang river higher while when the cailinggang pump station stops working under dayunhe pumping conditions the stagnant water in the cailing river will lead to a higher risk of the river relatively the area that can be improved by dayunhe pumping is larger than that of cailinggang pumping which is more consistent with the drainage demand of changzhou city therefore dayunhe pumping namely wr3 could be regarded as the optimized water diversion route condition however in the specific application the diversion route should vary according to the drainage demand for the water diversion potential condition this paper takes the schemes wr3s4 to wr3s9 under the optimized diversion duration wd3 to form schemes twp0 to twp5 respectively it appears that the risk grade is significantly reduced with the rise of the water level of the zaogang river at the entrance of changzhou city and when the water level of the zaogang river s city entrance reached 3 95 m and 4 00 m no river across the study area reached high risk levels arguably it could be determined that the optimized water diversion potential is wp5 based on the above results this paper considered the scheme wr3s9 under the optimized diversion duration as the reference diversion scheme 3 3 the relationship between hpd and stagnant water environmental risks the cumulative risk intensity and risk probability of all diversion schemes were used to explore the relations between hpd and stagnant water environmental risk by adopting the nonlinear approach fig 5 the coefficient of determination r2 was used to describe the intensity of the relationship between two variables when the r squared is more than 0 6 it could be considered a strong relationship generally the non linear regression results showed that the hpd results are consistent with the changing trend of both the cumulative risk intensity and the risk probability and positive correlation was significant for them with r2 0 86 and 0 74 respectively the established relationship predictions for hpd and risk intensity and probability denote that it could be feasible to make a rough estimate of stagnant water environmental risks by determining the hpd value as a whole the hpd of the no pumping scheme is higher than that of cailinggang pumping and dayunhe pumping specifically the hpd values of no pumping schemes remain from 40 0 to 80 0 and that of cailinggang pumping and dayunhe pumping schemes are mostly lower than 55 0 meanwhile the hpd of dayunhe pumping is slightly lower than cailinggang pumping the trend is in accordance with the stagnant water environmental risk trend fig 3 the range of hpd can be evaluated to roughly estimate the risk grade of a specific river under a diversion scheme for the main longitudinal rivers among three stage water levels hpd under different stagnant water environmental risk grades were approximated according to the results of 270 diversion schemes fig 6 taking the river from f1 to s1 namely the desheng river as an example it could be considered the low risk grade moderate risk grade and high risk grade when the hpd value is between about 0 to 49 8 49 8 63 4 and 63 4 83 7 respectively besides it is noticeable that the upstream rivers between the first stage water level and the second stage water level have a relatively lower risk than the downstream rivers between the second stage water level and the third stage water level especially for the downstream rivers from s2 to t2 s2 to t3 and s3 to t4 there is even no low risk range owing to the limited improvement of the existing water diversion measures this further illustrates that more diversion measures such as gates pump stations and weirs need to be considered for development in these rivers in future water diversion projects 4 discussion 4 1 analysis and suggestions for improvement of water diversion measures on stagnant water environmental risk diversion duration flow route and potential are key hydraulic regulation measures that could promote water flow improve water quality and mitigate stagnant water environmental risk through reasonable and scientific methods li et al 2013 gu et al 2017 xiao et al 2021 this study quantified the improvement in stagnant water environmental risk of the changzhou river network under different combinations of these water diversion measures the time varying stagnant water environmental risk distribution results denote that the risk intensity and probability show a trend of slightly increasing at first then decreasing and tending towards stability from the third day fig 3 the reason for this phenomenon is that a high concentration of pollutants in the upper reaches scoured the urban river network after the implementation of diversion measures which increased the concentration of pollutants in the study area however as diversion duration increases the negative effect of pollutants brought from upstream will be gradually offset and then the pollutant concentration drops until steady that could be called pollutant concentration rebound the spatial varying stagnant water environmental risk distribution results show that a part of the river course in the urban river network still represents considerable risks although the most optimized water diversion measures are adopted fig 4 the major cause of these risks lies in that these rivers are adjacent to densely populated areas and accept a large number of domestic and industrial wastewater and other pollutants causing relative low flow velocity and high initial concertation of water quality indicators of these rivers bu et al 2022 furthermore most of these rivers with relative risk are medium and small rivers the narrow shallow trench made in poor river flow which leads to high stagnant water environmental risk kumar et al 2013 in specific applications some targeted hydraulic regulations should be taken to reduce the stagnant water environmental risks of designated rivers 4 2 mechanism and feasibility of using hpd to reflect urban stagnant water environmental risk the proposed parameter hpd could be regarded as the key indicator to reflect urban stagnant water environmental risk and be used to indicate the feasibility and availability of any water diversion scheme under relatively complex hydrological conditions our results showed that hpd had a good performance in reflecting stagnant water environmental risks fig 5 the stagnant water environmental risk still existed when hpd reached 0 it could be seen that the cumulative risk intensity and risk probability were respectively around 950 and 0 42 when hpd was 0 namely the intercept of the longitudinal axis actually according to our definition of hpd the intercepts denote the risk intensity and risk probability of the reference diversion scheme in this paper it represents the stagnant water environmental risks of the scheme wr3s9 under the 3 day diversion duration therefore it s validated to be viable to evaluate water diversion schemes by hpd by the rough scope of hpd under different risk grades it will be more intuitive and rapid to obtain the risk grade only using the water level data of the diversion scheme to substitute the complex risk analysis method fig 6 for example when implementing any water diversion scheme we just need to adjust the upstream hpd between first stage and second stage water level of the main channels namely f1 to s1 f2 to s2 and f3 to s3 keep below 63 4 74 1 and 57 7 and the downstream hpd between second stage and third stage water level of the main channels namely s1 to t1 s2 tot2 s2 tot3 and s3 to t4 keep below 40 6 32 9 22 4 and 19 1 to ensure the water environmental security the previous research revealed that increasing the hydraulic potential by using sluices pumping stations overflow weirs and other artificial structures will result in the fast passage of diversion water discharge reducing the diversion water retention time in low lying areas and enhancing diversion water flow velocity burian and edwards 2002 nardini and miguez 2016 tang et al 2022 especially for urban river networks with the characteristic of low lying areas gentle bed slopes and stagnant water flow converting water potential energy into kinetic energy by precise water diversion measures in the river network area generates the desired temporal and spatial distribution of hydrodynamic forces this can decrease stagnant water environmental risk and improve urban water environment enormously horne et al 2016 4 3 application challenges and future work of iswera in stagnant water environmental management compared with the stagnant water environmental risk analysis method proposed in our previous research yu and zhang 2021 iswera adopted the process based hydrodynamic and water quality model to characterize the physical processes and complex interactions of risk indicators with rapid responses and easy accessibility by adjusting the order of the basic risk indicators according to their importance using the random forest model iswera could accurately and flexibly reflect the stagnant water environmental risk however the use of the random forest model is bound to increase the uncertainties of iswera schoppa et al 2020 wang et al 2021 departed findings indicated that the number of random model runs run will affect the results while it has no significant impact on results when run 4000 beck 1987 zheng and keller 2007 since the number of random trees to grow was adopted by 10 000 in our paper the uncertainties caused by the random forest model could be negligible furthermore the framework needs to select the risk indicators and determine the hierarchy and classification of these indicators by water environmental managers that means these decisions rely on the criteria and responsibility of the managers which may lead to different risk assessment results for different managers despite some inadequacies iswera still has wide application prospects by using iswera more types of risk indicators such as phytoplankton zooplankton and even bacterial community indicators in water systems and various process based hydraulic regulations and diversion measures could be considered to further establish a more complete evaluation system in our future work 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed a novel hydraulic potential dissipation hpd index as a unified and accessible metric to reflect the spatiotemporal stagnant water environmental risks of heterogeneous water diversion schemes quickly and intuitively taking the application of stagnant water environmental risk assessment for an urban river network along the yangtze river as an example an integrated stagnant water environmental risk analysis model iswera was constructed by coupling the process based model and stochastic process to assess stagnant water environmental risk under various water diversion measures and complex water environment index systems iswera was used to assess the temporal and spatial varying stagnant water environmental risk of 270 water diversion schemes formed by the combination of different water diversion measures to identify the optimized water diversion scheme the hpd index was proposed to reflect stagnant water environmental risk intuitively and rapidly it provided good evidence that hpd could not only be used to reflect urban stagnant water environmental risk more simply but indicate the feasibility and availability of any water diversion scheme under relatively complex hydrological conditions considering the quickening step of urbanization and inevitable stagnant environmental pollution hpd will be of great use and necessity in urban river networks in the future declaration of competing interest the

1803,urbanization coupled with climate change is expected to put pressure on the urban stormwater network to predict and mitigate the effects of these trends accurate modeling of urban stormwater changes is required at scales and resolutions meaningful to stormwater management although numerous studies have analyzed the effect of climate change on urban flooding risk using the event based approach none have incorporated the continuous modelling approach to investigate the whole spectrum of changes in an urban catchment this study analyzes seasonal changes in future urban hydrological behavior using a mini ensemble of six state of the art climate model projections and a calibrated hydrological hydraulic storm water management model swmm the modelling results show future changes in seasonal and monthly hydrological behavior the notable winter warming is the major driver in the future snow processes resulting in considerably less snow days and an increase in the flow events frequency during the winter months the modelling results also suggest an increase in the annual maximum hourly flow in all seasons with the clearest trend modelled in winter monthly average runoff during the cold period is modelled to increase while no clear trends are detected for the rest of the year there is a clear added benefit in using convection permitting regional climate models throughout the year overall the climate change mitigation and adaption strategies in urban catchments should focus more on the whole spectrum of changes rather than only on urban pluvial flooding risk these findings call for a transition from traditional to a more advanced stormwater management keywords climate change impact rcm urban flooding finland nordic conditions data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction there is an overwhelming body of evidence on global climate change based on analyzing measured climatic data alexander et al 2006 easterling et al 2017 among the climate variables the increase of average global temperature has been the center of attention this is especially true with the notable increasing rate of warming in recent decades in fact the whole hydrological cycle is changing which in turn alternates the frequency and magnitude of floods kundzewicz et al 2014 droughts grillakis 2019 water scarcity gosling and arnell 2016 and water resource management in general estrela et al 2012 tamm et al 2018 as the future projections show the continuation of this phenomena ipcc 2014 climate change is probably the greatest challenge for humanity during the 21st century urban catchments are highly vulnerable to changing climatic conditions due to their fast rainfall runoff response time high impervious surface area and traditional stormwater management with limited storage capacity as the urbanization degree in europe is projected to increase from 73 melchiorri et al 2018 to approximately 84 in 2050 un 2019 this will further exacerbate the urban stormwater vulnerability to changes in rainfall intensities and frequencies sillanpää and koivusalo 2015 urban densification also concerns already developed areas where reconstruction plans aim to form more efficient urban fabric with efficient mobility and reduced energy consumption from the urban environmental point of view densification causes stress to water systems including stormwater management and urban streams e g kaur et al 2022 the designs often do not consider the impacts of climate change which will alter the dimensioning and lead to increasing risks on infrastructures there are some exceptions from scandinavia arnbjerg nielsen 2012 olsson et al 2009 tamm et al 2023 and north america denault et al 2006 waters et al 2003 where climate factors have been introduced in the designs quantification of the climate change effect on stormwater systems is complex due to the uncertainties inherent in climate models giorgi and gutowski 2015 urban water managers need tools to address the role of changing conditions in the densification planning phases various climate change impact studies have been carried out in urban catchments berggren et al 2014 järvi et al 2017 jato espino et al 2019 kourtis et al 2021 le floch et al 2022 semadeni davies et al 2008 these mostly focus on flooding risk analysis berggren et al 2014 jato espino et al 2019 semadeni davies et al 2008 and possible adaptation and mitigation techniques kourtis et al 2021 le floch et al 2022 using mathematical models like dhi mouse and swmm to simulate future flow in an urban catchment although swmm has the capacity for single event and continuous flow simulation rossman 2010 event based modelling is typically used for climate change impact analysis for this the theoretical design storm concept is used which is the basis of designing urban drainage systems to account for the climate change effect design storm depths are modified to correspond to future conditions by multiplying the design storm depth with climate factors hernes et al 2020 which are derived from either global or regional climate models gcms and rcms respectively to date the event based approach is used in climate change impact analysis due to the lack of reliable high resolution climate simulations while spatially coarse climate models with a temporal resolution of 1 day can be sufficient for describing processes in larger catchments such a scale fails to capture spatio temporal variability of rainfall runoff processes in urban catchments where the response time is from minutes to hours even though rcms have gone through significant improvements in the last decade the ability of these rcms to adequately represent short duration precipitation extremes has still remained a concern vergara temprado et al 2020 this gap hinders the scientific understanding of the future changes in urban hydrology and increases the uncertainty involved in urban flooding risk assessment the recent development of convection permitting regional climate models cprcms mostly based on numerical weather prediction nwp models are showing a promising performance to fill this cap ban et al 2020 lucas picher et al 2021 médus et al 2022 showed how cprcms clearly improve the simulation of heavy and extreme precipitation on a sub daily scale over the nordic region as the cprcms with explicitly resolved deep convection require considerably more computer capacity their added benefit over rcms with a coarser deep convection parameterization can be questioned in practical applications the current study investigates the added benefits of adopting cprcms over simpler rcms when assessing all year urban hydrological regime with the swmm model the main objective of this research is to analyze changes in the urban catchment using an ensemble of state of the art tailor made rcm produced meteorological variables as input to the swmm model in snow affected conditions additionally the added value of using high resolution cprcms is examined and discussed using swmm to the knowledge of the authors this is one of the first attempts to model interannual long term changes in an urban catchment using swmm coupled with the new generation rcms in northern europe this gives new insights to the understanding of seasonal trends in extreme flow frequency and magnitude as well as to the overall interannual changes in water cycle processes in an urban catchment with snow during the winter months this in turn gives a more detailed input to practitioners for more advanced stormwater management to mitigate urban flooding while mimicking natural water cycle in urban areas finally the current study explores whether the use of cprcms could start the transition from event based climate change impact analysis to continuous urban catchment modelling 2 methods 2 1 study catchment the study is conducted in vallikallio vk urban catchment which is a typical medium density residential area in espoo southern finland fig 1 the total area of the catchment is roughly 11 ha of which the pervious area 47 is mostly vegetation and non vegetated open sand gravel area the impervious area 53 land cover consists of 3 4 story apartment houses 36 walkways 26 parking areas 26 and asphalted roads 11 the dominant soil type is sandy till with a relatively low hydraulic conductivity 4 2 mm h surface runoff is directed to a storm sewer network which is mostly located under the roads a more detailed description of the study catchment characteristics can be found in sillanpää 2013 the climate in vk belongs to dfb warm summer humid continental type which is influenced by the proximity of the baltic sea with large temperature differences the four seasons can be clearly distinguished fig 2 the coldest month is february with an average temperature of 4 4 c with a high variability from 14 0 c to 1 4 c the warmest month is july with the mean of 18 0 c and a much narrower variability from 14 7 to 22 0 c the average annual precipitation depth in the region is 650 mm out of which 20 is snowfall the highest precipitation amounts are typically observed in august whereas april experiences the lowest amounts as point precipitation gages tend to underestimate the ground true precipitation due to various reasons aerodynamical effects gage wetting blowing drifting of snow the dynamic correction model førland et al 1996 developed for the nordic area was used to reduce this bias 2 2 climate models the regional climate model harmonie climate hclim e g médus et al 2022 olsson et al 2021 is driven by two different gcms ec earth ece and gfdl the climate change outputs from the two gcms differ considerably from each other in the nordic area the ec earth gcm is a modelling effort by a consortium of european research institutes to study global climate change this study uses the irish centre for high end computing simulations of the ec earth the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory climate gfdl model version 3 cm3 has been developed by the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the following two model setups of hclim are used 1 a 12 km resolution hclim12 aladin rcm al which uses parameterized convection and 2 a cprcm with a grid spacing of 3 km hclim3 arome ar with an emphasis on deep convection lind et al 2022 the climate projections consist of three 20 year periods the historical reference period 1986 2005 mid future 2041 2060 and far future 2081 2100 the climate models are forced by two representative concentration pathways rcp the stabilizing rcp4 5 45 and pessimistic rcp8 5 85 scenario the mini ensemble of future climate projections used in this study are listed in table 1 the meteorological input parameters extracted from the rcm s output include hourly series of air temperature near surface and precipitation the series were retrieved from the grid cell which coincided with the location of the discharge outlet of the vallikallio study catchment the comparison of the raw climate projections and observed monthly mean climate variables are shown in fig 3 2 3 bias correction when climate model results from the rcm computation grid s are compared against local point observations of near surface meteorological variables a disagreement between climate model series and observations is quite common such discrepancy often requires a correction of the bias prior to using the climate model results in hydrological modelling various bias correction concepts have been developed over time such as statistical downscaling histogram equalizing and quantile mapping qm piani et al 2010 attention was paid to choosing an appropriate bias correction technique as some methods in fact can even worsen the accuracy of climate models enayati et al 2021 among the various bias correction approaches qm techniques are one of the most widely used bias correction methods to adjust the raw rcm outputs jakob themeßl et al 2011 lafon et al 2013 out of the qm methods family this study used the empirical quantile mapping eqm method due to its already proven ability in correcting temperature and precipitation biases enayati et al 2021 the eqm correction procedure of climate variables in this study involved several steps first measurements from the closest meteorological station to the study catchment were compared against the hindcasted climate simulations from the nearest grid point to that meteorological station the closest meteorological station is the kaisaniemi kn station operated by the finnish meteorological institute fmi kn is located roughly 9 km south east from the vk study catchment daily maximum minimum average temperature and precipitation values are available from the kn station the correction of daily average temperature is preferred over minimum and maximum temperature because the use of quantile mapping methodology could introduce unrealistic values e g daily minimum is higher than daily maximum the obtained corrections derived from the bias correction were then applied to the hourly temperature output of the climate models the eqm method was also employed for correcting precipitation bias as no hourly precipitation measurements are available in the nearby stations for the hindcasted period daily precipitation sums from kn were used as a reference for correcting precipitation bias the obtained daily corrections are then applied to scale hourly climate simulation values in the vk catchment the bias corrected climate model outputs are used as an input to the swmm model 2 4 swmm model the swmm model was first developed in 1971 strictly as a design model oriented in single storm events and short simulation periods since then it has undergone continuous updates over the years nowadays it has been developed into a dynamic rainfall runoff routing simulation model that is capable of modelling water quantity as well as quality for both event based and long term simulations rossman 2010 swmm consists of several process models swmm allows to determine the computation time step for different conditions which affects the simulation time numerical stability and simulation results the dry weather time step is used when there is no rainfall and ponded water in the catchment a dry weather time step of 1 h was found to be suitable in terms of simulation time and model accuracy a high wet weather time step of 5 min was chosen to achieve a better model description of runoff processes in swmm the routing time step of 5 s was used in computing flow through the drainage network to assure the numerical stability of the swmm model among the flow routing options dynamic wave routing was used to calculate the stormwater hydraulics the modified horton was used to calculate infiltration the model parameterization for the vallikallio catchment is adopted from tuomela et al 2019 and embeds a discretization of the study catchment into 8 surfaces having homogeneous surface properties for example roofs parking plots walkways and road segments and isolated green areas were modeled as separate subcatchments draining either to a neighboring subcatchment or to the underground stormwater network the model was refined by koivusalo et al 2022 who calibrated it against snow and discharge measurements available from sillanpää 2013 the snow model was activated to produce a simulation of snow accumulation ploughing and snowmelt in all subcatchments the snow module s initial values were derived from relevant literature rossman and huber 2015 the division of precipitation between snow and rain was based on the temperature value of 1 c the ploughing process was triggered in roads walkways and parking lots this study assumed a snow ploughing threshold of 50 mm as a snow depth moghadas et al 2018 a fixed snow density of 125 kg m3 relatively fresh snow was used for the conversion to snow water equivalent swe resulting in a ploughing swe threshold of 6 25 mm this study took the continuous modelling approach to investigate climate change impact on an urban stormwater catchment the use of continuous modelling with swmm allows to analyze changes in runoff event frequencies in the future current study used the outflow from the system for event definition basis an event separation time of 3 hours was used which corresponds to the typical minimum inter event time for defining a rainfall event dunkerley 2008 secondly an event threshold volume of 114 000 l was set which corresponds to a precipitation event of 1 mm finally if the mean system outflow of an event exceeds 1 l s then it was considered in the event analysis a model warm up period of 9 months was used to reach realistic soil moisture conditions before model results start to be reported reporting was set to start from the beginning of the water year 1 october it should be noted that an event was here defined based on catchment outflow instead of precipitation and it was triggered by both rainfall and snowmelt depending on the seasonal weather 3 results 3 1 future climate projections the comparison between bias corrected historical and future climate projections already indicate notable changes for the mid future period fig 4 the mean annual temperature anomaly is 1 7 2 3 c for the ece emissions scenario rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the gfdl driven climate projections indicate even larger increase of 4 1 c thus projecting a considerable change in the mid future air temperatures as expected no anomalies were detected in air temperature between the deep convection permitting ar and parameterized convection regional climate model al fig 4 a there is no notable difference between ar and al in annual precipitation fig 4 b in general a modest annual increase is projected by the ece driven mini ensemble members from 4 up to 10 by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively similarly to mean temperature anomaly the gfdl driven climate models tend to show a larger change with a projected increase of precipitation approximately 35 the air temperature warming is continuing to the far future period fig 4 c the rcp 4 5 driven by the ece gcm is showing an increase of 2 3 c by the end of the century compared to the baseline period the more pessimistic rcp 8 5 shows quite a dramatical increase by the end of century with values of 4 8 and 6 8 c by ece and gfdl respectively the ar and al show no notable differences in monthly precipitation anomalies for the ece gcm fig 4 c and d some discrepancy can be seen in the gfdl gcm with higher precipitation values from october to january all the mini ensemble models indicate predominantly increases in monthly precipitation and the largest increases are projected in the autumn october november and winter january february moderate increases in precipitation are also projected for summer the pessimistic rcp8 5 series showed the most striking monthly precipitation anomalies for the far future to occur during the period from october to january fig 4 d 3 2 simulated changes in flow statistics changes in meteorological conditions alter the urban catchment hydrological and hydraulic behavior modelled monthly average runoff anomaly for the future periods shows large variations between months and climate models fig 5 the rcp8 5 rcms driven by the gfdl gcm reveal a considerably higher average annual flow of 0 5 l s by the end of the century compared to the rcp8 5 rcms driven by ece gcm 0 2 l s interestingly the simulated monthly anomaly is mostly non negative for average flow with the gfdl gcm the clearest change in the future average runoff is shown in the winter months where all the simulations from the mini ensemble show an average increase of approximately 0 4 l s and 0 6 l s for the mid future and far future respectively fig 5 an overall increasing trend is evident from october to february the average runoff during the first half of spring march and april is expected to decrease whereas a slight increase can be expected in may the climate change signal in summer months is inconsistent especially for the mid future period where the change magnitude is mostly negligible and direction incoherent gfdl ar with pessimistic rcp8 5 shows future increases in august which signal deviates from the results of other models simulations suggest an increase in average flow for the autumn months the colder the month the higher the increase interestingly no clear signal can be seen between the parameterized and deep convection permitting rcm overall the average runoff is expected to increase most in colder months october february whereas the change extent is less pronounced in warm months also it should be noted that the change signal is inconsistent during the warm period 3 3 simulated changes in extreme flow changes in extreme flows due to climate change are of great importance as they are directly linked to urban pluvial flooding risk fig 6 summarizes the annual non exceedance probabilities of maximum hourly mean flows for different seasons and for historical and future periods visual inspection of historical probability curves reveals clearly lower maximum flows in winter fig 6a compared to other seasons in the future scenarios the winter flows are most consistently increasing but the maximum values still remain lower than the other seasons summer maximum flows show the highest differences between the future scenarios fig 6c three out of six scenarios which are for the pessimistic rcp8 5 show shifts of increasing maximum flows additionally statistical analysis was performed to investigate if these changes are significant p 0 05 for this the nonparametric mood s median test mood 1950 was used to analyze the statistical significance of changes on annual maxima extreme flows the mood s median test compares the median values of samples and their significance the results of the mood s median test can be seen in table 2 there are occasional significant changes in the mid future seasons except no changes in spring the differences in maximum flows become stronger for the far future period when significant shifts in autumn and winter flows are the most common in fact the mini ensemble member results suggest significant increas e at a 90 confidence level in the autumn the average seasonal differences suggest an overall significant increase of maximum flows for the rcp8 5 far future seasons while using rcp4 5 the average trend in maximum flows is insignificant in spring and summer 3 4 climate change impact on snow characteristics the study region is located at the edge of the seasonal snow cover where the region typically has snowfall and an established snow cover in winter even though the winter season is characterized by intermittent accumulation melt cycles fig 7 demonstrates the initiation of snow cover by the historical climate model scenarios in october november and the mean snow cover is melted in may at the latest the modelled late tail in snow cover is computationally caused by the melting of the ploughed snow whereas undisturbed snow cover disappears earlier the increasing temperature in mid and far future periods during the winter months indicate a substantial reduction of mean snow depth in the study catchment this decrease of swe is partly compensated by the projected increase in precipitation during the winter months the notable winter warming is the major driver in the future snow processes resulting in considerably smaller swe values in the study catchment the rcp 8 5 scenarios suggest that mean swe goes close to zero in the far future period depending on the period and climate projection used for modelling there still are some differences between climate models the decrease in the mean swe is accompanied with a later accumulation in autumn and an earlier disappearance of snow in spring while the mean swe for the future presents a clear decline in ground snow it does not allow assessing the snow variability table 3 summarizes the evolution of the main driver of snow accumulation i e annual snowfall and its variability for the different periods the average snowfall precipitation ratio s p for the historical period is consistent in a narrow range 0 21 0 25 the average s p ratio in the future periods is strongly decreasing for all scenarios with larger decreases than the variability in the historical values a striking result is the difference in maximum s p ratios between the projections this reveals the uncertainty related to the occurrence of high snowfall accumulations in the future the exceedance probability curves of the annual maximum swe in fig 8 demonstrate the high variability of future scenarios for the mid future period while snow will not completely disappear from the urban area in the winter the irregularity of snowy winters is increasing since winter is part of the dormancy period when potential evaporation is reduced and the largest volumes of runoff are generated strong shifts in the snow conditions and variability are directly reflected to storm runoff dynamics 3 5 flow event statistics changes in precipitation patterns and snow dynamics indicate changes in the frequency and magnitude of flow events seasonal event analysis is carried out with the swmm event tool package to investigate how climate change impacts runoff generation in the urban catchment fig 9 shows the flow event occurrence according to climate projection and season the event count reveals a clear shift in the winter season where all the climate models show an overall increase in the number of winter flow events the change magnitude depends on the climate model analyzed with an average increase of 5 to 15 events by the end of the century while the number of winter flow events in the historical period is the smallest among the seasons the number of winter events in the far future period is most often the highest for the pessimistic rcp8 5 a similar tendency is evident during the autumn season however the change is not as pronounced as during winter months except for the autumn results of gfdl interestingly for both seasons the increase is continuous i e the number of flow events is higher in the far future compared to mid future although considerably less snowpack is left for melt during the spring months in the future fig 7 the number of events indicate no clear tendency changes in the number of summer events is inconclusive change direction and magnitude is dependent on the climate model employed it is interesting to note the concordance between ar and al both agree in the direction and magnitude of changes in the winter season as expected the convective permitting capability of the ar increases the average number of flow events in the summer compared to al where events are longer and with a lower event intensity due to its known limitation in generating high intensity short duration events 4 discussion densely populated urban areas are highly vulnerable to changes in climate and land cover the focus on urban climate change impact studies mostly lies on flooding risk assessment since it is a major source of threat to human life and property dong et al 2022 while this is crucial from the climate adaptation aspect it is equally important to understand the whole spectrum of changes for climate resilience strategy however the projected overall temperature increase accompanied by changing variability in precipitation makes the understanding of climate change impact in an urban mosaic a challenging task the robustness of the results is hindered with some limitations in the study the uncertainties related to choosing a bias correction methodology are widely acknowledged in climate change impact studies piani et al 2010 the recent availability of hourly climate series introduces a new paradigm to the bias correction concept the lack of high quality measurements to correct the climate series against while this is not an issue when correcting near surface air temperature values it becomes a concern when precipitation is corrected this raises the research question about the temporal mismatch between climate models and on ground measurements lind et al 2020 the use of a mini ensemble adds additional uncertainty to the results as a larger ensemble size would be less susceptible to random fluctuations and the law of small numbers benestad et al 2017 thus increasing the ensemble member size would aid to see the whole spectrum of changes nevertheless the addition of cprcm hclim3 to the mini ensemble should potentially improve the representation of the future climate on a small urban scale the study verifies this assumption in the summertime where the high intensity rainfall events caused notably higher annual maximum hourly flow values with hclim3 fig 6 this result is in line with previous research where hclim3 was found to strongly improve the representation of higher intensity events compared to hclim12 in sweden olsson et al 2021 remarkably hclim3 was even able to simulate an extreme rainfall event similar to the magnitude of malmö 2014 event in the same region which caused substantial pluvial flood damage mobini et al 2021 according to this study there is a clear tendency towards higher maximum flows in all seasons except spring the finding is consistent with other climate impact studies in fennoscandia nie et al 2009 pang et al 2022 semadeni davies et al 2008 however this study addressed the maximum flows at an hourly time step at the catchment outlet which sets the focus on the seasonal maximum flow dynamics rather than on the hydraulic performance future work is needed to explore how intensification of rainfall extremes due to the climate change affects stormwater system peak flow dynamics pipe network surcharge and manhole flooding lind and others 2020 studied the benefits and added value of cprcm over fenno scandinavia the cprcm was found to represent less drizzle events frequent precipitation events with low intensities which is a persistent problem in many climate models koutroulis et al 2016 mehran et al 2014 contrary to the expectations the seasonal event analysis in this study reveals an opposite effect fig 9 using the convection permitting model as an input to swmm produced more events than the climate model with parameterized convection this difference is probably due to the event definition where the minimum mean outflow and intensity criteria discarded the drizzle events interestingly the simulated average monthly swe fig 8 for the historical period is notably higher and more realistic with the hclim3 compared to the coarser hclim12 this finding agrees with earlier study by lind and others 2020 who also showed that cprcms provide added value even for winter precipitation at the edge of the seasonal snow cover influenced by the maritime climate snow cover is highly sensitive to increasing temperature callaghan et al 2011 this is confirmed in a study by luomaranta et al 2019 where similarly to this study a decreasing snow depth trend in southern finland was found the increasing mixed and liquid precipitation and rising temperature were found to be the main drivers of these changes according to results in this study a decrease in snowfall to total precipitation s p ratio was also evident thus the decreasing trend in snow depth luomaranta et al 2019 and s p ratio irannezhad et al 2017 is expected to continue in the future this is further confirmed by the increase of simulated events in winter regardless of the analyzed climate projection also the substantial increase in monthly average runoff during winter months fig 6 supports that the projected increases are largest and most consistent during winter the increasing average runoff and number of flow events indicates an increasing hydraulic load to the existing stormwater drainage network it is obvious from the above discussion that climate change affects the urban flow regime all year round this calls for a holistic stormwater management approach to regard the whole spectrum of changes low impact development lid stormwater solutions have proven to have a positive impact on urban water balance by reducing the runoff volume and flooding khadka et al 2020 therefore it can be a useful technique in adaption to climate change by maintaining the current urban water cycle khadka et al 2020 among the lid controls green roofs and permeable pavements are the most widely researched abdalla et al 2021 parnas et al 2021 since they directly replace impermeable surfaces however their performance in reducing runoff and peak flow is most pronounced during warmer conditions and their performance in wintertime conditions remains limited mantilla et al 2023 other types of green infrastructure such as rain gardens also referred to as bioretention cells can be adapted to the colder conditions by diversifying the plant species fowdar et al 2021 and maintaining the suitable soil characteristics to ensure efficient hydraulic capacity for infiltration mantilla et al 2023 paus et al 2016 in addition to runoff quantity control treatment of stormwater to improve water quality has an important role when constructing lid solutions pollutant removal efficiency of various designs can vary between mild and cold seasons in the nordic latitudes thus warming temperatures are expected to have an influence on the urban runoff water quality and lid solutions performance according to previous studies sediment and sediment bound phosphorus are removed also in lower temperatures in biofilters but nitrogen treatment drops notably with a decreasing temperature blecken et al 2010 ekka et al 2021 fowdar et al 2022 nayeb yazdi et al 2021 changes in stormwater quantity are reflected in pollutant loads from urban areas and therefore increase the complexity of stormwater management under changing climate the optimal selection and placement of lid controls requires using optimization algorithms eckart et al 2018 liu et al 2016 instead of optimizing the stormwater network against hydraulic performance and cost an integrated sustainability assessment including the evaluation of water quality benefits and ecosystem services should be carried out thus future work should couple reliable high quality climate projections with hydrological hydraulic tools like swmm to quantify the all year climate change effect on an urban catchment this in turn enables to carry out optimization of lid controls to understand to what extent the lid controls can mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the water cycle and contribute towards the un sustainable development goals 5 conclusions this study assessed the year round climate change impacts in an urban stormwater catchment in finland based on simulations carried out with the stormwater model swmm driven by a mini ensemble of climate projections the ensemble includes high resolution convection permitting regional climate projections and a coarser rcm with parameterized convection the climate models are forced by the stabilizing rcp4 5 and pessimistic scenario rcp8 5 therefore the simulations can serve as a reference of the expected changes in an urban catchment with snow processes and thus help decision makers to plan for mitigation and adaptation measures ahead of time the climate change signal in cold periods is consistent the colder the month the higher the increase in average surface runoff the study also indicates that annual maximum flow will increase in all seasons from which winter and autumn showed a statistically significant change for the end of the century the advantage of using convective permitting models over parameterized ones is clear they result higher and more realistic annual maximum flow values this is even true for the winter period where the representation of the snow conditions was closer to reality using the convective permitting climate outputs as input to swmm warming winters indicate a substantial reduction of mean snow depth and maximum annal swe in the study catchment according to the rcp 8 5 scenarios mean swe goes close to zero in the far future period this is confirmed by the strong decrease in s p ratio during the future periods for all scenarios thus the water balance of the southern finland urban catchment will alter remarkably due to the projected climate change this in turn will make stormwater management more challenging in the future results of this study clearly present the need for a holistic stormwater management approach the climate change mitigation and adaption strategies in urban catchments should focus more on the whole spectrum of changes rather than only urban pluvial flooding risk this study used a mini ensemble of climate projections to investigate future climate change impact further study can be conducted with a larger ensemble for understanding the range of climate change impacts on an urban catchment the future study could be extended by the evaluation of the optimal selection

1803,urbanization coupled with climate change is expected to put pressure on the urban stormwater network to predict and mitigate the effects of these trends accurate modeling of urban stormwater changes is required at scales and resolutions meaningful to stormwater management although numerous studies have analyzed the effect of climate change on urban flooding risk using the event based approach none have incorporated the continuous modelling approach to investigate the whole spectrum of changes in an urban catchment this study analyzes seasonal changes in future urban hydrological behavior using a mini ensemble of six state of the art climate model projections and a calibrated hydrological hydraulic storm water management model swmm the modelling results show future changes in seasonal and monthly hydrological behavior the notable winter warming is the major driver in the future snow processes resulting in considerably less snow days and an increase in the flow events frequency during the winter months the modelling results also suggest an increase in the annual maximum hourly flow in all seasons with the clearest trend modelled in winter monthly average runoff during the cold period is modelled to increase while no clear trends are detected for the rest of the year there is a clear added benefit in using convection permitting regional climate models throughout the year overall the climate change mitigation and adaption strategies in urban catchments should focus more on the whole spectrum of changes rather than only on urban pluvial flooding risk these findings call for a transition from traditional to a more advanced stormwater management keywords climate change impact rcm urban flooding finland nordic conditions data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction there is an overwhelming body of evidence on global climate change based on analyzing measured climatic data alexander et al 2006 easterling et al 2017 among the climate variables the increase of average global temperature has been the center of attention this is especially true with the notable increasing rate of warming in recent decades in fact the whole hydrological cycle is changing which in turn alternates the frequency and magnitude of floods kundzewicz et al 2014 droughts grillakis 2019 water scarcity gosling and arnell 2016 and water resource management in general estrela et al 2012 tamm et al 2018 as the future projections show the continuation of this phenomena ipcc 2014 climate change is probably the greatest challenge for humanity during the 21st century urban catchments are highly vulnerable to changing climatic conditions due to their fast rainfall runoff response time high impervious surface area and traditional stormwater management with limited storage capacity as the urbanization degree in europe is projected to increase from 73 melchiorri et al 2018 to approximately 84 in 2050 un 2019 this will further exacerbate the urban stormwater vulnerability to changes in rainfall intensities and frequencies sillanpää and koivusalo 2015 urban densification also concerns already developed areas where reconstruction plans aim to form more efficient urban fabric with efficient mobility and reduced energy consumption from the urban environmental point of view densification causes stress to water systems including stormwater management and urban streams e g kaur et al 2022 the designs often do not consider the impacts of climate change which will alter the dimensioning and lead to increasing risks on infrastructures there are some exceptions from scandinavia arnbjerg nielsen 2012 olsson et al 2009 tamm et al 2023 and north america denault et al 2006 waters et al 2003 where climate factors have been introduced in the designs quantification of the climate change effect on stormwater systems is complex due to the uncertainties inherent in climate models giorgi and gutowski 2015 urban water managers need tools to address the role of changing conditions in the densification planning phases various climate change impact studies have been carried out in urban catchments berggren et al 2014 järvi et al 2017 jato espino et al 2019 kourtis et al 2021 le floch et al 2022 semadeni davies et al 2008 these mostly focus on flooding risk analysis berggren et al 2014 jato espino et al 2019 semadeni davies et al 2008 and possible adaptation and mitigation techniques kourtis et al 2021 le floch et al 2022 using mathematical models like dhi mouse and swmm to simulate future flow in an urban catchment although swmm has the capacity for single event and continuous flow simulation rossman 2010 event based modelling is typically used for climate change impact analysis for this the theoretical design storm concept is used which is the basis of designing urban drainage systems to account for the climate change effect design storm depths are modified to correspond to future conditions by multiplying the design storm depth with climate factors hernes et al 2020 which are derived from either global or regional climate models gcms and rcms respectively to date the event based approach is used in climate change impact analysis due to the lack of reliable high resolution climate simulations while spatially coarse climate models with a temporal resolution of 1 day can be sufficient for describing processes in larger catchments such a scale fails to capture spatio temporal variability of rainfall runoff processes in urban catchments where the response time is from minutes to hours even though rcms have gone through significant improvements in the last decade the ability of these rcms to adequately represent short duration precipitation extremes has still remained a concern vergara temprado et al 2020 this gap hinders the scientific understanding of the future changes in urban hydrology and increases the uncertainty involved in urban flooding risk assessment the recent development of convection permitting regional climate models cprcms mostly based on numerical weather prediction nwp models are showing a promising performance to fill this cap ban et al 2020 lucas picher et al 2021 médus et al 2022 showed how cprcms clearly improve the simulation of heavy and extreme precipitation on a sub daily scale over the nordic region as the cprcms with explicitly resolved deep convection require considerably more computer capacity their added benefit over rcms with a coarser deep convection parameterization can be questioned in practical applications the current study investigates the added benefits of adopting cprcms over simpler rcms when assessing all year urban hydrological regime with the swmm model the main objective of this research is to analyze changes in the urban catchment using an ensemble of state of the art tailor made rcm produced meteorological variables as input to the swmm model in snow affected conditions additionally the added value of using high resolution cprcms is examined and discussed using swmm to the knowledge of the authors this is one of the first attempts to model interannual long term changes in an urban catchment using swmm coupled with the new generation rcms in northern europe this gives new insights to the understanding of seasonal trends in extreme flow frequency and magnitude as well as to the overall interannual changes in water cycle processes in an urban catchment with snow during the winter months this in turn gives a more detailed input to practitioners for more advanced stormwater management to mitigate urban flooding while mimicking natural water cycle in urban areas finally the current study explores whether the use of cprcms could start the transition from event based climate change impact analysis to continuous urban catchment modelling 2 methods 2 1 study catchment the study is conducted in vallikallio vk urban catchment which is a typical medium density residential area in espoo southern finland fig 1 the total area of the catchment is roughly 11 ha of which the pervious area 47 is mostly vegetation and non vegetated open sand gravel area the impervious area 53 land cover consists of 3 4 story apartment houses 36 walkways 26 parking areas 26 and asphalted roads 11 the dominant soil type is sandy till with a relatively low hydraulic conductivity 4 2 mm h surface runoff is directed to a storm sewer network which is mostly located under the roads a more detailed description of the study catchment characteristics can be found in sillanpää 2013 the climate in vk belongs to dfb warm summer humid continental type which is influenced by the proximity of the baltic sea with large temperature differences the four seasons can be clearly distinguished fig 2 the coldest month is february with an average temperature of 4 4 c with a high variability from 14 0 c to 1 4 c the warmest month is july with the mean of 18 0 c and a much narrower variability from 14 7 to 22 0 c the average annual precipitation depth in the region is 650 mm out of which 20 is snowfall the highest precipitation amounts are typically observed in august whereas april experiences the lowest amounts as point precipitation gages tend to underestimate the ground true precipitation due to various reasons aerodynamical effects gage wetting blowing drifting of snow the dynamic correction model førland et al 1996 developed for the nordic area was used to reduce this bias 2 2 climate models the regional climate model harmonie climate hclim e g médus et al 2022 olsson et al 2021 is driven by two different gcms ec earth ece and gfdl the climate change outputs from the two gcms differ considerably from each other in the nordic area the ec earth gcm is a modelling effort by a consortium of european research institutes to study global climate change this study uses the irish centre for high end computing simulations of the ec earth the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory climate gfdl model version 3 cm3 has been developed by the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the following two model setups of hclim are used 1 a 12 km resolution hclim12 aladin rcm al which uses parameterized convection and 2 a cprcm with a grid spacing of 3 km hclim3 arome ar with an emphasis on deep convection lind et al 2022 the climate projections consist of three 20 year periods the historical reference period 1986 2005 mid future 2041 2060 and far future 2081 2100 the climate models are forced by two representative concentration pathways rcp the stabilizing rcp4 5 45 and pessimistic rcp8 5 85 scenario the mini ensemble of future climate projections used in this study are listed in table 1 the meteorological input parameters extracted from the rcm s output include hourly series of air temperature near surface and precipitation the series were retrieved from the grid cell which coincided with the location of the discharge outlet of the vallikallio study catchment the comparison of the raw climate projections and observed monthly mean climate variables are shown in fig 3 2 3 bias correction when climate model results from the rcm computation grid s are compared against local point observations of near surface meteorological variables a disagreement between climate model series and observations is quite common such discrepancy often requires a correction of the bias prior to using the climate model results in hydrological modelling various bias correction concepts have been developed over time such as statistical downscaling histogram equalizing and quantile mapping qm piani et al 2010 attention was paid to choosing an appropriate bias correction technique as some methods in fact can even worsen the accuracy of climate models enayati et al 2021 among the various bias correction approaches qm techniques are one of the most widely used bias correction methods to adjust the raw rcm outputs jakob themeßl et al 2011 lafon et al 2013 out of the qm methods family this study used the empirical quantile mapping eqm method due to its already proven ability in correcting temperature and precipitation biases enayati et al 2021 the eqm correction procedure of climate variables in this study involved several steps first measurements from the closest meteorological station to the study catchment were compared against the hindcasted climate simulations from the nearest grid point to that meteorological station the closest meteorological station is the kaisaniemi kn station operated by the finnish meteorological institute fmi kn is located roughly 9 km south east from the vk study catchment daily maximum minimum average temperature and precipitation values are available from the kn station the correction of daily average temperature is preferred over minimum and maximum temperature because the use of quantile mapping methodology could introduce unrealistic values e g daily minimum is higher than daily maximum the obtained corrections derived from the bias correction were then applied to the hourly temperature output of the climate models the eqm method was also employed for correcting precipitation bias as no hourly precipitation measurements are available in the nearby stations for the hindcasted period daily precipitation sums from kn were used as a reference for correcting precipitation bias the obtained daily corrections are then applied to scale hourly climate simulation values in the vk catchment the bias corrected climate model outputs are used as an input to the swmm model 2 4 swmm model the swmm model was first developed in 1971 strictly as a design model oriented in single storm events and short simulation periods since then it has undergone continuous updates over the years nowadays it has been developed into a dynamic rainfall runoff routing simulation model that is capable of modelling water quantity as well as quality for both event based and long term simulations rossman 2010 swmm consists of several process models swmm allows to determine the computation time step for different conditions which affects the simulation time numerical stability and simulation results the dry weather time step is used when there is no rainfall and ponded water in the catchment a dry weather time step of 1 h was found to be suitable in terms of simulation time and model accuracy a high wet weather time step of 5 min was chosen to achieve a better model description of runoff processes in swmm the routing time step of 5 s was used in computing flow through the drainage network to assure the numerical stability of the swmm model among the flow routing options dynamic wave routing was used to calculate the stormwater hydraulics the modified horton was used to calculate infiltration the model parameterization for the vallikallio catchment is adopted from tuomela et al 2019 and embeds a discretization of the study catchment into 8 surfaces having homogeneous surface properties for example roofs parking plots walkways and road segments and isolated green areas were modeled as separate subcatchments draining either to a neighboring subcatchment or to the underground stormwater network the model was refined by koivusalo et al 2022 who calibrated it against snow and discharge measurements available from sillanpää 2013 the snow model was activated to produce a simulation of snow accumulation ploughing and snowmelt in all subcatchments the snow module s initial values were derived from relevant literature rossman and huber 2015 the division of precipitation between snow and rain was based on the temperature value of 1 c the ploughing process was triggered in roads walkways and parking lots this study assumed a snow ploughing threshold of 50 mm as a snow depth moghadas et al 2018 a fixed snow density of 125 kg m3 relatively fresh snow was used for the conversion to snow water equivalent swe resulting in a ploughing swe threshold of 6 25 mm this study took the continuous modelling approach to investigate climate change impact on an urban stormwater catchment the use of continuous modelling with swmm allows to analyze changes in runoff event frequencies in the future current study used the outflow from the system for event definition basis an event separation time of 3 hours was used which corresponds to the typical minimum inter event time for defining a rainfall event dunkerley 2008 secondly an event threshold volume of 114 000 l was set which corresponds to a precipitation event of 1 mm finally if the mean system outflow of an event exceeds 1 l s then it was considered in the event analysis a model warm up period of 9 months was used to reach realistic soil moisture conditions before model results start to be reported reporting was set to start from the beginning of the water year 1 october it should be noted that an event was here defined based on catchment outflow instead of precipitation and it was triggered by both rainfall and snowmelt depending on the seasonal weather 3 results 3 1 future climate projections the comparison between bias corrected historical and future climate projections already indicate notable changes for the mid future period fig 4 the mean annual temperature anomaly is 1 7 2 3 c for the ece emissions scenario rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the gfdl driven climate projections indicate even larger increase of 4 1 c thus projecting a considerable change in the mid future air temperatures as expected no anomalies were detected in air temperature between the deep convection permitting ar and parameterized convection regional climate model al fig 4 a there is no notable difference between ar and al in annual precipitation fig 4 b in general a modest annual increase is projected by the ece driven mini ensemble members from 4 up to 10 by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively similarly to mean temperature anomaly the gfdl driven climate models tend to show a larger change with a projected increase of precipitation approximately 35 the air temperature warming is continuing to the far future period fig 4 c the rcp 4 5 driven by the ece gcm is showing an increase of 2 3 c by the end of the century compared to the baseline period the more pessimistic rcp 8 5 shows quite a dramatical increase by the end of century with values of 4 8 and 6 8 c by ece and gfdl respectively the ar and al show no notable differences in monthly precipitation anomalies for the ece gcm fig 4 c and d some discrepancy can be seen in the gfdl gcm with higher precipitation values from october to january all the mini ensemble models indicate predominantly increases in monthly precipitation and the largest increases are projected in the autumn october november and winter january february moderate increases in precipitation are also projected for summer the pessimistic rcp8 5 series showed the most striking monthly precipitation anomalies for the far future to occur during the period from october to january fig 4 d 3 2 simulated changes in flow statistics changes in meteorological conditions alter the urban catchment hydrological and hydraulic behavior modelled monthly average runoff anomaly for the future periods shows large variations between months and climate models fig 5 the rcp8 5 rcms driven by the gfdl gcm reveal a considerably higher average annual flow of 0 5 l s by the end of the century compared to the rcp8 5 rcms driven by ece gcm 0 2 l s interestingly the simulated monthly anomaly is mostly non negative for average flow with the gfdl gcm the clearest change in the future average runoff is shown in the winter months where all the simulations from the mini ensemble show an average increase of approximately 0 4 l s and 0 6 l s for the mid future and far future respectively fig 5 an overall increasing trend is evident from october to february the average runoff during the first half of spring march and april is expected to decrease whereas a slight increase can be expected in may the climate change signal in summer months is inconsistent especially for the mid future period where the change magnitude is mostly negligible and direction incoherent gfdl ar with pessimistic rcp8 5 shows future increases in august which signal deviates from the results of other models simulations suggest an increase in average flow for the autumn months the colder the month the higher the increase interestingly no clear signal can be seen between the parameterized and deep convection permitting rcm overall the average runoff is expected to increase most in colder months october february whereas the change extent is less pronounced in warm months also it should be noted that the change signal is inconsistent during the warm period 3 3 simulated changes in extreme flow changes in extreme flows due to climate change are of great importance as they are directly linked to urban pluvial flooding risk fig 6 summarizes the annual non exceedance probabilities of maximum hourly mean flows for different seasons and for historical and future periods visual inspection of historical probability curves reveals clearly lower maximum flows in winter fig 6a compared to other seasons in the future scenarios the winter flows are most consistently increasing but the maximum values still remain lower than the other seasons summer maximum flows show the highest differences between the future scenarios fig 6c three out of six scenarios which are for the pessimistic rcp8 5 show shifts of increasing maximum flows additionally statistical analysis was performed to investigate if these changes are significant p 0 05 for this the nonparametric mood s median test mood 1950 was used to analyze the statistical significance of changes on annual maxima extreme flows the mood s median test compares the median values of samples and their significance the results of the mood s median test can be seen in table 2 there are occasional significant changes in the mid future seasons except no changes in spring the differences in maximum flows become stronger for the far future period when significant shifts in autumn and winter flows are the most common in fact the mini ensemble member results suggest significant increas e at a 90 confidence level in the autumn the average seasonal differences suggest an overall significant increase of maximum flows for the rcp8 5 far future seasons while using rcp4 5 the average trend in maximum flows is insignificant in spring and summer 3 4 climate change impact on snow characteristics the study region is located at the edge of the seasonal snow cover where the region typically has snowfall and an established snow cover in winter even though the winter season is characterized by intermittent accumulation melt cycles fig 7 demonstrates the initiation of snow cover by the historical climate model scenarios in october november and the mean snow cover is melted in may at the latest the modelled late tail in snow cover is computationally caused by the melting of the ploughed snow whereas undisturbed snow cover disappears earlier the increasing temperature in mid and far future periods during the winter months indicate a substantial reduction of mean snow depth in the study catchment this decrease of swe is partly compensated by the projected increase in precipitation during the winter months the notable winter warming is the major driver in the future snow processes resulting in considerably smaller swe values in the study catchment the rcp 8 5 scenarios suggest that mean swe goes close to zero in the far future period depending on the period and climate projection used for modelling there still are some differences between climate models the decrease in the mean swe is accompanied with a later accumulation in autumn and an earlier disappearance of snow in spring while the mean swe for the future presents a clear decline in ground snow it does not allow assessing the snow variability table 3 summarizes the evolution of the main driver of snow accumulation i e annual snowfall and its variability for the different periods the average snowfall precipitation ratio s p for the historical period is consistent in a narrow range 0 21 0 25 the average s p ratio in the future periods is strongly decreasing for all scenarios with larger decreases than the variability in the historical values a striking result is the difference in maximum s p ratios between the projections this reveals the uncertainty related to the occurrence of high snowfall accumulations in the future the exceedance probability curves of the annual maximum swe in fig 8 demonstrate the high variability of future scenarios for the mid future period while snow will not completely disappear from the urban area in the winter the irregularity of snowy winters is increasing since winter is part of the dormancy period when potential evaporation is reduced and the largest volumes of runoff are generated strong shifts in the snow conditions and variability are directly reflected to storm runoff dynamics 3 5 flow event statistics changes in precipitation patterns and snow dynamics indicate changes in the frequency and magnitude of flow events seasonal event analysis is carried out with the swmm event tool package to investigate how climate change impacts runoff generation in the urban catchment fig 9 shows the flow event occurrence according to climate projection and season the event count reveals a clear shift in the winter season where all the climate models show an overall increase in the number of winter flow events the change magnitude depends on the climate model analyzed with an average increase of 5 to 15 events by the end of the century while the number of winter flow events in the historical period is the smallest among the seasons the number of winter events in the far future period is most often the highest for the pessimistic rcp8 5 a similar tendency is evident during the autumn season however the change is not as pronounced as during winter months except for the autumn results of gfdl interestingly for both seasons the increase is continuous i e the number of flow events is higher in the far future compared to mid future although considerably less snowpack is left for melt during the spring months in the future fig 7 the number of events indicate no clear tendency changes in the number of summer events is inconclusive change direction and magnitude is dependent on the climate model employed it is interesting to note the concordance between ar and al both agree in the direction and magnitude of changes in the winter season as expected the convective permitting capability of the ar increases the average number of flow events in the summer compared to al where events are longer and with a lower event intensity due to its known limitation in generating high intensity short duration events 4 discussion densely populated urban areas are highly vulnerable to changes in climate and land cover the focus on urban climate change impact studies mostly lies on flooding risk assessment since it is a major source of threat to human life and property dong et al 2022 while this is crucial from the climate adaptation aspect it is equally important to understand the whole spectrum of changes for climate resilience strategy however the projected overall temperature increase accompanied by changing variability in precipitation makes the understanding of climate change impact in an urban mosaic a challenging task the robustness of the results is hindered with some limitations in the study the uncertainties related to choosing a bias correction methodology are widely acknowledged in climate change impact studies piani et al 2010 the recent availability of hourly climate series introduces a new paradigm to the bias correction concept the lack of high quality measurements to correct the climate series against while this is not an issue when correcting near surface air temperature values it becomes a concern when precipitation is corrected this raises the research question about the temporal mismatch between climate models and on ground measurements lind et al 2020 the use of a mini ensemble adds additional uncertainty to the results as a larger ensemble size would be less susceptible to random fluctuations and the law of small numbers benestad et al 2017 thus increasing the ensemble member size would aid to see the whole spectrum of changes nevertheless the addition of cprcm hclim3 to the mini ensemble should potentially improve the representation of the future climate on a small urban scale the study verifies this assumption in the summertime where the high intensity rainfall events caused notably higher annual maximum hourly flow values with hclim3 fig 6 this result is in line with previous research where hclim3 was found to strongly improve the representation of higher intensity events compared to hclim12 in sweden olsson et al 2021 remarkably hclim3 was even able to simulate an extreme rainfall event similar to the magnitude of malmö 2014 event in the same region which caused substantial pluvial flood damage mobini et al 2021 according to this study there is a clear tendency towards higher maximum flows in all seasons except spring the finding is consistent with other climate impact studies in fennoscandia nie et al 2009 pang et al 2022 semadeni davies et al 2008 however this study addressed the maximum flows at an hourly time step at the catchment outlet which sets the focus on the seasonal maximum flow dynamics rather than on the hydraulic performance future work is needed to explore how intensification of rainfall extremes due to the climate change affects stormwater system peak flow dynamics pipe network surcharge and manhole flooding lind and others 2020 studied the benefits and added value of cprcm over fenno scandinavia the cprcm was found to represent less drizzle events frequent precipitation events with low intensities which is a persistent problem in many climate models koutroulis et al 2016 mehran et al 2014 contrary to the expectations the seasonal event analysis in this study reveals an opposite effect fig 9 using the convection permitting model as an input to swmm produced more events than the climate model with parameterized convection this difference is probably due to the event definition where the minimum mean outflow and intensity criteria discarded the drizzle events interestingly the simulated average monthly swe fig 8 for the historical period is notably higher and more realistic with the hclim3 compared to the coarser hclim12 this finding agrees with earlier study by lind and others 2020 who also showed that cprcms provide added value even for winter precipitation at the edge of the seasonal snow cover influenced by the maritime climate snow cover is highly sensitive to increasing temperature callaghan et al 2011 this is confirmed in a study by luomaranta et al 2019 where similarly to this study a decreasing snow depth trend in southern finland was found the increasing mixed and liquid precipitation and rising temperature were found to be the main drivers of these changes according to results in this study a decrease in snowfall to total precipitation s p ratio was also evident thus the decreasing trend in snow depth luomaranta et al 2019 and s p ratio irannezhad et al 2017 is expected to continue in the future this is further confirmed by the increase of simulated events in winter regardless of the analyzed climate projection also the substantial increase in monthly average runoff during winter months fig 6 supports that the projected increases are largest and most consistent during winter the increasing average runoff and number of flow events indicates an increasing hydraulic load to the existing stormwater drainage network it is obvious from the above discussion that climate change affects the urban flow regime all year round this calls for a holistic stormwater management approach to regard the whole spectrum of changes low impact development lid stormwater solutions have proven to have a positive impact on urban water balance by reducing the runoff volume and flooding khadka et al 2020 therefore it can be a useful technique in adaption to climate change by maintaining the current urban water cycle khadka et al 2020 among the lid controls green roofs and permeable pavements are the most widely researched abdalla et al 2021 parnas et al 2021 since they directly replace impermeable surfaces however their performance in reducing runoff and peak flow is most pronounced during warmer conditions and their performance in wintertime conditions remains limited mantilla et al 2023 other types of green infrastructure such as rain gardens also referred to as bioretention cells can be adapted to the colder conditions by diversifying the plant species fowdar et al 2021 and maintaining the suitable soil characteristics to ensure efficient hydraulic capacity for infiltration mantilla et al 2023 paus et al 2016 in addition to runoff quantity control treatment of stormwater to improve water quality has an important role when constructing lid solutions pollutant removal efficiency of various designs can vary between mild and cold seasons in the nordic latitudes thus warming temperatures are expected to have an influence on the urban runoff water quality and lid solutions performance according to previous studies sediment and sediment bound phosphorus are removed also in lower temperatures in biofilters but nitrogen treatment drops notably with a decreasing temperature blecken et al 2010 ekka et al 2021 fowdar et al 2022 nayeb yazdi et al 2021 changes in stormwater quantity are reflected in pollutant loads from urban areas and therefore increase the complexity of stormwater management under changing climate the optimal selection and placement of lid controls requires using optimization algorithms eckart et al 2018 liu et al 2016 instead of optimizing the stormwater network against hydraulic performance and cost an integrated sustainability assessment including the evaluation of water quality benefits and ecosystem services should be carried out thus future work should couple reliable high quality climate projections with hydrological hydraulic tools like swmm to quantify the all year climate change effect on an urban catchment this in turn enables to carry out optimization of lid controls to understand to what extent the lid controls can mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the water cycle and contribute towards the un sustainable development goals 5 conclusions this study assessed the year round climate change impacts in an urban stormwater catchment in finland based on simulations carried out with the stormwater model swmm driven by a mini ensemble of climate projections the ensemble includes high resolution convection permitting regional climate projections and a coarser rcm with parameterized convection the climate models are forced by the stabilizing rcp4 5 and pessimistic scenario rcp8 5 therefore the simulations can serve as a reference of the expected changes in an urban catchment with snow processes and thus help decision makers to plan for mitigation and adaptation measures ahead of time the climate change signal in cold periods is consistent the colder the month the higher the increase in average surface runoff the study also indicates that annual maximum flow will increase in all seasons from which winter and autumn showed a statistically significant change for the end of the century the advantage of using convective permitting models over parameterized ones is clear they result higher and more realistic annual maximum flow values this is even true for the winter period where the representation of the snow conditions was closer to reality using the convective permitting climate outputs as input to swmm warming winters indicate a substantial reduction of mean snow depth and maximum annal swe in the study catchment according to the rcp 8 5 scenarios mean swe goes close to zero in the far future period this is confirmed by the strong decrease in s p ratio during the future periods for all scenarios thus the water balance of the southern finland urban catchment will alter remarkably due to the projected climate change this in turn will make stormwater management more challenging in the future results of this study clearly present the need for a holistic stormwater management approach the climate change mitigation and adaption strategies in urban catchments should focus more on the whole spectrum of changes rather than only urban pluvial flooding risk this study used a mini ensemble of climate projections to investigate future climate change impact further study can be conducted with a larger ensemble for understanding the range of climate change impacts on an urban catchment the future study could be extended by the evaluation of the optimal selection

1804,as an important part of the hydrological cycle preferential flow significantly improves infiltration properties and limits the ability of soil to store filter and buffer water however the effect of roots on the preferential flow infiltration process in forest ecosystems is still unclear this study measured the preferential flow infiltration process in short rotation eucalyptus plantations four forest ages of 1 2 3 and 5 years with the surface positioned double ring infiltrometer in south subtropical area china overall the cumulative infiltration ci initial infiltration rate iir and stable infiltration rate sir increased with forest age the ci iir and sir of the 5 year old eucalyptus plantation were the highest in four aged eucalyptus plantations correlation analysis showed that root biomass was positively and significantly correlated with ci p 0 05 iir p 0 01 and sir p 0 01 which showed that the preferential flow increased with root biomass however the correlations between total porosity tp and iir sir and ci were all not significant p 0 05 the dye coverage of the inner and outer ring tangents which were used to observe the strength of lateral preferential flows was significantly and positively correlated with ci p 0 01 iir p 0 01 and sir p 0 01 the dye coverage of the outer ring tangent was significantly and positively correlated with root biomass p 0 05 so the lateral preferential flows depended on root biomass and increased with forest age the horton model which had higher stability and accuracy than the kostiakov and philip models was the most suitable model to describe the preferential flow infiltration process in eucalyptus plantations as important factors influencing the evolution of preferential flow in eucalyptus plantation root biomass was used in predicting the parameters of the horton model through regression analysis then a unified model predicting the preferential flow infiltration process in short rotation eucalyptus plantations was proposed and verified this study achieved the quantitative measurement of preferential flow infiltration process explored the importance of roots in the production of preferential flow channels and found the lateral preferential flow played an important role in infiltration in forests these results can provide a theoretical basis for improving the efficiency of water resource management in plantation and optimizing the model of preferential flow infiltration process in plantation keywords preferential flow plantation root model double ring data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction preferential flow is defined as the physical movement of solutes and water along certain pathways while bypassing most of the soil porous matrix hendrickx and flury 2001 beven and german 2013 accounting for about 15 85 of the soil total infiltration laine kanlio et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 preferential flow was an important part in the regional and global water cycle hirmas et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 preferential flow improves soil infiltration property thereby reducing surface runoff and soil erosion allaire et al 2011 increasing groundwater recharge and slowing down soil degradation kan et al 2020 meanwhile preferential flow shortens the contact time between water and soil and limits the ability of soil to store filter and buffer water alakukku et al 2010 laine kaulio et al 2015 thus reducing the water and nutrient utilization rates of plants clothier et al 2007 luo et al 2019 and increasing the risk of groundwater pollution weiler 2017 therefore the study of preferential flow is essential to improving the utilization efficiency of water resource comprehensively evaluating the benefits of soil and water conservation and preventing and controlling groundwater pollution which has been a global concern kulasekera et al 2011 the macropores accounted for only a small proportion of soil beven and german 2013 moret and arrue 2007 are formed in many ways such as root growth chemical weathering and drying wetting and freezing thawing cycles hardie et al 2011 li et al 2020 chen et al 2021 thereinto root growth is considered as an important way forming macropores nespoulous et al 2019 both decaying and living roots can form preferential root channels or continuous macropores and promote the movement of water and solutes with slight resistance gaiser 1952 jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 root exudates enhance soil aggregation that form inter aggregate macropores luo et al 2018 root channels account for 70 100 of the total amount of macropores in forest soils and serve as main paths of water and solute preferential transport newman et al 2004 noguchi et al 2017 the radii of developed forest roots are almost 10 times the canopy radius and the development of forest roots lead to a wide distribution range and high degree differentiation of preferential flow in forest soils and produced a higher lateral preferential flow lejeune et al 2004 ghestem et al 2011 liu et al 2021 and infiltration rate neris et al 2012 mongil manso et al 2021 to date many researchers conducted a lot of qualitative studies on the relationship between forest roots and preferential flow by using the dye tracer technique but mainly focusing on the relationship between the dye covers and root diameter luo et al 2018 root length density zhang et al 2015 and root weight density gang et al 2017 the effect of root biomass on the lateral preferential flow developing and the quantitative relationship between root biomass and preferential flow infiltration processes were still unclear as forest age increases plant root channels become deeper wider and denser facilitating preferential flow and increasing the permeability of forest soils tobella et al 2014 deuchars et al 1999 measured soil infiltration rate by single ring infiltrometer to study the change in soil infiltration rate during rainforest regeneration after pastures were abandoned in the san luis valley in central america their results showed that soil infiltration rate increased with forest age because the root activities in the forests increased soil porosity and decreased soil bulk density greenwood and buttle 2014 and archer et al 2016 also found the saturated hydraulic conductivity was increased with forest age in southern ontario and temperate forests because root biomass and macroporosity increased kalhoro et al 2018 showed that forests and grasslands had positive effects on soil infiltration because of increasing root biomass and total porosity tp in the hilly areas of the loess plateau and the effects strengthened as planting age increased shi et al 2021 found that plant age could significantly affect soil hydraulic properties and root development significantly promoted soil infiltration by using meta analysis they proposed that the correlation between tp and infiltration was not significant while the high correlation with non capillary porosity above studies mainly focused on the changes of total infiltration with forest age but not distinguishing the matrix infiltration and preferential flow some studies found the similar change of preferential flow with forest age cheng et al 2014 and ma et al 2022 studied the vertical distribution characteristics of soil preferential paths in differently aged chinese fir plantations and caragana korshinskii plantations by using the dye tracer method respectively their results showed that the preferential flow path depths and dye covers increased with increasing forest age because of root mass and number increasing so the root system of forest continuously developed with the increase of forest age to increase the root biomass and then affecting the preferential flow path and promoting the total infiltration and preferential flow however previous studies were confined to qualitatively analyze dye covers by using the dye tracer method quantitively analysis and predicting model with considering root characteristics at different forest age were lacked on studying preferential flow many methods have been developed and applied for studying preferential flow such as dye tracer technique nespoulous et al 2019 time domain reflectometry oberdörster et al 2010 3d x ray computed tomography ct sammartino et al 2012 magnetic resonance imaging votrubová et al 2003 and ground penetrating radar di prima et al 2020 the dye tracer technique is the most commonly used method in studying preferential flow and allows the direct observation evaluation and analysis of the path quantity and distribution of preferential flow jiang et al 2019 zhang 2017 and zhang et al 2019 proposed a surface positioned double ring infiltrometer for determining the preferential flow infiltration process and measuring difference in total infiltration and matrix infiltration in adjacent areas they observed the distribution of preferential paths and successfully measured the preferential flow infiltration process in 50 year old robinia pseudoacacia in the loess plateau china compared with other methods zhang s method is relatively economic simple and easy to operate and can accurately quantify the infiltration processes of preferential flow tao et al 2019 in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region eucalyptus plantations constitute 34 91 of the total plantation area and eucalyptus contributes to 49 97 of harvested timber stock volume zhang and wang 2021 owing to the short rotation of eucalyptus plantation 5 7 years eucalyptus plantations require continuous management while release active allelopathic substances which inhibit the growth of understory vegetation resulting in sparse understory vegetation engler et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 yao et al 2021 thus eucalyptus plantations hydrological cycles were heavy disturbed and causing problems in water environments deng et al 2020 therefore studying on preferential flow and its control mechanism in eucalyptus plantation is essential to investigate the water ecological security in the region simultaneously the measurement of preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations is difficult in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region due to the large number of mountains and inconvenient transportation han and song 2020 a unified model describing the preferential flow infiltration process in short rotation eucalyptus plantations is urgently needed which can improve measurement efficiency and reduce experiment cost thus combined with the findings of previous studies a hypothesis was proposed the growth of root system with forest age could promote the forming of lateral preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations and the preferential flow infiltration process from this we present the following objectives 1 to quantify the preferential flow infiltration process in four aged eucalyptus plantations 2 to assess the effect of root biomass and tp on preferential flow and 3 to establish a unified model with considering root biomass for predicting the preferential flow in short rotation eucalyptus plantations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area four aged eucalyptus plantations at the state owned dongmen forest farm 107 15 108 00 e 22 17 22 30 n in chongzuo city in china were selected as study objects fig 1a the annual rainfall and evaporation are 1100 1300 mm and 1192 1724 mm respectively rainfall events mainly occur from june to august accounting for 51 03 of the annual rainfall the average annual temperature is 21 c the soil is lateritic red soil with ph of 4 0 6 0 the soil has a clear development differentiation profile and good hydrothermal conditions 2 2 experiment design four eucalyptus urophylla e grandis plantations planted in may in 2020 2019 2018 and 2016 were selected as experimental forests table 1 and the gradient of forest age represented the different growth stage of eucalyptus plantations in short rotation ouyang et al 2021 in each plantation a 20 m 20 m experimental area was set and three experimental plots 2 m 3 m were set along the diagonal randomly the four corners of each experimental plot consisted of four eucalyptus trees as shown in fig 1b the measurement place of matrix infiltration was the center of each experimental plot three of four adjacent eucalyptus were selected as the sample trees namely nine sample trees in each experiment plot given that the root systems of eucalyptus plantations are mainly distributed within 1 m2 from the center of the trunk viera et al 2012 laclau et al 2013 a flat and grassless place that was 0 5 m away from the trunk was selected as the measurement point of total infiltration three matrix infiltration measurements and nine total infiltration measurements were performed in each plot all eucalyptus plantations were the first generation of seedling forests the cluttered shrubs or weeds shoveled were cut every 1 year the spaces and intra spaces in all plantations were 2 m 3 m eucalyptus have been planted in the four experimental areas since 2001 and our experiments were performed in august 2021 2 3 soil samples analysis and root biomass estimation three points were randomly selected diagonally in each eucalyptus plantations plots to excavate soil profiles because the soil layer below 60 cm of lateritic red soil is a parent material layer and the depth of soil subsoiling was mostly 50 60 cm in eucalyptus plantation fu and li 1993 santos and reichert 2022 soil samples of 0 60 cm soil layer were collected to use in laboratory analysis in this study three replicate samples were collected at three layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm of each soil profile for measuring soil water content swc bulk density bd soil particle density ds tp and soil texture these indicators of the whole soil profiles were counted with mean values of the three soil layers table 2 the soil samples for measuring swc were sealed immediately in airtight aluminum cylinders and swc was measured by the oven drying method in laboratory soils was measured for calculating bd were collected by the cutting ring 100 cm3 and oven dried at 105 c until constant weight for the other analyses the soil was sampled with a small shovel air dried removed roots and passed through a 2 mm sieve in the laboratory tp was calculated using eq 1 and soil particle density was measured by the pycnometer method 1 tp 1 b d d s 100 where tp is total porosity bd is bulk density g cm 3 and ds is soil particle density g cm 3 soil texture was determined using a mastersizer 3000 analyzer malvern instruments the ranges of sand silt and clay in the four plantations were 11 01 29 39 51 43 59 89 and 14 57 37 56 respectively according to the usda texture classification the forest soils of the four plots were loam soil wang et al 2015 arranged 15 sample plots of eucalyptus plantation by using the grid method 100 km 100 km in guangxi zhuang autonomous region each sample plot had three replicates 20 m 50 m the height diameter at breast height and crown breadth of a tree in each duplicate plot were measured a total of 18 eucalyptus trees with different ages and diameters at breast height were selected outside each plot for the measurement of root biomass the distribution level of diameter at breast height was considered during measurement then the optimized allometric model eq 2 was formulated on the basis of the dataset of root biomass and diameter at breast height of the eucalyptus plantations and used in estimating root biomass the root biomass of each sample tree was estimated with the optimized allometric model wang et al 2015 2 w r 0 06 d 1 771 r 2 0 85 where wr is root biomass kg and d is diameter at breast height cm in this study the diameter at breast height 1 3 m above ground level of the sample trees was measured with tape measure table 2 2 4 measurement and calculation method of preferential flow 2 4 1 measurement method of total infiltration and matrix infiltration a surface positioned double ring infiltrometer inner ring diameter of 30 cm outer ring diameter of 60 cm and both height of 8 cm was used to measure total infiltration and matrix infiltration zhang et al 2017a 2019 as shown in fig 2 a a flat measurement point was selected and carefully cleaned the litter for total infiltration measurement the double ring infiltrometer was gently hammered into the soil to a depth of about 1 cm by using a leveling ruler and a rubber hammer while ensuring that the rings remained horizontal the method requires the water level of the inner and outer rings keeping consistent the water of outer ring prevents the water of inner ring lateral seepage so that keeping a one dimensional vertical infiltration process in the inner ring zhang and li 2020 soil was stacked and compacted at the inner and outer walls to prevent water leakage from the bottoms of both rings two 5 cm 5 cm cardboards were placed in the inner and outer rings to buffer water flow and prevent damage for the surface soil structure at the beginning of the experiment the 4 g l 1 methylene blue solution was poured into the inner ring and the clean water was poured into the outer ring at the same time based on zhang s experience the heights of infiltration rings were set as 8 cm the measurement of soil matrix infiltration needed hammering into the soil of 1 cm and covering 3 cm thick soil sand mixture thus the maximum measurement water level of soil matrix infiltration was only 4 cm the initial water level of soil total infiltration kept be consistent with soil matrix infiltration simultaneously many researches also set a water level of 4 cm when using surface positioned double ring infiltrometer zhang 2017 huang et al 2018 tao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 and traditional double ring infiltrometer bodhinayake et al 2004 wu et al 2021 therefore both the initial water levels of soil total infiltration and matrix infiltration were 4 cm depth a stopwatch was used to record the time durations of each 1 cm water infiltration in inner ring throughout each experimental process water was appropriately added into the outer ring to maintain the water levels in the inner and outer rings consistent other details of the measurement of total infiltration could be found in previous studies tao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the surface positioned double ring infiltrometer with covering materials was used in measurement of soil matrix infiltration perroux and white 1988 indicated that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a covering material for sheltering preferential flow must be higher than that of the soil matrix in a tested plot to ensure that the infiltration process was controlled by the soil matrix and yuan 2018 found that the soil sand mixture as covering materials whose saturated hydraulic conductivities were higher than that of the soil matrix could well shelter preferential flow among them the higher the proportion of soil the better shielding effect on preferential flow the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil sand mixtures with different proportions 5 0 4 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 and 0 5 were pretested for the identification of optimal soil sand mixtures a series of laboratory experiments were conducted and obtained that the saturation hydraulic conductivities of topsoil 0 20 cm 216 mm h 1 128 mm h 1 121 mm h 1 and 98 mm h 1 of 1 2 3 and 5 year old eucalyptus plantations and that of 1 2 and 2 3 soil sand mixtures 238 mm h 1 and 112 mm h 1 according to the test results 3 cm thick soil sand mixtures 1 2 were uniformly spread over the areas of inner rings and the areas between inner and outer rings in the 1 2 and 3 year old eucalyptus plantations and 2 3 soil sand mixtures were used in the 5 year old eucalyptus plantation fig 2b to buffer the water flow geotextile and two 5 cm 5 cm cardboards were placed on the surface of soil sand mixture subsequent measurement procedures were same with those used in total infiltration using soil sand mixture effectively to block preferential flow ensures the accuracy of matrix infiltration measurement yuan 2018 zhao et al 2022 when no change in infiltration time was observed after three times of measurement the infiltration process was considered stable infiltration commonly the time of measurement is 1 5 h the infiltration rate was calculated with eq 3 3 i δ i δ t 600 where i denotes infiltration rate mm h 1 δi is the cumulative infiltration in the inner ring during δt time period cm and 600 is the conversion coefficient after 24 h of finishing the measurement of total infiltration and matrix infiltration 1 m 1 m soil profiles were excavated fig 2c and d a series of vertical soil profiles along the tangents of the outer ring the inner ring one fourth of the inner ring and half of the inner ring were respectively excavated then a series of horizontal soil profiles at depths of 5 10 20 and 30 cm from the soil surface according to the profile of the half outer ring were excavated the soil profiles were treated with photoshop cs6 adobe systems incorporated usa and imagej wayne rasband national institutes of health maryland usa for the quantification of the dyeing area yan and zhao 2016 the images were geometrically corrected with photoshop cs6 in accordance with the inner ring width and height of the soil profile each image was cropped to 30 cm 70 cm after the saturation brightness grayscale and threshold of the processing pictures were adjusted the color images were converted to black and white binary images which were used in calculating the proportion of the stained area to the entire profile with imagej 2 4 2 calculation principle of preferential flow owing to the small spatial variability of matrix infiltration in adjacent area das gupta et al 2006 zhang et al 2017a zhang 2017 and zhang et al 2019 proposed a principle for estimating the preferential flow infiltration process soil infiltration with many macropores consists of two parts soil matrix infiltration and preferential flow and soil matrix infiltration in the preferential flow measurement area can be replaced by that in the adjacent area therefore the formula for calculating the preferential flow is 4 i 2 p d q 2 p d t d q 2 d t d q 1 m d t i 2 t i 1 m where q1m represents the matrix infiltration of position 1 mm and q2m is the matrix infiltration of position 2 mm i2p is the infiltration rate of preferential flow of position 2 mm h 1 i 2 t is the infiltration rate of total infiltration of position 2 mm h 1 and i 1 m is the infiltration rate of matrix infiltration of position 1 mm h 1 other details of the calculation principle of preferential flow could be found in the study of zhang et al 2019 after the measurement of soil total infiltration and soil matrix infiltration in adjacent areas the preferential flow infiltration process can be obtained with eq 4 2 4 3 fitting model of preferential flow infiltration process the horton kostiakov and philip models were used to fit the measured preferential flow infiltration process the horton model considers the effect of soil surface conditions on infiltration property when describing the rainfall infiltration process horton 1941 5 i i f i 0 i f exp n t where i denotes infiltration rate mm h 1 t is infiltration time h if represents stable infiltration rate mm h 1 i0 represents initial infiltration rate mm h 1 and n is infiltration decay factor the kostiakov model is the most commonly used empirical model kostiakov 1932 its parameters have strong elasticity 6 i a t b where a and b are fitting parameters and a and b describe the infiltration rate at t time the philip model is a classical physical model for simulating infiltration philip 1957 however the fitting deviation of the philip model for long time infiltration is large 7 i 0 5 s t 0 5 a where s is the sorptivity mm h 0 5 and a is conceptually the stable infiltration rate mm h 1 in addition the expression of ci was obtained according to the functional relationship eq 8 between infiltration rate and ci 8 ci 0 t i t d t where ci is cumulative infiltration mm 2 4 4 unified model of preferential flow the establishment of a unified model for predicting the preferential flow infiltration process requires four steps 1 preferential flow infiltration process of six of the nine sample trees in each plantation were randomly selected and fitted by the horton kostiakov and philip models and determination coefficients r 2 were compared on the basis of the preferential flow infiltration process fitted by the three models for the identification of the model can characterize the preferential flow infiltration process 2 the measured values of cumulative infiltration ci initial infiltration rate iir and stable infiltration rate sir were compared with the analytical values estimated by the three models and the model with the highest fitting accuracy was selected as the basic model 3 the correlation between infiltration process and root biomass was analyzed and root biomass was used as an independent variable for predicting the original parameters of the basic model through regression analysis 4 a unified model was obtained for predicting the preferential flow infiltration process and the accuracy of the unified model was verified by other three trees 2 5 statistical analysis in this study iir is the average of the first 3 min of infiltration sir is the average of the last three infiltration rates and ci is cumulative infiltration of preferential flow within 1 5 h all data were presented as mean sd and the shapiro wilk test was used to verify the data conformed to the normal distribution one way analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in soil properties root biomass ci iir and sir of eucalyptus plantation of different ages the regression analysis was used to derive the regression equations predicting the model parameters the correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation among dye coverage of soil profiles along the tangents of inner and outer rings root biomass tp iir sir and ci 3 results 3 1 preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations of four ages the total infiltration and matrix infiltration of four eucalyptus plantations are shown in fig 3 the preferential flow infiltration process fig 4 was obtained with eq 4 the results showed that iirs were 4314 2708 mm h 1 4559 3504 mm h 1 5322 2120 mm h 1 and 8303 1978 mm h 1 respectively sirs were 63 44 mm h 1 82 57 mm h 1 167 72 mm h 1 and 283 90 mm h 1 respectively cis were 913 406 mm 890 512 mm 1470 387 mm 2226 514 mm for 1 2 3 and 5 year old eucalyptus plantations respectively the iir sir and ci increased with forest age fig 5 the iir sir and ci of the 5 year old eucalyptus plantation were the highest in four plantations p 0 05 the infiltration capacity of the 1 and 2 year old eucalyptus plantations showed no significant difference and were lower than other plantations the infiltration processes of preferential flow were fitted with the horton model eq 5 kostiakov model eq 6 and philip model eq 7 in each plantation as shown in table 3 the variation coefficients of the three model parameters were higher than 10 showing that the preferential flow had high variability the r 2 of the three models were 0 77 0 98 horton model 0 70 0 99 kostiakov model and 0 67 0 99 philip model showing that the measured infiltration data accurately reflected the preferential flow infiltration process the fitting parameters if steady infiltration rate and i 0 initial infiltration rate of the horton model increased with forest age similar to the measured results the fitting parameter a steady infiltration rate of the philip model presented a large number of negative values because the model had a fixed attenuation coefficient of time 0 5 with limiting the attenuation rate of preferential flow liu et al 2011 thus the philip model was unable to fit the stable infiltration rate of the preferential flow 3 2 root biomass of eucalyptus plantations of four ages according to eq 2 the root biomass of the nine sample trees ranged from 0 74 kg to 9 39 kg in four eucalyptus plantations fig 6 the root biomass of the sample trees rapidly grew in the eucalyptus plantations especially in the second and third years the root biomass of the 5 year old eucalyptus plantation was the highest in four plantations the root biomass of the sample trees in 3 year old eucalyptus plantation was significantly higher than those of the 1 and 2 year old eucalyptus plantations p 0 05 4 discussions 4 1 effects of eucalyptus plantations of different planting ages on preferential flow the root systems of plants including living and decaying roots can produce root channels which account for 70 100 of the total of macropores in forest soils newman et al 2004 noguchi et al 2017 roots can change the size connectivity and distribution of soil pores thereby affecting the development of preferential flow in forest soils liu et al 2020 in our study the correlations between preferential flow and root biomass and tp were examined respectively in four forest age eucalyptus plantations iir had a significantly positive correlation to root biomass p 0 05 and sir and ci had highly significant and positive correlation to root biomass p 0 01 table 4 the results showed that root biomass increased with forest age and thus iir sir and ci increased these findings were consistent with those of previous studies archer et al 2016 leung et al 2017 plant roots promote the development of soil macropores in two main ways 1 the roots separate and squeeze the soil to form root channels by elongating interspersing and thickening liu et al 2020 2 when roots die the decaying xylem forms a tubular root channel because the decay of bark takes more time than the decay of xylem gaiser 1952 as forest age increases increase in root biomass promotes the formation of plant root channels and increases macropore network density and continuity thereby promoting preferential flow wu et al 2021 moreover plant roots in the upper layer of soil form more preferential root channels than those in the subsoil during plant root decay jørgensen et al 2002 liu et al 2020 resulting in a high iir owing to increase in root biomass with forest age root decay increases then leading to iir increase however the correlations between tp and iir sir and ci were all not significant p 0 05 the findings were inconsistent with some previous studies ren et al 2016 kalhoro et al 2018 their studies focused on soil total infiltration including matrix infiltration and preferential flow rather than preferential flow the macropores which were the pores through preferential flow accounted for only a small proportion of soil beven and german 2013 moret and arrue 2007 so preferential flow may be not significant with tp however other previous researches were consistent with our results shi et al 2021 jačka et al 2021 shi et al 2021 emphasized that non capillary porosity that is macropores plays a more important role in changes of infiltration than tp the macropores had a significant effect on the preferential transport of water the flow rate in which could be two to eight times higher than that in the soil matrix bouma 1982 wang et al 1994 shipitalo and gibbs 2000 zhang et al 2019 and small changes could affect the mutation of the preferential flow cheng et al 2018 jačka et al 2021 found that soil total infiltration and preferential flow in three plantations was not related to tp while significantly influenced by pore size distribution and connectivity in summary the preferential flow of eucalyptus plantations was mainly affected by its root and not significantly affected by tp the vertical and horizontal growth of plant roots leads to the formation of a large number of vertical and horizontal channels of preferential flow in the soil ghestem et al 2011 jiang et al 2018 after water infiltrates the soil water flows along the lateral coarse roots forming a rapid lateral preferential flow schwärzel et al 2012 guo et al 2020 this phenomenon was consistent with our findings as shown in fig 7 a and b some parts of the soil profiles along the tangents of the inner and outer rings were dyed and a clear root channel from the inner ring to the outer ring was observed the dyeing results showed that water infiltrating the inner ring flowed laterally outside of the inner ring through the root channels because of the lateral roots and formed a lateral preferential flow fig 7c zhang et al 2019 the soil profile dyeing area was quantified the dye coverages of the soil profiles along the tangents of the inner and outer rings were 1 13 28 10 and 0 06 4 73 the dye coverages of the soil profiles along the tangents of the inner and outer rings increased with forest age moreover correlation analysis showed that the dye coverage of the soil profiles along the tangents of inner and outer rings had an extremely significant and positive correlation to iir sir and ci p 0 01 and the dye coverage of the outer ring tangent was significantly and positively correlated with root biomass p 0 05 these results illustrated that the lateral preferential flow was controlled by the roots and increased with forest age eventually increasing preferential flow lateral root pathways became deep and wide as forest age increased promoting lateral preferential flow simultaneously the lateral preferential flow expanded the potential soil volume accessible to surface water enhancing preferential flow lange et al 2009 4 2 unified model of preferential flow our results indicated that the philip model is unsuitable for describing the sir of preferential flow because the fitting parameter a steady infiltration rate of the philip model presented a large number of negative values similar to the results of the previous studies zhang et al 2017b santra et al 2021 the measured iir sir and ci of the six sample trees in each plantation were individually compared with those fitted using the horton and kostiakov model and then the appropriate model was selected as shown in fig 8 a the iir estimated by fitting the results of the kostiakov model was extremely high and 6 24 times the measured iir given that the kostiakov model is a power function when the time was 0 the iir tended to have infinite values the iir estimated with the fitting results of the horton model was closer to the measured values the sir estimated by fitting the results of the horton and kosiakov models were 1 07 and 1 72 times the measured values respectively fig 8b the ci values estimated by the fitting results of the horton model were 0 93 times the measured values but the ci estimated by the fitting results of the kosiakov model was 2 10 times the measured values fig 8c in summary the iir sir and ci predicted by the horton model were closer to the measured values than those predicted by the kostiakov model wang et al 2017 showed that the fitting results of the three parameter model horton model were more accurate than those of the two parameter model kosiakov and philip models additional parameters adjust three parameter models and improve their accuracy by increasing the stability of the models and reducing interference and bias duan et al 2010 wang et al 2017 hence the horton model was selected as the basis of the unified model for the preferential flow in short rotation eucalyptus plantations root biomass was positively and significantly correlated with if p 0 01 and i0 p 0 05 respectively which were the parameters of the horton model the effects of root biomass on preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations were considered in the regression analysis for predicting the parameters if and i0 table 5 the parameter n is the infiltration decay factor haghighi et al 2010 and significantly positively correlated with the difference between initial and steady infiltration rates i 0 if p 0 01 thus the parameters if and i0 were used as independent variables in regression analysis for predicting the parameter n table 5 a unified model eq 14 predicting preferential flow in short rotation eucalyptus plantations was obtained 14 i 27 84 w r 29 13 217 92 w r 2 1356 62 w r 5341 26 exp 0 11 w r 2 0 85 w r 5 90 t where i represents infiltration rate mm h 1 t is infiltration time h and wr denotes root biomass kg the measurement results of the other three sample trees in each plantation were used in verifying and evaluating the effects of the unified model the measured preferential flow infiltration process in the three sample trees were compared with the values predicted by the unified model as shown in fig 9 the fitting coefficients between the measured and predicted values of the four eucalyptus plantations were close to 1 indicating that the unified model had a good predictive effect on the preferential flow the short rotation eucalyptus plantations the good prediction of unified model further showed that roots had a considerable effect on preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations 5 conclusions in this study total infiltration and matrix infiltration in adjacent areas were measured by using a surface positioned double ring infiltrometer the preferential flow infiltration processes in four aged 1 2 3 and 5 years eucalyptus plantations were determined by calculating the differences between the processes of total infiltration and matrix infiltration the results showed that iir sir and ci increased during short rotation of eucalyptus plantation the root biomass was significantly and positively correlated with iir p 0 05 sir p 0 01 and ci p 0 01 but the correlations between tp and iir sir and ci were all not significant p 0 05 preferential flow increased with root biomass mainly because of root induced lateral preferential flow in the three infiltration models the horton model had a higher stability and accuracy than the other two parameter models kostiakov model and philip model regression analysis was used in determining the parameters of the horton model with considering root biomass and then the unified model of preferential flow in short rotation eucalyptus plantations was constructed the unified model and correlation results demonstrated the significant effect of root biomass on preferential flow of eucalyptus plantations our results revealed a theoretical basis for improving the

1804,as an important part of the hydrological cycle preferential flow significantly improves infiltration properties and limits the ability of soil to store filter and buffer water however the effect of roots on the preferential flow infiltration process in forest ecosystems is still unclear this study measured the preferential flow infiltration process in short rotation eucalyptus plantations four forest ages of 1 2 3 and 5 years with the surface positioned double ring infiltrometer in south subtropical area china overall the cumulative infiltration ci initial infiltration rate iir and stable infiltration rate sir increased with forest age the ci iir and sir of the 5 year old eucalyptus plantation were the highest in four aged eucalyptus plantations correlation analysis showed that root biomass was positively and significantly correlated with ci p 0 05 iir p 0 01 and sir p 0 01 which showed that the preferential flow increased with root biomass however the correlations between total porosity tp and iir sir and ci were all not significant p 0 05 the dye coverage of the inner and outer ring tangents which were used to observe the strength of lateral preferential flows was significantly and positively correlated with ci p 0 01 iir p 0 01 and sir p 0 01 the dye coverage of the outer ring tangent was significantly and positively correlated with root biomass p 0 05 so the lateral preferential flows depended on root biomass and increased with forest age the horton model which had higher stability and accuracy than the kostiakov and philip models was the most suitable model to describe the preferential flow infiltration process in eucalyptus plantations as important factors influencing the evolution of preferential flow in eucalyptus plantation root biomass was used in predicting the parameters of the horton model through regression analysis then a unified model predicting the preferential flow infiltration process in short rotation eucalyptus plantations was proposed and verified this study achieved the quantitative measurement of preferential flow infiltration process explored the importance of roots in the production of preferential flow channels and found the lateral preferential flow played an important role in infiltration in forests these results can provide a theoretical basis for improving the efficiency of water resource management in plantation and optimizing the model of preferential flow infiltration process in plantation keywords preferential flow plantation root model double ring data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction preferential flow is defined as the physical movement of solutes and water along certain pathways while bypassing most of the soil porous matrix hendrickx and flury 2001 beven and german 2013 accounting for about 15 85 of the soil total infiltration laine kanlio et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 preferential flow was an important part in the regional and global water cycle hirmas et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 preferential flow improves soil infiltration property thereby reducing surface runoff and soil erosion allaire et al 2011 increasing groundwater recharge and slowing down soil degradation kan et al 2020 meanwhile preferential flow shortens the contact time between water and soil and limits the ability of soil to store filter and buffer water alakukku et al 2010 laine kaulio et al 2015 thus reducing the water and nutrient utilization rates of plants clothier et al 2007 luo et al 2019 and increasing the risk of groundwater pollution weiler 2017 therefore the study of preferential flow is essential to improving the utilization efficiency of water resource comprehensively evaluating the benefits of soil and water conservation and preventing and controlling groundwater pollution which has been a global concern kulasekera et al 2011 the macropores accounted for only a small proportion of soil beven and german 2013 moret and arrue 2007 are formed in many ways such as root growth chemical weathering and drying wetting and freezing thawing cycles hardie et al 2011 li et al 2020 chen et al 2021 thereinto root growth is considered as an important way forming macropores nespoulous et al 2019 both decaying and living roots can form preferential root channels or continuous macropores and promote the movement of water and solutes with slight resistance gaiser 1952 jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 root exudates enhance soil aggregation that form inter aggregate macropores luo et al 2018 root channels account for 70 100 of the total amount of macropores in forest soils and serve as main paths of water and solute preferential transport newman et al 2004 noguchi et al 2017 the radii of developed forest roots are almost 10 times the canopy radius and the development of forest roots lead to a wide distribution range and high degree differentiation of preferential flow in forest soils and produced a higher lateral preferential flow lejeune et al 2004 ghestem et al 2011 liu et al 2021 and infiltration rate neris et al 2012 mongil manso et al 2021 to date many researchers conducted a lot of qualitative studies on the relationship between forest roots and preferential flow by using the dye tracer technique but mainly focusing on the relationship between the dye covers and root diameter luo et al 2018 root length density zhang et al 2015 and root weight density gang et al 2017 the effect of root biomass on the lateral preferential flow developing and the quantitative relationship between root biomass and preferential flow infiltration processes were still unclear as forest age increases plant root channels become deeper wider and denser facilitating preferential flow and increasing the permeability of forest soils tobella et al 2014 deuchars et al 1999 measured soil infiltration rate by single ring infiltrometer to study the change in soil infiltration rate during rainforest regeneration after pastures were abandoned in the san luis valley in central america their results showed that soil infiltration rate increased with forest age because the root activities in the forests increased soil porosity and decreased soil bulk density greenwood and buttle 2014 and archer et al 2016 also found the saturated hydraulic conductivity was increased with forest age in southern ontario and temperate forests because root biomass and macroporosity increased kalhoro et al 2018 showed that forests and grasslands had positive effects on soil infiltration because of increasing root biomass and total porosity tp in the hilly areas of the loess plateau and the effects strengthened as planting age increased shi et al 2021 found that plant age could significantly affect soil hydraulic properties and root development significantly promoted soil infiltration by using meta analysis they proposed that the correlation between tp and infiltration was not significant while the high correlation with non capillary porosity above studies mainly focused on the changes of total infiltration with forest age but not distinguishing the matrix infiltration and preferential flow some studies found the similar change of preferential flow with forest age cheng et al 2014 and ma et al 2022 studied the vertical distribution characteristics of soil preferential paths in differently aged chinese fir plantations and caragana korshinskii plantations by using the dye tracer method respectively their results showed that the preferential flow path depths and dye covers increased with increasing forest age because of root mass and number increasing so the root system of forest continuously developed with the increase of forest age to increase the root biomass and then affecting the preferential flow path and promoting the total infiltration and preferential flow however previous studies were confined to qualitatively analyze dye covers by using the dye tracer method quantitively analysis and predicting model with considering root characteristics at different forest age were lacked on studying preferential flow many methods have been developed and applied for studying preferential flow such as dye tracer technique nespoulous et al 2019 time domain reflectometry oberdörster et al 2010 3d x ray computed tomography ct sammartino et al 2012 magnetic resonance imaging votrubová et al 2003 and ground penetrating radar di prima et al 2020 the dye tracer technique is the most commonly used method in studying preferential flow and allows the direct observation evaluation and analysis of the path quantity and distribution of preferential flow jiang et al 2019 zhang 2017 and zhang et al 2019 proposed a surface positioned double ring infiltrometer for determining the preferential flow infiltration process and measuring difference in total infiltration and matrix infiltration in adjacent areas they observed the distribution of preferential paths and successfully measured the preferential flow infiltration process in 50 year old robinia pseudoacacia in the loess plateau china compared with other methods zhang s method is relatively economic simple and easy to operate and can accurately quantify the infiltration processes of preferential flow tao et al 2019 in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region eucalyptus plantations constitute 34 91 of the total plantation area and eucalyptus contributes to 49 97 of harvested timber stock volume zhang and wang 2021 owing to the short rotation of eucalyptus plantation 5 7 years eucalyptus plantations require continuous management while release active allelopathic substances which inhibit the growth of understory vegetation resulting in sparse understory vegetation engler et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 yao et al 2021 thus eucalyptus plantations hydrological cycles were heavy disturbed and causing problems in water environments deng et al 2020 therefore studying on preferential flow and its control mechanism in eucalyptus plantation is essential to investigate the water ecological security in the region simultaneously the measurement of preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations is difficult in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region due to the large number of mountains and inconvenient transportation han and song 2020 a unified model describing the preferential flow infiltration process in short rotation eucalyptus plantations is urgently needed which can improve measurement efficiency and reduce experiment cost thus combined with the findings of previous studies a hypothesis was proposed the growth of root system with forest age could promote the forming of lateral preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations and the preferential flow infiltration process from this we present the following objectives 1 to quantify the preferential flow infiltration process in four aged eucalyptus plantations 2 to assess the effect of root biomass and tp on preferential flow and 3 to establish a unified model with considering root biomass for predicting the preferential flow in short rotation eucalyptus plantations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area four aged eucalyptus plantations at the state owned dongmen forest farm 107 15 108 00 e 22 17 22 30 n in chongzuo city in china were selected as study objects fig 1a the annual rainfall and evaporation are 1100 1300 mm and 1192 1724 mm respectively rainfall events mainly occur from june to august accounting for 51 03 of the annual rainfall the average annual temperature is 21 c the soil is lateritic red soil with ph of 4 0 6 0 the soil has a clear development differentiation profile and good hydrothermal conditions 2 2 experiment design four eucalyptus urophylla e grandis plantations planted in may in 2020 2019 2018 and 2016 were selected as experimental forests table 1 and the gradient of forest age represented the different growth stage of eucalyptus plantations in short rotation ouyang et al 2021 in each plantation a 20 m 20 m experimental area was set and three experimental plots 2 m 3 m were set along the diagonal randomly the four corners of each experimental plot consisted of four eucalyptus trees as shown in fig 1b the measurement place of matrix infiltration was the center of each experimental plot three of four adjacent eucalyptus were selected as the sample trees namely nine sample trees in each experiment plot given that the root systems of eucalyptus plantations are mainly distributed within 1 m2 from the center of the trunk viera et al 2012 laclau et al 2013 a flat and grassless place that was 0 5 m away from the trunk was selected as the measurement point of total infiltration three matrix infiltration measurements and nine total infiltration measurements were performed in each plot all eucalyptus plantations were the first generation of seedling forests the cluttered shrubs or weeds shoveled were cut every 1 year the spaces and intra spaces in all plantations were 2 m 3 m eucalyptus have been planted in the four experimental areas since 2001 and our experiments were performed in august 2021 2 3 soil samples analysis and root biomass estimation three points were randomly selected diagonally in each eucalyptus plantations plots to excavate soil profiles because the soil layer below 60 cm of lateritic red soil is a parent material layer and the depth of soil subsoiling was mostly 50 60 cm in eucalyptus plantation fu and li 1993 santos and reichert 2022 soil samples of 0 60 cm soil layer were collected to use in laboratory analysis in this study three replicate samples were collected at three layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm of each soil profile for measuring soil water content swc bulk density bd soil particle density ds tp and soil texture these indicators of the whole soil profiles were counted with mean values of the three soil layers table 2 the soil samples for measuring swc were sealed immediately in airtight aluminum cylinders and swc was measured by the oven drying method in laboratory soils was measured for calculating bd were collected by the cutting ring 100 cm3 and oven dried at 105 c until constant weight for the other analyses the soil was sampled with a small shovel air dried removed roots and passed through a 2 mm sieve in the laboratory tp was calculated using eq 1 and soil particle density was measured by the pycnometer method 1 tp 1 b d d s 100 where tp is total porosity bd is bulk density g cm 3 and ds is soil particle density g cm 3 soil texture was determined using a mastersizer 3000 analyzer malvern instruments the ranges of sand silt and clay in the four plantations were 11 01 29 39 51 43 59 89 and 14 57 37 56 respectively according to the usda texture classification the forest soils of the four plots were loam soil wang et al 2015 arranged 15 sample plots of eucalyptus plantation by using the grid method 100 km 100 km in guangxi zhuang autonomous region each sample plot had three replicates 20 m 50 m the height diameter at breast height and crown breadth of a tree in each duplicate plot were measured a total of 18 eucalyptus trees with different ages and diameters at breast height were selected outside each plot for the measurement of root biomass the distribution level of diameter at breast height was considered during measurement then the optimized allometric model eq 2 was formulated on the basis of the dataset of root biomass and diameter at breast height of the eucalyptus plantations and used in estimating root biomass the root biomass of each sample tree was estimated with the optimized allometric model wang et al 2015 2 w r 0 06 d 1 771 r 2 0 85 where wr is root biomass kg and d is diameter at breast height cm in this study the diameter at breast height 1 3 m above ground level of the sample trees was measured with tape measure table 2 2 4 measurement and calculation method of preferential flow 2 4 1 measurement method of total infiltration and matrix infiltration a surface positioned double ring infiltrometer inner ring diameter of 30 cm outer ring diameter of 60 cm and both height of 8 cm was used to measure total infiltration and matrix infiltration zhang et al 2017a 2019 as shown in fig 2 a a flat measurement point was selected and carefully cleaned the litter for total infiltration measurement the double ring infiltrometer was gently hammered into the soil to a depth of about 1 cm by using a leveling ruler and a rubber hammer while ensuring that the rings remained horizontal the method requires the water level of the inner and outer rings keeping consistent the water of outer ring prevents the water of inner ring lateral seepage so that keeping a one dimensional vertical infiltration process in the inner ring zhang and li 2020 soil was stacked and compacted at the inner and outer walls to prevent water leakage from the bottoms of both rings two 5 cm 5 cm cardboards were placed in the inner and outer rings to buffer water flow and prevent damage for the surface soil structure at the beginning of the experiment the 4 g l 1 methylene blue solution was poured into the inner ring and the clean water was poured into the outer ring at the same time based on zhang s experience the heights of infiltration rings were set as 8 cm the measurement of soil matrix infiltration needed hammering into the soil of 1 cm and covering 3 cm thick soil sand mixture thus the maximum measurement water level of soil matrix infiltration was only 4 cm the initial water level of soil total infiltration kept be consistent with soil matrix infiltration simultaneously many researches also set a water level of 4 cm when using surface positioned double ring infiltrometer zhang 2017 huang et al 2018 tao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 and traditional double ring infiltrometer bodhinayake et al 2004 wu et al 2021 therefore both the initial water levels of soil total infiltration and matrix infiltration were 4 cm depth a stopwatch was used to record the time durations of each 1 cm water infiltration in inner ring throughout each experimental process water was appropriately added into the outer ring to maintain the water levels in the inner and outer rings consistent other details of the measurement of total infiltration could be found in previous studies tao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the surface positioned double ring infiltrometer with covering materials was used in measurement of soil matrix infiltration perroux and white 1988 indicated that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a covering material for sheltering preferential flow must be higher than that of the soil matrix in a tested plot to ensure that the infiltration process was controlled by the soil matrix and yuan 2018 found that the soil sand mixture as covering materials whose saturated hydraulic conductivities were higher than that of the soil matrix could well shelter preferential flow among them the higher the proportion of soil the better shielding effect on preferential flow the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil sand mixtures with different proportions 5 0 4 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 and 0 5 were pretested for the identification of optimal soil sand mixtures a series of laboratory experiments were conducted and obtained that the saturation hydraulic conductivities of topsoil 0 20 cm 216 mm h 1 128 mm h 1 121 mm h 1 and 98 mm h 1 of 1 2 3 and 5 year old eucalyptus plantations and that of 1 2 and 2 3 soil sand mixtures 238 mm h 1 and 112 mm h 1 according to the test results 3 cm thick soil sand mixtures 1 2 were uniformly spread over the areas of inner rings and the areas between inner and outer rings in the 1 2 and 3 year old eucalyptus plantations and 2 3 soil sand mixtures were used in the 5 year old eucalyptus plantation fig 2b to buffer the water flow geotextile and two 5 cm 5 cm cardboards were placed on the surface of soil sand mixture subsequent measurement procedures were same with those used in total infiltration using soil sand mixture effectively to block preferential flow ensures the accuracy of matrix infiltration measurement yuan 2018 zhao et al 2022 when no change in infiltration time was observed after three times of measurement the infiltration process was considered stable infiltration commonly the time of measurement is 1 5 h the infiltration rate was calculated with eq 3 3 i δ i δ t 600 where i denotes infiltration rate mm h 1 δi is the cumulative infiltration in the inner ring during δt time period cm and 600 is the conversion coefficient after 24 h of finishing the measurement of total infiltration and matrix infiltration 1 m 1 m soil profiles were excavated fig 2c and d a series of vertical soil profiles along the tangents of the outer ring the inner ring one fourth of the inner ring and half of the inner ring were respectively excavated then a series of horizontal soil profiles at depths of 5 10 20 and 30 cm from the soil surface according to the profile of the half outer ring were excavated the soil profiles were treated with photoshop cs6 adobe systems incorporated usa and imagej wayne rasband national institutes of health maryland usa for the quantification of the dyeing area yan and zhao 2016 the images were geometrically corrected with photoshop cs6 in accordance with the inner ring width and height of the soil profile each image was cropped to 30 cm 70 cm after the saturation brightness grayscale and threshold of the processing pictures were adjusted the color images were converted to black and white binary images which were used in calculating the proportion of the stained area to the entire profile with imagej 2 4 2 calculation principle of preferential flow owing to the small spatial variability of matrix infiltration in adjacent area das gupta et al 2006 zhang et al 2017a zhang 2017 and zhang et al 2019 proposed a principle for estimating the preferential flow infiltration process soil infiltration with many macropores consists of two parts soil matrix infiltration and preferential flow and soil matrix infiltration in the preferential flow measurement area can be replaced by that in the adjacent area therefore the formula for calculating the preferential flow is 4 i 2 p d q 2 p d t d q 2 d t d q 1 m d t i 2 t i 1 m where q1m represents the matrix infiltration of position 1 mm and q2m is the matrix infiltration of position 2 mm i2p is the infiltration rate of preferential flow of position 2 mm h 1 i 2 t is the infiltration rate of total infiltration of position 2 mm h 1 and i 1 m is the infiltration rate of matrix infiltration of position 1 mm h 1 other details of the calculation principle of preferential flow could be found in the study of zhang et al 2019 after the measurement of soil total infiltration and soil matrix infiltration in adjacent areas the preferential flow infiltration process can be obtained with eq 4 2 4 3 fitting model of preferential flow infiltration process the horton kostiakov and philip models were used to fit the measured preferential flow infiltration process the horton model considers the effect of soil surface conditions on infiltration property when describing the rainfall infiltration process horton 1941 5 i i f i 0 i f exp n t where i denotes infiltration rate mm h 1 t is infiltration time h if represents stable infiltration rate mm h 1 i0 represents initial infiltration rate mm h 1 and n is infiltration decay factor the kostiakov model is the most commonly used empirical model kostiakov 1932 its parameters have strong elasticity 6 i a t b where a and b are fitting parameters and a and b describe the infiltration rate at t time the philip model is a classical physical model for simulating infiltration philip 1957 however the fitting deviation of the philip model for long time infiltration is large 7 i 0 5 s t 0 5 a where s is the sorptivity mm h 0 5 and a is conceptually the stable infiltration rate mm h 1 in addition the expression of ci was obtained according to the functional relationship eq 8 between infiltration rate and ci 8 ci 0 t i t d t where ci is cumulative infiltration mm 2 4 4 unified model of preferential flow the establishment of a unified model for predicting the preferential flow infiltration process requires four steps 1 preferential flow infiltration process of six of the nine sample trees in each plantation were randomly selected and fitted by the horton kostiakov and philip models and determination coefficients r 2 were compared on the basis of the preferential flow infiltration process fitted by the three models for the identification of the model can characterize the preferential flow infiltration process 2 the measured values of cumulative infiltration ci initial infiltration rate iir and stable infiltration rate sir were compared with the analytical values estimated by the three models and the model with the highest fitting accuracy was selected as the basic model 3 the correlation between infiltration process and root biomass was analyzed and root biomass was used as an independent variable for predicting the original parameters of the basic model through regression analysis 4 a unified model was obtained for predicting the preferential flow infiltration process and the accuracy of the unified model was verified by other three trees 2 5 statistical analysis in this study iir is the average of the first 3 min of infiltration sir is the average of the last three infiltration rates and ci is cumulative infiltration of preferential flow within 1 5 h all data were presented as mean sd and the shapiro wilk test was used to verify the data conformed to the normal distribution one way analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in soil properties root biomass ci iir and sir of eucalyptus plantation of different ages the regression analysis was used to derive the regression equations predicting the model parameters the correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation among dye coverage of soil profiles along the tangents of inner and outer rings root biomass tp iir sir and ci 3 results 3 1 preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations of four ages the total infiltration and matrix infiltration of four eucalyptus plantations are shown in fig 3 the preferential flow infiltration process fig 4 was obtained with eq 4 the results showed that iirs were 4314 2708 mm h 1 4559 3504 mm h 1 5322 2120 mm h 1 and 8303 1978 mm h 1 respectively sirs were 63 44 mm h 1 82 57 mm h 1 167 72 mm h 1 and 283 90 mm h 1 respectively cis were 913 406 mm 890 512 mm 1470 387 mm 2226 514 mm for 1 2 3 and 5 year old eucalyptus plantations respectively the iir sir and ci increased with forest age fig 5 the iir sir and ci of the 5 year old eucalyptus plantation were the highest in four plantations p 0 05 the infiltration capacity of the 1 and 2 year old eucalyptus plantations showed no significant difference and were lower than other plantations the infiltration processes of preferential flow were fitted with the horton model eq 5 kostiakov model eq 6 and philip model eq 7 in each plantation as shown in table 3 the variation coefficients of the three model parameters were higher than 10 showing that the preferential flow had high variability the r 2 of the three models were 0 77 0 98 horton model 0 70 0 99 kostiakov model and 0 67 0 99 philip model showing that the measured infiltration data accurately reflected the preferential flow infiltration process the fitting parameters if steady infiltration rate and i 0 initial infiltration rate of the horton model increased with forest age similar to the measured results the fitting parameter a steady infiltration rate of the philip model presented a large number of negative values because the model had a fixed attenuation coefficient of time 0 5 with limiting the attenuation rate of preferential flow liu et al 2011 thus the philip model was unable to fit the stable infiltration rate of the preferential flow 3 2 root biomass of eucalyptus plantations of four ages according to eq 2 the root biomass of the nine sample trees ranged from 0 74 kg to 9 39 kg in four eucalyptus plantations fig 6 the root biomass of the sample trees rapidly grew in the eucalyptus plantations especially in the second and third years the root biomass of the 5 year old eucalyptus plantation was the highest in four plantations the root biomass of the sample trees in 3 year old eucalyptus plantation was significantly higher than those of the 1 and 2 year old eucalyptus plantations p 0 05 4 discussions 4 1 effects of eucalyptus plantations of different planting ages on preferential flow the root systems of plants including living and decaying roots can produce root channels which account for 70 100 of the total of macropores in forest soils newman et al 2004 noguchi et al 2017 roots can change the size connectivity and distribution of soil pores thereby affecting the development of preferential flow in forest soils liu et al 2020 in our study the correlations between preferential flow and root biomass and tp were examined respectively in four forest age eucalyptus plantations iir had a significantly positive correlation to root biomass p 0 05 and sir and ci had highly significant and positive correlation to root biomass p 0 01 table 4 the results showed that root biomass increased with forest age and thus iir sir and ci increased these findings were consistent with those of previous studies archer et al 2016 leung et al 2017 plant roots promote the development of soil macropores in two main ways 1 the roots separate and squeeze the soil to form root channels by elongating interspersing and thickening liu et al 2020 2 when roots die the decaying xylem forms a tubular root channel because the decay of bark takes more time than the decay of xylem gaiser 1952 as forest age increases increase in root biomass promotes the formation of plant root channels and increases macropore network density and continuity thereby promoting preferential flow wu et al 2021 moreover plant roots in the upper layer of soil form more preferential root channels than those in the subsoil during plant root decay jørgensen et al 2002 liu et al 2020 resulting in a high iir owing to increase in root biomass with forest age root decay increases then leading to iir increase however the correlations between tp and iir sir and ci were all not significant p 0 05 the findings were inconsistent with some previous studies ren et al 2016 kalhoro et al 2018 their studies focused on soil total infiltration including matrix infiltration and preferential flow rather than preferential flow the macropores which were the pores through preferential flow accounted for only a small proportion of soil beven and german 2013 moret and arrue 2007 so preferential flow may be not significant with tp however other previous researches were consistent with our results shi et al 2021 jačka et al 2021 shi et al 2021 emphasized that non capillary porosity that is macropores plays a more important role in changes of infiltration than tp the macropores had a significant effect on the preferential transport of water the flow rate in which could be two to eight times higher than that in the soil matrix bouma 1982 wang et al 1994 shipitalo and gibbs 2000 zhang et al 2019 and small changes could affect the mutation of the preferential flow cheng et al 2018 jačka et al 2021 found that soil total infiltration and preferential flow in three plantations was not related to tp while significantly influenced by pore size distribution and connectivity in summary the preferential flow of eucalyptus plantations was mainly affected by its root and not significantly affected by tp the vertical and horizontal growth of plant roots leads to the formation of a large number of vertical and horizontal channels of preferential flow in the soil ghestem et al 2011 jiang et al 2018 after water infiltrates the soil water flows along the lateral coarse roots forming a rapid lateral preferential flow schwärzel et al 2012 guo et al 2020 this phenomenon was consistent with our findings as shown in fig 7 a and b some parts of the soil profiles along the tangents of the inner and outer rings were dyed and a clear root channel from the inner ring to the outer ring was observed the dyeing results showed that water infiltrating the inner ring flowed laterally outside of the inner ring through the root channels because of the lateral roots and formed a lateral preferential flow fig 7c zhang et al 2019 the soil profile dyeing area was quantified the dye coverages of the soil profiles along the tangents of the inner and outer rings were 1 13 28 10 and 0 06 4 73 the dye coverages of the soil profiles along the tangents of the inner and outer rings increased with forest age moreover correlation analysis showed that the dye coverage of the soil profiles along the tangents of inner and outer rings had an extremely significant and positive correlation to iir sir and ci p 0 01 and the dye coverage of the outer ring tangent was significantly and positively correlated with root biomass p 0 05 these results illustrated that the lateral preferential flow was controlled by the roots and increased with forest age eventually increasing preferential flow lateral root pathways became deep and wide as forest age increased promoting lateral preferential flow simultaneously the lateral preferential flow expanded the potential soil volume accessible to surface water enhancing preferential flow lange et al 2009 4 2 unified model of preferential flow our results indicated that the philip model is unsuitable for describing the sir of preferential flow because the fitting parameter a steady infiltration rate of the philip model presented a large number of negative values similar to the results of the previous studies zhang et al 2017b santra et al 2021 the measured iir sir and ci of the six sample trees in each plantation were individually compared with those fitted using the horton and kostiakov model and then the appropriate model was selected as shown in fig 8 a the iir estimated by fitting the results of the kostiakov model was extremely high and 6 24 times the measured iir given that the kostiakov model is a power function when the time was 0 the iir tended to have infinite values the iir estimated with the fitting results of the horton model was closer to the measured values the sir estimated by fitting the results of the horton and kosiakov models were 1 07 and 1 72 times the measured values respectively fig 8b the ci values estimated by the fitting results of the horton model were 0 93 times the measured values but the ci estimated by the fitting results of the kosiakov model was 2 10 times the measured values fig 8c in summary the iir sir and ci predicted by the horton model were closer to the measured values than those predicted by the kostiakov model wang et al 2017 showed that the fitting results of the three parameter model horton model were more accurate than those of the two parameter model kosiakov and philip models additional parameters adjust three parameter models and improve their accuracy by increasing the stability of the models and reducing interference and bias duan et al 2010 wang et al 2017 hence the horton model was selected as the basis of the unified model for the preferential flow in short rotation eucalyptus plantations root biomass was positively and significantly correlated with if p 0 01 and i0 p 0 05 respectively which were the parameters of the horton model the effects of root biomass on preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations were considered in the regression analysis for predicting the parameters if and i0 table 5 the parameter n is the infiltration decay factor haghighi et al 2010 and significantly positively correlated with the difference between initial and steady infiltration rates i 0 if p 0 01 thus the parameters if and i0 were used as independent variables in regression analysis for predicting the parameter n table 5 a unified model eq 14 predicting preferential flow in short rotation eucalyptus plantations was obtained 14 i 27 84 w r 29 13 217 92 w r 2 1356 62 w r 5341 26 exp 0 11 w r 2 0 85 w r 5 90 t where i represents infiltration rate mm h 1 t is infiltration time h and wr denotes root biomass kg the measurement results of the other three sample trees in each plantation were used in verifying and evaluating the effects of the unified model the measured preferential flow infiltration process in the three sample trees were compared with the values predicted by the unified model as shown in fig 9 the fitting coefficients between the measured and predicted values of the four eucalyptus plantations were close to 1 indicating that the unified model had a good predictive effect on the preferential flow the short rotation eucalyptus plantations the good prediction of unified model further showed that roots had a considerable effect on preferential flow in eucalyptus plantations 5 conclusions in this study total infiltration and matrix infiltration in adjacent areas were measured by using a surface positioned double ring infiltrometer the preferential flow infiltration processes in four aged 1 2 3 and 5 years eucalyptus plantations were determined by calculating the differences between the processes of total infiltration and matrix infiltration the results showed that iir sir and ci increased during short rotation of eucalyptus plantation the root biomass was significantly and positively correlated with iir p 0 05 sir p 0 01 and ci p 0 01 but the correlations between tp and iir sir and ci were all not significant p 0 05 preferential flow increased with root biomass mainly because of root induced lateral preferential flow in the three infiltration models the horton model had a higher stability and accuracy than the other two parameter models kostiakov model and philip model regression analysis was used in determining the parameters of the horton model with considering root biomass and then the unified model of preferential flow in short rotation eucalyptus plantations was constructed the unified model and correlation results demonstrated the significant effect of root biomass on preferential flow of eucalyptus plantations our results revealed a theoretical basis for improving the
