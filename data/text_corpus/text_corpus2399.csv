water from the source shah et al 2017 jha et al 2019 the utilizable surface freshwater supply is not enough to meet the water requirements of each and every industry yadav et al 2020 pillai et al 2020 shah and shah 2020 groundwater is cleaner than the surface water and embarks its critical importance in supplying water to streams and wetlands as well as providing water for manufacturing goods and products patel et al 2020 shah et al 2019a b c d e india is the largest user of groundwater in the world with an estimated usage of 230 cubic kilometers of groundwater per year over a quarter of the global total worldbank 2012 abbasnia et al 2018 studied about the groundwater quality evaluated the scaling and corrosiveness potential of drinking water samples from the villages of the chabahar city in iran we can infer from the study conducted on the sites about the scaling and corrosiveness potential of the water which of our main concern in the industrial utilization of the groundwater in our study the main focus of the study done by a abbasnia et al 2018 describes the various water quality indices that are lsi rsi psi ls and ai then lsi rsi psi ls and ai will be used to evaluate the water stability similarly these water indices will be calculated and used for the evaluation in the industrial uses a abbasnia et al 2018 ramakrishnaiah et al 2008 studied the groundwater in tumkur taluk karnataka state india where the author used various methodologies in the evaluation of the groundwater in the study area and used various norms suggested by international organizations which were then used to evaluate the groundwater the author has also approached this particular study in the mathematical procedure of finding the correlation between the parameters which will be used in our study in order to interpret the data obtained in industrial application shah et al 2018a b c carried out an evaluation of the water quality index wqi in the unai geothermal field situated in vansda taluka that belongs to the navsari district of gujarat state in india the investigation done was first of its kind carried out in unai geothermal field a total of 9 samples were collected from 3 different locations from the village and the main aim of the research work was to utilize the geothermal water for industrial and irrigation purposes various wqis like lsi rsi psi ls sar rsc kr sp and pi were calculated to define whether geothermal water can be used for the above mentioned purposes the wqi values indicate that for safe and relevant utilization of geothermal water ca2 ion concentration needs to be decreased slightly but cl f and na needs to be highly decreased the production process is mainly affected by the quality of raw materials and the quality of water available for the fabrication in an industry kirby et al 2003 normally the salt content sodium concentration acidity alkalinity and the hardness of water are the major parameters determining the water characteristics various chemical constituents may differ in their concentrations constituting groundwater most of the soluble elements in groundwater come from soluble minerals in the sedimentary rock formations and soils wantm 2005 moreover for most groundwaters more than 90 of the ions are represented by only a few major ionic species the negatively charged anions chloride cl sulphate so4 2 bicarbonate hco3 and nitrate no3 and the positively charged cations sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 as suggested by todd mays 2005 cl fe3 so4 2 no3 mn2 ph tds and hardness are the important chemical constituents to assess the suitability of water for industrial purposes among all the ions considered krishna kumar et al 2009 apart from this groundwater quality may change due to climatic condition variation water residence time materials of the aquifer and the augmentation from the soil during water percolation information about the subsurface geologic environments in which water is present can be generated by assessing water quality raju et al 2011 the use of geothermal energy as an additional source of energy gains greater importance considering the increasing demand for energy in india with its industries being the second highest consumer of water and the need to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel since the surface water supply from municipal sources is not sufficiently guaranteed industrial units tend to depend on groundwater shah et al 2019a b c d e shah et al 2019a b c d e darshna shah et al 2020 darshna et al 2020 industrial water requisition is hiking up briskly with rapid industrial development bharatiya et al 2019 furthermore significant growth in industries mainly focusing on water as the basic raw material piles up the water demand thus the main objective of this study is to evaluate the quality of groundwater hot springs with the help of available chemical data and to analyse its suitability for industrial uses water is being characterised on the bases of various plots piper plot stiff plot and ion balance study are prominent among them besides this dendrogram and durov interpretation were carried out emphatically 2 study area chasing up the need for non conventional energy resources leads to an inventory of 340 hot springs in india prominent among these are located in puga valley jammu kashmir state and tatapani chhattisgarh apart from these bakreshwar in w bengal and tantaloi hot springs previously in bihar now jharkhand are auspicious geothermal zones with their proximity close to urban agglomeration as shown in fig 1 bakreshwar is a village in dubrajpur cd block in suri sadar subdivision of birbhum district in the state of west bengal west bengal is a state located in the eastern part of india and shares an international border with bangladesh the location coordinates of the bakreshwar village is 23 88 n 87 37 e the village s average elevation is 84 m i e 276 feet many of the hot springs are located in bakreshwar and near the village area the village experiencesannual total rainfall of 1298 mm mainly contributed by 1009 mm and 289 mm of monsoon and non monsoon precipitation respectively the western area of birbhum district being a part of chhota nagpur plateau is a bushy region and merges with the alluvial farmlands in the east geographically the area in the north east end of the chhota nagpur plateau merges with the alluvial plains of the ganges as it slopes down the western portion is an undulating upland that is generally barren w bengal birbhum district 2019 the district also has a number of active industries silk and cotton harvesting lac harvesting rice and oilseed milling are among the principal ones moreover there are stone mining metalware and pottery manufacturing units also the thermal power plant of bakreshwar is also one of the only substantial industry national highway 2 via panagarh provides the accessibility to hot springs located in bakreshwar the ease of approach also includes neighbouring villages and towns of illambazar dubrajpur and suiri these hot springs are located 210 km from howrah by rail and 15 km west of suiri geology of a region plays an important role in its groundwater resources lithology thickness and structure of rock formations affect the occurrence movement and storage of groundwater there is no perennial river in the study area laterite and older alluvium cover up the major area the lithology changes abruptlyin the bolpur area from the rest of the birbhum district as it can be inferred from fig 3 featured granular zone with an average cumulative thickness of 100 m 110 m occurs with an average subsurface depth of 250 m 450 m chakrabarti et al 2016 groundwater occurred with suitable water table conditions in shallow aquifers and in the deep aquifer under confined conditions tantaloi dalahi and bara palasi are a group of hot springs that are located in dumka district jharkhand a state located in the eastern part of india dumka is coordinated at 24 28 n 87 21 e in jharkhand it has an average elevation of 137 m 449 feet the average annualrainfall is 1422 5 mm comprising of 1125 6 mm and 296 9 mm of normal monsoonand non monsoon precipitation respectively dumka has a predominantly undulating terrain with hard rocks under the ground the landscape of the district is characterised by long undulation ridges forming rugged and coarsely dissected topography between which runs the drainage channels kujur et al 2013 geomorphologically the district can broadly be divided into three well defined physically identifiable and genetically significant units 1 the hilly area 2 the rolling country or valleys and 3 thepediplained flat country the dumka district can be broadly subdivided into two hydrogeological units as in fig 2 depending upon the morpho genetic and lithological diversities and relative ground water capabilities of the aquifer belonging to different geological formations a fissured formation b porous formation the natural manifestation of geothermal water at bakreshwar show temperature of 35 c 67 c on the surface while the hot springs at tantaloi dalahi and bara palasi record temperature of 30 c 70 c at the surface d k mukhopadhyay and p b sarolkar 2012 this geothermal occurrence gains importance as a source of non conventional energy for the utility of the local population amongst the group

water samples have been studied for the purpose of investigation of the nature of water for drinking and irrigation and these water samples belong to different regions of the bakreshwar and tantoli area the characteristics of the water samples were estimated in the field of drinking and irrigation the water samples were preserved so that they do not reduce the rate of biological or chemical reactions using thermometric and electrometric methods the temperature and ph were measured in the field itself each water sample was evaluated in the laboratory after the sampling was done to check the concentration of different components the standard sampling method was used by the researchers to determine the concentration of the ions shah et al 2018a b c shah et al 2019a b c d ebib shah et al 2019 sircar et al 2015 4 results and interpretation to understand the hydrochemical evolution and to categorise the usage of groundwater the graphical representation of its paramount components i e crucial anions and cations play a vital role to evaluate the enrichment and variations of hydrochemical facies for the present study area piper trilinear diagram durov plot stiff diagram and ion balance plots were employed 4 1 hydrochemical facies in the fields of hydrogeology and groundwater examination piper plots otherwise called trilinear charts are incredible devices for envisioning the overall wealth of common ions in water samples even though there are other plot types that can indicate the abundance of particles in groundwater this plot type is particularly helpful because it enables you to plot multiple samples on the same plot in this way taking into consideration gathering water tests by groundwater facies and other criteria nowadays when groundwater is so nearly observed it is particularly critical to have a plot type like the piper plot that makes it simple to decide if it is appropriate for human use a piper plot has three segments a ternary chart in the lower left representing cations magnesium calcium and sodium in addition to potassium a ternary graph in the lower right representing anions chloride sulphate and carbonate in addition to bicarbonate and a diamond plot in the centre which is a matrix transformation of the two ternary outlines piper et al 1944 each sample in fig 4 is standardized to 100 aggregate of cations 100 and the entirety of anions 100 so the relative concentrations are on a percentage basis along the groundwater ﬂowpath it interacts with different materials and different ﬂuids which aﬀect its quality this water quality relies on different factors for example geography nature of bedrock soil environment and air precipitation huneau et al 2011 the plot plainly demonstrates how the samples are rich in na and k high na concentration in water samples could present a significant issue of corrosion in pipes bara palasi has 60 mg and 40 ca as cationic composition and 25 cl and 75 co3 hco3 as anionic composition the water of bara palasi plots near the left corner is rich in ca mg and hco3 and is the region of water of temporary hardness mahanta et al 2015 tantloi has 8 ca 12 mg and 80 na k as cation composition and 45 cl 30 co3 hco3 and 25 so4 agnikund and kharkund have more than 90 cationic composition as na k and anionic as 55 cl 12 so4 and 33 co3 hco3 tantloi agnikund and kharkund lying near the right side of the diamond may be considered saline groundwater tests showed a chemical composition ruled by sodium and chloride particles which generally speciﬁes a solid seawater inﬂuence pulido leboeuf 2004 chidambaram et al 2017 barapalasi a barapalasi c1 and dalahi have more than 90 cationic composition as na k anionic ratio cl so4 co3 hco3 is for barapalasi a 8 2 90 barapalasi c1 31 15 54 and dalahi 45 0 55 all of them being plotted at the lower corner of the diamond plot is primarily composed of alkali carbonates na k and hco3 co3 a stiff diagram is used for graphical representation of major anions and cations in the water sample typically in stiff diagram the polygonal shape is created from four parallel horizontal axes extending on either side of a vertical zero axis stiff et al 1951 cations are plotted on the left side of the vertical zero axis and anions are on the right side the concentration of ions is measured in meq l the total ionic content is equivalent to the total size of the pattern from fig 6 it s evident that most of the wells have major cation is na and k compared to other cations in anions most have more hco3 co3 ions except agnikund kharkund and tantloi they have more cl ion compare to others in barapalasi cations are very less compared to other wells so from all wells we can conclude that the water in these samples is freshwater and for agnikund kharkund and tantaloi we can say that they have influenced with deep water the trilinear durov plot is based on the percentage of major ion milliequivalents the cations and anions esteems are plotted on two separate triangular plots and the information focuses are anticipated onto a square lattice at the base of every triangle moreover the durov plot takes into consideration the immediate correlation of two other groundwater parameters ordinarily ph and the aggregate broken down solids tds since a large portion of the information focuses are on the end of the square lattice which recommends most of them gone for ion exchange k ravikumar somashekar r k and prakash 2015 if you see in fig 5 that tds esteems for all wells are between 300 and 400mq l the ph part of the plot reveals that groundwater in the study area is alkaline which is preferred for drinking ion balance diagram gives information about the concentration of cations and anions from inferring to the ion balance diagram plotted for the respective cations and anions of the various groundwater samples in fig 7 considering the cations the sodium ion is seen prevailing the category of cations which is supervened by lithiumion r s s nigerian 2016 majority quantities of na ions and li ions the corrosion and scale forming will not take place on a bigger scale as these ions do not affect majorly the process of scale formation and corrosion the major ions which are generally involved with the corrosion and scale formation are ca 2 and mg 2 ions which are present in our water samples in a minor amount however they will engage in the corrosion of metals and scale formation considering the ion balance diagram for the anions present in our groundwater samples in fig 7 the prevailing anions are bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl ions the presence of the bicarbonate ions in the water increases the temporary hardness of water which can be easily removed but may affect the metals if the water is not properly treated before employing higher concentrations of the bicarbonate ions increase the chances of film formation over the metals the presence of chloride ions is seen in various samples which will lead to pitting corrosion of the metals f ma the major anions which are engaged in corrosion and scale formation are carbonate co3 2 and sulphate so4 2 the quantities of these two ions co3 2 and so4 2 are adequate that they can cause serious scaling problems and corrosion to the metals so before employing the water it must be treated and permanent hardness of water must be removed prior to the usage of the water 4 2 characterisation of industrial water use 4 2 1 impact of water quality for industrial applications in immediate or backhanded geothermal applications there is a slow decrease in temperature this change in temperature is directly related to the reduction of salt solvency that further prompts scale formation on the internal wall of equipment the scale is less conductive so this abatement the heat flux transition through the walls of hardware prompting a lessening in productivity and overheating at last prompting gear failure krishnamurthy et al 2014 hence geochemical examination helps in avoiding potential risksin regards tothe scale arrangement issue this must be remembered while choosing material for various parts of orc like condenser vaporizer and turbine as indicated by working temperature and weight conditions choosing the material to be utilized is an extremely basic errand particularly for turbine body and distinctive areas like for change segment pipe column diffuser bowl inlet bell impeller shaft and shaft sleeves and wear rings and catapulting 4 2 2 defining norms for fitness for use in these rules enterprises are characterized as frameworks of water utilizing forms in which qualification for utilization of the water is surveyed as far as the standards recorded underneath its potential for causing damage to equipment for example corrosion abrasion problems it may cause in the manufacturing process for example precipitates colour changes impairment of product quality for example taste discolouration the complexity of waste handling as a result of using water of the quality available process types include cooling steam production process water solvent diluent carrier product water as in beverages utilities domestic fire protection and wash water table 1 can be summarized for the above mentioned parameters 4 2 3 identify water related problems potential water related issues related to different industrial procedures are given in the table underneath the following table also relates parameters that affect mainly three processes in an industry namely 1 the damage that is dealt withthe equipments and devices 2 main problems related to manufacturing line and or processing 3 the final damage that is caused to a product as a result of improper processing some of the most common water utilization operations with the above listed complications are discussed in detail in table 1 dept of water affairs and forestry 1996 4 2 4 identification constituents that contribute to problems the water quality issues recorded in the table above can be related to constituents that add to them much of the time water quality issues are not only related to the presence of a variable as well with the collaboration between factors similar to the case with corrosion and scaling table 2 shown underneath displays the constituents which might be related to water related issues in industrial procedures the most striking feature of the below table is clearly an indication for corrosion with its dependency on a wide range of parameters apart from this scaling and blockage issues adds up to its dependency on correlated factors 4 2 5 produce water quality guidelines water quality rules for the four classifications of industrial processes have been assembled as far as the constituents recorded above dept of water affairs and forestry 1996 obviously there are numerous different constituents for example overwhelming or heavy metals phenols and natural substances which can unfavourably influence the qualification for utilization of the water these are not ordinarily present in huge fixations and rules are consequently not given in the uncommon circumstance where such constituents might be huge they should be considered on a site particular premise 5 statistical analysis 5 1 bivariate plots a significant fluctuating relationship is being uncovered among various hydrogeochemical parameters at the seven unique destinations using bivariate plots the plot in fig 8 a shows the data points of all the geothermal wells are clustered in the region of evaporite dissolutions for na normalized mg2 on the other hand the groundwater samples lie in between the evaporite dissolution and silicate weathering for the bivariate plot of na normalized hco3 inferring from fig 8b evaporites are the stone framed as encourages by vanishing of saline water shah et al 2018a b c the evaporation and subsequent precipitation of saline water results in the evaporites rock formation halites anhydrites and gypsum are the main constituents of evaporites for the current study area dissolution of evaporites consisting mainly of halites i e nacl results in a higher concentration of na ions a bivariate plot ref fig 8c was created for hco3 and so42 corrected with ca2 and mg2 to get the rid of the effect of latter cations from carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering versus cl corrected with na that eradicates the evaporite dissolution effect sako et al 2018 biswas et al 2012 for the above plot if it would be an active aquifer with a good potential of cation exchange capacity the slope of the best fit model would be 1 i e tan ø 1 y x on a supporting note the current study bears a slope of 1 0483 i e tan ø 1 0483 y 1 0483x 100 15 implying that the groundwater shows active cation exchange capability the other plot ref fig 8d for cl to na can be analyzed and if the trendline takes an upslope of 1 then it would imply for the meteoric origin the present geothermal wells show the trendline with a lower slope and bending towards na ion concentration w air m aloupi and p gaganis 2015 selvakumar et al 2016 the enrichment of na ion may occur from the dissolution of silicate mineral and or cation exchange ability hence the cation exchange potential can be correlated with the previous bivariate plot 5 2 multivariate analyses multivariate measurable methods have been broadly used to encourage the arrangement of ecological issues and recommend proof for the comprehension of some characteristic and anthropogenic procedures s selvakumar n chandrasekar and g kumar 2017 correlation analysis ca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca have been extensively utilized as impartial methods in the investigation of water quality data for illustration significant data r s society ray et al 2016 box et al 1978 chapman 1996 shrivastava and patil 2002 singh et al 2005 5 2 1 pearsons correlation pearson correlation coefficient v i i mathematical and e iii 1895 also referred to as pearson s r is a measure of a linear relationship between any two variables or measures of strength of association between those two variables i journal o f environmental 2012 the value of r ranges from 1 to 1 nag et al 2017 1 alludes to total negative linear correlation 0 alludes to no correlation and 1 alludes to total positive linear correlation the correlation matrix is utilized to explore the reliance between various variables at the same time the outcome is a table 3 containing the correlation coefficients between every variable and the others the correlation coefficients of different water quality parameters were computed and the estimations of the correlation coefficients are given in table 4 as indicated by the pearson s correlation tests demonstrating r 0 7 are thought to be strongly correlated though r in the scope of 0 45

which uses hierarchical clustering in this scheme data is classified into clusters and interrelated as per the similarities shown by them it is a tree diagram consisting of different branches called a clade each clade is made up of one or more leaves clades having similarities are depicted at the same height dissimilarities increases with increasing height difference the bottom up or hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac is the most used procedure for classification here each data will be considered as a single cluster further we merge two or more individual clusters into a new cluster based on their similarity k p singh a malik d mohan and s sinha 2004 in the given dendrogram fig 9 b we can see the correlation of different chemical constituents and properties of water obtained from seven different places the clusters b total fe no3 mg ec ca k th f ph li so4 are connected at a height near to zero depicting similarity among them the other cluster of co3 cl and na are formed at the same height as earlier one portraying an equal amount of similarity the third cluster of cl na sio2 is formed at a height more than the previous two showing lesser similarity the last cluster is linked at the farthest distance from zero illustrating the least similarity alberto et al 2001 in other fig 9a the disparity between water samples from different places is depicted cluster of agnikund kharkund and dalahi shows the maximum similarity on the other hand barapalasi shows extreme variability fig is the dendrogram linking the wells on the basis of their properties it can be deduced that well agnikund kharkund and dalahi show good linkage as do wells barapalasi and barapalasi c1 while there is high variation in measured properties of water from well barapalasi a as compared to other wells this variation also pertains to the underground geology thus the linkage diagram or dendrogram helps in associating areas with similar properties 6 water quality indices a number of water quality indexes have been used to predict whether water will corrode materials used in distribution systems or home plumbing units in most cases these indexes are used as a criterion for water treatment control but they can also be used as a guide to the selection of materials their principal advantage is simplicity but they are not always perfect predictors long term tests of materials are costlier to conduct but provide more direct evidence of water quality and its potential to corrode given materials s drinking w committee d water and n a press 2018 6 1 the langelier saturation index the langelier saturation index lsi may be a strict equilibrium model derived from the theoretical idea of saturation water is claimed to be saturated with carbonate once it will neither dissolve or precipitate calcium carbonate scale this equilibrium condition relies upon undisturbed water at a constant temperature that is allowed to stay undisturbed for an infinite amount of your time water is said to be under saturated if it will dissolve an existing carbonate substrate if left at rest for identical infinity saturated water can precipitate ca and carbonate from water if allowed to rest the langelier saturation index gives an indicator of a water s degree of saturation with an estimate to ca carbonate lsi ph p h s rsi 2 p h s ph langlier 1936 p h s 9 3 a b c d a l o g 10 tds 1 10 0 15 b 13 12 l o g 10 c o 273 34 55 c l o g 10 c a 2 a s c a c o 3 0 4 d l o g 10 a l k a l i n i t y a s c a c o 3 on the calculation of the lsi for the given well data we can see from table 5 and table 6 that generally the groundwater that is obtained is slightly scale forming and corrosive in nature the general trend of the calculated values of lsi ranges from 0 027 to 0 63 if we carefully see in the case of bara palasi c1 the results that we get from lsi says that water is having a serious tendency to corrode the metal hence we can conclude from the lsi that the groundwater obtained cannot be directly employed for industrial purposes it must be treated in order to get employed in the industry 6 2 ryznar stability index the ryznar stability index aims to attempt to correlate an empirical information base of scale thickness discovered in municipal water systems to the water chemistry just like the langelier saturation index the ryznar stability index has its basis within the construct of saturation level ryznar tried to quantify the link between calcium carbonate saturation state and scale formation 6 2 1 indications on computing the rsi for the given well data we infer from tables 7 and 8 about the groundwater that it is very corrosive in nature which makes according to the rsi not suitable for industrial employment the results obtained from the ryznar stability index advise that groundwater can corrode or in the worst case scenario the corrosion is intolerable therefore groundwater must be treated before its use in the industries 6 3 puckorius scaling index the puckorius or practical scaling index seeks to more quantify the connection between saturation state and scale formation by incorporating an estimate of the buffering capacity of the water into the index the previously mentioned saturation derived indices solely account for the propulsion for carbonate scale formation they do not account for the two different essential parameters the buffering capacity of the water and the maximum amount of precipitate that may form in bridging the water to equilibrium 6 3 1 indications on computing the psi for the given well data we infer from table 9 about the groundwater that it has mild effects of corrosion on metals as well as steels this might raise problems when the groundwater is employed into industrial uses water should be treated properly before employing it into industrial uses 6 4 larson skold index the larson skold index ls describes the corrosivity of water towards mild steel the index relies upon the evaluation of in situ corrosion of mild steel transport lines in systems transporting waters the index is that the ratio of equivalents per million epm of sulphate so4 and chloride cl to the equivalents per millions of alkalinities within the form bicarbonate and carbonate hco3 co3 6 4 1 indications on further deducing the results from the larson skold index we infer that the groundwater which is available may have high rates of localized corrosion or majorly the presence of chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 are unlikely to interfere with the formation of protecting film as it can be deduced from table 10 so we can infer that according to larson skold index the groundwater available might be used but odds in favor of employing the water in industrial use are not high 6 5 aggressive index the aggressive index ai originally developed for observation water in the asbestos pipe is usually replaced for the langelier index as a sign of the corrosivity of water 26 the ai is derived from the actual ph calcium hardness and total alkalinity where it is applicable it is simpler and more convenient than the lsi because the ai doesn t embody the consequences of temperature or dissolved solids it is less correct as an analytical tool than the lsi 6 5 1 indications the aggressive index does not include the effects of temperature or dissolved solids it is less accurate as an analytical tool than the lsi so if we infer from the calculations based on the aggressive index we can infer that the groundwater which is obtained is non aggressive in nature as shown in table 11 which contradicts the results inferred from langelier saturation index 7 conclusion 8 this study was led to assess factors controlling groundwater quality in a territory with industrial utilization as main use the current study in consideration with seven geothermal hot springs revealed its incompatibility for direct industrial purposes based on several different hydro geochemical parameters assessment of thermal hotsprings was initiated in the different districts of w bengal and jharkhand india conclusion can be derived from result of hydrochemical facies analysis in which most samples are unsuitable for employing in manufacturing units as the principal strategy was to investigate out the water sample which is genuinely fit for industrial practices results concluded that bakreshwar and tantloi ground water aren t suitable for usagebecause it doesn t fall within the permissible limits of wqi on a supporting note bivariate plots and statistical analysis when correlated with standard industrial water usage guidelines conclusion can be derived that most of the thermal hot springs samples are unsuitable for their usage including samples from major geothermal regions of bakreshwar as well as tantloi moreover the water quality index wqi based on the various anions and cations compositions supports the analysis on complete evaluation results indicated that the collected samples are highly aggressive and scale forming in nature that could damage potential equipment and thus it cannot be exploited specifically for manufacturing units on the basis of correlation index dendrogram analysis hierarchical cluster analysis it can be interpreted how different physio chemical parameters are related to each other and revealed that high values of sodium na and calcium ca2 along with chloride cl dominance maybe the result of intrusion of seawater at different parts of study area since the proximity of each location from the coast is high it could be the result of anthropogenic activities or due the mineral compositions of sedimentary facies however water samples having slightly high sodium ion na concentration can be used depending on the industries requirements of groundwater besides this water quality indices also support its indirect employment which could be tackled by the pre treatment processes such as desalination and ion exchange process availability of data and material

in iran we can infer from the study conducted on the sites about the scaling and corrosiveness potential of the water which of our main concern in the industrial utilization of the groundwater in our study the main focus of the study done by a abbasnia et al 2018 describes the various water quality indices that are lsi rsi psi ls and ai then lsi rsi psi ls and ai will be used to evaluate the water stability similarly these water indices will be calculated and used for the evaluation in the industrial uses a abbasnia et al 2018 ramakrishnaiah et al 2008 studied the groundwater in tumkur taluk karnataka state india where the author used various methodologies in the evaluation of the groundwater in the study area and used various norms suggested by international organizations which were then used to evaluate the groundwater the author has also approached this particular study in the mathematical procedure of finding the correlation between the parameters which will be used in our study in order to interpret the data obtained in industrial application shah et al 2018a b c carried out an evaluation of the water quality index wqi in the unai geothermal field situated in vansda taluka that belongs to the navsari district of gujarat state in india the investigation done was first of its kind carried out in unai geothermal field a total of 9 samples were collected from 3 different locations from the village and the main aim of the research work was to utilize the geothermal water for industrial and irrigation purposes various wqis like lsi rsi psi ls sar rsc kr sp and pi were calculated to define whether geothermal water can be used for the above mentioned purposes the wqi values indicate that for safe and relevant utilization of geothermal water ca2 ion concentration needs to be decreased slightly but cl f and na needs to be highly decreased the production process is mainly affected by the quality of raw materials and the quality of water available for the fabrication in an industry kirby et al 2003 normally the salt content sodium concentration acidity alkalinity and the hardness of water are the major parameters determining the water characteristics various chemical constituents may differ in their concentrations constituting groundwater most of the soluble elements in groundwater come from soluble minerals in the sedimentary rock formations and soils wantm 2005 moreover for most groundwaters more than 90 of the ions are represented by only a few major ionic species the negatively charged anions chloride cl sulphate so4 2 bicarbonate hco3 and nitrate no3 and the positively charged cations sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 as suggested by todd mays 2005 cl fe3 so4 2 no3 mn2 ph tds and hardness are the important chemical constituents to assess the suitability of water for industrial purposes among all the ions considered krishna kumar et al 2009 apart from this groundwater quality may change due to climatic condition variation water residence time materials of the aquifer and the augmentation from the soil during water percolation information about the subsurface geologic environments in which water is present can be generated by assessing water quality raju et al 2011 the use of geothermal energy as an additional source of energy gains greater importance considering the increasing demand for energy in india with its industries being the second highest consumer of water and the need to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel since the surface water supply from municipal sources is not sufficiently guaranteed industrial units tend to depend on groundwater shah et al 2019a b c d e shah et al 2019a b c d e darshna shah et al 2020 darshna et al 2020 industrial water requisition is hiking up briskly with rapid industrial development bharatiya et al 2019 furthermore significant growth in industries mainly focusing on water as the basic raw material piles up the water demand thus the main objective of this study is to evaluate the quality of groundwater hot springs with the help of available chemical data and to analyse its suitability for industrial uses water is being characterised on the bases of various plots piper plot stiff plot and ion balance study are prominent among them besides this dendrogram and durov interpretation were carried out emphatically 2 study area chasing up the need for non conventional energy resources leads to an inventory of 340 hot springs in india prominent among these are located in puga valley jammu kashmir state and tatapani chhattisgarh apart from these bakreshwar in w bengal and tantaloi hot springs previously in bihar now jharkhand are auspicious geothermal zones with their proximity close to urban agglomeration as shown in fig 1 bakreshwar is a village in dubrajpur cd block in suri sadar subdivision of birbhum district in the state of west bengal west bengal is a state located in the eastern part of india and shares an international border with bangladesh the location coordinates of the bakreshwar village is 23 88 n 87 37 e the village s average elevation is 84 m i e 276 feet many of the hot springs are located in bakreshwar and near the village area the village experiencesannual total rainfall of 1298 mm mainly contributed by 1009 mm and 289 mm of monsoon and non monsoon precipitation respectively the western area of birbhum district being a part of chhota nagpur plateau is a bushy region and merges with the alluvial farmlands in the east geographically the area in the north east end of the chhota nagpur plateau merges with the alluvial plains of the ganges as it slopes down the western portion is an undulating upland that is generally barren w bengal birbhum district 2019 the district also has a number of active industries silk and cotton harvesting lac harvesting rice and oilseed milling are among the principal ones moreover there are stone mining metalware and pottery manufacturing units also the thermal power plant of bakreshwar is also one of the only substantial industry national highway 2 via panagarh provides the accessibility to hot springs located in bakreshwar the ease of approach also includes neighbouring villages and towns of illambazar dubrajpur and suiri these hot springs are located 210 km from howrah by rail and 15 km west of suiri geology of a region plays an important role in its groundwater resources lithology thickness and structure of rock formations affect the occurrence movement and storage of groundwater there is no perennial river in the study area laterite and older alluvium cover up the major area the lithology changes abruptlyin the bolpur area from the rest of the birbhum district as it can be inferred from fig 3 featured granular zone with an average

water samples have been studied for the purpose of investigation of the nature of water for drinking and irrigation and these water samples belong to different regions of the bakreshwar and tantoli area the characteristics of the water samples were estimated in the field of drinking and irrigation the water samples were preserved so that they do not reduce the rate of biological or chemical reactions using thermometric and electrometric methods the temperature and ph were measured in the field itself each water sample was evaluated in the laboratory after the sampling was done to check the concentration of different components the standard sampling method was used by the researchers to determine the concentration of the ions shah et al 2018a b c shah et al 2019a b c d ebib shah et al 2019 sircar et al 2015 4 results and interpretation to understand the hydrochemical evolution and to categorise the usage of groundwater the graphical representation of its paramount components i e crucial anions and cations play a vital role to evaluate the enrichment and variations of hydrochemical facies for the present study area piper trilinear diagram durov plot stiff diagram and ion balance plots were employed 4 1 hydrochemical facies in the fields of hydrogeology and groundwater examination piper plots otherwise called trilinear charts are incredible devices for envisioning the overall wealth of common ions in water samples even though there are other plot types that can indicate the abundance of particles in groundwater this plot type is particularly helpful because it enables you to plot multiple samples on the same plot in this way taking into consideration gathering water tests by groundwater facies and other criteria nowadays when groundwater is so nearly observed it is particularly critical to have a plot type like the piper plot that makes it simple to decide if it is appropriate for human use a piper plot has three segments a ternary chart in the lower left representing cations magnesium calcium and sodium in addition to potassium a ternary graph in the lower right representing anions chloride sulphate and carbonate in addition to bicarbonate and a diamond plot in the centre which is a matrix transformation of the two ternary outlines piper et al 1944 each sample in fig 4 is standardized to 100 aggregate of cations 100 and the entirety of anions 100 so the relative concentrations are on a percentage basis along the groundwater ﬂowpath it interacts with different materials and different ﬂuids which aﬀect its quality this water quality relies on different factors for example geography nature of bedrock soil environment and air precipitation huneau et al 2011 the plot plainly demonstrates how the samples are rich in na and k high na concentration in water samples could present a significant issue of corrosion in pipes bara palasi has 60 mg and 40 ca as cationic composition and 25 cl and 75 co3 hco3 as anionic composition the water of bara palasi plots near the left corner is rich in ca mg and hco3 and is the region of water of temporary hardness mahanta et al 2015 tantloi has 8 ca 12 mg and 80 na k as cation composition and 45 cl 30 co3 hco3 and 25 so4 agnikund and kharkund have more than 90 cationic composition as na k and anionic as 55 cl 12 so4 and 33 co3 hco3 tantloi agnikund and kharkund lying near the right side of the diamond may be considered saline groundwater tests showed a chemical composition ruled by sodium and chloride particles which generally speciﬁes a solid seawater inﬂuence pulido leboeuf 2004 chidambaram et al 2017 barapalasi a barapalasi c1 and dalahi have more than 90 cationic composition as na k anionic ratio cl so4 co3 hco3 is for barapalasi a 8 2 90 barapalasi c1 31 15 54 and dalahi 45 0 55 all of them being plotted at the lower corner of the diamond plot is primarily composed of alkali carbonates na k and hco3 co3 a stiff diagram is used for graphical representation of major anions and cations in the water sample typically in stiff diagram the polygonal shape is created from four parallel horizontal axes extending on either side of a vertical zero axis stiff et al 1951 cations are plotted on the left side of the vertical zero axis and anions are on the right side the concentration of ions is measured in meq l the total ionic content is equivalent to the total size of the pattern from fig 6 it s evident that most of the wells have major cation is na and k compared to other cations in anions most have more hco3 co3 ions except agnikund kharkund and tantloi they have more cl ion compare to others in barapalasi cations are very less compared to other wells so from all wells we can conclude that the water in these samples is freshwater and for agnikund kharkund and tantaloi we can say that they have influenced with deep water the trilinear durov plot is based on the percentage of major ion milliequivalents the cations and anions esteems are plotted on two separate triangular plots and the information focuses are anticipated onto a square lattice at the base of every triangle moreover the durov plot takes into consideration the immediate correlation of two other groundwater parameters ordinarily ph and the aggregate broken down solids tds since a large portion of the information focuses are on the end of the square lattice which recommends most of them gone for ion exchange k ravikumar somashekar r k and prakash 2015 if you see in fig 5 that tds esteems for all wells are between 300 and 400mq l the ph part of the plot reveals that groundwater in the study area is alkaline which is preferred for drinking ion balance diagram gives information about the concentration of cations and anions from inferring to the ion balance diagram plotted for the respective cations and anions of the various groundwater samples in fig 7 considering the cations the sodium ion is seen prevailing the category of cations which is supervened by lithiumion r s s nigerian 2016 majority quantities of na ions and li ions the corrosion and scale forming will not take place on a bigger scale as these ions do not affect majorly the process of scale formation and corrosion the major ions which are generally involved with the corrosion and scale formation are ca 2 and mg 2 ions which are present in our water samples in a minor amount however they will engage in the corrosion of metals and scale formation considering the ion balance diagram for the anions present in our groundwater samples in fig 7 the prevailing anions are bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl ions the presence of the bicarbonate ions in the water increases the temporary hardness of water which can be easily removed but may affect the metals if the water is not properly treated before employing higher concentrations of the bicarbonate ions increase the chances of film formation over the metals the presence of chloride ions is seen in various samples which will lead to pitting corrosion of the metals f ma the major anions which are engaged in corrosion and scale formation are carbonate co3 2 and sulphate so4 2 the quantities of these two ions co3 2 and so4 2 are adequate that they can cause serious scaling problems and corrosion to the metals so before employing the water it must be treated and permanent hardness of water must be removed prior to the usage of the water 4 2 characterisation of industrial water use 4 2 1 impact of water quality for industrial applications in immediate or backhanded geothermal applications there is a slow decrease in temperature this change in temperature is directly related to the reduction of salt solvency that further prompts scale formation on the internal wall of equipment the scale is less conductive so this abatement the heat flux transition through the walls of hardware prompting a lessening in productivity and overheating at last prompting gear failure krishnamurthy et al 2014 hence geochemical examination helps in avoiding potential risksin regards tothe scale arrangement issue this must be remembered while choosing material for various parts of orc like condenser vaporizer and turbine as indicated by working temperature and weight conditions choosing the material to be utilized is an extremely basic errand particularly for turbine body and distinctive areas like for change segment pipe column diffuser bowl inlet bell impeller shaft and shaft sleeves and wear rings and catapulting 4 2 2 defining norms for fitness for use in these rules enterprises are characterized as frameworks of water utilizing forms in which qualification for utilization of the water is surveyed as far as the standards recorded underneath its potential for causing damage to equipment for example corrosion abrasion problems it may cause in the manufacturing process for example precipitates colour changes impairment of product quality for example taste discolouration the complexity of waste handling as a result of using water of the quality available process types include cooling steam production process water solvent diluent carrier product water as in beverages utilities domestic fire protection and wash water table 1 can be summarized for the above mentioned parameters 4 2 3 identify water related problems potential water related issues related to different industrial procedures are given in the table underneath the following table also relates parameters that affect mainly three processes in an industry namely 1 the damage that is dealt withthe equipments and devices 2 main problems related to manufacturing line and or processing 3 the final damage that is caused to a product as a result of improper processing some of the most common water utilization operations with the above listed complications are discussed in detail in table 1 dept of water affairs and forestry 1996 4 2 4 identification constituents that contribute to problems the water quality issues recorded in the table above can be related to constituents that add to them much of the time water quality issues are not only related to the presence of a variable as well with the collaboration between factors similar to the case with corrosion and scaling table 2 shown underneath displays the constituents which might be related to water related issues in industrial procedures the most striking feature of the below table is clearly an indication for corrosion with its dependency on a wide range of parameters apart from this scaling and blockage issues adds up to its dependency on correlated factors 4 2 5 produce water quality guidelines water quality rules for the four classifications of industrial processes have been assembled as far as the constituents recorded above dept of water affairs and forestry 1996 obviously there are numerous different constituents for example overwhelming or heavy metals phenols and natural substances which can unfavourably influence the qualification for utilization of the water these are not ordinarily present in huge fixations and rules are consequently not given in the uncommon circumstance where such constituents might be huge they should be considered on a site particular premise 5 statistical analysis 5 1 bivariate plots a significant fluctuating relationship is being uncovered among various hydrogeochemical parameters at the seven unique destinations using bivariate plots the plot in fig 8 a shows the data points of all the geothermal wells are clustered in the region of evaporite dissolutions for na normalized mg2 on the other hand the groundwater samples lie in between the evaporite dissolution and silicate weathering for the bivariate plot of na normalized hco3 inferring from fig 8b evaporites are the stone framed as encourages by vanishing of saline water shah et al 2018a b c the evaporation and subsequent precipitation of saline water results in the evaporites rock formation halites anhydrites and gypsum are the main constituents of evaporites for the current study area dissolution of evaporites consisting mainly of halites i e nacl results in a higher concentration of na ions a bivariate plot ref fig 8c was created for hco3 and so42 corrected with ca2 and mg2 to get the rid of the effect of latter cations from carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering versus cl corrected with na that eradicates the evaporite dissolution effect sako et al 2018 biswas et al 2012 for the above plot if it would be an active aquifer with a good potential of cation exchange capacity the slope of the best fit model would be 1 i e tan ø 1 y x on a supporting note the current study bears a slope of 1 0483 i e tan ø 1 0483 y 1 0483x 100 15 implying that the groundwater shows active cation exchange capability the other plot ref fig 8d for cl to na can be analyzed and if the trendline takes an upslope of 1 then it would imply for the meteoric origin the present geothermal wells show the trendline with a lower slope and bending towards na ion concentration w air m aloupi and p gaganis 2015 selvakumar et al 2016 the enrichment of na ion may occur from the dissolution of silicate mineral and or cation exchange ability hence the cation exchange potential can be correlated with the previous bivariate plot 5 2 multivariate analyses multivariate measurable methods have been broadly used to encourage the arrangement of ecological issues

linear correlation 0 alludes to no correlation and 1 alludes to total positive linear correlation the correlation matrix is utilized to explore the reliance between various variables at the same time the outcome is a table 3 containing the correlation coefficients between every variable and the others the correlation coefficients of different water quality parameters were computed and the

which uses hierarchical clustering in this scheme data is classified into clusters and interrelated as per the similarities shown by them it is a tree diagram consisting of different branches called a clade each clade is made up of one or more leaves clades having similarities are depicted at the same height dissimilarities increases with increasing height difference the bottom up or hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac is the most used procedure for classification here each data will be considered as a single cluster further we merge two or more individual clusters into a new cluster based on their similarity k p singh a malik d mohan and s sinha 2004 in the given dendrogram fig 9 b we can see the correlation of different chemical constituents and properties of water obtained from seven different places the clusters b total fe no3 mg ec ca k th f ph li so4 are connected at a height near to zero depicting similarity among them the other cluster of co3 cl and na are formed at the same height as earlier one portraying an equal amount of similarity the third cluster of cl na sio2 is formed at a height more than the previous two showing lesser similarity the last cluster is linked at the farthest distance from zero illustrating the least similarity alberto et al 2001 in other fig 9a the disparity between water samples from different places is depicted cluster of agnikund kharkund and dalahi shows the maximum similarity on the other hand barapalasi shows extreme variability fig is the dendrogram linking the wells on the basis of their properties it can be deduced that well agnikund kharkund and dalahi show good linkage as do wells barapalasi and barapalasi c1 while there is high variation in measured properties of water from well barapalasi a as compared to other wells this variation also pertains to the underground geology thus the linkage diagram or dendrogram helps in associating areas with similar properties 6 water quality indices a number of water quality indexes have been used to predict whether water will corrode materials used in distribution systems or home plumbing units in most cases these indexes are used as a criterion for water treatment control but they can also be used as a guide to the selection of materials their principal advantage is simplicity but they are not always perfect predictors long term tests of materials are costlier to conduct but provide more direct evidence of water quality and its potential to corrode given materials s drinking w committee d water and n a press 2018 6 1 the langelier saturation index the langelier saturation index lsi may be a strict equilibrium model derived from the theoretical idea of saturation water is claimed to be saturated with carbonate once it will neither dissolve or precipitate calcium carbonate scale this equilibrium condition relies upon undisturbed water at a constant temperature that is allowed to stay undisturbed for an infinite amount of your time water is said to be under saturated if it will dissolve an existing carbonate substrate if left at rest for identical infinity saturated water can precipitate ca and carbonate from water if allowed to rest the langelier saturation index gives an indicator of a water s degree of saturation with an estimate to ca carbonate lsi ph p h s rsi 2 p h s ph langlier 1936 p h s 9 3 a b c d a l o g 10 tds 1 10 0 15 b 13 12 l o g 10 c o 273 34 55 c l o g 10 c a 2 a s c a c o 3 0 4 d l o g 10 a l k a l i n i t y a s c a c o 3 on the calculation of the lsi for the given well data we can see from table 5 and table 6 that generally the groundwater that is obtained is slightly scale forming and corrosive in nature the general trend of the calculated values of lsi ranges from 0 027 to 0 63 if we carefully see in the case of bara palasi c1 the results that we get from lsi says that water is having a serious tendency to corrode the metal hence we can conclude from the lsi that the groundwater obtained cannot be directly employed for industrial purposes it must be treated in order to get employed in the industry 6 2 ryznar stability index the ryznar stability index aims to attempt to correlate an empirical information base of scale thickness discovered in municipal water systems to the water chemistry just like the langelier saturation index the ryznar stability index has its basis within the construct of saturation level ryznar tried to quantify the link between calcium carbonate saturation state and scale formation 6 2 1 indications on computing the rsi for the given well data we infer from tables 7 and 8 about the groundwater that it is very corrosive in nature which makes according to the rsi not suitable for industrial employment the results obtained from the ryznar stability index advise that groundwater can corrode or in the worst case scenario the corrosion is intolerable therefore groundwater must be treated before its use in the industries 6 3 puckorius scaling index the puckorius or practical scaling index seeks to more quantify the connection between saturation state and scale formation by incorporating an estimate of the buffering capacity of the water into the index the previously mentioned saturation derived indices solely account for the propulsion for carbonate scale formation they do not account for the two different essential parameters the buffering capacity of the water and the maximum amount of precipitate that may form in bridging the water to equilibrium 6 3 1 indications on computing the psi for the given well data we infer from table 9 about the groundwater that it has mild effects of corrosion on metals as well as steels this might raise problems when the groundwater is employed into industrial uses water should be treated properly before employing it into industrial uses 6 4 larson skold index the larson skold index ls describes the corrosivity of water towards mild steel the index relies upon the evaluation of in situ corrosion of mild steel transport lines in systems transporting waters the index is that the ratio of equivalents per million epm of sulphate so4 and chloride cl to the equivalents per millions of alkalinities within the form bicarbonate and carbonate hco3 co3 6 4 1 indications on further deducing the results from the larson skold index we infer that the groundwater which is available may have high rates of localized corrosion or majorly the presence of chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 are unlikely to interfere with the formation of protecting film as it can be deduced from table 10 so we can infer that according to larson skold index the groundwater available might be used but odds in favor of employing the water in industrial use are not high 6 5 aggressive index the aggressive index ai originally developed for observation water in the asbestos pipe is usually replaced for the langelier index as a sign of the corrosivity of water 26 the ai is derived from the actual ph calcium hardness and total alkalinity where it is applicable it is simpler and more convenient than the lsi because the ai doesn t embody the consequences of temperature or dissolved solids it is less correct as an analytical tool than the lsi 6 5 1 indications the aggressive index does not include the effects of temperature or dissolved solids it is less accurate as an analytical tool than the lsi so if we infer from the calculations based on the aggressive index we can infer that the groundwater which is obtained is non aggressive in nature as shown in table 11 which contradicts the results inferred from langelier saturation index 7 conclusion 8 this study was led to assess factors controlling groundwater quality in a territory with industrial utilization as main use the current study in consideration with seven geothermal hot springs revealed its incompatibility for direct industrial purposes based on several different hydro geochemical parameters assessment of thermal hotsprings was initiated in the different districts of w bengal and jharkhand india conclusion can be derived from result of hydrochemical facies analysis in which most samples are unsuitable for employing in manufacturing units as the principal strategy was to investigate out the water sample which is genuinely fit for industrial practices results concluded that bakreshwar and tantloi ground water aren t suitable for usagebecause it doesn t fall within the permissible limits of wqi on a supporting note bivariate plots and statistical analysis when correlated with standard industrial water usage guidelines conclusion can be derived that most of the thermal hot springs samples are unsuitable for their usage including samples from major geothermal regions of bakreshwar as well as tantloi moreover the water quality index wqi based on the various anions and cations compositions supports the analysis on complete evaluation results indicated that the collected samples are highly aggressive and scale forming in nature that could damage potential equipment and thus it cannot be exploited specifically for manufacturing units on the basis of correlation index dendrogram analysis hierarchical cluster analysis it can be interpreted how different physio chemical parameters are related to each other and revealed that high values of sodium na and calcium ca2 along with chloride cl dominance maybe the result of intrusion of seawater at different parts of study area since the proximity of each location from the coast is high it could be the result of anthropogenic activities or due the mineral compositions of sedimentary facies however water samples having slightly high sodium ion na concentration can be used depending on the industries requirements of groundwater besides this water quality indices also support its indirect employment which could be tackled by the pre treatment processes such as desalination and ion exchange process availability of data and material

et al 2016 around the globe 2 5 billion people depend on groundwater supplies to meet their basic needs margat and gun 2013 de chaisemartin et al 2017 in recent years due to the growing climate change threat to water supplies the importance of groundwater resources has increased climate change is one of the most important phenomena in today s world and has shown its effects intensely around the globe since the start of the twenty first century according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 due to human activities global warming has increased 1 c since pre industrial times and this rise is likely to reach 1 5 c between 2030 and 2052 possible effects of climate change are worrying since the climate is a very important factor controlling hydrologic cycle streamflow rate of rivers groundwater systems freshwater availability and related human life migration and socio economic features ipcc 2008 ipcc 2014 epa 2014 ipcc 2018 many research showed that streamflow rates of rivers decreasing at high rates bao et al 2012 givati et al 2019 dudley et al 2020 sun et al 2020 in various parts of the world while rapidly growing population cleland 2013 demands more accessible freshwater resources areas that are facing a possibility of water scarcity today and in the near future will depend more on available groundwater resources determination of groundwater resources can play an important role to raise regional awareness and decreasing eventual losses from a possible water shortage in this scope the determination of groundwater potential zones has become important at a global and especially regional level searching for groundwater and evaluating its usability usually conducted with geophysical surveys and borehole data these methods costs are relatively high and requires great amount of time and labor an efficient environment can be used for the integration of geographical parameters geographical information systems gis and remote sensing rs technologies are often used in the determination of groundwater potential zones to reduce the costs and support other surveys findings patra et al 2018 şener et al 2018 mallick et al 2019 murmu et al 2019 achu et al 2020 ajay kumar et al 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 the studies which combine gis and rs technologies with multi criteria decision making methods gave very good results on groundwater potential assessment in newly conducted studies arulbalaji et al 2019 qadir et al 2020 roy et al 2020 ahmad et al 2020 analytic hierarchy process ahp widely used and its reliability highly accepted in groundwater potential literature adiat et al 2012 mohammadi behzad et al 2019 diaz alcaide and martinez santos 2019 thus the main aim of this study is to prepare a digital database and thematic maps considering the factors slope lineament density lithology fault density geomorphology soil land use and land cover precipitation and drainage density which affects groundwater potential and combine gis and ahp techniques to delineate groundwater potential zones in nw turkey between edirne kalkansogut study area located at northwestern turkey near to its border of bulgaria and greece in the west part of turkey s thrace region roughly between east 26 31 26 52 and north 41 39 41 60 coordinates it constitutes the lower part of the transboundary tundzha river s alluvial flood plain and its biggest subbasins in turkey borders which are sinankoy kayalı and comlek river basins it lies through the northeast southwest direction between edirne city center and kalkansogut covers 501 km2 area figs 1 and 2 many studies indicate drought problems and associated water scarcity for turkey s thrace region especially since the 2000s in cities like edirne kırklareli istanbul and tekirdağ the presence of drought conditions in various periods throughout the last twenty years have been documented in many studies sirdaş and şen 2003 sen et al 2012 turoğlu 2014 bagdatli and belliturk 2016 aykut 2019 also by 2030 it is expected that water demand will excess of 1 million m3 to 3 million m3 related to increasing population industrializing and urbanization albut et al 2007 bagdatli and belliturk 2016 therefore available groundwater has crucial importance for the region and researchs dealing with groundwater potential needs to be done for more efficient and effective water management

efficient analysis of the lclu features on the gis environment corine program utilizes landsat tm sentinel 2 and spot satellites as its main data source and therefore reliable data source yılmaz 2009 in order to determine the changes between 2018 and 2020 lclu features were further updated using up to date high resolution satellite data available on google earth thus 10 m spatial resolution lulc database was created lineament features were produced automatically using geomatica 2015 s lineament algorithm which used a hillshade produced from a 10 m resolution digital elevation model geomatica can extract lineaments through satellite images and hillshades using the line option pinto et al 2017 for soil characteristics of the study area 1 25 000 scale soil map was acquired from the turkish general directorate of rural services as well as the edirne environmental status report prepared by turkish environment and urban ministry all density analyses fd ld and dd were produced using arcgis software v 10 7 s line density tool in order to determine the precipitation features of the study area fifty eight years of precipitation data 1960 2018 were obtained from the edirne meteorology station located at n 41 40 36 1 e 26 33 02 9 and the distribution characteristics of precipitation were calculated using the schreiber interpolation method schreiber interpolation method is one of the most consistent methods for revealing spatial distribution of the precipitation especially where there is a scarce meteorological data it takes into consideration the elevation and topography factors unlike the other interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting idw and kriging it is an efficient interpolation method in groundwater potential mapping studies values were assigned to each parameter based on their relative importance to the groundwater potential during this process of value assignment expert knowledge and literature review of similar researches were taken into consideration kumar et al 2016 şener et al 2018 mohammadi behzad et al 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 achu et al 2020 pairwise comparison was carried out between each parameter and normalized weights were assigned according to the results of the ahp method finally consistency ratio cr and consistency index ci values were calculated to produce the groundwater potential map the groundwater potential index gwpi was used the turkish general directorate of state hydraulic works gdshw conducted a series of research projects starting in 1947 on the hydrogeological features of different areas using geophysical techniques drilling applications static water level measurements water chemistry and water quality evaluations with the results being constantly updated up to 2016 gdshw 2016 the hydrogeological data produced in the gdshw 2016 report was used to validate the results of this study distribution characteristics of the springs and wells annual average groundwater levels and groundwater flow directions were checked against the produced groundwater potential zones additionally discharge rates of the twenty wells were compared to the groundwater potential index values and analyzed through a scatter plot 3 parameters affecting groundwater potential 3 1 lithology from the geological perspective the study area can be divided into two major units strandzha massif and thrace sedimentary basin north and northeast parts of the study area consist of strandzha massif s paleozoic and mesozoic crystalline magmatic and metamorphic rocks while south and southwest parts of the study area between lalapasa and edirne consist of cenozoic sedimentary units like mudstone sandstone limestone conglomerate etc fig 3 lithology is a highly decisive parameter for groundwater recharge processes as it controls percolation and infiltration adiat et al 2012 thivya et al 2013 gates et al 2014 therefore lithological characteristics should be investigated in detail to accurately determine groundwater potential zones paleozoic metamorphic and magmatic units are characterized by resistant lithological units such as gneiss meta granite granite amphibolite schist migmatite and partly metamorphosed dolomite in the study area okay et al 2001 catto et al 2018 these lithological units are partly deformed but in general they do not contain very developed cracks joints and fractures caglayan and yurtseven 1998 these lithological units are also classified as aquifuges by gdshw 2016 based on their very poor permeability and low porosity properties mesozoic dolomites and calcshists are partly metamorphized and rich in fractures joints and cracks caglayan and yurtseven 1998 also they are classified as aquifers gdshw 2016 cenozoic units of thrace sedimentary basin are very versatile and their hydrogeological properties differ from one another eocene reefal limestones and argillaceous limestones are very deformed caglayan and yurtseven 1998 their dip direction is generally southwest dip angles varying between 5 and 30 aykut 2019 aykut and turoğlu 2020 hydrogeologically they both exhibit aquifer quality gdshw 2016 even so eocene argillaceous limestones are more inefficient because of the relatively high clay proportion in their texture caglayan and yurtseven 1998 oligocene gravel and conglomerates are classified as aquitards they have poor to moderate permeability their groundwater holding capacity is low miocene lacustrine limestones are interbedded with claystone and mudstone because of this they are classified as aquicludes and represent poor permeability characteristics gdshw 2016 miocene pliocene terrestrial deposits consist of sandstones mudstones claystones and siltstones with a clay silt and sand matrix caglayan and yurtseven 1998 their porosity is very low and they are classified as aquicludes therefore they are not very efficient for groundwater storage gdshw 2016 quaternary alluviums are defined as young river deposits and exhibit very good permeability and porosity characteristics caglayan and yurtseven 1998 they are classified as very efficient aquifers and have relatively good conditions for groundwater potential gdshw 2016 3 2 faults and fault density faults highly control the groundwater potential of an area by determining fracture fissure and joint density within lithological units generally it is expected that with increasing fault density groundwater recharge increases too mansour et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 paleozoic crystalline rocks of the strandzha massif were deformed multiple times by the variscan and cimmerian orogenesis catto et al 2018 these orogeny phases have caused the formation of the overthrust and thrust faults within the north and northeast parts of the study area fig 3 along these faults cataclastic zones have been detected caglayan and yurtseven 1998 deposits of the thrace sedimentary basin have been effected from tectonic deformation between eocene miocene time perincek 1991 caglayan and yurtseven 1998 normal faults have been active between eocene miocene and today they are buried under pliocene terrestrial sediments in the study area perincek 1991 these faults were shown in fig 3 the study area has 0 1 82 km km2 fault density values high fault density values cumulated in the strandzha massif part of the study area fig 4 3 3 geomorphology geomorphological features of an area greatly impact groundwater occurrence and circulation thus groundwater potential rajaveni et al 2017 kudamnya et al 2019 most of the study area consists of greatly eroded undulated plateau surfaces between 55 and 340 m elevation in the study area a low plateau surface 55 190 m and a high plateau surface 210 340 m were differentiated by aykut 2019 roughness features generally exhibit low values in the southwest part tundzha river s alluvial valley and associated flood plain extend through the north south direction additionally it was noted before that cuesta relief developed on the low plateau area especially in the parts where the lithological structure is suitable for differentiated erosional activity and the exhumation of subjacent structure the northeastern part of the study area shows mountainous characteristics depending on increasing topographic relief and increasing slope features aykut 2019 fig 5 according to its percolation characteristics and groundwater holding capacities the highest weight is given to the alluvial flood plain while the lowest values are given to mountainous areas table 4 3 4 soil soil is a key parameter determining groundwater potential as soil type soil thickness soil texture and soil composition control infiltration characteristics hence groundwater recharge arulalaji et al 2019 achu et al 2020 soil map of the study area is presented in fig 7 the dominant soil class is limeless brown soils which covers an area of 325 km2 64 of the study area other soil classes are hydromorphic soils brown forest soils grumusols and alluvial soils fig 7 limeless brown soils and alluvial soils have sandy loam texture that are more than 90 cm thick while brown forest soils have gravelly and sandy loam texture that are 20 50 cm thick grumusols texture features exhibit a high clay ratio and more than 90 cm thick hydromorphic soils spread through marshy areas and are in close proximity to the water table slope features of the soil classes are 0 2 alluvial soils and hydromorphic soils 2 6 limeless brown soils and grumusols and 20 30 brown forest soils table 1 related to soil types soil textures slope of the soils and thickness of soils the highest weights are assigned to hydromorphic and alluvial soils while the lowest weights were assigned to grumusols table 4 3 5 slope slope is one of the most important parameters which affects groundwater potential generally groundwater potential increases as slope values decrease delin et al 2000 rahman et al 2012 slope values of the study area range between 0 and 39 fig 9 values are reclassified into four different classes 0 2 2 5 5 15 and 15 39 most of the study area is characterized by 2 5 slope values covering 213 km2 42 0 1 class covers 149 km2 30 and is related to the tundzha river s flood plain 5 15 and 15 39 values correspond to strandzha massif s mountainous units and cuesta fronts of the thrace sedimentary basin and cover 137 km2 27 and 2 km2 1 respectively appropriate weights have been assigned to slope classes shown in table 4 3 6 drainage density drainage density defines the ratio of total drainage length to total basin area drainage density is greatly related to permeability and infiltration capacity therefore it is an important parameter when determining groundwater potential zones high drainage density values favor the surface drainage while reflects low permeability hence low groundwater potential and vice versa patra et al 2018 pinto et al 2017 dd values vary between 0 and 4 53 in the study area fig 8 the 0 1 1 3 and 3 4 53 classes covers 213 km2 42 281 km2 56 and 6 km2 2 respectively most of the study area has low to moderate drainage density values 3 7 lineaments and lineament density lineaments define linear units associated with geological and geomorphological processes they can represent tectonic deformation zones topographic elements such as interfluves and valleys and ridgelines etc jordan et al 2005 since the lineaments represent the weakness zones they affect groundwater movements and increase the possibility of infiltration to the groundwater thus lineament density is directly proportional to groundwater potential with increasing ld values groundwater potential also increases magowe and carr 1999 varade et al 2018 ld values range between 0 and 5 89 in the study area the general direction of lineaments are ne sw same with the dip direction of the geological units and the general flow direction of rivers lineaments are mostly concentrated in the northwestern part of the study area fig 10 ld values of the study are grouped into three classes 0 1 1 3 and 3 5 89 these covering 232 km2 46 218 km2 43 and 49 km2 11 area respectively the weights assigned to the ld classes were shown in table 4 3 8 precipitation precipitation is one of the major components controlling the hydrological cycle and groundwater recharge asoka et al 2018 arulbalaji et al 2019 murmu et al 2019 thus the precipitation characteristics should be determined to delineate the groundwater potential of an area fifty eight years of data 1960 2018 were used to calculate the precipitation distribution of the study area according to the schreiber interpolation method this method estimates precipitation distribution values in areas where meteorological stations are insufficient schreiber 1904 dönmez 1990 it has been used in various studies and described as being very reliable ardel et al 1969 günlü et al 2008 fraedrich 2010 cürebal et al 2012 türkel et al 2016 karataş 2018 bayrakdar et al 2020 csaki et al 2020 çılgın 2020 according to this method the distribution characteristics of precipitation can be calculated using equation 1 schreiber 1904 1 p h p o 54 h where ph represents the precipitation value to be calculated mm po refers to the precipitation amount of the known point of altitude meteorology station 54 represents the precipitation increase coefficient in every 100 m and h defines the difference of the altitude between the meteorology station and the point where precipitation will be calculated in hectometers precipitation values range between 597 and 866 mm and can be grouped into three classes 597 675 mm 675 750 mm and 750 866 mm fig 11 597 675 mm class covers most of the area with 305 km2 675 750 mm class covers 218 km2 and 750 866 mm class covers the smallest area with 49 km2 as expected precipitation values increase with rising elevation values towards to the mountainous areas of strandzha massif the weights assigned to each class were shown in table 4 3 9 land use and land cover lulc features greatly affect groundwater resources by changing recharge conditions and affecting water demand lerner and harris 2009 jinno et al 2009 lulc features are very versatile around edirne vicinity cultivated non irrigated arable lands mining areas marshes forests grasslands and settlements are the major lulc classes seen in the study area fig 6 cultivated regions dominate most of the study area as they are broadly spread over plateaued surfaces and flood plains of the tundzha river there are mountainous areas to the north generally occupied by forests and non irrigated arable land there are also grasslands scattered all over the study area which show fragmental characteristics previous researchers have noted very dramatic changes around the edirne vicinity between 1990 and 2018 aykut 2019 there has been a rapid decline in non irrigated arable lands from 250 km2 50 to 50 km2 10 and a rapid increase in cultivated areas from 40 km2 8 to 250 km2 50 it can be said that groundwater demand greatly increased in approximately 30 years thus determining the potential for groundwater increasingly important for the study area 4 analysis and results 4 1 analytic hierarchy process ahp and weight assignment analytic hierarchy process ahp is a broadly accepted multi criteria decision making method mcdm developed by saaty 1980 and utilized as an efficient method for solving several environmental problems chandio et al 2013 zabihi et al 2019 diaz alcaide and martinez santos 2019 integrating with gis ahp provides easy and fast overlay analysis of the thematic layers in this study ahp was applied in four major steps 1 appropriate weights have been assigned to the parameters according to expert opinions and literature reviews 2 a pairwise comparison between the parameters has been developed 3 parameter weights have been calculated and 4 consistency ratio cr has been estimated the scale for pairwise comparison developed by saaty 1980 has been used in the comparison of the parameters table 2 the relative importance of parameters on groundwater potential has been calculated based on a nine point hierarchy scale table 3 depicts the assigned weights of the parameters pairwise comparison between parameters and calculated and normalized parameter weights all parameters have been compared in a pairwise comparison matrix table 3 thus parameter weights have been calculated sub classes of parameters were classified on the gis environment the sub classes were ranked on a scale of 1 9 according to their effect on groundwater potential table 4 demonstrates the sub classes of the parameters and their rankings consistency ratio of pairwise comparison calculated using equation 2 saaty 1980 2 c r c i r i where cr is consistency ratioi ci is consistency index and ri is random index whose value is dependent on the number of parameters that have been compared the ci can be calculated by equation 3 saaty 1980 3 c i λ n n 1 where n is the number of parameters that were used and λ is the average eigenvalue of the consistency vector the ri value depends upon the number of parameters being compared according to saaty 1980 the ri value for n 9 is 1 45 table 5 the calculated cr should be 0 10 or less to be acceptable therefore if the cr is greater than 0 10 assigned weights are not consistent and the pairwise matrix should be reconstructed λ calculated as 9 045 and ci 9 045 9 9 1 0 005 cr 0 005 1 45 0 003 therefore the consistency ratio is calculated as 0 003 since 0 003 0 10 weights assigned to the parameters exhibit trustworthy values very close to the perfect consistency value 0 4 2 determination of groundwater potential zones for determination of groundwater potential zones groundwater potential index gwpi kumar et al 2016 andualem and demeke 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 have been used as presented in equation 4 4 w 1 m j 1 n w j x i where m is the total number of parameters n is the total number of subclasses of a parameter wj is the normalized weight of the jth parameter and xi is the normalized rank of the parameters subclasses the calculation was carried out and groundwater potential zones were determined fig 12 final values were classified using the equal interval method in 4 classes as poor moderate good and very good according to the results an area of about 70 788 km2 exhibits poor groundwater potential which accounts for 14 of the study area the moderate groundwater potential zones cover an area of 233 167 km2 47 while the good groundwater potential zones spread through an area of 156 374 km2 31 the very good groundwater potential zones extend 8 of the study area and cover 40 671 km2 lithology geomorphology and soil characteristics are the most decisive factors in the study area very good groundwater potential zones cumulated in the southwest part especially around the tundzha rivers flood plain the valley floors of the sinankoy kayalı and comlek rivers with relatively permeable lithological units and dense lineament features demonstrated good groundwater potential the strandzha massif area generally has moderate to low groundwater potential in the northeast part of the study area densely faulted areas with relatively permeable lithological units like mesozoic dolomites and calcschists show moderate groundwater potential while areas characterized with slightly deformed paleozoic crystalline rocks have poor groundwater potential fig 12 4 3 validation of results for the validation of the results the hydrogeological database published by the turkish general directorate of state hydraulic works 2016 has been used which includes annual average groundwater levels groundwater flow directions distribution characteristics of the springs and wells and discharge values of the wells in the study area annual average groundwater level decreases from 160 m level to 60 m level gradually getting closer to the surface from northeast to the southwest within the thrace sedimentary basins borders qualifying the increasing groundwater potential from kalkansogut to the edirne fig 12 groundwater flow direction is also northeast to southwest parallel to the lithological units dip direction demonstrating better groundwater potential in the southwest part of the study area and validating the groundwater potential zones there are sixty two wells and six springs identified by gdshw 2016 in the study area their distribution characteristics were shown in fig 12 four of the springs spread in the moderate groundwater potential zone while two of them spread in the good groundwater potential zone four of the wells were located in the poor groundwater potential zone nineteen of them in the moderate groundwater potential zone thirty eight of them in the good groundwater potential zone and one of them in the very good groundwater potential zone roughly 63 of the wells fall into the good and very good groundwater potential zones supporting the reliability of the results discharge values of twenty wells have been compared with the groundwater potential index results discharge values vary from 4 to 23 l s in the good and the very good groundwater potential zones and 1 5 l s in the moderate and poor groundwater potential zones scatter plot between groundwater potential index and well discharge values shows a reasonable correlation with the 0 64 r2 value fig 13 5 conclusion in this study groundwater potential zones were determined using an integrated approach of the gis and ahp techniques between edirne kalkansogut northwestern turkey lithology fault density lineament density soil geomorphology precipitation land use and land cover drainage density and slope features were examined evaluated and interpreted using the ahp method appropriate weights have been assigned to the geoenvironmental parameters and groundwater potential zones were determined on the gis platform according to the results 14 of the study area exhibits poor groundwater potential and 47 of the study area has moderate groundwater potential good groundwater potential zones and very good groundwater potential zones constitute 31 and 8 of the study area respectively the groundwater potential increasing gradually from the northeast to southwest tundzha river s alluvial flood plain shows very good groundwater potential and most of the strandzha massif have poor to moderate groundwater potential areas with good groundwater potential generally extend between lalapasa edirne examination of groundwater characteristics such as groundwater levels groundwater flow directions springs and wells distribution characteristics and well discharge data verified the results determination of groundwater potential zones using the gis based ahp method produced reliable results in this study the biggest limitation of this study is the weight assignment process which depending on expert opinion even so the ahp method reduces the negative effects of this limitation while methods like drilling observation wells and geophysical studies will give more reliable methods in groundwater potential mapping the integration of gis and ahp techniques will be more logical cheaper and preferable in large scale areas results have great potential to increase the success of water management policies efficient use of natural resources physical planning and sustainable groundwater development in the edirne vicinity especially in the brink of climate changes unfavorable threats to human life the methods of this study can be applied anywhere else in the world further studies can be done about the groundwater level and its effects on agriculture since agricultural areas cover up much of land in the edirne vicinity also the procedure of determination of groundwater potential zones can be automated by using open source gis software e g duarte et al 2015 the

efficient analysis of the lclu features on the gis environment corine program utilizes landsat tm sentinel 2 and spot satellites as its main data source and therefore reliable data source yılmaz 2009 in order to determine the changes between 2018 and 2020 lclu features were further updated using up to date high resolution satellite data available on google earth thus 10 m spatial resolution lulc

can extract lineaments through satellite images and hillshades using the line option pinto et al 2017 for soil characteristics of the study area 1 25 000 scale soil map was acquired from the turkish general directorate of rural services as well as the edirne environmental status report prepared by turkish environment and urban ministry all density analyses fd ld and dd were produced using arcgis software v 10 7 s line density tool in order to determine the precipitation features of the study area fifty eight years of precipitation data 1960 2018 were obtained from the edirne meteorology station located at n 41 40 36 1 e 26 33 02 9 and the distribution characteristics of precipitation were calculated using the schreiber interpolation method schreiber interpolation method is one of the most consistent methods for revealing spatial distribution of the precipitation especially where there is a scarce meteorological data it takes into consideration the elevation and topography factors unlike the other interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting idw and kriging it is an efficient interpolation method in groundwater potential mapping studies values were assigned to each parameter based on their relative importance to the groundwater potential during this process of value assignment expert knowledge and literature review of similar researches were taken into consideration kumar et al 2016 şener et al 2018 mohammadi behzad et al 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 achu et al 2020 pairwise comparison was carried out between each parameter and normalized weights were assigned according to the results of the ahp method finally consistency ratio cr and consistency index ci values were calculated to produce the groundwater potential map the groundwater potential index gwpi was used the turkish general directorate of state hydraulic works gdshw conducted a series of research projects starting in 1947 on the hydrogeological features of different areas using geophysical techniques drilling applications static water level measurements water chemistry and water quality evaluations with the results being constantly updated up to 2016 gdshw 2016 the hydrogeological data produced in the gdshw 2016 report was used to validate the results of this study distribution characteristics of the springs and wells annual average groundwater levels and groundwater flow directions were checked against the produced groundwater potential zones additionally discharge rates of the twenty wells were compared to the groundwater potential index values and analyzed through a scatter plot 3 parameters affecting groundwater potential 3 1 lithology from the geological perspective the study area can be divided into two major units strandzha massif and thrace sedimentary basin north and northeast parts of the study area consist of strandzha massif s paleozoic and mesozoic crystalline magmatic and metamorphic rocks while south and southwest parts of the study area between lalapasa and edirne consist of cenozoic sedimentary units like mudstone sandstone limestone conglomerate etc fig 3 lithology is a highly decisive parameter for groundwater recharge processes as it controls percolation and infiltration adiat et al 2012 thivya et al 2013 gates et al 2014 therefore lithological characteristics should be investigated in detail to accurately determine groundwater potential zones paleozoic metamorphic and magmatic units are characterized by resistant lithological units such as gneiss meta granite granite amphibolite schist migmatite and partly metamorphosed dolomite in the study area okay et al 2001 catto et al 2018 these lithological units are partly deformed but in general they do not contain very developed cracks joints and fractures caglayan and yurtseven 1998 these lithological units are also classified as aquifuges by gdshw 2016 based on their very poor permeability and low porosity properties mesozoic dolomites and calcshists are partly metamorphized and rich in fractures joints and cracks caglayan and yurtseven 1998 also they are classified as aquifers gdshw 2016 cenozoic units of thrace sedimentary basin are very versatile and their hydrogeological properties differ from one another eocene reefal limestones and argillaceous limestones are very deformed caglayan and yurtseven 1998 their dip direction is generally southwest dip angles varying between 5 and 30 aykut 2019 aykut and turoğlu 2020 hydrogeologically they both exhibit aquifer quality gdshw 2016 even so eocene argillaceous limestones are more inefficient because of the relatively high clay proportion in their texture caglayan and yurtseven 1998 oligocene gravel and conglomerates are classified as aquitards they have poor to moderate permeability their groundwater holding capacity is low miocene lacustrine limestones are interbedded with claystone and mudstone because of this they are classified as aquicludes and represent poor permeability characteristics gdshw 2016 miocene pliocene terrestrial deposits consist of sandstones mudstones claystones and siltstones with a clay silt and sand matrix caglayan and yurtseven 1998 their porosity is very low and they are classified as aquicludes therefore they are not very efficient for groundwater storage gdshw 2016 quaternary alluviums are defined as young river deposits and exhibit very good permeability and porosity characteristics caglayan and yurtseven 1998 they are classified as very efficient aquifers and have relatively good conditions for groundwater potential gdshw 2016 3 2 faults and fault density faults highly control the groundwater potential of an area by determining fracture fissure and joint density within lithological units generally it is expected that with increasing fault density groundwater recharge increases too mansour et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 paleozoic crystalline rocks of the strandzha massif were deformed multiple times by the variscan and cimmerian orogenesis catto et al 2018 these orogeny phases have caused the formation of the overthrust and thrust faults within the north and northeast parts of the study area fig 3 along these faults cataclastic zones have been detected caglayan and yurtseven 1998 deposits of the thrace sedimentary basin have been effected from tectonic deformation between eocene miocene time perincek 1991 caglayan and yurtseven 1998 normal faults have been active between eocene miocene and today they are buried under pliocene terrestrial sediments in the study area perincek 1991 these faults were shown in fig 3 the study area has 0 1 82 km km2 fault density values high fault density values cumulated in the strandzha massif part of the study area fig 4 3 3 geomorphology geomorphological features of an area greatly impact groundwater occurrence and circulation thus groundwater potential rajaveni et al 2017 kudamnya et al 2019 most of the study area consists of greatly eroded undulated plateau surfaces between 55 and 340 m elevation in the study area a low plateau surface 55 190 m and a high plateau surface 210 340 m were differentiated by aykut 2019 roughness features generally exhibit low values in the southwest part tundzha river s alluvial valley and associated flood plain extend through the north south direction additionally it was noted before that cuesta relief developed on the low plateau area especially in the parts where the lithological structure is suitable for differentiated erosional activity and the exhumation of subjacent structure the northeastern part of the study area shows mountainous characteristics depending on increasing topographic relief and increasing slope features aykut 2019 fig 5 according to its percolation characteristics and groundwater holding capacities the highest weight is given to the alluvial flood plain while the lowest values are given to mountainous areas table 4 3 4 soil soil is a key parameter determining groundwater potential as soil type soil thickness soil texture and soil composition control infiltration characteristics hence groundwater recharge arulalaji et al 2019 achu et al 2020 soil map of the study area is presented in fig 7 the dominant soil class is limeless brown soils which covers an area of 325 km2 64 of the study area other soil classes are hydromorphic soils brown forest soils grumusols and alluvial soils fig 7 limeless brown soils and alluvial soils have sandy loam texture that are more than 90 cm thick while brown forest soils have gravelly and sandy loam texture that are 20 50 cm thick grumusols texture features exhibit a high clay ratio and more than 90 cm thick hydromorphic soils spread through marshy areas and are in close proximity to the water table slope features of the soil classes are 0 2 alluvial soils and hydromorphic soils 2 6 limeless brown soils and grumusols and 20 30 brown forest soils table 1 related to soil types soil textures slope of the soils and thickness of soils the highest weights are assigned to hydromorphic and alluvial soils while the lowest weights were assigned to grumusols table 4 3 5 slope slope is one of the most important parameters which affects groundwater potential generally groundwater potential increases as slope values decrease delin et al 2000 rahman et al 2012 slope values of the study area range between 0 and 39 fig 9 values are reclassified into four different classes 0 2 2 5 5 15 and 15 39 most of the study area is characterized by 2 5 slope values covering 213 km2 42 0 1 class covers 149 km2 30 and is related to the tundzha river s flood plain 5 15 and 15 39 values correspond to strandzha massif s mountainous units and cuesta fronts of the thrace sedimentary basin and cover 137 km2 27 and 2 km2 1 respectively appropriate weights have been assigned to slope classes shown in table 4 3 6 drainage density drainage density defines the ratio of total drainage length to total basin area drainage density is greatly related to permeability and infiltration capacity therefore it is an important parameter when determining groundwater potential zones high drainage density values favor the surface drainage while reflects low permeability hence low groundwater potential and vice versa patra et al 2018 pinto et al 2017 dd values vary between 0 and 4 53 in the study area fig 8 the 0 1 1 3 and 3 4 53 classes covers 213 km2 42 281 km2 56 and 6 km2 2 respectively most of the study area has low to moderate drainage density values 3 7 lineaments and lineament density lineaments define linear units associated with geological and geomorphological processes they can represent tectonic deformation zones topographic elements such as interfluves and valleys and ridgelines etc jordan et al 2005 since the lineaments represent the weakness zones they affect groundwater movements and increase the possibility of infiltration to the groundwater thus lineament density is directly proportional to groundwater potential with increasing ld values groundwater potential also increases magowe and carr 1999 varade et al 2018 ld values range between 0 and 5 89 in the study area the general direction of lineaments are ne sw same with the dip direction of the geological units and the general flow direction of rivers lineaments are mostly concentrated in the northwestern part of the study area fig 10 ld values of the study are grouped into three classes 0 1 1 3 and 3 5 89 these covering 232 km2 46 218 km2 43 and 49 km2 11 area respectively the weights assigned to the ld classes were shown in table 4 3 8 precipitation precipitation is one of the major components controlling the hydrological cycle and groundwater recharge asoka et al 2018 arulbalaji et al 2019 murmu et al 2019 thus the precipitation characteristics should be determined to delineate the groundwater potential of an area fifty eight years of data 1960 2018 were used to calculate the precipitation distribution of the study area according to the schreiber interpolation method this method estimates precipitation distribution values in areas where meteorological stations are insufficient schreiber 1904 dönmez 1990 it has been used in various studies and described as being very reliable ardel et al 1969 günlü et al 2008 fraedrich 2010 cürebal et al 2012 türkel et al 2016 karataş 2018 bayrakdar et al 2020 csaki et al 2020 çılgın 2020 according to this method the distribution characteristics of precipitation can be calculated using equation 1 schreiber 1904 1 p h p o 54 h where ph represents the precipitation value to be calculated mm po refers to the precipitation amount of the known point of altitude meteorology station 54 represents the precipitation increase coefficient in every 100 m and h defines the difference of the altitude between the meteorology station and the point where precipitation will be calculated in hectometers precipitation values range between 597 and 866 mm and can be grouped into three classes 597 675 mm 675 750 mm and 750 866 mm fig 11 597 675 mm class covers most of the area with 305 km2 675 750 mm class covers 218 km2 and 750 866 mm class covers the smallest area with 49 km2 as expected precipitation values increase with rising elevation values towards to the mountainous areas of strandzha massif the weights assigned to each class were shown in table 4 3 9 land use and land cover lulc features greatly affect groundwater resources by changing recharge conditions and affecting water demand lerner and harris 2009 jinno et al 2009 lulc features are very versatile around edirne vicinity cultivated non irrigated arable lands mining areas marshes forests grasslands and settlements are the major lulc classes seen in the study area fig 6 cultivated regions dominate most of the study area as they are broadly spread over plateaued surfaces and flood plains of the tundzha river there are mountainous areas to the north generally occupied by forests and non irrigated arable land there are also grasslands scattered all over the study area which show fragmental characteristics previous researchers have noted very dramatic changes around the edirne vicinity between 1990 and 2018 aykut 2019 there has been a rapid decline in non irrigated arable lands from 250 km2 50 to 50 km2 10 and a rapid increase in cultivated areas from 40 km2 8 to 250 km2 50 it can be said that groundwater demand greatly increased in approximately 30 years thus determining the potential for groundwater increasingly important for the study area 4 analysis and results 4 1 analytic hierarchy process ahp and weight assignment analytic hierarchy process ahp is a broadly accepted multi criteria decision making method mcdm developed by saaty 1980 and utilized as an efficient method for solving several environmental problems chandio et al 2013 zabihi et al 2019 diaz alcaide and martinez santos 2019 integrating with gis ahp provides easy and fast overlay analysis of the thematic layers in this study ahp was applied in four major steps 1 appropriate weights have been assigned to the parameters according to expert opinions and literature reviews 2 a pairwise comparison between the parameters has been developed 3 parameter weights have been calculated and 4 consistency ratio cr has been estimated the scale for pairwise comparison developed by saaty 1980 has been used in the comparison of the parameters table 2 the relative importance of parameters on groundwater potential has been calculated based on a nine point hierarchy scale table 3 depicts the assigned weights of the parameters pairwise comparison between parameters and calculated and normalized parameter weights all parameters have been compared in a pairwise comparison matrix table 3 thus parameter weights have been calculated sub classes of parameters were classified on the gis environment the sub classes were ranked on a scale of 1 9 according to their effect on groundwater potential table 4 demonstrates the sub classes of the parameters and their rankings consistency ratio of pairwise comparison calculated using equation 2 saaty 1980 2 c r c i r i where cr is consistency ratioi ci is consistency index and ri is random index whose value is dependent on the number of parameters that have been compared the ci can be calculated by equation 3 saaty 1980 3 c i λ n n 1 where n is the number of parameters that were used and λ is the average eigenvalue of the consistency vector the ri value depends upon the number of parameters being compared according to saaty 1980 the ri value for n 9 is 1 45 table 5 the calculated cr should be 0 10 or less to be acceptable therefore if the cr is greater than 0 10 assigned weights are not consistent and the pairwise matrix should be reconstructed λ calculated as 9 045 and ci 9 045 9 9 1 0 005 cr 0 005 1 45 0 003 therefore the consistency ratio is calculated as 0 003 since 0 003 0 10 weights assigned to the parameters exhibit trustworthy values very close to the perfect consistency value 0 4 2 determination of groundwater potential zones for determination of groundwater potential zones groundwater potential index gwpi kumar et al 2016 andualem and demeke 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 have been used as presented in equation 4 4 w 1 m j 1 n w j x i where m is the total number of parameters n is the total number of subclasses of a parameter wj is the normalized weight of the jth parameter and xi is the normalized rank of the parameters subclasses the calculation was carried out and groundwater potential zones were determined fig 12 final values were classified using the equal interval method in 4 classes as poor moderate good and very good according to the results an area of about 70 788 km2 exhibits poor groundwater potential which accounts for 14 of the study area the moderate groundwater potential zones cover an area of 233 167 km2 47 while the good groundwater potential zones spread through an area of 156 374 km2 31 the very good groundwater potential zones extend 8 of the study area and cover 40 671 km2 lithology geomorphology and soil characteristics are the most decisive factors in the study area very good groundwater potential zones cumulated in the southwest part especially around the tundzha rivers flood plain the valley floors of the sinankoy kayalı and comlek rivers with relatively permeable lithological units and dense lineament features demonstrated good groundwater potential the strandzha massif area generally has moderate to low groundwater potential in the northeast part of the study area densely faulted areas with relatively permeable lithological units like mesozoic dolomites and calcschists show moderate groundwater potential while areas characterized with slightly deformed paleozoic crystalline rocks have poor groundwater potential fig 12 4 3 validation of results for the validation of the results the hydrogeological database published by the turkish general directorate of state hydraulic works 2016 has been used which includes annual average groundwater levels groundwater flow directions distribution characteristics of the springs and wells and discharge values of the wells in the study area annual average groundwater level decreases from 160 m level to 60 m level gradually getting closer to the surface from northeast to the southwest within the thrace sedimentary basins borders qualifying the increasing groundwater potential from kalkansogut to the edirne fig 12 groundwater flow direction is also northeast to southwest parallel to the lithological units dip direction demonstrating better groundwater potential in the southwest part of the study area and validating the groundwater potential zones there are sixty two wells and six springs identified by gdshw 2016 in the study area their distribution characteristics were shown in fig 12 four of the springs spread in the moderate groundwater potential zone while two of them spread in the good groundwater potential zone four of the wells were located in the poor groundwater potential zone nineteen of them in the moderate groundwater potential zone thirty eight of them in the good groundwater potential zone and one of them in the very good groundwater potential zone roughly 63 of the wells fall into the good and very good groundwater potential zones supporting the reliability of the results discharge values of twenty wells have been compared with the groundwater potential index results discharge values vary from 4 to 23 l s in the good and the very good groundwater potential zones and 1 5 l s in the moderate and poor groundwater potential zones scatter plot between groundwater potential index and well discharge values shows a reasonable correlation with the 0 64 r2 value fig 13 5 conclusion in this study groundwater potential zones were determined using an integrated approach of the gis and ahp techniques between edirne kalkansogut northwestern turkey lithology fault density lineament density soil geomorphology precipitation land use and land cover drainage density and slope features were examined evaluated and interpreted using the ahp method appropriate weights have been assigned to the geoenvironmental parameters and groundwater potential zones were determined on the gis platform according to the results 14 of the study area exhibits poor groundwater potential and 47 of the study area has moderate groundwater potential good groundwater potential zones and very good groundwater potential zones constitute 31 and 8 of the study area respectively the groundwater potential increasing gradually from the northeast to southwest tundzha river s alluvial flood plain shows very good groundwater potential and most of the strandzha massif have poor to moderate groundwater potential areas with good groundwater potential generally extend between lalapasa edirne examination of groundwater characteristics such as groundwater levels groundwater flow directions springs and wells distribution characteristics and well discharge data verified the results determination of groundwater potential zones using the gis based ahp method produced reliable results in this study the biggest limitation of this study is the weight assignment process which depending on expert opinion even so the ahp method reduces the negative effects of this limitation while methods like drilling observation wells and geophysical studies will give more reliable methods in groundwater potential mapping the integration of gis and ahp techniques will be more logical cheaper and preferable in large scale areas results have great potential to increase the success of water management policies efficient use of natural resources physical planning and sustainable groundwater development in the edirne vicinity especially in the brink of climate changes unfavorable threats to human life the methods of this study can be applied anywhere else in the world further studies can be done about the groundwater level and its effects on agriculture since agricultural areas cover up much of land in the edirne vicinity also the procedure of determination of groundwater potential zones can be automated by using open source gis software e g duarte et al 2015 the

entire world all pollutants from industrial or human origin can have very serious consequences for animals and plants qing et al 2015 yang et al 2018 for example discharges of polluted water from factories into rivers kill thousands of aquatic creatures like fishes islam and tanaka 2004 mulk et al 2016 in general among the chemical substances likely to constitute a danger for aquatic life metal elements like ag as cu cr ni pb or zn aithani et al 2020 lin et al 2016 rank on top these elements are increasingly used in many industrial sectors nagajyoti et al 2010 rivera et al 2007 consequently there is a necessity to treat industrial effluents contaminated with metals before their discharge into the receiving water bodies in morocco the craft sector is a buoyant and dynamic sector of the country s economy especially developed in the region fez meknes where the brassware industry poses a significant risk for the environment by releasing effluents heavily contaminated by nickel and silver in recent years nickel and silver in wastewater pose a very serious threat for ecosystems and human health dey et al 2018 mousavi et al 2015 nickel a metal known to be carcinogenic is widely used in modern industries dey et al 2018 in addition the exposures to small quantities of nickel on a long timescale can cause irritation and allergic reactions in particular itchy skin das et al 2008 silver is considered as an emerging contaminant due to its increasing use based on its bactericidal properties fabrega et al 2011 maillard and hartemann 2013 exposures to silver over a long period can lead to the appearance of a characteristic irreversible pigmentation of the skin and or the eyes gulbranson et al 2000 the united states environmental protection agency us epa has set specific nickel limits for wastewater effluents 0 2 mg l for long term effluent reuse and 2 mg l for short term effluent reuse katsou et al 2010 the us epa under the safe drinking water act sets the contaminant level for silver in drinking water at 0 1 mg l s f etris 2010 the european directive 98 83 ec on the quality of water intended for human consumption sets a limit for nickel in drinking water at 20 μg l eu 1998 european environmental quality standards eqs recommends that the silver concentration in drinking water does not exceed 5 μg l vorkamp and sanderson 2016 recently there has been a considerable effort to develop efficient technologies to lower the levels of metal elements in water intended for human consumption the conventional technologies for removing metals from wastewater include many processes such as precipitation fu and wang 2011 ion exchange da and robens 2004 adsorption dotto et al 2015 el ouardi et al 2020a 2020b bib el ouardi et al 2020a bib el ouardi et al 2020b coagulation el samrani et al 2008 and reverse osmosis bódalo santoyo et al 2003 among these adsorption received considerable interest due many advantages over conventional methods i e chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane filtration and coagulation flocculation such as the low cost the high efficiency and the regeneration of the adsorbents the effectiveness of removing pollutants such as metals from effluents through an adsorption process strongly depends on the physical properties and chemical composition of the adsorbents uddin 2017 various natural adsorbents have been used in the adsorption process kaolinite zhu et al 2018 activated carbon zaini et al 2010 natural and synthetic zeolites motsi et al 2009 or clays uddin 2017 the cost of the adsorbent is a key point for its commercial and industrial use recently the use of bentonite for adsorption or removal of heavy metals in effluents has been the focus of many studies because of its important economic benefits karapinar and donat 2009 mohammed azizi et al 2013 vieira et al 2010a to increase the application range of bentonite use there is a need to improve its physico chemical properties numerous physical and chemical methods have been examined in that purpose such as acid activation españa et al 2019 heat treatment freitas et al 2017 and treating with a cationic surfactants özcan et al 2007 nevertheless none of the above mentioned works did study the impact of such bentonite activation neither on nickel and silver retention nor on the competition of divalent metal ions such as nickel with monovalent metal ions silver for the adsorption sites the aim of this study was to activate bentonite with sodium carbonate na be and by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 to increase its adsorption capacity to remove nickel and silver from simple and complex media the main purpose of the activation bentonite by sodium carbonate is the modification of its physico chemical properties by modifying its specific surface area and increasing its cation exchange capacity furthermore in this work the chemical activated na be will be subjected to thermal activation by heating at 450 c na be450 to enhance its adsorption performance towards nickel and silver the idea was to take advantage of the demonstrated improving effect of thermal treatment on materials el ouardi et al 2020a 2020b and to compare with chemical activation a simpler activation method the materials were tested in a matrix of increasing complexity to finally be tested in natural effluents tap water river

equally ranging between 15 and 120 mg l in buffered milliq water at ph 7 for 90 min nickel and silver retention on na be and na be450 were studied in real effluents by batch adsorption experiments effluents from the brassware industry a and effluents from sebou s1 s2 and fez f1 f2 rivers were tested in this study effluent brassware was directly collected into the rinsing baths before discharge in fez river the effluents from fez and sebou rivers were collected downstream from fez city and downstream from the confluence with fez river respectively either during a period of brassware fabrication f1 and s1 or during a non working day f2 and s2 the composition of each effluent is presented in table 1 and table si 1 in order to examine the reusability of the adsorbent the used material was agitated with 10 ml of 0 05 mol l hno3 for 30 min the procedure was repeated as long as trace metals could not be detected they were then washed three times with milliq water to remove acidity finally the adsorbent was dried at 60 c for 24 h then nickel and silver adsorptions were repeated in the same conditions as before the regeneration cycle was repeated five times 2 5 theoretical and calculations fundamentals several kinetic models can be used to express the adsorption mechanism of solute on an adsorbent the amount of the metal ion adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent at equilibrium qe mg g and the adsorption rate were calculated from the expressions 1 q e c 0 c e m v 2 a d s o r p t i o n c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 mg l is the metal ion initial concentration in the solution ce mg l is the metal ion concentration at equilibrium in the dissolved phase m is the mass of adsorbent g and v is the volume of solution l in this work the pseudo first order kinetic and the pseudo second order kinetic were used to study the kinetic behavior of nickel on the surface of the modified bentonite by chemical activation na be and the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 the kinetic model of pseudo first order proposed by lagergren 1898 is generally applicable over the initial 20 30 min of the adsorption process aksu 2001 this model assumed that the adsorption process is reversible guimarães and leão 2014 this model is expressed by the following equation 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t contrarily to the pseudo first order model the pseudo second order kinetic model developed by ho and mckay mckay 1998 predicts the behavior over the whole range of adsorption time scale the pseudo second order model is based on the assumption that the rate limiting step may be chemisorption which involves valence forces by electron sharing or exchange between the adsorbate and the adsorbent ho 2006 the pseudo second order equation is given by the following expression 4 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order in min 1 and k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order in g mg 1 min 1 and qt and qe are the amount of solute adsorbed at time t and at equilibrium respectively equilibrium isotherms for nickel and silver were studied in order to better model the adsorption mechanisms the adsorption data were analyzed using langmuir 1918 and freundlich 1906 models langmuir model is based on a homogeneous surface with a finite number of identical sites it also assumes that there is no interaction between the adjacent sites langmuir equation is expressed as 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where qm mg g refers to the maximum adsorption capacity and kl l mg is the langmuir constant freundlich model supposes that adsorption occurs onto a heterogeneous surface this model is expressed by the following equation 6 q e k f c e 1 n where kf and n are freundlich constants related to the adsorption capacity and the strength of adsorption respectively the langmuir freundlich equation sips 1948 is given by 7 q e q m k l f c e n l f 1 k l f c e n l f where qe is the adsorbed amount at equilibrium mg g qm the l f maximum adsorption capacity mg g ce the adsorbate equilibrium concentration mg l klf the equilibrium constant for a heterogeneous solid and nlf is

equilibrium adsorption and competitive equilibrium adsorption to non competitive adsorption observed at equilibrium 8 δ q i m q i m i x q i m where qim mg g and qimix mg g are the maximum adsorption capacity of i species in the single component system and binary component system respectively to prove the fit quality pearson s chi square χ2 values were evaluated using the following equation piccin

bentonites by chemical activation na be and combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 the phases were identified using x pert highscore software through the jcpds database the studied bentonites mostly consist of montmorillonite mt feldspars f and small amounts of crystalline phases in the form of impurities quartz q for raw be all peaks were located at 2θ 5 9 d 14 9 å 19 8 d 4 4 å 34 1 d 2 6 å 35 8 d 2 5 å and 62 2 d 1 49 å values of d spacing 14 9 å 4 4 å 2 6 å 2 5 å and 1 49 å which correspond to the montmorillonite according to jcpds database feldspars peak f 2θ 27 7 and quartz peak q 2θ 26 6 with values of d spacing 3 2 å and 3 3 å for feldspars and quartz respectively could also be observed the estimation of montmorillonite and feldspars in the materials were evaluated by diffrac eva using semi quantitative method and led to the following proportions 70 0 73 4 of montmorillonite 25 6 27 0 of feldspars and 1 3 of other phases d spacing series of smectites for raw be demonstrated a reflection d001 at d value of 14 9 å this diffraction peak shrinked to 13 3 å after activation treatments thus through the evolution of bentonite after activation treatments a structural change can be noticed especially the move of the characteristic montmorillonite peak at bragg angles 2θ 6 8 which indicated a variation in sodium and calcium proportions table 2 as already demonstrated el miz et al 2017 it has also to be noted the disappearance of the crystalline phases in forms of quartz impurities q with the activation treatments ftir spectra of the natural and modified bentonite fig 2 showed infra red bands observed around 517 cm 1 corresponding to the deformation modes of si o al er ramly 2014 while the bands at 910 and 840 cm 1 are the characteristic bands of the bending vibrations of the al mg oh and al al oh groups of bentonite ayari et al 2005 bertagnolli et al 2011 farmer 1974 xu et al 2000 the presence of adsorbed water is evidenced by the band at 1635 cm 1 characteristic of the bending vibration of h2o the strong band at 1000 cm 1 of raw be can be attributed to a si o stretching vibration of the condensed phase affected by si o h deformation vibration band g socrates 2001 while the band at 3396 cm 1 corresponds to water stretching vibration band and 3623 cm 1 to the stretching vibration of structural oh groups farmer 1974 3 2 morphology and characterization of the considered materials the morphology of raw be fig 3 a na be fig 3b and na be450 fig 3c showed an irregularity of the particles forming aggregates the sem pictures showed the classical general appearance of the montmorillonite essentially constituted of sheets as a matter of fact smectites are demonstrated to be composed of one octahedral sheet centered between two tetrahedral sheets shichi and takagi 2000 uddin 2017 as seen from fig 3b to c the evolution of modified bentonite grain size during activation process could be observed fig 3b and c showed a slight increase in particle roughness resulted by activation treatment nitrogen adsorption desorption experiments were performed on raw be na be and na be450 to study their porosity fig 4 a shows that the isotherms of modified bentonites are of type iv according to the iupac classification stafford et al 1985 thommes et al 2015 which reveals the presence of mesopores in these materials the specific surface area determined by bet and total pore volume of raw bentonite were 14 5 m2 g and 0 063 cm3 g respectively when considering na be and na be450 an increase in the bet surface area 44 9 m2 g and 66 7 m2 g respectively table 3 was measured na be450 bentonite has received maximum improvement in surface area 78 compared to na be 67 the pore size of the modified bentonites followed the same trend as the specific surface area na be450 na be raw be na be and na be450 were composed of micropores mesopores and macropores fig 4b it can be concluded that the treatment has resulted in an important increase in specific surface and pore size with a higher effect of the combined treatment this is due to the removal of adsorbed and hydrated water molecules and other impurities 3 3 kinetic studies of nickel retention the kinetic studies of nickel onto modified bentonites are presented in fig 5 the adsorption of nickel ions on modified bentonite was demonstrated to rapidly occur the maximum adsorbed amount of nickel on na be and na be450 were 4 6 and 4 8 mg g respectively fig 5 the adsorption kinetics of nickel on na be and na be450 are examined with the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetics fig 5 table 4 shows the different kinetic parameters calculated from the graphical representation of these three models according to the coefficient of determination r2 values and the qeq values table 4 the pseudo second order kinetic model is the most reliable to describe the adsorption of nickel on the modified bentonites which suggests that the adsorption process may be a chemisorption kumar et al 2011 piccin et al 2017 zou et al 2006 3 4 nickel and silver retention in single component systems the equilibrium isotherms in single component systems are presented in fig 6 the maximum nickel retention capacity 10 7 mg g was obtained for the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 the obtained results fully followed the variation of specific surface with activation treatment sbet na be450 sbet na be sbet raw be in addition nickel adsorption on raw be in the tested experimental conditions caused the saturation of the adsorption sites of the considered material compared to the activated bentonite which still demonstrated adsorption properties this means that the activated treatment of na be and na be450 creates more active sites leading to an improved retention ability the adsorption capacity for silver more rapidly reached saturation than for nickel on each of the tested material the maximum silver retention capacity 7 1 mg g was obtained for the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 which corroborates the results obtained for nickel adsorption isotherms were modeled by langmuir eq 5 freundlich eq 6 and l f models sips eq 7 based on the coefficient of determination r2 values table 5 freundlich does not provide a good fit to the experimental data for both nickel and silver ions the experimental data have been well fitted by langmuir isotherm and langmuir freundlich sips models as can be observed in table 5 and fig 6 these results predict a cooperative adsorption process involving adsorbent adsorption interactions which implies that the adsorbents present homogeneous adsorption sites guerra et al 2013 the adsorption of nickel and silver ions may also be enhanced by ion exchange which occurs between the metal ions and the amounts of alkali and alkaline earth metals in bentonites e g ni2 can take the place of the exchangeable cations such as na mg2 and k in bentonite layer and interposed between the bentonite layers vieira et al 2010a as a matter of fact the exchange process between sodium and calcium occurring during chemical treatment and demonstrated by eds and xrd analysis could enhance the adsorption capacities as already demonstrated alvarez ayuso and garcia sanchez 2003 bhattacharyya and gupta 2008 ijagbemi et al 2010 the results from this study suggests that the chemical activation na be and the combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 could be an effective method to enhance the adsorption capacity of the bentonite 3 5 nickel and silver retention in binary component systems when simultaneously exposed to nickel and silver the maximal adsorption capacities obtained for na be450 equaled 10 2 and 6 6 mg g or 0 17 and 0 06 mmol g for nickel and silver respectively fig 7 this is in agreement with the above results in single component systems the results obtained in single component systems were added on the figures for an easier comparison showing that the competition led to a decrease of the adsorption capacity but such reduction was attenuated for the modified bentonites following the previous modelling results only l f model was used table 6 to fit the experimental data in binary system the high r2 values showed that equilibrium data were well fitted which corroborates the previous results in single component system suggesting a monolayer adsorption of nickel and silver onto na be and na be450 in terms of competition between metals such enhanced competitive effects in binary components was investigated mohan and singh 2002 zhi rong and shao qi 2009 using the ratio of the maximum adsorption capacity for the metal in the binary component system qimix to the maximum adsorption capacity for the same metal in the single component qim if qimix qim 1 the adsorption is promoted in the presence of the other metal ions if qimix qim 1 there is no effect and interaction between metal ion i and other metals ions if qimix qim 1 the adsorption is suppressed by the presence of other metal ions in this work the values of all qimix qim were below 1 which confirms the mutual competitive effect of nickel and silver in binary component systems the rates of equilibrium adsorption reduction δ are given in table 6 for na be the rate of equilibrium adsorption reduction δ of nickel was diminished by 6 4 in binary component system ni ag and for silver was decreased by 25 6 in the ag ni system for na be450 in ni ni ag and ag ag ni systems this rate δ was decreased by 4 6 and 5 8 respectively these results were in agreement with the observed experimental data fig 7 based on the rate of equilibrium adsorption reduction δ values the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 has demonstrated its performance and efficiency towards nickel and silver even in the binary component system in addition it was clear that the presence of another metal led to a competition for the adsorption sites on na be and na be450 even though nickel was less submitted to this effect compared to ag this could be explained by the smaller ionic radius of nickel 0 72 å yavuz et al 2003 than that of silver 1 26 å liu et al 2003 which allows an easier nickel penetration to the available sites of na be and na be450 3 6 nickel and silver retention in natural effluents to better understand the mechanism of silver adsorption by bentonites in complex environments it is important to know the speciation of silver in solution which also depends on the ph speciation diagram of silver was obtained using the hydra medusa software figure si 1 the choice of the concentrations studied in figure si 1 was based on the values found in the natural effluents such as brassware effluent a fez f1 and sebou rivers table 1 and tap water table si 2 nickel and silver retention by na be and na be450 in tap water are depicted in fig 8 the results obtained with milliq water mq experiments were added on the figures for an easier comparison the presence of some major ions i e calcium sodium and magnesium table si 2 in tap water did not seem to impact on modified bentonites efficiency silver retention quite increased compared to that in milliq water experiments this result could come from the presence of chloride ions in tap water 37 mg l that could directly increase silver removal accounted for na be and na be450 material the probability of formation of silver chloride solid was performed using the hydra medusa software ignasi puigdomenech 2015 as a function of cl ag ratios the results of the hydra medusa simulation fig si 1 confirmed the formation of agcl s concerning nickel the results showed that the removal efficiency in the studied concentration range were above 89 and 93 on na be and na be450 respectively silver removal efficiency on na be and na be450 was above 99 in these conditions the modified bentonites have demonstrated a good adsorption efficiency which turns these adsorbents interesting for metal adsorption even in complex media the brassware effluent a was characterized by very high metal levels 80 3 mg l of nickel and 41 7 mg l of silver table 1 the effluents from fez f1 and sebou rivers s1 during working day were polluted in nickel and silver though at a lesser extent 214 6 and 94 3 μg l respectively in fez river and 122 8 and 28 9 μg l respectively in sebou river fez f2 and sebou rivers s2 during non working day were the least polluted in nickel and silver 59 5 and 51 1 μg l respectively in fez river and 20 4 and 5 1 μg l respectively in sebou river table 1 in order to assess the risk associated with the presence of metal pollutants in the studied waters the measured concentrations were compared to the standards set by the european water framework directive directive 2008 105 ec the results showed that nickel and silver concentrations in the study sites are greater than the values set for nickel 20 μg l eu 2008 and silver 5 μg l concentrations vorkamp and sanderson 2016 established in accordance with environmental quality standards eqs this means that the waters of fez and sebou rivers present a toxic risk for aquatic organisms the retention of nickel from the brassware industry effluent a by na be and na be450 turned less efficient due to the presence of numerous competing agents na be and na be450 retention efficiency were 26 4 and 41 2 respectively for ni such discrepancy can be explained by the higher surface area of the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 which caused an increase of the number of available sites silver removal efficiency is very high this result may be due to the presence of ions chloride for example in effluents wastewater which could react with silver and lead to precipitation the removal efficiency of na be and na be450 for both nickel and silver in sebou and fez rivers were 100 table 7 it has to be underlined that even if the tested effluents were less contaminated in metals than the brassware rinsing bath their metals content was important this clearly demonstrated the effectiveness and ability of both materials for removal nickel and silver in a complex and contaminated media in order to evaluate the potential improvements to nickel and silver ions extraction offered by modified bentonite by chemical activation na be and the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 over other adsorbents the results obtained in this work were compared to the retention capacities of some usual natural adsorbents from the literature table 8 chosen for their composition close to that of the studied bentonites although a direct comparison of na be and na be450 with other adsorbents is quite complicated due to the different experimental conditions used it has been found that nickel and silver adsorption capacity of na be and na be450 is among the highest results therefore considering the adsorption capacities of other natural materials low cost accessibility and environment friendly bio material it can be concluded that the modified bentonite by chemical activation na be and the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 proved themselves promising low cost effective natural adsorbents to remove nickel and silver ions from aqueous solutions 3 7 regeneration study the regeneration and reuse of na be and na be450 adsorbents is an interesting operation from an environmental and economical point of view if an industrial application is targeted the impact of regeneration cycles on efficiency removal is presented in fig 9 the regeneration efficiency showed that nickel adsorption efficiency on na be450 and na be b and c bars was kept around 90 and 70 respectively up to the fifth cycle of regeneration for ag both na be450 and na be d and e bars removal efficiency dramatically decreased from the first cycle of regeneration until the fifth one nickel retention through regeneration cycles show that na be and na be450 can be easily regenerated and still demonstrated a high efficiency sustainable in time 4 conclusion in this paper a na2co3 activated bentonite na be and modified by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 both treatments of the bentonite led to improving the specific surface areas of the material and its adsorption capacity the sorption experiments carried out has shown that na be and na be450 materials demonstrated a noticeable retention ability towards nickel and silver taken separately or as a binary component system the contact time was rapid which turns these materials suitable for industrial depolluting systems in single component system the maximum nickel and silver retention capacity was obtained on na be450 which fully follows the variation of specific surface with activation treatment the adsorption isotherms were better represented by the l f model suggesting that the monolayer adsorption of nickel and silver onto na be and na be450 the results in binary component systems confirms the previous results in single component systems this study showed the positive effect of combined chemical and thermal activation on the enhancing adsorbent properties the use of na be and na be450 were then successfully tested in industrial effluents brassware effluent as well as river effluents demonstrating the possible use of this worldwide materials in wastewaters treatment finally the regeneration study revealed a net benefit for na be450 which make it as low cost effective

activation adsorption nickel silver 1 introduction the fight against environmental pollution has become the priority of many agencies associations and commissions for environmental protection in the entire world all pollutants from industrial or human origin can have very serious consequences for animals and plants qing et al 2015 yang et al 2018 for example discharges of polluted water from factories into rivers kill thousands of aquatic creatures like fishes islam and tanaka 2004 mulk et al 2016 in general among the chemical substances likely to constitute a danger for aquatic life metal elements like ag as cu cr ni pb or zn aithani et al 2020 lin et al 2016 rank on top these elements are increasingly used in many industrial sectors nagajyoti et al 2010 rivera et al 2007 consequently there is a necessity to treat industrial effluents contaminated with metals before their discharge into the receiving water bodies in morocco the craft sector is a buoyant and dynamic sector of the country s economy especially developed in the region fez meknes where the brassware industry poses a significant risk for the environment by releasing effluents heavily contaminated by nickel and silver in recent years nickel and silver in wastewater pose a very serious threat for ecosystems and human health dey et al 2018 mousavi et al 2015 nickel a metal known to be carcinogenic is widely used in modern industries dey et al 2018 in addition the exposures to small quantities of nickel on a long timescale can cause irritation and allergic reactions in particular itchy skin das et al 2008 silver is considered as an emerging contaminant due to its increasing use based on its bactericidal properties fabrega et al 2011 maillard and hartemann 2013 exposures to silver over a long period can lead to the appearance of a characteristic irreversible pigmentation of the skin and or the eyes gulbranson et al 2000 the united states environmental protection agency us epa has set specific nickel limits for wastewater effluents 0 2 mg l for long term effluent reuse and 2 mg l for short term effluent reuse katsou et al 2010 the us epa under the safe drinking water act sets the contaminant level for silver in drinking water at 0 1 mg l s f etris 2010 the european directive 98 83 ec on the quality of water intended for human consumption sets a limit for nickel in drinking water at 20 μg l eu 1998 european environmental quality standards eqs recommends that the silver concentration in drinking water does not exceed 5 μg l vorkamp and sanderson 2016 recently there has been a considerable effort to develop efficient technologies to lower the levels of metal elements in water intended for human consumption the conventional technologies for removing metals from wastewater include many processes such as precipitation fu and wang 2011 ion exchange da and robens 2004 adsorption dotto et al 2015 el ouardi et al 2020a 2020b bib el ouardi et al 2020a bib el ouardi et al 2020b coagulation el samrani et al 2008 and reverse osmosis bódalo santoyo et al 2003 among these adsorption received considerable interest due many advantages over conventional methods i e chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane filtration and coagulation flocculation such as the low cost the high efficiency and the regeneration of the adsorbents the effectiveness of removing pollutants such as metals from effluents through an adsorption process strongly depends on the physical properties and chemical composition of the adsorbents uddin 2017 various natural adsorbents have been used in the adsorption process kaolinite zhu et al 2018 activated carbon zaini et al 2010 natural and synthetic zeolites motsi et al 2009 or clays uddin 2017 the cost of the adsorbent is a key point for its commercial and industrial use recently the use of bentonite for adsorption or removal of heavy metals in effluents has been the focus of many studies because of its important economic benefits karapinar and donat 2009 mohammed azizi et al 2013 vieira et al 2010a to increase the application range of bentonite use there is a need to improve its physico chemical properties numerous physical and chemical methods have been examined in that purpose such as acid activation españa et al 2019 heat treatment freitas et al 2017 and treating with a cationic surfactants özcan et al 2007 nevertheless none of the above mentioned works did study the impact of such bentonite activation neither on nickel and silver retention nor on the competition of divalent metal ions such as nickel with monovalent metal ions silver for the adsorption sites the aim of this study was to activate bentonite with sodium carbonate na be and by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 to increase its adsorption capacity to remove nickel and silver from simple and complex media the main purpose of the activation bentonite by sodium carbonate is the modification of its physico chemical properties by modifying its specific surface area and increasing its cation exchange capacity furthermore in this work the chemical activated na be will be subjected to thermal activation by heating at 450 c na be450 to enhance its adsorption performance towards nickel and silver the idea was to take advantage of the demonstrated improving effect of thermal treatment on materials el ouardi et al 2020a 2020b and to compare with chemical activation a simpler activation method the materials were tested in a matrix of increasing complexity to finally be tested in natural effluents tap water river

material was agitated with 10 ml of 0 05 mol l hno3 for 30 min the procedure was repeated as long as trace metals could not be detected they were then washed three times with milliq water to remove acidity finally the adsorbent was dried at 60 c for 24 h then nickel and silver adsorptions were repeated in the same conditions as before the regeneration cycle was repeated five times 2 5 theoretical and calculations fundamentals several kinetic models can be used to express the adsorption mechanism of solute on an adsorbent the amount of the metal ion adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent at equilibrium qe mg g and the adsorption rate were calculated from the expressions 1 q e c 0 c e m v 2 a d s o r p t i o n c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 mg l is the metal ion initial concentration in the solution ce mg l is the metal ion concentration at equilibrium in the dissolved phase m is the mass of adsorbent g and v is the volume of solution l in this work the pseudo first order kinetic and the pseudo second order kinetic were used to study the kinetic behavior of nickel on the surface of the modified bentonite by chemical activation na be and the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 the kinetic model of pseudo first order proposed by lagergren 1898 is generally applicable over the initial 20 30 min of the adsorption process aksu 2001 this model assumed that the adsorption process is reversible guimarães and leão 2014 this model is expressed by the following equation 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t contrarily to the pseudo first order model the pseudo second order kinetic model developed by ho and mckay mckay 1998 predicts the behavior over the whole range of adsorption time scale the pseudo second order model is based on the assumption that the rate limiting step may be chemisorption which involves valence forces by electron sharing or exchange between the adsorbate and the adsorbent ho 2006 the pseudo second order equation is given by the following expression 4 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order in min 1 and k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order in g mg 1 min 1 and qt and qe are the amount of solute adsorbed at time t and at equilibrium respectively equilibrium isotherms for nickel and silver were studied in order to better model the adsorption mechanisms the adsorption data were analyzed using langmuir 1918 and freundlich 1906 models langmuir model is based on a homogeneous surface with a finite number of identical sites it also assumes that there is no interaction between the adjacent sites langmuir equation is expressed as 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where qm mg g refers to the maximum adsorption capacity and kl l mg is the langmuir constant freundlich model supposes that adsorption occurs onto a heterogeneous surface this model is expressed by the following equation 6 q e k f c e 1 n where kf and n are freundlich constants related to the adsorption capacity and the strength of adsorption respectively the langmuir freundlich equation sips 1948 is given by 7 q e q m k l f c e n l f 1 k l f c e n l f where qe is the adsorbed amount at equilibrium mg g qm the l f maximum adsorption capacity mg g ce the adsorbate equilibrium concentration mg l klf the equilibrium constant for a heterogeneous solid and nlf is the heterogeneity parameter another parameter was considered the rate of equilibrium adsorption reduction δ zhi rong and shao qi 2009 it is the ratio of the difference between non competitive equilibrium adsorption and competitive equilibrium adsorption to non competitive adsorption observed at equilibrium 8 δ q i m q i m i x q i m where qim mg g and qimix mg g are the maximum adsorption capacity of i species in the single component system and binary component system respectively to prove the fit quality pearson s chi square χ2 values were evaluated using the following equation piccin et al 2017 9 χ 2 i 1 n q i e x p q i m o d e l 2 q i m o d e l where qi exp is the experimental value mg g of an independent variable qi mod is the equilibrium capacity calculated with the model mg g n is the number total of information 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical characterization of the considered materials fig 1 presents the xrd patterns of the raw bentonite raw be and modified bentonites by chemical activation na be and combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 the phases were identified using x pert highscore software through the jcpds database the studied bentonites mostly consist of montmorillonite mt feldspars f and small amounts of crystalline phases in the form of impurities quartz q for raw be all peaks were located at 2θ 5 9 d 14 9 å 19 8 d 4 4 å 34 1 d 2 6 å 35 8 d 2 5 å and 62 2 d 1 49 å values of d spacing 14 9 å 4 4 å 2 6 å 2 5 å and 1 49 å which correspond to the montmorillonite according to jcpds database feldspars peak f 2θ 27 7 and quartz peak q 2θ 26 6 with values of d spacing 3 2 å and 3 3 å for feldspars and quartz respectively could also be observed the estimation of montmorillonite and feldspars in the materials were evaluated by diffrac eva using semi quantitative method and led to the following proportions 70 0 73 4 of montmorillonite 25 6 27 0 of feldspars and 1 3 of other phases d spacing series of smectites for raw be demonstrated a reflection d001 at d value of 14 9 å this diffraction peak shrinked to 13 3 å after activation treatments thus through the evolution of bentonite after activation treatments a structural change can be noticed especially the move of the characteristic montmorillonite peak at bragg angles 2θ 6 8 which indicated a variation in sodium and calcium proportions table 2 as already demonstrated el miz et al 2017 it has also to be noted the disappearance of the crystalline phases in forms of quartz impurities q with the activation treatments ftir spectra of the natural and modified bentonite fig 2 showed infra red bands observed around 517 cm 1 corresponding to the deformation modes of si o al er ramly 2014 while the bands at 910 and 840 cm 1 are the characteristic bands of the bending vibrations of the al mg oh and al al oh groups of bentonite ayari et al 2005 bertagnolli et al 2011 farmer 1974 xu et al 2000 the presence of adsorbed water is evidenced by the band at 1635 cm 1 characteristic of the bending vibration of h2o the strong band at 1000 cm 1 of raw be can be attributed to a si o stretching vibration of the condensed phase affected by si o h deformation vibration band g socrates 2001 while the band at 3396 cm 1 corresponds to water stretching vibration band and 3623 cm 1 to the stretching vibration of structural oh groups farmer 1974 3 2 morphology and characterization of the considered materials the morphology of raw be fig 3 a na be fig 3b and na be450 fig 3c showed an irregularity of the particles forming aggregates the sem pictures showed the classical general appearance of the montmorillonite essentially constituted of sheets as a matter of fact smectites are demonstrated to be composed of one octahedral sheet centered between two tetrahedral sheets shichi and takagi 2000 uddin 2017 as seen from fig 3b to c the evolution of modified bentonite grain size during activation process could be observed fig 3b and c showed a slight increase in particle roughness resulted by activation treatment nitrogen adsorption desorption experiments were performed on raw be na be and na be450 to study their porosity fig 4 a shows that the isotherms of modified bentonites are of type iv according to the iupac classification stafford et al 1985 thommes et al 2015 which reveals the presence of mesopores in these materials the specific surface area determined by bet and total pore volume of raw bentonite were 14 5 m2 g and 0 063 cm3 g respectively when considering na be and na be450 an increase in the bet surface area 44 9 m2 g and 66 7 m2 g respectively table 3 was measured na be450 bentonite has received maximum improvement in surface area 78 compared to na be 67 the pore size of the modified bentonites followed the same trend as the specific surface area na be450 na be raw be na be and na be450 were composed of micropores mesopores and macropores fig 4b it can be concluded that the treatment has resulted in an important increase in specific surface and pore size with a higher effect of the combined treatment this is due to the removal of adsorbed and hydrated water molecules and other impurities 3 3 kinetic studies of nickel retention the kinetic studies of nickel onto modified bentonites are presented in fig 5 the adsorption of nickel ions on modified bentonite was demonstrated to rapidly occur the maximum adsorbed amount of nickel on na be and na be450 were 4 6 and 4 8 mg g respectively fig 5 the adsorption kinetics of nickel on na be and na be450 are examined with the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetics fig 5 table 4 shows the different kinetic parameters calculated from the graphical representation of these three models according to the coefficient of determination r2 values and the qeq values table 4 the pseudo second order kinetic model is the most reliable to describe the adsorption of nickel on the modified bentonites which suggests that the adsorption process may be a chemisorption kumar et al 2011 piccin et al 2017 zou et al 2006 3 4 nickel and silver retention in single component systems the equilibrium isotherms in single component systems are presented in fig 6 the maximum nickel retention capacity 10 7 mg g was obtained for the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 the obtained results fully followed the variation of specific surface with activation treatment sbet na be450 sbet na be sbet raw be in addition nickel adsorption on raw be in the tested experimental conditions caused the saturation of the adsorption sites of the considered material compared to the activated bentonite which still demonstrated adsorption properties this means that the activated treatment of na be and na be450 creates more active sites leading to an improved retention ability the adsorption capacity for silver more rapidly reached saturation than for nickel on each of the tested material the maximum silver retention capacity 7 1 mg g was obtained for the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 which corroborates the results obtained for nickel adsorption isotherms were modeled by langmuir eq 5 freundlich eq 6 and l f models sips eq 7 based on the coefficient of determination r2 values table 5 freundlich does not provide a good fit to the experimental data for both nickel and silver ions the experimental data have been well fitted by langmuir isotherm and langmuir freundlich sips models as can be observed in table 5 and fig 6 these results predict a cooperative adsorption process involving adsorbent adsorption interactions which implies that the adsorbents present homogeneous adsorption sites guerra et al 2013 the adsorption of nickel and silver ions may also be enhanced by ion exchange which occurs between the metal ions and the amounts of alkali and alkaline earth metals in bentonites e g ni2 can take the place of the exchangeable cations such as na mg2 and k in bentonite layer and interposed between the bentonite layers vieira et al 2010a as a matter of fact the exchange process between sodium and calcium occurring during chemical treatment and demonstrated by eds and xrd analysis could enhance the adsorption capacities as already demonstrated alvarez ayuso and garcia sanchez 2003 bhattacharyya and gupta 2008 ijagbemi et al 2010 the results from this study suggests that the chemical activation na be and the combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 could be an effective method to enhance the adsorption capacity of the bentonite 3 5 nickel and silver retention in binary component systems when simultaneously exposed to nickel and silver the maximal adsorption capacities obtained for na be450 equaled 10 2 and 6 6 mg g or 0 17 and 0 06 mmol g for nickel and silver respectively fig 7 this is in agreement with the above results in single component systems the results obtained in single component systems were added on the figures for an easier comparison showing that the competition led to a decrease of the adsorption capacity but such reduction was attenuated for the modified bentonites following the previous modelling results only l f model was used table 6 to fit the experimental data in binary system the high r2 values showed that equilibrium data were well fitted which corroborates the previous results in single component system suggesting a monolayer adsorption of nickel and silver onto na be and na be450 in terms of competition between metals such enhanced competitive effects in binary components was investigated mohan and singh 2002 zhi rong and shao qi 2009 using the ratio of the maximum adsorption capacity for the metal in the binary component system qimix to the maximum adsorption capacity for the same metal in the single component qim if qimix qim 1 the adsorption is promoted in the presence of the other metal ions if qimix qim 1 there is no effect and interaction between metal ion i and other metals ions if qimix qim 1 the adsorption is suppressed by the presence of other metal ions in this work the values of all qimix qim were below 1 which confirms the mutual competitive effect of nickel and silver in binary component systems the rates of equilibrium adsorption reduction δ are given in table 6 for na be the rate of equilibrium adsorption reduction δ of nickel was diminished by 6 4 in binary component system ni ag and for silver was decreased by 25 6 in the ag ni system for na be450 in ni ni ag and ag ag ni systems this rate δ was decreased by 4 6 and 5 8 respectively these results were in agreement with the observed experimental data fig 7 based on the rate of equilibrium adsorption reduction δ values the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 has demonstrated its performance and efficiency towards nickel and silver even in the binary component system in addition it was clear that the presence of another metal led to a competition for the adsorption sites on na be and na be450 even though nickel was less submitted to this effect compared to ag this could be explained by the smaller ionic radius of nickel 0 72 å yavuz et al 2003 than that of silver 1 26 å liu et al 2003 which allows an easier nickel penetration to the available sites of na be and na be450 3 6 nickel and silver retention in natural effluents to better understand the mechanism of silver adsorption by bentonites in complex environments it is important to know the speciation of silver in solution which also depends on the ph speciation diagram of silver was obtained using the hydra medusa software figure si 1 the choice of the concentrations studied in figure si 1 was based on the values found in the natural effluents such as brassware effluent a fez f1 and sebou rivers table 1 and tap water table si 2 nickel and silver retention by na be and na be450 in tap water are depicted in fig 8 the results obtained with milliq water mq experiments were added on the figures for an easier comparison the presence of some major ions i e calcium sodium and magnesium table si 2 in tap water did not seem to impact on modified bentonites efficiency silver retention quite increased compared to that in milliq water experiments this result could come from the presence of chloride ions in tap water 37 mg l that could directly increase silver removal accounted for na be and na be450 material the probability of formation of silver chloride solid was performed using the hydra medusa software ignasi puigdomenech 2015 as a function of cl ag ratios the results of the hydra medusa simulation fig si 1 confirmed the formation of agcl s concerning nickel the results showed that the removal efficiency in the studied concentration range were above 89 and 93 on na be and na be450 respectively silver removal efficiency on na be and na be450 was above 99 in these conditions the modified bentonites have demonstrated a good adsorption efficiency which turns these adsorbents interesting for metal adsorption even in complex media the brassware effluent a was characterized by very high metal levels 80 3 mg l of nickel and 41 7 mg l of silver table 1 the effluents from fez f1 and sebou rivers s1 during working day were polluted in nickel and silver though at a lesser extent 214 6 and 94 3 μg l respectively in fez river and 122 8 and 28 9 μg l respectively in sebou river fez f2 and sebou rivers s2 during non working day were the least polluted in nickel and silver 59 5 and 51 1 μg l respectively in fez river and 20 4 and 5 1 μg l respectively in sebou river table 1 in order to assess the risk associated with the presence of metal pollutants in the studied waters the measured concentrations were compared to the standards set by the european water framework directive directive 2008 105 ec the results showed that nickel and silver concentrations in the study sites are greater than the values set for nickel 20 μg l eu 2008 and silver 5 μg l concentrations vorkamp and sanderson 2016 established in accordance with environmental quality standards eqs this means that the waters of fez and sebou rivers present a toxic risk for aquatic organisms the retention of nickel from the brassware industry effluent a by na be and na be450 turned less efficient due to the presence of numerous competing agents na be and na be450 retention efficiency were 26 4 and 41 2 respectively for ni such discrepancy can be explained by the higher surface area of the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 which caused an increase of the number of available sites silver removal efficiency is very high this result may be due to the presence of ions chloride for example in effluents wastewater which could react with silver and lead to precipitation the removal efficiency of na be and na be450 for both nickel and silver in sebou and fez rivers were 100 table 7 it has to be underlined that even if the tested effluents were less contaminated in metals than the brassware rinsing bath their metals content was important this clearly demonstrated the effectiveness and ability of both materials for removal nickel and silver in a complex and contaminated media in order to evaluate the potential improvements to nickel and silver ions extraction offered by modified bentonite by chemical activation na be and the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 over other adsorbents the results obtained in this work were compared to the retention capacities of some usual natural adsorbents from the literature table 8 chosen for their composition close to that of the studied bentonites although a direct comparison of na be and na be450 with other adsorbents is quite complicated due to the different experimental conditions used it has been found that nickel and silver adsorption capacity of na be and na be450 is among the highest results therefore considering the adsorption capacities of other natural materials low cost accessibility and environment friendly bio material it can be concluded that the modified bentonite by chemical activation na be and the modified bentonite by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 proved themselves promising low cost effective natural adsorbents to remove nickel and silver ions from aqueous solutions 3 7 regeneration study the regeneration and reuse of na be and na be450 adsorbents is an interesting operation from an environmental and economical point of view if an industrial application is targeted the impact of regeneration cycles on efficiency removal is presented in fig 9 the regeneration efficiency showed that nickel adsorption efficiency on na be450 and na be b and c bars was kept around 90 and 70 respectively up to the fifth cycle of regeneration for ag both na be450 and na be d and e bars removal efficiency dramatically decreased from the first cycle of regeneration until the fifth one nickel retention through regeneration cycles show that na be and na be450 can be easily regenerated and still demonstrated a high efficiency sustainable in time 4 conclusion in this paper a na2co3 activated bentonite na be and modified by combined chemical and thermal activation na be450 both treatments of the bentonite led to improving the specific surface areas of the material and its adsorption capacity the sorption experiments carried out has shown that na be and na be450 materials demonstrated a noticeable retention ability towards nickel and silver taken separately or as a binary component system the contact time was rapid which turns these materials suitable for industrial depolluting systems in single component system the maximum nickel and silver retention capacity was obtained on na be450 which fully follows the variation of specific surface with activation treatment the adsorption isotherms were better represented by the l f model suggesting that the monolayer adsorption of nickel and silver onto na be and na be450 the results in binary component systems confirms the previous results in single component systems this study showed the positive effect of combined chemical and thermal activation on the enhancing adsorbent properties the use of na be and na be450 were then successfully tested in industrial effluents brassware effluent as well as river effluents demonstrating the possible use of this worldwide materials in wastewaters treatment finally the regeneration study revealed a net benefit for na be450 which make it as low cost effective

storage movement and recharge ultimately depicting groundwater potentiality with the integration of these thematic layers groundwater potential zones have been delineated under gis environment the analytic hierarchy process ahp and multi influencing factors mif techniques have been considered to depict groundwater potential zones of the test area the ahp technique was first introduced by prof thomas l saaty in the 1970s to normalize the assigned weights chowdhury et al 2008 nithya et al 2019 with this method decision making can be done by judgments hierarchical structure and the proper perception that has dominant control on the ultimate decision nithya et al 2019 saaty 1994 in this experiment the ahp technique is a universally accepted decision making technique and simple and well structured to understand on the contrary multi influencing factors mif has also been applied to delineate potential zones of groundwater in the mif technique the interrelationship between different factors is taken into consideration for weightage calculation it is also simple and well structured in the end which model is more better and reliable model in the test area will be analysed these two models were selected for comparative study because both the models are weighted the ahp model is based on the weights assigned by the different experts in contrast the mif technique s weights are entirely based on the different influencing layers interrelationship 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the test area suri sadar sub division is located in the southwestern margin of birbhum

materials used eleven thematic layers have been made with arcgis 10 5 software to identify groundwater potential zones various conventional data like geology rainfall drainage density soil texture lineament density aquifer thickness and multiple remotely sensed data like elevation slope land use and land cover ndvi and pond density have been accumulated from various sources table 1 the

kappa statistics in ibm spss 25 software fig 2 depiction of how groundwater potential zones maps were extracted and validated 3 factors influencing groundwater potentiality 3 1 aquifer thickness according to encyclopedia britannica the aquifer is the water bearing stratum of the rock as per the literature review aquifer thickness has vital dominance on groundwater potentiality adiat et al 2013 das and mukhopadhyay 2018 razandi et al 2015 shekhar and pandey 2015 aquifer thickness map is found in the portal of the water resources information system of india in this test area the aquifer is quite thick in the southeastern part of the sub division and decreases towards the northwest direction fig 3 a therefore it can be said that the southeast part will store more water as it has more space but areal coverage of thicker aquifer is relatively low in the test area table 2 3 2 geology geology has a direct impact on groundwater potentiality it influences permeability and the porosity of rocks das and mukhopadhyay 2018 murmu et al 2019 rahmati et al 2016 the test area is covered with laterite hard clay impregnated with caliche nodules alternating layer of sand silt and clay rajmahal trap siltstone sandstone and shale with coal seam and granitic gneiss with enclaves of metamorphites units fig 3b table 3 depicts that 39 88 percent of the test area is covered by granitic gneiss with enclaves of metamorphites and 2 80 percent by rajmahal trap geologic units that do not sufficiently allow water percolation that is why the lowest score has been assigned to these groups siltstone sandstone and shale with coal seam covering only 1 52 percent of the test area have been given lower weightage than hard clay impregnated with caliche nodules 18 44 percent the alternating layer of sand silt and clay occupied 26 06 percent has been given good weightage contrary to that laterite covered 11 27 percent of the test area it has been given the highest weightage because of its porous nature 3 3 rainfall in the hydrological cycle precipitation or rainfall has a vital contribution for the proper regulation of surface and sub surface hydrology chaudhry et al 2019 in the hydrological cycle groundwater is recharged by rainfall therefore the higher the amount of rain and the duration of rainfall the higher would be the recharge as the test area is under a tropical monsoon climate maximum precipitation occurs during the monsoon season fig 3c represents that maximum rainfall occurs in the northern part and gradually decreases towards the southeast table 4 describes that more than 1400 mm precipitation occurs in 32 54 percent 1300 1400 mm in 51 81 percent and less than 1300 mm in 15 65 percent area 3 4 lineament density there is an excellent correlation between lineament density and groundwater recharge lineament depicts the fractures of the earth s surface through which water can infiltrate anbarasu et al 2019 areas with lineaments have a higher infiltration rate which increases groundwater storage capacity murmu et al 2019 fig 3d represents the lineament density map which has been made by the line density tool of arcgis 10 5 software the lineament density of the test area ranges from 0 to 1 26 km km2 from fig 3d it is found that lineament density is maximum in the central and northwestern portion of the test area lineament orientations are represented with the rose diagram avtar et al 2010 the rose diagram fig 4 illustrates the directions of lineaments fig 4 predominant along the northwest and southeast table 5 depicts that only 11 82 percent area of the test region has 0 46 1 26 km km2 35 63 percent has 0 17 0 45 km km2 and 52 55 percent has 0 0 16 km km2 lineament density 3 5 soil texture geology different climatic agents elevation slope etc determine soil character which ultimately determines groundwater recharge capacity and groundwater movement in the vadose layer ajay kumar et al 2020 avtar et al 2010 das and mukhopadhyay 2018 ghosh et al 2020 murmu et al 2019 infiltration capacity is determined by soil texture the test area comprises five types of soil textures clay clay loam loam sandy and sandy loam fig 3e clay soil covers 14 percent clay loam 21 71percent loam 4 47 percent sandy 14 9 percent and sandy loam 44 92 percent of the test area table 6 the nomenclature of the major soil types of the study region is essential for the international readers based on the predominance of sand silt and clay major soil types have been classified in the study area table 7 sandy soil texture has been found in the western part of the study area where sands are predominant due to the weathering and erosion process over the jharkhand plateau fringe as the content of sand 80 100 is very high so this soil type is called sandy soil sandy loam clay loam and loam are found around the river network area fig 3e and j that s why sand and silt are deposited by the rivers in their surroundings here the percentage of silt is high for both soils 3 6 slope the steepness of the slope of a place strongly influences surface runoff and infiltration ghosh et al 2020 guru et al 2017 murmu et al 2019 naghibi et al 2015 nithya et al 2019 the slope s steepness indicates higher surface runoff which results in lower infiltration rate and vice versa magesh et al 2012 murmu et al 2019 the degree of slope varies from 0 to 28 79 in the test area fig 3f about 40 5 percent of the test area is occupied by 0 1 13 slope which is almost flat and assigned a very high rank for groundwater prospect nearly 37 3 percent area covered by 1 14 2 48 slope set a high rank 2 49 4 29 slope covered 18 21 percent area assigned as a medium and only 3 99 percent area covered y 4 3 28 79 slope which is reclassified with very low rank table 8 3 7 elevation elevation or topography determine groundwater recharge capacity in the plain region infiltration will occur in higher proportion due to slow surface runoff or stagnation of water duan et al 2016 with the increase of relief the runoff will occur faster and recharge will be done at a lower rate the elevation of the test area varies from 26 to 167 m fig 3g table 9 depicts that 24 77 percent area of the test region has 26 56 m height 26 43 percent has 56 72 m 20 87 percent has 72 90 m 17 47 percent has 90 108 m and 10 45 percent area has 108 167 m height 3 8 pond density in the plain region ponds are one of the most significant features of surface water storage surface water storage influences groundwater recharge by increasing infiltration das and mukhopadhyay 2018 ponds of the test area are digitized from google earth and a pond density map has been made in the gis environment the pond density of the test area increases toward the southeast fig 3h table 10 represents that 45 41 percent of the region has 3 63 6 39 km km2 pond density 28 93 percent has 6 4 11 99 km km2 and 25 66 percent has 0 3 62 km km2 pond density 3 9 normalised difference vegetation index ndvi healthy vegetation will grow when there will be available water in pore spaces of soil on the contrary vegetation will be degraded due to the lack of water therefore if the ndvi value increases groundwater prospect is probable putra and masduqi 2018 fig 3i depicts that the ndvi value ranges from 0 7 to 0 73 in the test area in table 11 the sub classwise area of the ndvi values has been plotted ndvi has been obtained from sentinel images using the following formula 1 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d 3 10 drainage density the pattern of the drainage in the surface is controlled by that region s lithological structure manap et al 2014 however elevation and slope determine the orientation of the drainage generally drainage density has a direct positive correlation with height so the higher the elevation higher would be the drainage density and vice versa on the contrary if the elevation increases drainage density will increase simultaneously which will decrease the infiltration rate and ultimately decrease groundwater recharge therefore the higher the drainage density lower will be groundwater prospect in the test area drainage density is maximum in the northwestern part and less in the southeastern region fig 3j table 12 represents that 66 75 percent area has less drainage density 27 69 percent has moderate and only 5 56 percent area has high drainage density 3 11 land use and land cover land use and land cover of an area influence various hydrogeological process viz runoff infiltration etc land use and land cover are two different terms having small distinction land use is anthropocentrically defined which means a human operator in a specific area agriculture mining etc in contrast to this land cover is a more natural category that means what exists in a particular area forest water bodies etc chaudhry et al 2019 land use and land cover sub classes of the test area have been derived from sentinel images of usgs earthexplorar in the test area there are 8 sub classes delineated using supervised classification fig 3k the water body covers 1 percent in the test area vegetation 7 39 percent wasteland 23 06 percent settlement 14 19 percent rabi crop 6 08 percent kharif crop 28 71 percent double triple crop 19 43 percent and current fallow covers only 0 14 percent area table 13 accuracy assessment of land use and land cover map has been done to assess how effectively the pixels were sampled into the correct land cover classes a total of 160 points were made 20 to each category in the classified land use land cover map of the test area with the help of google earth and field visit as a reference source each point was verified table 14 represents the error matrix of land use land cover classification now the overall accuracy of the land use land cover classification 2 n u m b e r o f c o r r e c t p o i n t n u m b e r o f t o t a l p o i n t 100 132 160 100 82 5 4 multi influencing factors mif for weightage the multi influencing factors mif technique has been adopted to assign weightage based on the literature review mif technique is initially based on interrelationship and interdependence among different influencing parameters fig 5 represents the interrelationship and interdependence of various influencing factors of groundwater potential zones for each significant factor 1 wt was assigned and for minor factor 0 5 wt was assigned table 15 now to calculate the weight of each influencing factors following formula has been adopted 3 p r o p o s e d s c o r e p i a b a b 100 a refers to the major effect b refers to the minor effect and pi refers to individual parameter weight contrary to this the sub classes of each influencing factor need to assign weightage now the sub class having the strongest influence the weight of the factor has been assigned for it after that to give the second highest influencing sub class following formula has been adopted for the highest influencing subclass 4 s i 1 p i where s i 1 refers to highest influencing sub class p i refers to factor weight for the next higher influencing subclass 5 s i 2 s i 1 p i n where s i 2 refers to next higher influencing sub class s i 1 refers to highest influencing sub class p i refers to factor weight following this pattern weights of all subclasses of each thematic layer have been calculated and plotted in table 16 mif basically based on the interrelationship and interdependence of the concerning thematic factors therefore the concept of multicollinearity has been arised here likewise multi linear regression multicollinearity is not a problem here but here multicollinearity helps us for the formulation of better spatial groundwater potential zones 5 analytic hierarchy process ahp for weightage it is very much essential to assign appropriate weight to obtain a more accurate result various methods are available to give rank ahp is one of them the entire work was done by the ahp template of scbuk https www scbuk com ahp html the ahp method is a rigorous method to assist in the process of prioritization this technique is based on a pair wise comparison matrix a fundamental scale has been used to assign rank based on a literature review table 17 using this fundamental scale of pair wise comparison a matrix was tabled table 18 after completion of the pair wise comparison matrix a normalize pair wise comparison matrix has been generated table 19 using following formula 6 x i j x i m a t x i where xij refers to normalised value of ith row and jth column xi mat refers to the individual matrix value of each cell of each theme and x i refers to the total value of each column in table 18 normalised weights of each theme have been calculated using the following formula 7 w i x i j n where w i normalised weight x i j refers normalised value of ith row and jth column and n refers the number of influencing factors consistency analysis is the major part of ahp technique because consistency proves the determination of ahp result according to satty if the consistency value is less than 10 percent it means ahp technique is best fitted to calculate the consistency index the following formula has been implied 8 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ m a x means the largest eigenvalue of the comparison matrix and n means number of observation now to calculate the consistency ratio following formula has been used 9 consistency ratio consistency index random inconsistency the consistency ratio value should be equal to or less than 0 1 6 groundwater potential zones with the systematic analysis of mif and ahp techniques two different groundwater potential zone maps were delineated using the raster calculator one gwpz map was obtained using the mif technique and the other used the ahp technique fig 6 a and fig 6b the entire work was done in a gis environment at first reclassification of thematic layers was made with weighted values then the integration of all weighted thematic layers has been done using the raster calculator two different techniques mif and ahp have been used to identify the potential zones of groundwater with the mif technique the low groundwater potential zone covers 44 05 percent medium groundwater potential zone covers 32 82 percent and high groundwater potential zone covers 23 13 percent area of the test region table 20 contrary to this with the use of the ahp technique a different result has come in the ahp technique the low groundwater potential zone covers 41 41 percent medium groundwater potential zone covers 34 32 percent and high groundwater potential zone covers 24 28 percent of the test region table 20 however both results represent that the northwestern part of the test area has low prospects and the southeastern part has good potentiality for groundwater fig 6a and b granitic gneiss with enclaves of metamorphites persist in the northwestern part of the test area which does not allow water to infiltrate that is why aquifer thickness is low contrary to this in the southeastern region laterite hard clay impregnated with caliche nodules the alternating layer of sand silt and clay geological unit persist suitable for water infiltration aquifer thickness is relatively high these lead to low potentiality in the northwestern part and high potentiality in the southeastern region 7 accuracy assessment to assess the accuracy of the obtained maps yield data of 55 wells have been collected from hydrological information of groundwater prospect maps designed and developed by hydrology division nrsc isro from the obtained yield data of 55 wells the actual yield from drilled borehole ranges from 30 to 800 lpm liters per minute it has been categorized in three groups low 30 50 and 50 100 lpm medium 100 200 lpm and high 200 400 and 400 800 lpm table 21 represents the accuracy of the gwpz maps which is obtained with mif and ahp techniques now to validate it kappa statistics were calculated with ibm spss 25 software the kappa statistic takes into account the chance agreement das et al 2020 sim and wright 2005 when two measurements actual yield and expected yield agree only at the chance level the value of kappa statistics is zero when the two measurements agree the value of kappa is 1 0 following formula has been used to calculate the kappa statistics value 10 k observed agreement chance agreement 1 chance agreement 10 table 22 reveals the measure of agreement of kappa statistics for the gwpz map obtained by mif technique is 0 754 and table 23 shows that the measure of agreement of kappa statistics for the gwpz map obtained by ahp technique is 0 702 however the measure of agreement above 0 7 is considered as good for validation the agreement of groundwater potential zones map obtained by multi influencing factors technique is 0 754 which is a very good result and by analytic hierarchy process is 0 702 which is also considered good for measurement in this test area the multi influencing factors technique for the delineation of groundwater potential zones map is more suitable in comparison to the ahp technique 8 conclusion various developing countries like india have colossal population pressure on its natural resources therefore to fulfill the demand of water it is very much essential to use groundwater in a sustainable manner with proper planning now on the eve of rs and gis it has become possible to handle large size data moreover we can integrate all the essential factors and can prepare groundwater potential zones map in rs and gis environment and with accuracy assessment it gives outstanding results as well in the test area the northwestern part is not enriched with groundwater and the southeastern part has good potentiality for groundwater but in the southeastern part the utilisation of groundwater for agriculture is maximum in this context the northwestern part of the test area will soon suffer from the groundwater crisis as it has no potentiality for groundwater contrary to this the southeastern part of the test is exploiting the groundwater as it is more potential the northwestern part is not agriculturally enriched but it has a significant coalfield on the other hand to maintain the agricultural prospect of the southeastern portion of the test area the alternative of groundwater for irrigation such as river lifting irrigation from ponds tanks etc must be increased the groundwater potential zones mapping is too much vital in adequate planning and sound management of subsurface hydrological resources as the study attempts to apply two statistical method viz mif and ahp the result coming out is near to similar but the accuracy assessment tell us about slight difference of this result the accuracy assessment is based on the actual yield capacity of tube well in different points of the test region and kappa coefficient is used here to identify the accuracy of two models where result reveals mif is more accurate than ahp it is because mif method based on interrelationship and interdependence of selected groundwater influencing parameters but ahp method solely depends on literature review and expert advice therefore human errors are always existing here so we can conclude that in this region mif is suitable than ahp statistical method however the maximum part of the region is not potentially good for groundwater storage therefore we need proper utilisation planning for sustainable development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

11998,this study involves the demarcation of groundwater potential zones gwpz which has been produced by multi influencing factors mif and analytic hierarchy process ahp with the aid of remote sensing and geographic information system gis eleven influencing factors viz aquifer thickness geology rainfall lineament density soil texture slope elevation pond density drainage density ndvi and land use and land cover were used to delineate gwpz maps gwpz map prepared by the mif technique classified into low medium and high covering 44 05 32 82 and 23 13 of the test area contrary to this the gwpz map obtained by the ahp technique classified into the same categories low medium and high covering 41 41 34 32 and 24 28 of the test area using kappa statistics accuracy assessment of the gwpz maps has been done for both the mif technique and ahp technique with the agreement value of 0 754 and 0 702 in this study it has been found that groundwater potentiality is not satisfactory in the northwestern part of the test region therefore to use it wisely we may encourage the use of pond irrigation river lifting rain water harvesting graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential zones analytic hierarchy process multi influencing factors kappa statistics 1 introduction groundwater is essential for the entire biosphere s sustenance that is deteriorating with the march of civilization is one of the most precious resources on the earth although groundwater is naturally restored by surface flow or surface storage made either by precipitation or snow melting it has been limited availability chaudhry et al 2019 das et al 2019b ghorbani nejad et al 2017 subba rao 2006 however due to arising demand in different sectors like domestic agriculture and industry groundwater resource is under threat das and mukhopadhyay 2018 this threat takes perilous proportion when groundwater fails to meet the growing population s daily need in some pockets therefore to adequately use groundwater keeping parity with sustainable development it is imperative to delineate potential groundwater zones anbazhagan and jothibasu 2016 stratigraphy analysis and test drilling methods are the most plausible to understand the aquifer characteristics and groundwater quality but it is laborious time consuming and expensive too chowdhury et al 2008 sander per chesley matthew m minor 1996 with

2020 magesh et al 2012 nair et al 2017 nasir et al 2018 thapa et al 2017 have been adopted by different researchers in this study various thematic layers have been collected from conventional sources geological survey of india survey of india national atlas and thematic mapping organization bhuvan portal and india wris portal or extracted from satellite imagery sentinel 2 google earth srtm dem the data like aquifer thickness geology rainfall lineament density soil texture drainage density have been obtained from conventional sources and slope elevation pond density normalised difference vegetation index ndvi land use and land cover which have been extracted from satellite images of usgs sentinel 2 imagery all data provide information about how these factors determine groundwater storage movement and recharge ultimately depicting groundwater potentiality with the integration of these thematic layers groundwater potential zones have been delineated under gis environment the analytic hierarchy process ahp and multi influencing factors mif techniques have been considered to depict groundwater potential zones of the test area the ahp technique was first introduced by prof thomas l saaty in the 1970s to normalize the assigned weights chowdhury et al 2008 nithya et al 2019 with this method decision making can be done by judgments hierarchical structure and the proper perception that has dominant control on the ultimate decision nithya et al 2019 saaty 1994 in this experiment the ahp technique is a universally accepted decision making technique and simple and well structured to understand on the contrary multi influencing factors mif has also been applied to delineate potential zones of groundwater in the mif technique the interrelationship between different factors is taken into consideration for weightage calculation it is also simple and well structured in the end which model is more better and reliable model in the test area will be analysed these two models were selected for comparative study because both the models are weighted the ahp model is based on the weights assigned by the different experts in contrast the mif technique s weights are entirely based on the different influencing layers interrelationship 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the test area suri sadar sub division is located in the southwestern margin of birbhum district occupying 1782 72 km2 holding 11 21 871 population as per the 2011 census suri sadar sub division is extended from 23 41 30 n to 23 07 40 n latitude and 87 05 20 e to 87 46 20 e longitude the study area constitutes seven community development blocks mohammad bazar saithia dubrajpur rajnagar suri i suri ii and khoyrasole fig 1 the test area s geophysical identity is quite diversified here and it leads to the spatial variation of groundwater quality in mohammad bazar c d block degraded lateritic patches the second largest potential coalfield china clay mine is present debnath and prolaymondal 2014 both have a significant influence on the local economy but most of the population is engaged in the agricultural sector which is highly dependent on groundwater based irrigation 2 2 materials used eleven thematic layers have been made with arcgis 10 5 software to identify groundwater potential zones various conventional data like geology rainfall drainage density soil texture lineament density aquifer thickness and multiple remotely sensed data like elevation slope land use and land cover ndvi and pond density have been accumulated from various sources table 1 the geological map is being digitized from the district resource map of birbhum district from india wris web gis of the water resources information system of india an aquifer thickness map has been collected from the district planning map series of natmo the rainfall map has been prepared the test area s drainages have been digitized from the topographical sheets after digitization one km2 grid has been made and a drainage density map has been prepared in the arcgis 10 5 software soil texture map was collected from the portal of birbhum district the lineament map has been collected from the indian geo platform of isro bhuvan for the preparation of the lineament density map the line density tool of spatial analyst of arcgis 10 5 software has been used with the help of srtm dem of usgs earth explorer elevation and slope maps have been prepared the slope map has been created using the slope of the surface tool from the spatial analyst tool the supervised classification has been done using maximum likelihood classification of image classification tool to produce land use and land cover map from sentinel satellite of usgs normalised difference vegetation index ndvi layer has been framed using two near infrared band and red band in the raster calculator of arcgis 10 5 software 2 3 methods the integration of various thematic layers as influencing factors has been done using two methods analytic hierarchy process ahp and multi influencing factors mif to produce the potential zones of groundwater in the beginning 11 thematic layers have been prepared all the thematic layers have been converted into a raster format of 30 30 m grid cell then the assignment of weight for each theme and each sub class of the themes following two different ahp and mif methods the integration of these thematic layers has been done using the raster calculator of the spatial analyst tool of arcgis 10 5 software to obtain groundwater potential zone maps the raster calculator tool summed up all the weights of each grid and produced the ultimate result to represent lineament orientations rose diagram has been made by rockwork 17 software in the end accuracy assessment has been done using kappa statistics in ibm spss 25 software fig 2 depiction of how groundwater potential zones maps were extracted and validated 3 factors influencing groundwater potentiality 3 1 aquifer thickness according to encyclopedia britannica the aquifer is the water bearing stratum of the rock as per the literature review aquifer thickness has vital dominance on groundwater potentiality adiat et al 2013 das and mukhopadhyay 2018 razandi et al 2015 shekhar and pandey 2015 aquifer thickness map is found in the portal of the water resources information system of india in this test area the aquifer is quite thick in the southeastern part of the sub division and decreases towards the northwest direction fig 3 a therefore it can be said that the southeast part will store more water as it has more space but areal coverage of thicker aquifer is relatively low in the test area table 2 3 2 geology geology has a direct impact on groundwater potentiality it influences permeability and the porosity of rocks das and mukhopadhyay 2018 murmu et al 2019 rahmati et al 2016 the test area is covered with laterite hard clay impregnated with caliche nodules alternating layer of sand silt and clay rajmahal trap siltstone sandstone and shale with coal seam and granitic gneiss with enclaves of metamorphites units fig 3b table 3 depicts that 39 88 percent of the test area is covered by granitic gneiss with enclaves of metamorphites and 2 80 percent by rajmahal trap geologic units that do not sufficiently allow water percolation that is why the lowest score has been assigned to these groups siltstone sandstone and shale with coal seam covering only 1 52 percent of the test area have been given lower weightage than hard clay impregnated with caliche nodules 18 44 percent the alternating layer of sand silt and clay occupied 26 06 percent has been given good weightage contrary to that laterite covered 11 27 percent of the test area it has been given the highest weightage because of its porous nature 3 3 rainfall in the hydrological cycle precipitation or rainfall has a vital contribution for the proper regulation of surface and sub surface hydrology chaudhry et al 2019 in the hydrological cycle groundwater is recharged by rainfall therefore the higher the amount of rain and the duration of rainfall the higher would be the recharge as the test area is under a tropical monsoon climate maximum precipitation occurs during the monsoon season fig 3c represents that maximum rainfall occurs in the northern part and gradually decreases towards the southeast table 4 describes that more than 1400 mm precipitation occurs in 32 54 percent 1300 1400 mm in 51 81 percent and less than 1300 mm in 15 65 percent area 3 4 lineament density there is an excellent correlation between lineament density and groundwater recharge lineament depicts the fractures of the earth s surface through which water can infiltrate anbarasu et al 2019 areas with lineaments have a higher infiltration rate which increases groundwater storage capacity murmu et al 2019 fig 3d represents the lineament density map which has been made by the line density tool of arcgis 10 5 software the lineament density of the test area ranges from 0 to 1 26 km km2 from fig 3d it is found that lineament density is maximum in the central and northwestern portion of the test area lineament orientations are represented with the rose diagram avtar et al 2010 the rose diagram fig 4 illustrates the directions of lineaments fig 4 predominant along the northwest and southeast table 5 depicts that only 11 82 percent area of the test region has 0 46 1 26 km km2 35 63 percent has 0 17 0 45 km km2 and 52 55 percent has 0 0 16 km km2 lineament density 3 5 soil texture geology different climatic agents elevation slope etc determine soil character which ultimately determines groundwater recharge capacity and groundwater movement in the vadose layer ajay kumar et al 2020 avtar et al 2010 das and mukhopadhyay 2018 ghosh et al 2020 murmu et al 2019 infiltration capacity is determined by soil texture the test area comprises five types of soil textures clay clay loam loam sandy and sandy loam fig 3e clay soil covers 14 percent clay loam 21 71percent loam 4 47 percent sandy 14 9 percent and sandy loam 44 92 percent of the test area table 6 the nomenclature of the major soil types of the study region is essential for the international readers based on the predominance of sand silt and clay major soil types have been classified in the study area table 7 sandy soil texture has been found in the western part of the study area where sands are predominant due to the weathering and erosion process over the jharkhand plateau fringe as the content of sand 80 100 is very high so this soil type is called sandy soil sandy loam clay loam and loam are found around the river network area fig 3e and j that s why sand and silt are deposited by the rivers in their surroundings here the percentage of silt is high for both soils 3 6 slope the steepness of the slope of a place strongly influences surface runoff and infiltration ghosh et al 2020 guru et al 2017 murmu et al 2019 naghibi et al 2015 nithya et al 2019 the slope s steepness indicates higher surface runoff which results in lower infiltration rate and vice versa magesh et al 2012 murmu et al 2019 the degree of slope varies from 0 to 28 79 in the test area fig 3f about 40 5 percent of the test area is occupied by 0 1 13 slope which is almost flat and assigned a very high rank for groundwater prospect nearly 37 3 percent area covered by 1 14 2 48 slope set a high rank 2 49 4 29 slope covered 18 21 percent area assigned as a medium and only 3 99 percent area covered y 4 3 28 79 slope which is reclassified with very low rank table 8 3 7 elevation elevation or topography determine groundwater recharge capacity in the plain region infiltration will occur in higher proportion due to slow surface runoff or stagnation of water duan et al 2016 with the increase of relief the runoff will occur faster and recharge will be done at a lower rate the elevation of the test area varies from 26 to 167 m fig 3g table 9 depicts that 24 77 percent area of the test region has 26 56 m height 26 43 percent has 56 72 m 20 87 percent has 72 90 m 17 47 percent has 90 108 m and 10 45 percent area has 108 167 m height 3 8 pond density in the plain region ponds are one of the most significant features of surface water storage surface water storage influences groundwater recharge by increasing infiltration das and mukhopadhyay 2018 ponds of the test area are digitized from google earth and a pond density map has been made in the gis environment the pond density of the test area increases toward the southeast fig 3h table 10 represents that 45 41 percent of the region has 3 63 6 39 km km2 pond density 28 93 percent has 6 4 11 99 km km2 and 25 66 percent has 0 3 62 km km2 pond density 3 9 normalised difference vegetation index ndvi healthy vegetation will grow when there will be available water in pore spaces of soil on the contrary vegetation will be degraded due to the lack of water therefore if the ndvi value increases groundwater prospect is probable putra and masduqi 2018 fig 3i depicts that the ndvi value ranges from 0 7 to 0 73 in the test area in table 11 the sub classwise area of the ndvi values has been plotted ndvi has been obtained from sentinel images using the following formula 1 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d 3 10 drainage density the pattern of the drainage in the surface is controlled by that region s lithological structure manap et al 2014 however elevation and slope determine the orientation of the drainage generally drainage density has a direct positive correlation with height so the higher the elevation higher would be the drainage density and vice versa on the contrary if the elevation increases drainage density will increase simultaneously which will decrease the infiltration rate and ultimately decrease groundwater recharge therefore the higher the drainage density lower will be groundwater prospect in the test area drainage density is maximum in the northwestern part and less in the southeastern region fig 3j table 12 represents that 66 75 percent area has less drainage density 27 69 percent has moderate and only 5 56 percent area has high drainage density 3 11 land use and land cover land use and land cover of an area influence various hydrogeological process viz runoff infiltration etc land use and land cover are two different terms having small distinction land use is anthropocentrically defined which means a human operator in a specific area agriculture mining etc in contrast to this land cover is a more natural category that means what exists in a particular area forest water bodies etc chaudhry et al 2019 land use and land cover sub classes of the test area have been derived from sentinel images of usgs earthexplorar in the test area there are 8 sub classes delineated using supervised classification fig 3k the water body covers 1 percent in the test area vegetation 7 39 percent wasteland 23 06 percent settlement 14 19 percent rabi crop 6 08 percent kharif crop 28 71 percent double triple crop 19 43 percent and current fallow covers only 0 14 percent area table 13 accuracy assessment of land use and land cover map has been done to assess how effectively the pixels were sampled into the correct land cover classes a total of 160 points were made 20 to each category in the classified land use land cover map of the test area with the help of google earth and field visit as a reference source each point was verified table 14 represents the error matrix of land use land cover classification now the overall accuracy of the land use land cover classification 2 n u m b e r o f c o r r e c t p o i n t n u m b e r o f t o t a l p o i n t 100 132 160 100 82 5 4 multi influencing factors mif for weightage the multi influencing factors mif technique has been adopted to assign weightage based on the literature review mif technique is initially based on interrelationship and interdependence among different influencing parameters fig 5 represents the interrelationship and interdependence of various influencing factors of groundwater potential zones for each significant factor 1 wt was assigned and for minor factor 0 5 wt was assigned table 15 now to calculate the weight of each influencing factors following formula has been adopted 3 p r o p o s e d s c o r e p i a b a b 100 a refers to the major effect b refers to the minor effect and pi refers to individual parameter weight contrary to this the sub classes of each influencing factor need to assign weightage now the sub class having the strongest influence the weight of the factor has been assigned for it after that to give the second highest influencing sub class following formula has been adopted for the highest influencing subclass 4 s i 1 p i where s i 1 refers to highest influencing sub class p i refers to factor weight for the next higher influencing subclass 5 s i 2 s i 1 p i n where s i 2 refers to next higher influencing sub class s i 1 refers to highest influencing sub class p i refers to factor weight following this pattern weights of all subclasses of each thematic layer have been calculated and plotted in table 16 mif basically based on the interrelationship and interdependence of the concerning thematic factors therefore the concept of multicollinearity has been arised here likewise multi linear regression multicollinearity is not a problem here but here multicollinearity helps us for the formulation of better spatial groundwater potential zones 5 analytic hierarchy process ahp for weightage it is very much essential to assign appropriate weight to obtain a more accurate result various methods are available to give rank ahp is one of them the entire work was done by the ahp template of scbuk https www scbuk com ahp html the ahp method is a rigorous method to assist in the process of prioritization this technique is based on a pair wise comparison matrix a fundamental scale has been used to assign rank based on a literature review table 17 using this fundamental scale of pair wise comparison a matrix was tabled table 18 after completion of the pair wise comparison matrix a normalize pair wise comparison matrix has been generated table 19 using following formula 6 x i j x i m a t x i where xij refers to normalised value of ith row and jth column xi mat refers to the individual matrix value of each cell of each theme and x i refers to the total value of each column in table 18 normalised weights of each theme have been calculated using the following formula 7 w i x i j n where w i normalised weight x i j refers normalised value of ith row and jth column and n refers the number of influencing factors consistency analysis is the major part of ahp technique because consistency proves the determination of ahp result according to satty if the consistency value is less than 10 percent it means ahp technique is best fitted to calculate the consistency index the following formula has been implied 8 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ m a x means the largest eigenvalue of the comparison matrix and n means number of observation now to calculate the consistency ratio following formula has been used 9 consistency ratio consistency index random inconsistency the consistency ratio value should be equal to or less than 0 1 6 groundwater potential zones with the systematic analysis of mif and ahp techniques two different groundwater potential zone maps were delineated using the raster calculator one gwpz map was obtained using the mif technique and the other used the ahp technique fig 6 a and fig 6b the entire work was done in a gis environment at first reclassification of thematic layers was made with weighted values then the integration of all weighted thematic layers has been done using the raster calculator two different techniques mif and ahp have been used to identify the potential zones of groundwater with the mif technique the low groundwater potential zone covers 44 05 percent medium groundwater potential zone covers 32 82 percent and high groundwater potential zone covers 23 13 percent area of the test region table 20 contrary to this with the use of the ahp technique a different result has come in the ahp technique the low groundwater potential zone covers 41 41 percent medium groundwater potential zone covers 34 32 percent and high groundwater potential zone covers 24 28 percent of the test region table 20 however both results represent that the northwestern part of the test area has low prospects and the southeastern part has good potentiality for groundwater fig 6a and b granitic gneiss with enclaves of metamorphites persist in the northwestern part of the test area which does not allow water to infiltrate that is why aquifer thickness is low contrary to this in the southeastern region laterite hard clay impregnated with caliche nodules the alternating layer of sand silt and clay geological unit persist suitable for water infiltration aquifer thickness is relatively high these lead to low potentiality in the northwestern part and high potentiality in the southeastern region 7 accuracy assessment to assess the accuracy of the obtained maps yield data of 55 wells have been collected from hydrological information of groundwater prospect maps designed and developed by hydrology division nrsc isro from the obtained yield data of 55 wells the actual yield from drilled borehole ranges from 30 to 800 lpm liters per minute it has been categorized in three groups low 30 50 and 50 100 lpm medium 100 200 lpm and high 200 400 and 400 800 lpm table 21 represents the accuracy of the gwpz maps which is obtained with mif and ahp techniques now to validate it kappa statistics were calculated with ibm spss 25 software the kappa statistic takes into account the chance agreement das et al 2020 sim and wright 2005 when two measurements actual yield and expected yield agree only at the chance level the value of kappa statistics is zero when the two measurements agree the value of kappa is 1 0 following formula has been used to calculate the kappa statistics value 10 k observed agreement chance agreement 1 chance agreement 10 table 22 reveals the measure of agreement of kappa statistics for the gwpz map obtained by mif technique is 0 754 and table 23 shows that the measure of agreement of kappa statistics for the gwpz map obtained by ahp technique is 0 702 however the measure of agreement above 0 7 is considered as good for validation the agreement of groundwater potential zones map obtained by multi influencing factors technique is 0 754 which is a very good result and by analytic hierarchy process is 0 702 which is also considered good for measurement in this test area the multi influencing factors technique for the delineation of groundwater potential zones map is more suitable in comparison to the ahp technique 8 conclusion various developing countries like india have colossal population pressure on its natural resources therefore to fulfill the demand of water it is very much essential to use groundwater in a sustainable manner with proper planning now on the eve of rs and gis it has become possible to handle large size data moreover we can integrate all the essential factors and can prepare groundwater potential zones map in rs and gis environment and with accuracy assessment it gives outstanding results as well in the test area the northwestern part is not enriched with groundwater and the southeastern part has good potentiality for groundwater but in the southeastern part the utilisation of groundwater for agriculture is maximum in this context the northwestern part of the test area will soon suffer from the groundwater crisis as it has no potentiality for groundwater contrary to this the southeastern part of the test is exploiting the groundwater as it is more potential the northwestern part is not agriculturally enriched but it has a significant coalfield on the other hand to maintain the agricultural prospect of the southeastern portion of the test area the alternative of groundwater for irrigation such as river lifting irrigation from ponds tanks etc must be increased the groundwater potential zones mapping is too much vital in adequate planning and sound management of subsurface hydrological resources as the study attempts to apply two statistical method viz mif and ahp the result coming out is near to similar but the accuracy assessment tell us about slight difference of this result the accuracy assessment is based on the actual yield capacity of tube well in different points of the test region and kappa coefficient is used here to identify the accuracy of two models where result reveals mif is more accurate than ahp it is because mif method based on interrelationship and interdependence of selected groundwater influencing parameters but ahp method solely depends on literature review and expert advice therefore human errors are always existing here so we can conclude that in this region mif is suitable than ahp statistical method however the maximum part of the region is not potentially good for groundwater storage therefore we need proper utilisation planning for sustainable development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

11999,the present study shows the groundwater potential assessment and an effective management of the groundwater resources in bostanlik district uzbekistan based on the integrated utilization of remote sensing and gis techniques for the current study various thematic spatial layers such as soil map geology map land use land cover lulc elevation slope stream proximity stream density curvature topographic wetness index twi and precipitation are used to delineate groundwater potential zones gis based multi criteria decision analysis mcda was applied the percentage of groundwater potential zones identified using given factors is shown as 6 45 26 13 and 10 respectively from very high to very low classes high and very high probability of groundwater existence occurs within or across the charvak reservoir and along the chirchik river territories covered by mountains have low and very low potential of groundwater resources the rest of the territory has moderate potential for groundwater resources for the validation of obtained results we have used 31 observed spring locations results of overlaying the final map with spring locations shows relatively high accuracy rate the results of the research can be helpful for determining potential groundwater reserves of the bostanlik district graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential zones multi criteria decision analysis mcda influencing factor remote sensing gis 1 introduction groundwater is the most important natural resources in many countries of the world groundwater is a sources of drinking water has enough positive signs comparing with the surface water khosravi et al 2018b nowadays the contamination of the groundwater is also becoming a vital issue for the community rapid population growth in developing countries coupled with climate change exerts additive pressure on water demand and groundwater resources can be a lifebuoy to avoid water scarcity issues and social tensions andualem and demeke 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 lee et al 2012 viet ha et al 2020 groundwater zones strongly vary through space and time these factors include hydrological features such as land use and land cover soil types geology and geomorphology precipitation and evaporation water bodies irrigation etc lee et al 2012 vidhya and vinay 2018 groundwater resources are being extensively used for several purposes around the world but mostly for domestic and industrial purposes in arid and semi arid countries with small precipitation with high surface runoff groundwater is also used for agricultural purposes selvam et al 2014 1 1 groundwater challenges in uzbekistan during the soviet period groundwater resources were not as extensively used for agriculture and irrigation as they are now due to the following factors adequate quantity of surface water water supply for farms and good irrigational and melioration infrastructure with reliable financial support from the government rakhmatullaev et al 2012 groundwater resources were only used for livestock farming and other specific purposes after the failure of the soviet union the central asian countries began transformation from the planned centralized economy to the market based and this switch introduced new paradigms like land tenure water rights and private property however not all farmers were able to pump and irrigate by themselves rakhmatullaev et al 2010 according to antonov 2000 total groundwater used for agriculture equaled 6 4 of the total water for irrigation purposes used in uzbekistan at the end of 20th century rakhmatullaev et al 2012 state that actual groundwater abstraction is approximately 7 5 km3 year which leads to a serious surface flow reduction agricultural sector in the country is largely based on irrigation according to ibragimov et al 2007 water supply is a major crop yield limiting factor two factors in uzbekistan create a high pressure for water resources increase in irrigated lands in the country from 1 3 million hectares in 1900 to 4 2 million hectares in 2000 and rapid population growth during the last 80 years from 6 5 million people to 33 million in 2018 unep 2005 according to the world bank 2007 approximately 70 of the water is lost during irrigation and melioration practices and poor water management and conservation practices in turn evapotranspiration adds to that which can vary between 1500 and 2000 mm in dry and humid zones of the country in addition to this hagga et al 2007 prognosed evaporation rates to reach 10 15 due to the global warming uzbekistan has two significantly different climatic regions mountainous areas and deserts these landscapes form two types of groundwater formations respectively autochthonous and allochthonous the autochthonous type remains typically occurring in regions not covered by mountains and characterized by groundwater resources formed from precipitation or agricultural use according to borisov et al 2002 from 5 to 22 5 of atmospheric precipitation accumulates in the water table zone the allochthonous type is typical in mountainous regions ostrovsky 2007 ostrovsky 2007 states that shallow aquifers are influenced by salinization processes which mainly result from intensive and unsustainable irrigation and sodic nature of local soil types solonetz and solontchaks groundwater salinity level decreases with the depth and is highly related to agricultural practices institute of hydrology and engineering geology gives different values for annual groundwater recharge 27 km3 year and 23 km3 year respectively mavlonov et al 2003 recharge sources include surface inflow decontamination of water from rivers and lakes and precipitation one third of the groundwater recharge arises from subsurface inflow and the rest is coming from artificial sources like infiltration from canals and reservoirs mavlonov et al 2003 according to rakhmatullaev et al 2012 groundwater resources constitute about 10 of the total water resources and 60 of it is used for irrigation and household needs most of major aquifers in the country are found in the ferghana valley tashkent and samarkand provinces table 1 and fig 1 some authors such as karimov et al 2010 mention that the use of groundwater resources is not profitable due to several reasons surface water exploitation is cheaper than extraction of groundwater finding potential zones can be challenging and drilling wells are costly for farmers nevertheless extraction of water from shallow aquifers can be crucial in arid regions in villages with the rapidly growing population and in drought seasons main institutions that are responsible for groundwater resources management and regulation in uzbekistan are the following the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on geology and mineral resources chief governmental agency for investigating groundwater reserves and strategic management the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan for ecology and environmental protection former state committee for nature protection responsible for pollution control and sanctions the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on safety in industry and mining works with mineral and thermal groundwater resources the ministry of water resources is responsible for groundwater resources quality in irrigated areas rakhmatullaev et al 2012 1 2 gis and remote sensing applications for groundwater potential zonation mapping traditional methods often used for the discovery of groundwater resources that include hydrological geological geophysical and geomorphological tools are considered expensive time and labor consuming arulbalaji et al 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 champak b and dinesh 2018 fashae et al 2014 s vidhya and y vinay 2018 the latest technology of remote sensing rs and gis can be used to analyze and research groundwater potential zones gpz these spatial tools are very effective in management monitoring visual representation and assessment in such fields as ecology hazard and disaster risk geology and hydrology adeyeye et al 2019 fashae et al 2014 khosravi et al 2018a 2018b kumar et al 2014 2016 2019 lee et al 2012 although satellite images do not show directly the groundwater regions products of remote sensing analysis can be used for further multi criteria analysis of sub surface aquifer existence these spatial layers include land use and land cover digital elevation model and slope as well as soil types and geology in addition to this satellite images provide with information on those regions that are hardly accessible for people ali et al 2015 andualem and demeke 2019 das et al 2019a khosravi et al 2018b lee et al 2012 qadir et al 2019 many methods implemented today for geospatial mapping of groundwater potential zones these are influencing factor frequency ratio logistic regression weight of evidence certainty factor artificial neural networks machine learning decision tree analytical hierarchy process etc agarwal et al 2013 arulbalaji et al 2019 chaudhry et al 2019 das et al 2019a 2019b das 2019 duan et al 2016 eko aryanto and hardiman 2018 fashae et al 2014 hussein et al 2017 kesana sai teja and dinesh singh 2019 selvam et al 2014 singh et al 2011 sujatha and satyanarayana 2016 the rs and gis technologies can be successfully used to map potential groundwater zones different authors use different thematic layers for instance in a case study conducted in the musi basin india researchers used six layers for groundwater areas prediction lithology geology geomorphology slope digital elevation model dem and land use land cover ganapuram et al 2009 in other research conducted in dengi area north central nigeria authors used eight layers for groundwater potential zones mapping dem slope geology lineament contact proximity drainage proximity drainage density and soil types giving to each different weights adeyeye et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 used 13 factors that contribute for groundwater probability assessment among traditional soil type precipitation land use land cover slope dem geology lithology were also included topographic wetness index curvature stream power index terrain roughness index distance from fault and distance from the river stream mondal et al 2019 mentioned that for groundwater management and suitability mapping various parameters i e topography soil media depth of water aquifer media net recharge hydraulic conductivity and impact of vadose zone using the remote sensing and gis techniques in combination with hydro geological data layers are used the main objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of influencing factor multi criteria decision analysis tool for delineation of the groundwater potential zones using geospatial techniques and observed locations of springs in the example of the bostanlik district uzbekistan 2 study area the bostanlik district is located in the north eastern part of uzbekistan between 41 00 and 42 20 north and 69 30 and 71 20 east it is the largest district in the tashkent region the largest recreation sites of uzbekistan are located in bostanlik district the total area of the study area is 4 32 thousand km2 which is approximately 87 of the bostanlik district fig 2 climatic zone of the study area belongs to a temperate continental climate implying hot summers and cold winters temperature variations during the maximum and minimum years and different months are shown in table 2 the minimum temperature was 26 c the maximum temperature is 46 c average annual precipitation ranges between 500 mm and 600 mm mostly falling in spring and autumn the vegetation period lasts for 210 215 days juliev et al 2019a the topography of the bostanlik district is moderately dull and is characterized by high mountains and hills nearly all the terrain belongs to the high mountain systems namely the eastern tien shan the pskem mountains the karzhantau ridge the ugam ridge and the chatkal ridge accordingly the heights in the district rise from the west to the east and from the south to the north the region s southern and western parts stand at an average of 1000 m above sea level the rest part of the area where the uplands predominate is situated from 1200 to 4000 m above sea level the highest point in the region is the adelung pskem ridge peak with an altitude of 4301 m most of the peaks in the region varies between 1000 and 4000 m above sea level juliev et al 2017c the region is characterizes by high seismicity and from 5 to 8 or more earthquakes of different magnitude occur annually almost all mountain ranges have streams some of which turn into rivers the bulk of the streams and watercourses in the district are tributaries of the chirchik river the largest of them beldersay pskem ugam koksu chimgansay and others juliev et al 2019b almost all rivers flow into the charvak reservoir all rivers and their inflows are characterized by an instability of a water balance in different seasons in the mountainous regions of uzbekistan on the rivers of chirchik akhangaran narin kashkadarya and surkhandarya operate six water reservoirs with a capacity from 170 million m3 to 2 0 billion m3 coastal zones are located on high downslopes characterized by a complex geologic structure and formed by weak and easily eroding rocks in 1970 construction of the charvak dam with the height of 167 m has ended and started flowage of the brichmulla depression and filling of the charvak reservoir in the area around 40 km2 and with a volume of 2 billion m3 the coastal zone of the charvak water reservoir has the extent of 80 km juliev et al 2019b 3 materials and methods overall groundwater thematic layers were prepared to identify the existence of aquifers namely digital elevation model dem slope soil map geology map land use land cover lulc stream proximity stream density curvature topographic wetness index twi and precipitation from raw satellite data and other primary sources and processed in arcgis and erdas imagine softwares as essential layers for the multi criteria decision analysis tool fig 4 to cover the study area we chose a large watershed with an outlet in the lower ugam river the total area of the watershed equals to 11223 km2 fig 3 and it shares the territory among uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan in order to calculate hydrological factors and watershed characteristics flow accumulation and flow direction were calculated in esri arcgis 10 6 software platform soil data were downloaded from the fao geonetwork database with various soil properties in a shape file format and later converted to raster dataset with 30 m pixel resolution table 3 precipitation data were downloaded from the university of east anglia climatic data in netcdf format and then converted into the raster data table 3 the preliminary format was transformed to raster grids afterwards raster grids were converted into a point vector dataset in order to interpolate using kriging method into 30 m pixel resolution for classification landsat 8 oli tirs satellite image map was used that was downloaded from the nasa s earth data online database four layers elevation slope curvature and topographic wetness index were derived from aster satellite images table 3 before processing a fill operation for deleting the errors was applied having analyzed research papers by several authors adeyeye et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 das 2019 singh et al 2018 who also used a influencing factor technique it was decided to use soil type land use slope elevation geology and stream density curvature topographic wetness index stream proximity and precipitation thematic layers table 4 other layers such as lineament density geomorphology lithology and topographic roughness were excluded due to the lack of data and they were found not to have a specific value for our research giving weight for each thematic layer means setting a priority as to which map will have a higher and a lower impact on our final output 3 1 multi criteria decision analysis tool multi criteria decision analysis mcda tool particularly an influencing factor method is widely used in gis for delineating groundwater potential zones adeyeye et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 das 2019 mcda tool was developed by saaty 2008 and helps to integrate all thematic layers according to their weight value influencing factor is one of the simplest methods among all multi criteria decision analysis tools used to demarcate groundwater potential zones however it is commonly used to map groundwater sites due to its inclusiveness and efficiency a basic principle under this technique is the researcher s ability to give an appropriate weight for each thematic layer and ranks for classes of the layer that will influence the outcome das 2019 ten various thematic layers corresponding to different aspects contributing to groundwater formation were integrated to generate the final map using the following formula gpz i n xa yb where x represents the weight of the thematic layers y represents the rank of the thematic layer classes then the term a a 1 2 3 x shows the thematic layers and the term b b 1 2 3 y represents classes of the thematic layers arulbalaji et al 2019 das 2019 for this purpose arcgis 10 6 software s spatial analysis toolset weighted overlay function was used for each layer its own weight out of 100 depending on its importance was given according to the research of numerous literature sources table 4 and authors own subjective opinions based on the expertise and analysis in order to evaluate the weight of each class of thematic layer on the result we gave each class of layer a range from 1 to 9 table 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 thematic layers 4 1 1 slope slope has a major impact which defines percolation of surface water into the subsurface das et al 2019 surface run off is slow in small slope pixels and high in big slope pixels due to little time for infiltration slope was derived from aster satellite digital elevation model in arcgis 10 6 software and separated into five classes using natural breaks classification fig 5 a 4 1 2 elevation aster satellite digital elevation model was acquired from nasa s earthdata the spatial resolution image is 30 m fig 5b elevation plays a big role in watershed delineation and groundwater forming regions with high altitudes have low probability of groundwater existence while low altitude areas in turn have higher probability because gravity forces of the earth pull down the water streams before classifying a dem image into the five classes using natural breaks errors in pixel values were eliminated utilizing a fill function 4 1 3 curvature curvature is a quantitative expression of a surface outline and it can be dipped and curved arulbalaji et al 2019 the curvature tool is to calculate the second derivative value of the input surface on a cell by cell basis for each cell a fourth order polynomial of the formula is fit to a surface composed of a 3 times 3 window z ax2y2 bx2y cxy2 dx2 ey2 fxy gx hy i the coefficients a b c and so on are calculated from this surface the relationships among the coefficients and the nine values of elevation for every cell were numbered the output of the curvature tool is the second derivative of the surface for example the inclination of the slope is curvature 2 d e 100 output layer was reclassified into five classes using the natural breaks classification tool fig 5c high values represent a high curvature and low values represent a low curvature of the surface respectively 4 1 4 topographic wetness index the topographic wetness index twi is the most widely applied hydrologic topographic index which describes the capacity of a cell to accumulate water mattivi et al 2019 the formula of twi is the following twi sca tan ϕ where sca is the precise catchment area and ϕ is the slope angle the underlying concept that lies behind twi is a balance of mass sca is a flow accumulation parameter while the slope and the draining contour length is the tendency to evaluate water areas susceptible for water accumulation and categorized by a low slope angle will be represented by high twi values at that time well drained dry areas associated with low twi values mattivi et al 2019 twi map was classified in arcgis 10 6 software into five classes using natural breaks fig 5d high values of twi indicate a high probability of groundwater existence and consequently low values of twi represent low probability of groundwater existence 4 1 5 geological map geology is an important layer for the groundwater potential assessment because it is directly connected to the subsurface flow of the groundwater a geological map fig 5e consists of several deposits conglomerates loess sandstones siltstones limestones dolomites shales and magmatic complexes loess deposits siltstones and sandstones cover most of the territory the current map was prepared based on the materials of uzhydrogeology 4 1 6 soil types percolation and infiltration of water into the soil is directly dependent on the soil texture the capacity of the soil to retain or percolate water depends on several factors foremost it is a particle size soils with a small particle size silt and especially clay have a high water holding capacity due to very small pores between particles that make it easy for water to percolate through the soil layers into the vadoze zone at the same time large soil particles like sand and gravel have a very small water holding capacity and make it easy for the water to infiltrate and accumulate in the water table zone juliev et al 2019a another soil characteristic that relates to soil hydrological properties is bulk density the bulk density mass of the dry soil per unit volume including the pore spaces expressed as kg dm3 the higher the bulk density the less is the percolation capacity the soil has and vice versa soil layer contains information about spatial coverage of soil types and their characteristics soil properties such as bulk density clay silt sand percentage and soil texture are represented in table 5 and fig 7 f 4 1 7 land use and land cover many authors use land use and land cover lulc map to identify potential groundwater zones lulc is important because of several reasons juliev et al 2019b foremost areas covered by dense trees intercept most of the precipitation and occurrence of aquifers in such surface areas is small for instance such land classes as bare soil and rangelands have higher probability of groundwater existence urban areas and surfaces covered by rocks asphalt and minerals also have a very small groundwater potential due to the runoff and tiny percolation below the ground secondly artificial land use such as irrigated fields and aboveground aquifers and streams involve inevitable groundwater forming processes satellite data were downloaded from earth data landsat 8 oli image for july 1 2018 path 154 row 31 spatial resolution of the image is 30 m times 30 m classification was performed in erdas imagine software using a combined classification method which has a higher precision than supervised or unsupervised classification methods fig 5g the study area was divided into 120 clusters according to their spectral signature and close clusters were merged into six classes glaciers water bodies bare soil urban rangelands and forests accuracy of the classification was tested using the google earth pro images and constituted 89 with 0 85 kappa statistics 4 2 precipitation precipitation is the main source of water in the hydrological cycle model and along with the slope and elevation it manipulates the influence of groundwater formation processes arulbalaji et al 2019 for the current research climatic research unit high resolution gridded dataset prepared by the university of east anglia was downloaded pixels were transformed into the point features and were interpolated into 30 m pixel resolution map using kriging interpolation method in arcgis 10 6 software results were broken down into five classes using natural breaks from low to high precipitation fig 7h 4 2 1 stream density stream density shows the total stream length in kilometers within one square kilometer to calculate the stream density a line density tool in arcgis 10 6 was applied fig 5i according to fashae et al 2014 higher drainage density represents low groundwater potential the lines l1 and l2 represent the length of the portion of each line that falls within the circle the consistent population field values were v1 and v2 thus density l1 v1 l2 v2 area of circle 4 2 2 stream proximity stream proximity map visualizes the closeness of the nearest stream in a certain pixel area it was calculated using the streamlines of the watershed fig 3 with euclidean distance tool in arcgis 10 6 further the result was divided into five classes using natural breaks fig 5j output file shows pixels that represent values of closeness of the nearest stream in kilometers 4 3 groundwater potential zones delineation in the given research an influencing factor technique a multi criteria decision analysis method was assigned to identify the groundwater potential zone however there are several compulsory thematic layers for mapping of groundwater potential zones including the geology soil type land use elevation slope and stream density other layers can be chosen by researchers optionally according to their vision and understanding therefore various authors use different number of layers based on the study area data existence scope of the research and etc along with the thematic layers mentioned above many authors use such layers as lineament density geomorphology lithology precipitation stream power index topographic roughness index aspect of slope stream proximity and curvature we ranked each class of each layer from 1 to 9 according to saaty s 2008 measurement scale where 1 is the least priority layer has the smallest impact on groundwater potential existence and 9 is the highest impact on groundwater existence most of the layers have five classes because they were reclassified using natural breaks and then reclassified from continuous to discrete dataset other layers of thematic maps have various numbers of classes because they were achieved with attributes like geology soil types or derived from continuous data as discrete land use table 6 ranking for each class of layer was given based on the literature review adeyeye et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 das et al 2019b kesana sai teja and dinesh singh 2019 lakhwinder singh et al 2018 and authors expertise most of the research area is covered with high slope mountains hence only areas with low altitudes and low slope areas were given high ranks table 6 topographic wetness index and curvature are layers that are derived from aster satellite images table 3 and are directly related to the slope and altitude most of the study area has a very low and low twi 73 5 in sum and a small area 8 4 has a high and a very high twi values at the same time curvature of the study area is mostly covered with moderate curvature values 41 8 and with a high and a very high curvatures 38 7 the rest of the territory has a low and a very low curvature table 6 classes with a high curvature and a twi were given the biggest ranks in mcda analysis because they have a positive correlation with the groundwater regarding the soil texture loamy clay soil types cover half of the area only 1 4 of the area belongs to a clay soil type while the rest to various types with a loamy texture table 6 rankings for each soil class in mcda analysis were given based on table 5 where the percentage of each soil type and a bulk density for each class of soil are given classes with high sand and low bulk density were given the highest ranks because they have more permeability and less water holding capacity table 5 stream density and stream proximity were derived from the river streams of watershed fig 2 together they make 18 of weighing on the result table 4 watershed covered by many small and large streams pixels closest to stream lines were given the highest ranking and vice versa table 6 stream density also increases the probability of groundwater existence more than two third of the territory has very small small and moderate stream density these classes were assigned small ranking values table 6 precipitation also influences the groundwater formation therefore regions with higher precipitation rates were assigned higher values compared to regions with low precipitation rates table 6 land use and land cover classes also influence gpz we decided to assign the highest ranking values to water bodies covers 1 3 bare soil barren land cover classes 24 5 of total area and rangelands 47 2 area table 6 urban areas land covered by glaciers and forests were given small and moderate ranking values respectively the final map shows the likelihood of incidence of groundwater in 5 ordinal scales from very low to very high fig 6 high and very high probabilities of groundwater existence occur within or across the charvak reservoir and along the chirchik river territories covered by the mountains have low and very low probability of groundwater resources the rest of the territory has a moderate potential for groundwater resources the above results have significant percentage of groundwater potential zones according to mcda tool which are very high covers 6 of the study area high 11 moderate 36 low 46 and very low 1 respectively fig 7 the observed springs and gpz according to gis and influencing factor

3 springs table 7 in general conjunction of the influencing factor multi criteria decision analysis tool and gis show a relatively high accuracy for mapping of potential groundwater sites for our study area and have a latent to be extrapolated on a country level as a time and cost effective method for sustainable groundwater management one of the main challenges that we faced during the research is access to the field data which is held by the government of uzbekistan the only information which was used for validation of our results are observed springs in the bostanlik district while many other authors also used location of wells water level and spatio temporal groundwater fluctuation uzbekistan lacks spatial data on groundwater resources which were mostly demarcated during the soviet period using conventional methods making spatial data transparent to the public will boost the research in this field in the country modern technologies like combination of gis and mcda will be vital for water management and water security especially during the drought period as it happened in 1998 2000 last but not least the effectiveness of developing gis based mcda methods needs to be thoroughly assessed under dissimilar geological hydrological and agro climatic environments already assuming it as a global explanation tool for real world water problems 5 conclusion the major

enough positive signs comparing with the surface water khosravi et al 2018b nowadays the contamination of the groundwater is also becoming a vital issue for the community rapid population growth in developing countries coupled with climate change exerts additive pressure on water demand and groundwater resources can be a lifebuoy to avoid water scarcity issues and social tensions andualem and demeke 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 lee et al 2012 viet ha et al 2020 groundwater zones strongly vary through space and time these factors include hydrological features such as land use and land cover soil types geology and geomorphology precipitation and evaporation water bodies irrigation etc lee et al 2012 vidhya and vinay 2018 groundwater resources are being extensively used for several purposes around the world but mostly for domestic and industrial purposes in arid and semi arid countries with small precipitation with high surface runoff groundwater is also used for agricultural purposes selvam et al 2014 1 1 groundwater challenges in uzbekistan during the soviet period groundwater resources were not as extensively used for agriculture and irrigation as they are now due to the following factors adequate quantity of surface water water supply for farms and good irrigational and melioration infrastructure with reliable financial support from the government rakhmatullaev et al 2012 groundwater resources were only used for livestock farming and other specific purposes after the failure of the soviet union the central asian countries began transformation from the planned centralized economy to the market based and this switch introduced new paradigms like land tenure water rights and private property however not all farmers were able to pump and irrigate by themselves rakhmatullaev et al 2010 according to antonov 2000 total groundwater used for agriculture equaled 6 4 of the total water for irrigation purposes used in uzbekistan at the end of 20th century rakhmatullaev et al 2012 state that actual groundwater abstraction is approximately 7 5 km3 year which leads to a serious surface flow reduction agricultural sector in the country is largely based on irrigation according to ibragimov et al 2007 water supply is a major crop yield limiting factor two factors in uzbekistan create a high pressure for water resources increase in irrigated lands in the country from 1 3 million hectares in 1900 to 4 2 million hectares in 2000 and rapid population growth during the last 80 years from 6 5 million people to 33 million in 2018 unep 2005 according to the world bank 2007 approximately 70 of the water is lost during irrigation and melioration practices and poor water management and conservation practices in turn evapotranspiration adds to that which can vary between 1500 and 2000 mm in dry and humid zones of the country in addition to this hagga et al 2007 prognosed evaporation rates to reach 10 15 due to the global warming uzbekistan has two significantly different climatic regions mountainous areas and deserts these landscapes form two types of groundwater formations respectively autochthonous and allochthonous the autochthonous type remains typically occurring in regions not covered by mountains and characterized by groundwater resources formed from precipitation or agricultural use according to borisov et al 2002 from 5 to 22 5 of atmospheric precipitation accumulates in the water table zone the allochthonous type is typical in mountainous regions ostrovsky 2007 ostrovsky 2007 states that shallow aquifers are influenced by salinization processes which mainly result from intensive and unsustainable irrigation and sodic nature of local soil types solonetz and solontchaks groundwater salinity level decreases with the depth and is highly related to agricultural practices institute of hydrology and engineering geology gives different values for annual groundwater recharge 27 km3 year and 23 km3 year respectively mavlonov et al 2003 recharge sources include surface inflow decontamination of water from rivers and lakes and precipitation one third of the groundwater recharge arises from subsurface inflow and the rest is coming from artificial sources like infiltration from canals and reservoirs mavlonov et al 2003 according to rakhmatullaev et al 2012 groundwater resources constitute about 10 of the total water resources and 60 of it is used for irrigation and household needs most of major aquifers in the country are found in the ferghana valley tashkent and samarkand provinces table 1 and fig 1 some authors such as karimov et al 2010 mention that the use of groundwater resources is not profitable due to several reasons surface water exploitation is cheaper than extraction of groundwater finding potential zones can be challenging and drilling wells are costly for farmers nevertheless extraction of water from shallow aquifers can be crucial in arid regions in villages with the rapidly growing population and in drought seasons main institutions that are responsible for groundwater resources management and regulation in uzbekistan are the following the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on geology and mineral resources chief governmental agency for investigating groundwater reserves and strategic management the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan for ecology and environmental protection former state committee for nature protection responsible for pollution control and sanctions the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on safety in industry and mining works with mineral and thermal groundwater resources the ministry of water resources is responsible for groundwater resources quality in irrigated areas rakhmatullaev et al 2012 1 2 gis and remote sensing applications for groundwater potential zonation mapping traditional methods often used for the discovery of groundwater resources that include hydrological geological geophysical and geomorphological tools are considered expensive time and labor consuming arulbalaji et al 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 champak b and dinesh 2018 fashae et al 2014 s vidhya and y vinay 2018 the latest technology of remote sensing rs and gis can be used to analyze and research groundwater potential zones gpz these spatial tools are very effective in management monitoring visual representation and assessment in such fields as ecology hazard and disaster risk geology and hydrology adeyeye et al 2019 fashae et al 2014 khosravi et al 2018a 2018b kumar et al 2014 2016 2019 lee et al 2012 although satellite images do not show directly the groundwater regions products of remote sensing analysis can be used for further multi criteria analysis of sub surface aquifer existence these spatial layers include land use and land cover digital elevation model and slope as well as soil types and geology in addition to this satellite images provide with information on those regions that are hardly accessible for people ali et al 2015 andualem and demeke 2019 das et al 2019a khosravi et al 2018b lee et al 2012 qadir et al 2019 many methods implemented today for geospatial mapping of groundwater potential zones these are influencing factor frequency ratio logistic regression weight of evidence certainty factor artificial neural networks machine learning decision tree analytical hierarchy process etc agarwal et al 2013 arulbalaji et al 2019 chaudhry et al 2019 das et al 2019a 2019b das 2019 duan et al 2016 eko aryanto and hardiman 2018 fashae et al 2014 hussein et al 2017 kesana sai teja and dinesh singh 2019 selvam et al 2014 singh et al 2011 sujatha and satyanarayana 2016 the rs and gis technologies can be successfully used to map potential groundwater zones different authors use different thematic layers for instance in a case study conducted in the musi basin india researchers used six layers for groundwater areas prediction lithology geology geomorphology slope digital elevation model dem and land use land cover ganapuram et al 2009 in other research conducted in dengi area north central nigeria authors used eight layers for groundwater potential zones mapping dem slope geology lineament contact proximity drainage proximity drainage density and soil types giving to each different weights adeyeye et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 used 13 factors that contribute for groundwater probability assessment among traditional soil type precipitation land use land cover slope dem geology lithology were also included topographic wetness index curvature stream power index terrain roughness index distance from fault and distance from the river stream mondal et al 2019 mentioned that for groundwater management and suitability mapping various parameters i e topography soil media depth of water aquifer media net recharge hydraulic conductivity and impact of vadose zone using the remote sensing and gis techniques in combination with hydro geological data layers are used the main objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of influencing factor multi criteria decision analysis tool for delineation of the groundwater potential zones using geospatial techniques and observed locations of springs in the example of the bostanlik district uzbekistan 2 study area the bostanlik district is located in the north eastern part of uzbekistan between 41 00 and 42 20 north and 69 30 and 71 20 east it is the largest district in the tashkent region the largest recreation sites of uzbekistan are located in bostanlik district the total area of the study area is 4 32 thousand km2 which is approximately 87 of the bostanlik district fig 2 climatic zone of the study area belongs to a temperate continental climate implying hot summers and cold winters temperature variations during the maximum and minimum years and different months are shown in table 2 the minimum temperature was 26 c the maximum temperature is 46 c average annual precipitation ranges between 500 mm and 600 mm mostly falling in spring and autumn the vegetation period lasts for 210 215 days juliev et al 2019a the topography of the bostanlik district is moderately dull and is characterized by high mountains and hills nearly all the terrain belongs to the high mountain systems namely the eastern tien shan the pskem mountains the karzhantau ridge the ugam ridge and the chatkal ridge accordingly the heights in the district rise from the west to the east and from the south to the north the region s southern and western parts stand at an average of 1000 m above sea level the rest part of the area where the uplands predominate is situated from 1200 to 4000 m above sea level the highest point in the region is the adelung pskem ridge peak with an altitude of 4301 m most of the peaks in the region varies between 1000 and 4000 m above sea level juliev et al 2017c the region is characterizes by high seismicity and from 5 to 8 or more earthquakes of different magnitude occur annually almost all mountain ranges have streams some of which turn into rivers the bulk of the streams and watercourses in the district are tributaries of the chirchik river the largest of them beldersay pskem ugam koksu chimgansay and others juliev et al 2019b almost all rivers flow into the charvak reservoir all rivers and their inflows are characterized by an instability of a water balance in different seasons in the mountainous regions of uzbekistan on the rivers of chirchik akhangaran narin kashkadarya and surkhandarya operate six water reservoirs with a capacity from 170 million m3 to 2 0 billion m3 coastal zones are located on high downslopes characterized by a complex geologic structure and formed by weak and easily eroding rocks in 1970 construction of the charvak dam with the height of 167 m has ended and started flowage of the brichmulla depression and filling of the charvak reservoir in the area around 40 km2 and with a volume of 2 billion m3 the coastal zone of the charvak water reservoir has the extent of 80 km juliev et al 2019b 3 materials and methods overall groundwater thematic layers were prepared to identify the existence of aquifers namely digital elevation model dem slope soil map geology map land use land cover lulc stream proximity stream density curvature topographic wetness index twi and precipitation from raw satellite data and other primary sources and processed in arcgis and erdas imagine softwares as essential layers for the multi criteria decision analysis tool fig 4 to cover the study area we chose a large watershed with an outlet in the lower ugam river the total area of the watershed equals to 11223 km2 fig 3 and it shares the territory among uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan in order to calculate hydrological factors and watershed characteristics flow accumulation and flow direction were calculated in esri arcgis 10 6 software platform soil data were downloaded from the fao geonetwork database with various soil properties in a shape file format and later converted to raster dataset with 30 m pixel resolution table 3 precipitation data were downloaded from the university of east anglia climatic data in netcdf format and then converted into the raster data table 3 the preliminary format was transformed to raster grids afterwards raster grids were converted into a point vector dataset in order to interpolate using kriging method into 30 m pixel resolution for classification landsat 8 oli tirs satellite image map was used that was downloaded from the nasa s earth data online database four layers elevation slope curvature and topographic wetness index were derived from aster satellite images table 3 before processing a fill operation for deleting the errors was applied having analyzed research papers by several authors adeyeye et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 das 2019 singh et al 2018 who also used a influencing factor technique it was decided to use soil type land use slope elevation geology and stream density curvature topographic wetness index stream proximity and precipitation thematic layers table 4 other layers such as lineament density geomorphology lithology and topographic roughness were excluded due to the lack of data and they were found not to have a specific value for our research giving weight for each thematic layer means setting a priority as to which map will have a higher and a lower impact on our final output 3 1 multi criteria decision analysis tool multi criteria decision analysis mcda tool particularly an influencing factor method is widely used in gis for delineating groundwater potential zones adeyeye et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 das 2019 mcda tool was developed by saaty 2008 and helps to integrate all thematic layers according to their weight value influencing factor is one of the simplest methods among all multi criteria decision analysis tools used to demarcate groundwater potential zones however it is commonly used to map groundwater sites due to its inclusiveness and efficiency a basic principle under this technique is the researcher s ability to give an appropriate weight for each thematic layer and ranks for classes of the layer that will influence the outcome das 2019 ten various thematic layers corresponding to different aspects contributing to groundwater formation were integrated to generate the final map using the following formula gpz i n xa yb where x represents the weight of the thematic layers y represents the rank of the thematic layer classes then the term a a 1 2 3 x shows the thematic layers and the term b b 1 2 3 y represents classes of the thematic layers arulbalaji et al 2019 das 2019 for this purpose arcgis 10 6 software s spatial analysis toolset weighted overlay function was used for each layer its own weight out of 100 depending on its importance was given according to the research of numerous literature sources table 4 and authors own subjective opinions based on the expertise and analysis in order to evaluate the weight of each class of thematic layer on the result we gave each class of layer a range from 1 to 9 table 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 thematic layers 4 1 1 slope slope has a major impact which defines percolation of surface water into the subsurface das et al 2019 surface run off is slow in small slope pixels and high in big slope pixels due to little time for infiltration slope was derived from aster satellite digital elevation model in arcgis 10 6 software and separated into five classes using natural breaks classification fig 5 a 4 1 2 elevation aster satellite digital elevation model was acquired from nasa s earthdata the spatial resolution image is 30 m fig 5b elevation plays a big role in watershed delineation and groundwater forming regions with high altitudes have low probability of groundwater existence while low altitude areas in turn have higher probability because gravity forces of the earth pull down the water streams before classifying a dem image into the five classes using natural breaks errors in pixel values were eliminated utilizing a fill function 4 1 3 curvature curvature is a quantitative expression of a surface outline and it can be dipped and curved arulbalaji et al 2019 the curvature tool is to calculate the second derivative value of the input surface on a cell by cell basis for each cell a fourth order polynomial of the formula is fit to a surface composed of a 3 times 3 window z ax2y2 bx2y cxy2 dx2 ey2 fxy gx hy i the coefficients a b c and so on are calculated from this surface the relationships among the coefficients and the nine values of elevation for every cell were numbered the output of the curvature tool is the second derivative of the surface for example the inclination of the slope is curvature 2 d e 100 output layer was reclassified into five classes using the natural breaks classification tool fig 5c high values represent a high curvature and low values represent a low curvature of the surface respectively 4 1 4 topographic wetness index the topographic wetness index twi is the most widely applied hydrologic topographic index which describes the capacity of a cell to accumulate water mattivi et al 2019 the formula of twi is the following twi sca tan ϕ where sca is the precise catchment area and ϕ is the slope angle the underlying concept that lies behind twi is a balance of mass sca is a flow accumulation parameter while the slope and the draining contour length is the tendency to evaluate water areas susceptible for water accumulation and categorized by a low slope angle will be represented by high twi values at that time well drained dry areas associated with low twi values mattivi et al 2019 twi map was classified in arcgis 10 6 software into five classes using natural breaks fig 5d high values of twi indicate a high probability of groundwater existence and consequently low values of twi represent low probability of groundwater existence 4 1 5 geological map geology is an important layer for the groundwater potential assessment because it is directly connected to the subsurface flow of the groundwater a geological map fig 5e consists of several deposits conglomerates loess sandstones siltstones limestones dolomites shales and magmatic complexes loess deposits siltstones and sandstones cover most of the territory the current map was prepared based on the materials of uzhydrogeology 4 1 6 soil types percolation and infiltration of water into the soil is directly dependent on the soil texture the capacity of the soil to retain or percolate water depends on several factors foremost it is a particle size soils with a small particle size silt and especially clay have a high water holding capacity due to very small pores between particles that make it easy for water to percolate through the soil layers into the vadoze zone at the same time large soil particles like sand and gravel have a very small water holding capacity and make it easy for the water to infiltrate and accumulate in the water table zone juliev et al 2019a another soil characteristic that relates to soil hydrological properties is bulk density the bulk density mass of the dry soil per unit volume including the pore spaces expressed as kg dm3 the higher the bulk density the less is the percolation capacity the soil has and vice versa soil layer contains information about spatial coverage of soil types and their characteristics soil properties such as bulk density clay silt sand percentage and soil texture are represented in table 5 and fig 7 f 4 1 7 land use and land cover many authors use land use and land cover lulc map to identify potential groundwater zones lulc is important because of several reasons juliev et al 2019b foremost areas covered by dense trees intercept most of the precipitation and occurrence of aquifers in such surface areas is small for instance such land classes as bare soil and rangelands have higher probability of groundwater existence urban areas and surfaces covered by rocks asphalt and minerals also have a very small groundwater potential due to the runoff and tiny percolation below the ground secondly artificial land use such as irrigated fields and aboveground aquifers and streams involve inevitable groundwater forming processes satellite data were downloaded from earth data landsat 8 oli image for july 1 2018 path 154 row 31 spatial resolution of the image is 30 m times 30 m classification was performed in erdas imagine software using a combined classification method which has a higher precision than supervised or unsupervised classification methods fig 5g the study area was divided into 120 clusters according to their spectral signature and close clusters were merged into six classes glaciers water bodies bare soil urban rangelands and forests accuracy of the classification was tested using the google earth pro images and constituted 89 with 0 85 kappa statistics 4 2 precipitation precipitation is the main source of water in the hydrological cycle model and along with the slope and elevation it manipulates the influence of groundwater formation processes arulbalaji et al 2019 for the current research climatic research unit high resolution gridded dataset prepared by the university of east anglia was downloaded pixels were transformed into the point features and were interpolated into 30 m pixel resolution map using kriging interpolation method in arcgis 10 6 software results were broken down into five classes using natural breaks from low to high precipitation fig 7h 4 2 1 stream density stream density shows the total stream length in kilometers within one square kilometer to calculate the stream density a line density tool in arcgis 10 6 was applied fig 5i according to fashae et al 2014 higher drainage density represents low groundwater potential the lines l1 and l2 represent the length of the portion of each line that falls within the circle the consistent population field values were v1 and v2 thus density l1 v1 l2 v2 area of circle 4 2 2 stream proximity stream proximity map visualizes the closeness of the nearest stream in a certain pixel area it was calculated using the streamlines of the watershed fig 3 with euclidean distance tool in arcgis 10 6 further the result was divided into five classes using natural breaks fig 5j output file shows pixels that represent values of closeness of the nearest stream in kilometers 4 3 groundwater potential zones delineation in the given research an influencing factor technique a multi criteria decision analysis method was assigned to identify the groundwater potential zone however there are several compulsory thematic layers for mapping of groundwater potential zones including the geology soil type land use elevation slope and stream density other layers can be chosen by researchers optionally according to their vision and understanding therefore various authors use different number of layers based on the study area data existence scope of the research and etc along with the thematic layers mentioned above many authors use such layers as lineament density geomorphology lithology precipitation stream power index topographic roughness index aspect of slope stream proximity and curvature we ranked each class of each layer from 1 to 9 according to saaty s 2008 measurement scale where 1 is the least priority layer has the smallest impact on groundwater potential existence and 9 is the highest impact on groundwater existence most of the layers have five classes because they were reclassified using natural breaks and then reclassified from continuous to discrete dataset other layers of thematic maps have various numbers of classes because they were achieved with attributes like geology soil types or derived from continuous data as discrete land use table 6 ranking for each class of layer was given based on the literature review adeyeye et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 das et al 2019b kesana sai teja and dinesh singh 2019 lakhwinder singh et al 2018 and authors expertise most of the research area is covered with high slope mountains hence only areas with low altitudes and low slope areas were given high ranks table 6 topographic wetness index and curvature are layers that are derived from aster satellite images table 3 and are directly related to the slope and altitude most of the study area has a very low and low twi 73 5 in sum and a small area 8 4 has a high and a very high twi values at the same time curvature of the study area is mostly covered with moderate curvature values 41 8 and with a high and a very high curvatures 38 7 the rest of the territory has a low and a very low curvature table 6 classes with a high curvature and a twi were given the biggest ranks in mcda analysis because they have a positive correlation with the groundwater regarding the soil texture loamy clay soil types cover half of the area only 1 4 of the area belongs to a clay soil type while the rest to various types with a loamy texture table 6 rankings for each soil class in mcda analysis were given based on table 5 where the percentage of each soil type and a bulk density for each class of soil are given classes with high sand and low bulk density were given the highest ranks because they have more permeability and less water holding capacity table 5 stream density and stream proximity were derived from the river streams of watershed fig 2 together they make 18 of weighing on the result table 4 watershed covered by many small and large streams pixels closest to stream lines were given the highest ranking and vice versa table 6 stream density also increases the probability of groundwater existence more than two third of the territory has very small small and moderate stream density these classes were assigned small ranking values table 6 precipitation also influences the groundwater formation therefore regions with higher precipitation rates were assigned higher values compared to regions with low precipitation rates table 6 land use and land cover classes also influence gpz we decided to assign the highest ranking values to water bodies covers 1 3 bare soil barren land cover classes 24 5 of total area and rangelands 47 2 area table 6 urban areas land covered by glaciers and forests were given small and moderate ranking values respectively the final map shows the likelihood of incidence of groundwater in 5 ordinal scales from very low to very high fig 6 high and very high probabilities of groundwater existence occur within or across the charvak reservoir and along the chirchik river territories covered by the mountains have low and very low probability of groundwater resources the rest of the territory has a moderate potential for groundwater resources the above results have significant percentage of groundwater potential zones according to mcda tool which are very high covers 6 of the study area high 11 moderate 36 low 46 and very low 1 respectively fig 7 the observed springs and gpz according to gis and influencing factor tools were used very high the number of springs equals 2 and cover 6 4 of the study area high 45 of the study area and equal 14 springs moderate 26 with 8 springs low 13 and 4 springs very low 9 6 and 3 springs table 7 in general conjunction of the influencing factor multi criteria decision analysis tool and gis show a relatively high accuracy for mapping of potential groundwater sites for our study area and have a latent to be extrapolated on a country level as a time and cost effective method for sustainable groundwater management one of the main challenges that we faced during the research is access to the field data which is held by the government of uzbekistan the only information which was used for validation of our results are observed springs in the bostanlik district while many other authors also used location of wells water level and spatio temporal groundwater fluctuation uzbekistan lacks spatial data on groundwater resources which were mostly demarcated during the soviet period using conventional methods making spatial data transparent to the public will boost the research in this field in the country modern technologies like combination of gis and mcda will be vital for water management and water security especially during the drought period as it happened in 1998 2000 last but not least the effectiveness of developing gis based mcda methods needs to be thoroughly assessed under dissimilar geological hydrological and agro climatic environments already assuming it as a global explanation tool for real world water problems 5 conclusion the major aim of our research was to test an accuracy of influencing factor technique mcda tool in combination with remote sensing and gis platforms for our study area to delineate potential groundwater zones for this purpose ten thematic layers i e soil types land use and land cover precipitation geology curvature topographic wetness index stream density stream proximity slope and elevation were weighted according to their factor of influence to the groundwater formation the results of spatial weighted overlay of our maps were divided into five classes of ordinal scale i e very low low moderate high and very high almost half of the territory has low and very low potential of groundwater aquifers and only 12 has high potential of groundwater existence the rest of the study area belongs to moderate potential of groundwater existence for the validation of our map we used 31 observed springs locations and compared them with our findings according to spatial overlay our map can prognose groundwater potential zones with relatively high accuracy rate which implies the effectiveness of the influencing factor technique despite its simplicity the results of our research can be helpful for determining potential groundwater reserves of the bostanlik district in addition our methodology has a potential to be extrapolated on a country level for water security and water management issues as cost and time efficient and effective technique declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
