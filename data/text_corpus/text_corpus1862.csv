9310,during the last decades the artificial afforestation is expanding in the northern china understanding their ecological function has been of scientific interest in this study we explored how surface energy balance components vary at seasonal and annual scales and how biophysical factors control bulk surface parameters and energy exchange over a poplar plantation using the eddy covariance measurements during 2016 2018 the plantation was characterized with a dry surface where available water played a dominant role in controlling energy partitioning annually sensible heat flux h exceeded latent heat flux λe for most of the years resulting in annual bowen ratio β of 1 31 1 74 seasonally within the year variations of evaporative fraction ef priestley taylor coefficient α surface conductance g s and decoupling coefficient ω was significant different between drought and wet periods the enhancement of λe by high vapor pressure deficit vpd was buffered by a concurrent suppression of g s which played a direct role in controlling energy partitioning during dry periods soil water availability restrained the atmospheric evaporative demand controls on water and energy exchange high et precipitation p 1 indicated high water consumption of the plantation which increased local water deficit our results highlight the limitation of poplar water use supply and energy partitioning in current water conditions and suggest more deliberation in species selection for afforestation in this area keywords energy partitioning sensible heat flux latent heat flux surface bulk parameters poplar plantation afforestation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china has the largest afforested area in the world with an estimated area of 80 03 106 ha or 26 2 of global forest plantation area 265 106 ha administration 2020 several ecological restoration projects have been initiated by chinese government since 1980 s such as converting croplands and marginal lands into forests and three north shelterbelt project to prevent soil and water quality degradation forests are recognized for their major role in terrestrial carbon sink fang et al 2001 piao et al 2009 therefore a variety of ecological afforestation programs in marginal land has been started to increase carbon stocks with the aim to cope with global climate change however large scale afforestation not only increases local carbon sink but also modifies albedo and turbulent energy fluxes which leads to feedback on the local climate devaraju et al 2015 peng et al 2014 forests have lower albedo than grasslands and croplands which results in enhanced absorption of solar radiation which may affect near surface and soil temperature the evapotranspiration is regulated by changing energy partitioning into ecosystem sensible h and latent λe heat launiainen 2010 peng et al 2014 in turn the energy exchange is influenced by environmental factors e g solar radiation atmospheric and soil temperature and moisture via physical and biological controls on plant canopy therefore knowledge of energy partitioning under different environmental conditions is crucial for understanding the complex interactions between the vegetation surface and atmosphere under a changing climate the energy exchange between biosphere and atmosphere is controlled by complex interactions among environmental and biological factors including plant type phenology and stomatal regulation to date studies on the effects of land use and land cover change lucc i e afforestation or deforestation on regional climate have drawn very different conclusions among different plant functional types arora and montenegro 2011 bala et al 2007 devaraju et al 2015 georgescu et al 2011 lee et al 2011 loarie et al 2011 nobre et al 1991 peng et al 2014 sampaio et al 2007 tropical forests with sufficient water and radiation partitioned much of available energy into evaporation accompanied by increasing carbon sequestration which cooled regional temperature effectively dickinson and kennedy 1992 lean and warrilow 1989 pielke and avissar 1990 shukla et al 1990 boreal forests characterized by high albedo and low productivity helped to stabilize global atmospheric co2 that accelerated regional climate warming betts 2000 temperate forests hold the greatest uncertainties bala et al 2007 field et al 2007 although their carbon sequestration rates are well established much less is known about how biophysical changes influence climate providing an interesting test bed to assess how afforestation affects local energy partitioning in temperate forests in north china about 1 5 of afforestation projects selected poplar for urban greening desertification control and carbon sequestration by 2015 due to its fast growth martín garcía et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 while most afforestation in the arid and semi arid areas was with water deficit problem zandaryaa et al 2020 poplar species is characterized with much water consumption throughout the growing season which are often water limited even in mesic regions thus indiscriminate use of poplar species beyond their native habitat has been questioned for their possible negative impacts on water availability meanwhile the mature poplar plantation are now facing degradation in this semi arid area zheng et al 2018 therefore a better understanding of the contribution of current poplar plantations to local climate especially water and energy circulation are of great significance in large scale climate feedback modeling to investigate the biophysical controls of energy partitioning on climatic conditions of northwest end of yanshan mountain we evaluated energy partitioning and bulk surface parameters at different water availabilities in a 15 year old poplar populus beijingensis w y hsu plantation on a gravelly sandy land in northern china we primarily focused on the partitioning of energy balance components and the possible biological and climatological controls on these distributions at seasonal and annual time scales the objectives of this work were to 1 describe the characteristics of energy flux on a typical poplar plantation and examine the variation of energy partitioning at multiple temporal scales and 2 assess the response mechanism of energy partitioning to biophysical variables considering measurements taken during three consecutive years in a water limited temperate forest we hypothesized that 1 energy partitioning and bulk surface parameters differ between contrasting wet dry periods at seasonal and annual scales 2 available water and surface conductance play a dominant role in energy partitioning 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description the research was conducted in a poplar

a value range of 0 1 the higher values 0 5 indicate a decoupling of vpd and λe with highly sensitivity of et to r n while lower values 0 5 are indicative of a strong coupling between the vegetation

were 14 and 5 8 below the average more than 90 of annual total precipitation fell during growing seasons fig 1 generally swc increased rapidly with the onset of precipitation in late june with the highest daily swc of 24 7 25 9 july and the lowest value appeared in june 9 9 2016 and october 9 7 2017 9 1 2018 respectively water stress was occurred in beginning and late growing seasons which was indicated by rew 0 4 fig 1 the annual mean values of daily t a were 10 3 c 12 0 c 11 0 c over three years respectively the magnitude and the seasonal variation in canopy development quantified by ndvi was related to t a r 0 73 p 0 01 fig 1 the growing seasons were from early april to late october determined by daily gep fig 2 clearly following the respective trends of t a and vpd fig 1 according to ndvi the poplar plantation s peak growing period was from mid may to mid september ndvi 0 7 the maximum daily vpd was highest in 2017 2 90 kpa june 20 fig 1 seasonal t a dynamic influenced vpd that determined the atmospheric evaporative demand increase of vpd was accompanied by the elevated t a during rainless days in june to september 3 2 dynamics of et gep and wue this poplar plantation was

flux variation was consistent with dynamics of canopy development ndvi fig 1 et declined during early may 1 jul 31 and late september stage of growing season coincided with the period of low swc p and high vpd gep in 2018 1247 5 gc m 2 was lower than that in 2016 1707 1 gc m 2 and 2017 1553 2 gc m 2 the annual maximum gep values were varying from 14 4 to 16 6 gc m 2 day 1 over the three years apparently drought in the growing seasons weakened carbon sink in may june of the three years figs 1 and 2 similar to gep and et daily wue peaked in mid summer 4 3 gc mm in 2016 3 7 gc mm 1 in 2017 4 2 gc mm 1 in 2018 with same patterns at annual and seasonal scales but wue presented larger seasonal variability fig 2 seasonally drought in 2016 2018 led to a notably depression in wue annually wue in growing season of 2017 with both less et and gep was obviously lower than 2016 and 2018 3 3 energy balance closure and dynamics of the components using half hourly data for 2016 2018 the surface

displayed a clear seasonal variability with obvious differences between the growing and non growing seasons the spring mar may plateau of daily h in 2018 monthly averaged value ranged from 4 0 to 4 5 mj m 2 was lower than those in 2016 6 0 6 9 mj m 2 and 2017 6 0 8 5 mj m 2 fig 3b a larger proportion of the r n was partitioned into h before leaf emergence cumulative h values were 1408 1566 and 939 mj m 2 over the three years and the annual h r n g values were 0 88 0 83 and 0 47 respectively annually λe was much smaller in 2018 than the other two years seasonally as leaves spread in late spring h dropped dramatically accompanied by increasing λe led to higher λe than h in growing seasons λe increased from spring to mid summer with the highest value of 15 2 19 8 mj m 2 day 1 in august and declined thereafter fig 3b the ef closely followed the variation pattern of λe linear r 2 0 7 and peaked 0 82 0 83 and 0 72 in 2016 2018 in the peak growing season there was more evident in difference of ef and λe between dry and wet periods than interannual difference fig 3b e the seasonal variation in λe and h characterized dynamics of β which was much higher in the non growing seasons in addition β displayed much higher annual value in 2018 and significantly increased in dry periods of 2016 and 2017 fig 3d the seasonal trends of daily g also tracked the variation of r n fig 3c which presented to be an energy sink from late february to early september there were significant differences in g among years p 0 01 with annual values of 83 2 47 8 and 450 3 mj m 2 g contributed significantly to the energy balance at seasonal and daily timescales but had a small proportion annually monthly diurnal energy partitioning components for 2016 2018 are presented in fig 4 where the peak point of r n ranged from about 220 w m 2 in december to 530 w m 2 in may h showed clear diurnal variations following the trends of r n within years the maximum values of diurnal h varied from 186 w m 2 in december to 300 w m 2 in may g and λe showed clear diurnal variation during the growing season with a peak λe value of 340 w m 2 in august during mid day 10 00 15 00 in sunny days h was generally larger than λe in most months except july september when λe exceeded h and β became 1 with an ef range of 0 47 0 81 3 4 dynamics of bulk surface parameters to quantitatively estimate the relative importance of environmental and biological factors that control energy partitioning we investigated the seasonal behavior of the mean mid day values of three bulk surface parameters α g s and ω fig 5 the daily bulk surface parameters showed similar seasonal trends with λe and canopy development which were significantly lower in 2017 than those in 2016 and 2018 p 0 01 daily values of the surface bulk parameters were generally close to zero during wintertime while peaked α 1 69 g s 31 mm s 1 ω 0 72 in 2016 α 1 79 g s 22 mm s 1 ω 0 83 in 2017 α 1 89 g s 28 mm s 1 ω 0 77 in 2018 in mid summer however compared to the values during unstressed periods the surface parameters were much lower during the seasonal water limited periods in this study fig 5 the annual average α of three years were 0 59 0 25 0 49 0 26 and 0 57 0 37 respectively the seasonal variations of daily mean α during the measurement period varied from 0 11 to 1 89 growing season value of α was higher in year 2018 0

15 0 26 0 14 and 0 32 0 2 with growing season mean values of 0 35 0 15 0 33 0 15 and 0 41 0 19 respectively the annual mean of g s in 2016 was higher than that in 2017 and 2018 p 0 01 during the growing seasons of 2016 2017 in dry months may june with a high vpd ranging from 0 22 to 2 65 kpa had g s values mostly below 10 mm s 1 whereas the wet months july august experienced low vpd ranging from 0 17 to 1 84 kpa with higher g s figs 1c 5b 3 5 biophysical controls on energy partitioning the α ω and g s were positively correlated with ndvi fig 6 which maximized during peak growing season june august with α 1 when ndvi was greater than 0 75 similar pattern appeared in the response of λe and ef to ndvi which maximized when ndvi 0 75 fig 7 linear relationships were also observed in their response to swc and the surface bulk parameters g s and ω fig 7 ef λe varied from 0 11 7 8 w m 2 under dry conditions swc 6 to 0 74 161 9 w m 2 under wet conditions swc 25 decoupling ω 0 5 between canopy and atmosphere and high g s was associated with et related parameters λe ef presented an exponential growth in response to the α coefficient which leveled off when α 1 2 similar to the priestley taylor constant 1 26 vpd had a two way influence on energy partitioning when vpd 1 5 kpa λe and ef were positively related to vpd while negative relationship was presented when vpd higher than 1 5 kpa the response of β to environmental and biotic variations presented opposite patterns compared to λe and ef β 1 occurred when vpd was in the range of 1 3 1 8 kpa ndvi 0 6 g s 20 mm s 1 ω 0

baldocchi 2000 zenone et al 2015 in addition drought plays an important role in mass and energy exchange during growing season jia et al 2016 kang et al 2015 in this study the cumulative et values measured over three years were much higher than other poplar plantation sites in similar latitude such as southern beijing kang et al 2015 inner mongolia wilske et al 2009 and mediterranean zenone et al 2015 although supply and demand of water were synchrony in this ecosystem λe was water limited during the research period indicated by the large gap between et 1073 1196 mm and p 426 507 mm this could have been due to the facts that this site had coarse sand on the surface with dense vegetation and received more radiation at high altitudes which might intercept more rainfall subsequently evaporated rapidly due to no stomatal limitation baldocchi et al 2004 all of these reasons could promote et therefore this plantation showed severe water deficit even in the wet year which had higher annual et p 2 27 3 20 and 2 61 respectively than the poplar plantation with relatively higher precipitations with an et p range of 0 84 1 24 kang et al 2015 suggested large amounts of deep soil water storage entered into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration this phenomenon would lead to over use of groundwater and thus aggravate local water deficit this study compared energy partitioning of a poplar plantation under different water conditions within growing seasons and between years the annual scale more solar radiation with low water supply in 2017 determined higher heat flux components h p 0 01 than in 2016 and 2018 dry surface was more beneficial to store and exchange heat g displayed obvious seasonal and diurnal variations as a result of canopy shading by vegetation from the beginning of growing season lower g was observed while its contribution to r n was very small e g 0 2 in 2017 over 90 of r n was partitioned into λe and h figs 3 and 4 in general high g was associated with low vegetation cover as the ground surface received a significant amount of solar radiation nakai et al 2013 apparently severe drought in 2017 exerted effects not only on vegetation growth in the current year but also the following year indicated by much lower ndvi productivity and higher g figs 1 3 seasonally high h values in winter and spring are attributed to surface dryness and more cloudless days with more solar radiation with leaf expansion energy partitioning associated with h dominance shifted into λe dominance as it has been observed in many ecosystems baldocchi et al 2004 chen et al 2009 lei and yang 2010 this transformation in energy partitioning proportion would offer obvious feedbacks at local and even regional scale climate in sufficiently large areas with appropriate spatial arrangement jia et al 2016 kang et al 2015 zenone et al 2015 to some extent the poplar plantation had a cooling effect of regional microclimate by extracting ground water but this would aggravate local water deficit 4 2 energy partitioning with increasing water deficit through years the dominant term h occupied an increased component denoted by an increased annual β from 1 31 to 1 74 which was much higher than values in temperate forests at the same latitude oliphant et al 2004 sun et al 2010 while during the growing season β 0 82 1 06 was also much higher than many natural temperate deciduous forests 0 43 0 64 wilson et al 2002 even higher than the temperate mixed forest 0 74 roy and avissar 2002 and boreal scots pine forest 0 81 launiainen 2010 our results were consistent with previous studies that precipitation available water was a critical factor affecting β rather than ecosystem function types aires et al 2008b biudes et al 2015 eichelmann et al 2016 krishnan et al 2012 it overturned the generally accepted assumption that deciduous broadleaved forests with high transpiration capacity would possess lower β at identical environmental conditions ville et al 2014 the plantation was characterized with a dry surface and as water supply increase in middle growing seasons more energy was partitioned into λe in promoting evapotranspiration the limitation of seasonal drought on evapotranspiration led to a decrease in ef fig 3 4 3 factors influence energy partitioning our analysis pronounced the importance of available water variation in regulating energy partitioning by influencing λe in this poplar plantation which was further illustrated by the positive relationship between λe and swc fig 7 soil moisture has a direct effect on stomatal conductance sufficient soil water supply allows stomata to respond freely to environmental factors such as r n and vpd under this situation et is unlimited and vegetation g s has a strong influence on the boundary layer energy exchange meanwhile more water returns to the atmosphere from wet soil surface our study showed that under drought stress closure of stomata caused by reduced swc weakened its sensibility to atmospheric evaporative demand this limitation and reduced evaporation weakened the dominance of λe and eventually led to the dominance of h under drought conditions β 1 fig 3 β decreased exponentially with soil moisture decreasing fig 7 consisting with previous studies bracho et al 2008 jia et al 2016 in semi arid area variations in β values observed in our study are expected among different water conditions tang et al 2014 as is well known poplar has a characteristic of high water consumption the linear correlation of swc with λe highlights the limitation of soil water availability on energy partitioning and et related parameters under current soil water condition this phenomenon was also observed in a semi deciduous forest in amazon basin vourlitis et al 2008 when water supply was ample et related parameters would be out of limitation leading to reduced sensitivities to swc therefore there should be an expected level off values at high swc but not in our study the influence of vpd on surface energy partitioning β ef was non linear with two opposite effects fig 7 the positive effect of increased vpd on λe was that vpd drove water vapor diffusion across the stomata as a measure of atmospheric evaporative power the negative effect was that higher vpd reduced stomatal conductance resulting in smaller λe how λe and therefore β and ef change with vpd depends on the balance between these two opposing effects which was mainly subjected by soil moisture according to previous studies vpd plays a strong role in controlling evapotranspiration thereafter energy partitioning during dry periods aires et al 2008b roy and avissar 2002 meanwhile the response of energy partitioning varied depending on ecosystem type negative effects of vpd on λe have been well documented for water limited ecosystems aires et al 2008b krishnan et al 2012 li et al 2006 the decrease in β and increase in ef with low vpd below 1 kpa have been reported in semi arid shrublands and mediterranean oak woodlands jia et al 2016 vourlitis et al 2008 positive relationship between high vpd and et was found in a temperate mixed forest leuschner et al 2001 in our study there were some transitional values of vpd 1 5 kpa where λe and ef reached a peak while the β reduced to a minimum the former was mainly attributed to the synchronous seasonal dynamic between vpd and λe and the latter during seasonal drought was associated with limited et λe and high h figs 1c 3 and 7 low vpd enhanced et initially while further increase in vpd triggered negative feedback on stomatal conductance leading to reduced transpiration this was consistent with studies on mediterranean oak woodlands avissar 1989 bracho et al 2008 changes in ndvi were observed to correlate positively with λe ef and negatively with β fig 7 suggesting that canopy cover played an important role in dynamic of λe and subsequently energy partitioning which was similar to the results in a temperate deciduous forest wilson and baldocchi 2000 and steppe ecosystems chen et al 2009 canopy structure and ndvi regulate energy partitioning via their impacts on surface albedo roughness and stand transpiration hammerle et al 2008 li et al 2006 our results that strong positive correlation between ndvi and energy partitioning and surface parameters were consistent with previous findings in many ecosystems indicating surface energy partitioning of this poplar plantation was associated with leaf area variation ma et al 2019 during dry periods in early growing seasons over 2016 2018 the strong coupling of canopy atmosphere low ω further indicating the control of canopy and vpd on energy partitioning stronger coupling in 2017 with less precipitation and dry period throughout the research period led to higher β this biological characteristic directly and to some extent led to changes in soil moisture and et thereby impacting energy partitioning ozdogan et al 2009 sridhar et al 2019 wilson and baldocchi 2000 to quantify district controls on energy partitioning we determined three bulk parameters g s ω and α g s was an important control on energy partitioning in different ecosystems within the fluxnet sites wilson et al 2002 which also coupled the abiotic and biotic controls on energy partitioning under changing environments high g s in wet seasons increased λe directly and thus enhanced ef fig 7 the significantly positive relationships between g s and α suggested that et was greatly influenced by canopy development while there was different sensitivity between dry and wet periods fig 8 during drought days α coefficient and ω levelled off when g s 18 mm s 1 suggesting an insensitivity of et to biotic controls and therefore an enhanced effect of abiotic controls r n or vpd on et annually even in 2016 with higher bulk parameter values low α 1 26 typified a dry surface of this site that available water was the most important limitation in energy partitioning strong coupling of canopy atmosphere 89 of days with ω 0 5 fig 5 during most of the study period indicated strong vegetation surface conductance control on energy partitioning that was influenced by swc and vpd this was illustrated by positive correlation of changing g s with ω and α similarly at high vpd accompanied with low swc ndvi became the main limitation on et therefore resulting in decreased ef and increased β figs 2 7 and 9 the restraint effect of g s on et dominated under dry conditions indicating the importance of biotic regulation on energy partitioning at this site this was different from some semi arid ecosystems that the positive effect on g s was offset by negative effect at high vpd where energy partitioning was insensitive with vpd li et al 2007 tang et al 2014 the priestley and taylor 1972b α coefficient helps determine how biotic factors control daily forest et relative to the amount of available energy in this precipitation limited ecosystem α was linearly influenced by swc to a large extent which was different with the results in a young plantation ma et al 2018 in general the level off threshold value of swc varied with plant functional type characterized by changing water demand and was relatively low in grassland or shrub ecosystems in arid and semi arid areas for example baldocchi et al 2004 and aires et al 2008b found linear increases in α with swc 13 15 in drought ecosystems mediterranean grassland oak grass savanna with mean annual precipitation of 559 mm and 751 mm the break point swc in two semi arid grasslands was 10 in north america with lower precipitation 240 mm krishnan et al 2012 in our research α kept linear increase with swc and varied from 0 9 to around 1 1 1 26 under well watered conditions swc 20 priestley and taylor 1972b yinghu et al 2015 so water limited surface featured this poplar plantation during most part of the growing season many previous studies illustrated the mature forest root system was able to use underground water effectively from deep soil layers aro et al 1993 georgescu et al 2011 leuschner et al 2001 roy and avissar 2002 wu et al 2013 our research presented that a portion of underground water participated in the water cycling between atmosphere and vegetation layer which was consistent with some xeric phreatophytes in hyper arid ecosystems odongo et al 2016 snyder and williams 2000 sridhar et al 2019 xu and li 2006 5 conclusion at this plantation partitioning of available energy into et was mainly controlled by vegetation g s in combination with soil water supply which supported our hypothesis that available water and vegetation were the dominant deciding factors poor precipitation and soil water storage restrained the response of the ecosystem to atmospheric vapor demand and solar radiation to a great extent annual energy flux was determined by total available energy our results demonstrated that the response of this ecosystem in terms of water and energy exchange and surface conductance varied in different years soil water plays a central role in the exchange of water to the atmosphere by vegetation in direct and indirect ways sandy soils utilized dispersed precipitation much better than high intensity rainfall which mostly seeped through the topsoil this site had a much higher et p than a nearby forest with similar climate environment annually h was the primary energy partitioning component in this semi arid poplar ecosystem λe was greater than h only in peak growing seasons drought apparently decreased g s α ω and ef soil water availability and canopy development were important factors affecting g s α ω and ef furthermore even in wet year the α 1 of this poplar plantation site indicated a permanent limitation of water and energy exchange by water availability given more variable precipitation pattern in future with more extreme rainfall events punctuated by longer intervening dry periods according to the predictions of global climate models northern china may experience increases in drought occurrence hence the government green projects should be cautious in species selection in this area especially

9310,during the last decades the artificial afforestation is expanding in the northern china understanding their ecological function has been of scientific interest in this study we explored how surface energy balance components vary at seasonal and annual scales and how biophysical factors control bulk surface parameters and energy exchange over a poplar plantation using the eddy covariance measurements during 2016 2018 the plantation was characterized with a dry surface where available water played a dominant role in controlling energy partitioning annually sensible heat flux h exceeded latent heat flux λe for most of the years resulting in annual bowen ratio β of 1 31 1 74 seasonally within the year variations of evaporative fraction ef priestley taylor coefficient α surface conductance g s and decoupling coefficient ω was significant different between drought and wet periods the enhancement of λe by high vapor pressure deficit vpd was buffered by a concurrent suppression of g s which played a direct role in controlling energy partitioning during dry periods soil water availability restrained the atmospheric evaporative demand controls on water and energy exchange high et precipitation p 1 indicated high water consumption of the plantation which increased local water deficit our results highlight the limitation of poplar water use supply and energy partitioning in current water conditions and suggest more deliberation in species selection for afforestation in this area keywords energy partitioning sensible heat flux latent heat flux surface bulk parameters poplar plantation afforestation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china has the largest afforested area in the world with an estimated area of 80 03 106 ha or 26 2 of global forest plantation area 265 106 ha administration 2020 several ecological restoration projects have been initiated by chinese government since 1980 s such as converting croplands and marginal lands into forests and three north shelterbelt project to prevent soil and water quality degradation forests are recognized for their major role in terrestrial carbon sink fang et al 2001 piao et al 2009 therefore a variety of ecological afforestation programs in marginal land has been started to increase carbon stocks with the aim to cope with global climate change however large scale afforestation not only increases local carbon sink but also modifies albedo and turbulent energy fluxes which leads to feedback on the local climate devaraju et al 2015 peng et al 2014 forests have lower albedo than grasslands and croplands which results in enhanced absorption of solar radiation which may affect near surface and soil temperature the evapotranspiration is regulated by changing energy partitioning into ecosystem sensible h and latent λe heat launiainen 2010 peng et al 2014 in turn the energy exchange is influenced by environmental factors e g solar radiation atmospheric and soil temperature and moisture via physical and biological controls on plant canopy therefore knowledge of energy partitioning under different environmental conditions is crucial for understanding the complex interactions between the vegetation surface and atmosphere under a changing climate the energy exchange between biosphere and atmosphere is controlled by complex interactions among environmental and biological factors including plant type phenology and stomatal regulation to date studies on the effects of land use and land cover change lucc i e afforestation or deforestation on regional climate have drawn very different conclusions among different plant functional types arora and montenegro 2011 bala et al 2007 devaraju et al 2015 georgescu et al 2011 lee et al 2011 loarie et al 2011 nobre et al 1991 peng et al 2014 sampaio et al 2007 tropical forests with sufficient water and radiation partitioned much of available energy into evaporation accompanied by increasing carbon sequestration which cooled regional temperature effectively dickinson and kennedy 1992 lean and warrilow 1989 pielke and avissar 1990 shukla et al 1990 boreal forests characterized by high albedo and low productivity helped to stabilize global atmospheric co2 that accelerated regional climate warming betts 2000 temperate forests hold the greatest uncertainties bala et al 2007 field et al 2007 although their carbon sequestration rates are well established much less is known about how biophysical changes influence climate providing an interesting test bed to assess how afforestation affects local energy partitioning in temperate forests in north china about 1 5 of afforestation projects selected poplar for urban greening desertification control and carbon sequestration by 2015 due to its fast growth martín garcía et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 while most afforestation in the arid and semi arid areas was with water deficit problem zandaryaa et al 2020 poplar species is characterized with much water consumption throughout the growing season which are often water limited even in mesic regions thus indiscriminate use of poplar species beyond their native habitat has been questioned for their possible negative impacts on water availability meanwhile the mature poplar plantation are now facing degradation in this semi arid area zheng et al 2018 therefore a better understanding of the contribution of current poplar plantations to local climate especially water and energy circulation are of great significance in large scale climate feedback modeling to investigate the biophysical controls of energy partitioning on climatic conditions of northwest end of yanshan mountain we evaluated energy partitioning and bulk surface parameters at different water availabilities in a 15 year old poplar populus beijingensis w y hsu plantation on a gravelly sandy land in northern china we primarily focused on the partitioning of energy balance components and the possible biological and climatological controls on these distributions at seasonal and annual time scales the objectives of this work were to 1 describe the characteristics of energy flux on a typical poplar plantation and examine the variation of energy partitioning at multiple temporal scales and 2 assess the response mechanism of energy partitioning to biophysical variables considering measurements taken during three consecutive years in a water limited temperate forest we hypothesized that 1 energy partitioning and bulk surface parameters differ between contrasting wet dry periods at seasonal and annual scales 2 available water and surface conductance play a dominant role in energy partitioning 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description the research was conducted in a poplar

displayed a clear seasonal variability with obvious differences between the growing and non growing seasons the spring mar may plateau of daily h in 2018 monthly averaged value ranged from 4 0 to 4 5 mj m 2 was lower than those in 2016 6 0 6 9 mj m 2 and 2017 6 0 8 5 mj m 2 fig 3b a larger proportion of the r n was partitioned into h before leaf emergence cumulative h values were 1408 1566 and 939 mj m 2 over the three years and the annual h r n g values were 0 88 0 83 and 0 47 respectively annually λe was much smaller in 2018 than the other two years seasonally as leaves spread in late spring h dropped dramatically accompanied by increasing λe led to higher λe than h in growing seasons λe increased from spring to mid summer with the highest value of 15 2 19 8 mj m 2 day 1 in august and declined thereafter fig 3b the ef closely followed the variation pattern of λe linear r 2 0 7 and peaked 0 82 0 83 and 0 72 in 2016 2018 in the peak growing season there was more evident in difference of ef and λe between dry and wet periods than interannual difference fig 3b e the seasonal variation in λe and h characterized dynamics of β which was much higher in the non growing seasons in addition β displayed much higher annual value in 2018 and significantly increased in dry periods of 2016 and 2017 fig 3d the seasonal trends of daily g also tracked the variation of r n fig 3c which presented to be an energy sink from late february to early september there were significant differences in g among years p 0 01 with annual values of 83 2 47 8 and 450 3 mj m 2 g contributed

peak point of r n ranged from about 220 w m 2 in december to 530 w m 2 in may h showed clear diurnal variations following the trends of r n within years the maximum values of diurnal h varied from 186 w m 2 in december to 300 w m 2 in may g and λe showed clear diurnal variation during the growing season with a peak λe value of 340 w m 2 in august during mid day 10 00 15 00 in sunny days h was generally larger than λe in most months except july september when λe exceeded h and β became 1 with an ef range of 0 47 0 81 3 4 dynamics of bulk surface parameters to quantitatively estimate the relative importance of environmental and biological factors that control energy partitioning we investigated the seasonal behavior of the mean mid day values of three bulk surface parameters α g s and ω fig 5 the daily bulk surface parameters showed similar seasonal trends with λe and canopy development which were significantly lower in 2017 than those in 2016 and 2018 p 0 01 daily values of the surface bulk parameters were generally close to zero during wintertime while peaked α 1 69 g s 31 mm s 1 ω 0 72 in 2016 α 1 79 g s 22 mm s 1 ω 0 83 in 2017 α 1 89 g s 28 mm s 1 ω 0 77 in 2018 in mid summer however compared to the values during unstressed periods the surface parameters were much lower during the seasonal water limited periods in this study fig 5 the annual average α of three years

growing seasons of 2016 2017 in dry months may june with a high vpd ranging from 0 22 to 2 65 kpa had g s values mostly below 10 mm s 1 whereas the wet months july august experienced low vpd ranging

june august with α 1 when ndvi was greater than 0 75 similar pattern appeared in the response of λe and ef to ndvi which maximized when ndvi 0 75 fig 7 linear relationships were also observed in their

baldocchi 2000 zenone et al 2015 in addition drought plays an important role in mass and energy exchange during growing season jia et al 2016 kang et al 2015 in this study the cumulative et values measured over three years were much higher than other poplar plantation sites in similar latitude such as southern beijing kang et al 2015 inner mongolia wilske et al 2009 and mediterranean zenone et al 2015 although supply and demand of water were synchrony in this ecosystem λe was water limited during the research period indicated by the large gap between et 1073 1196 mm and p 426 507 mm this could have been due to the facts that this site had coarse sand on the surface with dense vegetation and received more radiation at high altitudes which might intercept more rainfall subsequently evaporated rapidly due to no stomatal limitation baldocchi et al 2004 all of these reasons could promote et therefore this plantation showed severe water deficit even in the wet year which had higher annual et p 2 27 3 20 and 2 61 respectively than the poplar plantation with relatively higher precipitations with an et p range of 0 84 1 24 kang et al 2015 suggested large amounts of deep soil water storage entered into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration this phenomenon would lead to over use of groundwater and thus aggravate local water deficit this study compared energy partitioning of a poplar plantation under different water conditions within growing seasons and between years the annual scale more solar radiation with low water supply in 2017 determined higher heat flux components h p 0 01 than in 2016 and 2018 dry surface was more beneficial to store and exchange heat g displayed obvious seasonal and diurnal variations as a result of canopy shading by vegetation from the beginning of growing season lower g was observed while its contribution to r n was very small e g 0 2 in 2017 over 90 of r n was partitioned into λe and h figs 3 and 4 in general high g was associated with low vegetation cover as the ground surface received a significant amount of solar radiation nakai et al 2013 apparently severe drought in 2017 exerted effects not only on vegetation growth in the current year but also the following year indicated by much lower ndvi productivity and higher g figs 1 3 seasonally high h values in winter and spring are attributed to surface dryness and more cloudless days with more solar radiation with leaf expansion energy partitioning associated with h dominance shifted into λe dominance as it has been observed in many ecosystems baldocchi et al 2004 chen et al 2009 lei and yang 2010 this transformation in energy partitioning proportion would offer obvious feedbacks at local and even regional scale climate in sufficiently large areas with appropriate spatial arrangement jia et al 2016 kang et al 2015 zenone et al 2015 to some extent the poplar plantation had a cooling effect of regional microclimate by extracting ground water but this would aggravate local water deficit 4 2 energy partitioning with increasing water deficit through years the dominant term h occupied an increased component denoted by an increased annual β from 1 31 to 1 74 which was much higher than values in temperate forests at the same latitude oliphant et al 2004 sun et al 2010 while during the growing season β 0 82 1 06 was also much higher than many natural temperate deciduous forests 0 43 0 64 wilson et al 2002 even higher than the temperate mixed forest 0 74 roy and avissar 2002 and boreal scots pine forest 0 81 launiainen 2010 our results were consistent with previous studies that precipitation available water was a critical factor affecting β rather than ecosystem function types aires et al 2008b biudes et al 2015 eichelmann et al 2016 krishnan et al 2012 it overturned the generally accepted assumption that deciduous broadleaved forests with high transpiration capacity would possess lower β at identical environmental conditions ville et al 2014 the plantation was characterized with a dry surface and as water supply increase in middle growing seasons more energy was partitioned into λe in promoting evapotranspiration the limitation of seasonal drought on evapotranspiration led to a decrease in ef fig 3 4 3 factors influence energy partitioning our analysis pronounced the importance of available water variation in regulating energy partitioning by influencing λe in this poplar plantation which was further illustrated by the positive relationship between λe and swc fig 7 soil moisture has a direct effect on stomatal conductance sufficient soil water supply allows stomata to respond freely to environmental factors such as r n and vpd under this situation et is unlimited and vegetation g s has a strong influence on the boundary layer energy exchange meanwhile more water returns to the atmosphere from wet soil surface our study showed that under drought stress closure of stomata caused by reduced swc weakened its sensibility to atmospheric evaporative demand this limitation and reduced evaporation weakened the dominance of λe and eventually led to the dominance of h under drought conditions β 1 fig 3 β decreased exponentially with soil moisture decreasing fig 7 consisting with previous studies bracho et al 2008 jia et al 2016 in semi arid area variations in β values observed in our study are expected among different water conditions tang et al 2014 as is well known poplar has a characteristic of high water consumption the linear correlation of swc with λe highlights the limitation of soil water availability on energy partitioning and et related parameters under current soil water condition this phenomenon was also observed in a semi deciduous forest in amazon basin vourlitis et al 2008 when water supply was ample et related parameters would be out of limitation leading to reduced sensitivities to swc therefore there should be an expected level off values at high swc but not in our study the influence of vpd on surface energy partitioning β ef was non linear with two opposite effects fig 7 the positive effect of increased vpd on λe was that vpd drove water vapor diffusion across the stomata as a measure of atmospheric evaporative power the negative effect was that higher vpd reduced stomatal conductance resulting in smaller λe how λe and therefore β and ef change with vpd depends on the balance between these two opposing effects which was mainly subjected by soil moisture according to previous studies vpd plays a strong role in controlling evapotranspiration thereafter energy partitioning during dry periods aires et al 2008b roy and avissar 2002 meanwhile the response of energy partitioning varied depending on ecosystem type negative effects of vpd on λe have been well documented for water limited ecosystems aires et al 2008b krishnan et al 2012 li et al 2006 the decrease in β and increase in ef with low vpd below 1 kpa have been reported in semi arid shrublands and mediterranean oak woodlands jia et al 2016 vourlitis et al 2008 positive relationship between high vpd and et was found in a temperate mixed forest leuschner et al 2001 in our study there were some transitional values of vpd 1 5 kpa where λe and ef reached a peak while the β reduced to a minimum the former was mainly attributed to the synchronous seasonal dynamic between vpd and λe and the latter during seasonal drought was associated with limited et λe and high h figs 1c 3 and 7 low vpd enhanced et initially while further increase in vpd triggered negative feedback on stomatal conductance leading to reduced transpiration this was consistent with studies on mediterranean oak woodlands avissar 1989 bracho et al 2008 changes in ndvi were observed to correlate positively with λe ef and negatively with β fig 7 suggesting that canopy cover played an important role in dynamic of λe and subsequently energy partitioning which was similar to the results in a temperate deciduous forest wilson and baldocchi 2000 and steppe ecosystems chen et al 2009 canopy structure and ndvi regulate energy partitioning via their impacts on surface albedo roughness and stand transpiration hammerle et al 2008 li et al 2006 our results that strong positive correlation between ndvi and energy partitioning and surface parameters were consistent with previous findings in many ecosystems indicating surface energy partitioning of this poplar plantation was associated with leaf area variation ma et al 2019 during dry periods in early growing seasons over 2016 2018 the strong coupling of canopy atmosphere low ω further indicating the control of canopy and vpd on energy partitioning stronger coupling in 2017 with less precipitation and dry period throughout the research period led to higher β this biological characteristic directly and to some extent led to changes in soil moisture and et thereby impacting energy partitioning ozdogan et al 2009 sridhar et al 2019 wilson and baldocchi 2000 to quantify district controls on energy partitioning we determined three bulk parameters g s ω and α g s was an important control on energy partitioning in different ecosystems within the fluxnet sites wilson et al 2002 which also coupled the abiotic and biotic controls on energy partitioning under changing environments high g s in wet seasons increased λe directly and thus enhanced ef fig 7 the significantly positive relationships between g s and α suggested that et was greatly influenced by canopy development while there was different sensitivity between dry and wet periods fig 8 during drought days α coefficient and ω levelled off when g s 18 mm s 1 suggesting an insensitivity of et to biotic controls and therefore an enhanced effect of abiotic controls r n or vpd on et annually even in 2016 with higher bulk parameter values low α 1 26 typified a dry surface of this site that available water was the most important limitation in energy partitioning strong coupling of canopy atmosphere 89 of days with ω 0 5 fig 5 during most of the study period indicated strong vegetation surface conductance control on energy partitioning that was influenced by swc and vpd this was illustrated by positive correlation of changing g s with ω and α similarly at high vpd accompanied with low swc ndvi became the main limitation on et therefore resulting in decreased ef and increased β figs 2 7 and 9 the restraint effect of g s on et dominated under dry conditions indicating the importance of biotic regulation on energy partitioning at this site this was different from some semi arid ecosystems that the positive effect on g s was offset by negative effect at high vpd where energy partitioning was insensitive with vpd li et al 2007 tang et al 2014 the priestley and taylor 1972b α coefficient helps determine how biotic factors control daily forest et relative to the amount of available energy in this precipitation limited ecosystem α was linearly influenced by swc to a large extent which was different with the results in a young plantation ma et al 2018 in general the level off threshold value of swc varied with plant functional type characterized by changing water demand and was relatively low in grassland or shrub ecosystems in arid and semi arid areas for example baldocchi et al 2004 and aires et al 2008b found linear increases in α with swc 13 15 in drought ecosystems mediterranean grassland oak grass savanna with mean annual precipitation of 559 mm and 751 mm the break point swc in two semi arid grasslands was 10 in north america with lower precipitation 240 mm krishnan et al 2012 in our research α kept linear increase with swc and varied from 0 9 to around 1 1 1 26 under well watered conditions swc 20 priestley and taylor 1972b yinghu et al 2015 so water limited surface featured this poplar plantation during most part of the growing season many previous studies illustrated the mature forest root system was able to use underground water effectively from deep soil layers aro et al 1993 georgescu et al 2011 leuschner et al 2001 roy and avissar 2002 wu et al 2013 our research presented that a portion of underground water participated in the water cycling between atmosphere and vegetation layer which was consistent with some xeric phreatophytes in hyper arid ecosystems odongo et al 2016 snyder and williams 2000 sridhar et al 2019 xu and li 2006 5 conclusion at this plantation partitioning of available energy into et was mainly controlled by vegetation g s in combination with soil water supply which supported our hypothesis that available water and vegetation were the dominant deciding factors poor precipitation and soil water storage restrained the response of the ecosystem to atmospheric vapor demand and solar radiation to a great extent annual energy flux was determined by total available energy our results demonstrated that the response of this ecosystem in terms of water and energy exchange and surface conductance varied in different years soil water plays a central role in the exchange of water to the atmosphere by vegetation in direct and indirect ways sandy soils utilized dispersed precipitation much better than high intensity rainfall which mostly seeped through the topsoil this site had a much higher et p than a nearby forest with similar climate environment annually h was the primary energy partitioning component in this semi arid poplar ecosystem λe was greater than h only in peak growing seasons drought apparently decreased g s α ω and ef soil water availability and canopy development were important factors affecting g s α ω and ef furthermore even in wet year the α 1 of this poplar plantation site indicated a permanent limitation of water and energy exchange by water availability given more variable precipitation pattern in future with more extreme rainfall events punctuated by longer intervening dry periods according to the predictions of global climate models northern china may experience increases in drought occurrence hence the government green projects should be cautious in species selection in this area especially

9311,compound drought and heat cdhe is frequently occurred worldwide and leads to disproportionate impacts on agricultural production than univariate climate extremes hence continues to receive research attention however the driving mechanism and occurrence characteristics of cdhes remain unclear in some agro ecological sensitive regions here we adopted standardized precipitation index spi and standardized temperature index sti to identify the intensity of drought and heat respectively in north china and then to identify the month and area that most prone to cdhes copulas can simulate the dependence between variables hence were proposed to construct joint cumulative probability distributions of spi and sti so as to simulate the occurrence characteristic of cdhes the results demonstrated that in cold season there were some stations with significant positive correlations between the spi and sti however 80 of stations had significant negative correlations between the two variables in july the month of the year with the most stations hence july is considered as the month most prone to cdhes among the year in north china we also found that the symmetrized joe clayton copula was the best to construct joint probability distributions of spi and sti in most stations in july cdhes occurred more frequently after 1990s with much higher intensity and wider spatial extent which was mainly attributed to more severe heats spatially mid western plain and north mountainous areas were more prone to cdhes our findings provide a better understanding of cdhes in north china and could offer valuable references for meteorological disaster risk prevention in agriculture production keywords compound events copula model standardized precipitation index standardized temperature index north china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate extremes continues to receive research attention due to their disproportionate impacts on society and agroecosystem ipcc 2012 especially some of the most serious impacts are often caused by a combination of climatic extremes that termed as compound event ipcc 2013 compound events involve more than one variable zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 which usually have excessive impacts than univariate climate extremes drought and extreme heat often co occurred under global warming which is one of the most concerned compound events types compound drought and heat event cdhe seriously affected vegetation production ciais et al 2005 de boeck et al 2011 wolf et al 2016 caused tree mortality allen et al 2010 promoted insect outbreaks williams et al 2010 and wildfires flannigan et al 2009 negatively affected agriculture sector in addition extreme heat and dry conditions are conducive to the spread of diseases and thus severely affect human health chretien et al 2007 padmanabha et al 2010 bandyopadhyay et al 2012 therefore understanding concurrent characteristics of compound drought and heat events is of crucial importance to provide relevant information for disaster mitigation former studies mainly focus on investigating the disasters from univariate perspective hence leading to underestimate the impacts of compound events the magnitudes of individual hazards will increase as climate extremes co occurred shukla et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2014 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 in addition drought and extreme heat interact with each other for instance surface drought caused by precipitation deficit can induce less evaporation leading to atmospheric heating mueller and seneviratne 2012 found that the number of high temperature days is closely related to the previous lack of precipitation in many parts of the world on the other hand extreme heat will significantly increase evaporation demand thereby exacerbating the severity of drought dai 2013 this can also explain why cdhe is one of the most frequent types of compound events under global warming in recent years there were some studies concerning compound events ridder et al 2020 zscheischler et al 2020 the most common approach was to define and identify the compound events so as to analyze the spatial and temporal distributions of historical occurrence frequencies chen and li 2017 wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 in different studies the definitions may be different for instance zhang et al 2020 defined the short term concurrent drought and heatwave events from evapotranspiration soil moisture and surface temperature to study their historical occurrence frequency around the world wu et al 2019b used 25th percentile of precipitation and 75th percentile of temperature to define compound precipitation and temperature extreme events in china this is a straight forward approach to improve our understanding of compound events in history however as the compound events are extreme events this kind of studies always require long term series data to contain more samples moreover because compound events are multi variable issues this kind of studies didn t capture the dependence structure between variables which is essential in estimating the probability of compound events and their potential effects hao et al 2018 some other studies on compound events used multivariate joint distribution to simulate the dependence between variables and to present the occurrence probability of compound events among them the copula models are the most commonly used especially for bivariate issues zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 chen et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2020 collins 2021 in high dimensions meta gaussian model has been proposed hao et al 2018 before performing joint distribution for two or more variables the marginal distribution of univariate must be fitted separately the advantage of copulas is allowing the correlate variables without the necessity of similar marginal distributions wazneh et al 2020 in the studies of cdhes the marginal distributions of precipitation collins 2021 or some drought indexes such as standardized precipitation index spi hao et al 2018 palmer drought severity index pdsi chen et al 2019 were fitted to denote drought water deficit and the marginal distributions of maximum temperature collins 2021 the number of high temperature days chen et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2020 were commonly used to denote extreme heat however the indexes to denote drought and heat in the joint probability modeling were not comparable for example drought indexes are commonly standardized but heat indexes are not this may have potential adverse effects on exploring the dominant drivers of compound events and the dependence between variables so far the exploration of concurrent event is increasing however the existing studies were most on global or national scale targeted researches on some sensitive and vulnerable agricultural areas are still missing in addition the driving mechanism and occurrence characteristics of cdhes in these areas are remain unclear moreover the current methodology applied to investigate compound events has some defects as described above hence in this study cdhes were studied in north china which is susceptible to cdhes and is a major agriculture area in china kang and eltahir 2018 two comparable indexes spi and standardized temperature index sti were adopted to denote intensities of drought and heat respectively copulas were used to link the marginal distributions of the two variables which can capture the dependence between variables the main objectives were 1 to identify the most frequently occurred month and areas of cdhes across north china during period 1961 2019 2 to explore the dominant driven factor of interannual variation of cdhes and 3 to study the spatial distributions of joint return periods of cdhes with different drought and heat intensities 2 dataset and methodology 2 1 study area the north china 112 1 122 42 e 34 22 42 35 n consists of beijing tianjin hebei shandong and northern henan with an area of 400 000 km2 fig 1 it is the most important winter wheat and summer maize production area in china this region has a temperate continental monsoon climate which is cold and dry in winter and hot and rainy in summer seventy percent of the annual precipitation occurs from june to september with large interannual variability hence there is frequently drought because north china plain has experienced great expansion of irrigated agriculture with significant impact on the surface temperature the risk of high temperature and heatwave in north china has increased since 1970 kang and eltahir 2018 owing to climate change and human interference this region is more prone to cdhes and the potential losses for agricultural production are huge 2 2 dataset the dataset including daily precipitation and average temperature data from 39 national weather stations during the period 1960 2019 was collected from china meteorological data network https data cma cn site index html which has been performed rigorous quality control procedures it is one of the best daily meteorological datasets in china chen and li 2017 and is widely used qiu et al 2021b 2022 2 3 methods 2 3 1 definition of compound drought and heat events in this study we investigated the monthly cdhes for a certain month when drought and heat happened simultaneously this month can be defined as cdhe occurred four characteristics of cdhes in different time periods are evaluated in this study intensity dominated factor spatial extent and joint return period we studied the intensities of drought and heat in the cdhes if heat intensity is higher than its drought intensity this cdhe can be defined as heat dominated the spatial extent of cdhes in a certain month is defined as the proportion of stations with compound events happened in north china in that month risk of cdhes is expressed by its return period a region with shorter return period means this region is more prone to cdhes and with higher risk to identify the drought a commonly used index spi was selected the main advantage of using spi is that it can be compared across different locations and calculated at various timescales to calculate spi the data of precipitation are fitted by the gamma distribution then converted to the standard normal distribution droughts are the negative anomalies when spi 0 5 mckee et al 1993 detailed calculation processes can be found elsewhere yao et al 2018 since heat is closely related to the previous lack of precipitation mueller and seneviratne 2012 spi were calculated at 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 12 month timescales in this study so as to investigate the timescale of drought most closely related to heat to identify heat we adopted the sti index which is computed in a similar spirit with spi zscheischler et al 2014 since temperature anomalies can be assumed to be normally distributed hansen et al 2012 zscheischler et al 2014 time series of monthly average temperature can be directly fitted by a normal distribution to calculate sti heat is defined as the positive anomalies when sti 0 5 according to previous studies mckee et al 1993 zscheischler et al 2014 categories of drought heat intensity based on spi sti can be divided into four levels as shown in table 1 hence 16 corresponding bivariate permutations are generated we will examine cdhes of these 16 drought and heat intensity combinations in this study the opposite values of spi spi were used to represent the drought intensity hence higher value of spi represents stronger drought this makes it more convenient for subsequent fitting of probability distributions 2 3 2 copulas and bivariate joint return periods any multivariate joint distribution can be written in terms of univariate marginal distribution functions and a joint model such as copula which describes the dependence structure between variables nelsen 2007 copula enables the flexible selection of arbitrary marginal distribution structures xu et al 2021 and has been widely used in hydrology and meteorology mellak and souag gamane 2020 zhang et al 2021a zhu et al 2019 one of the objectives of this study is to estimate the joint cumulative probability distribution of cdhes six copula functions are evaluated to link the marginal distributions of drought denoted by spi and heat intensities denoted by sti the specific functions and parameter ranges are shown in table 2 the akaike information criterion aic is used to illustrate the fitting goodness of the six copulas akaike 2011 in this study the candidate univariate marginal distributions include the normal distribution norm the extreme value distribution ev and the generalized extreme value distribution gev the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test is used to select the optimal marginal distribution function massey 1951 and p value near to 1 indicates the marginal distribution function fits the data very well the k s test is also used to assess the differences between the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of compound events in different time periods p value 0 05 indicates the data from the two periods are draw from different distributions at a 0 05 significance level the bivariate joint return periods of cdhes are computed from the fitted copulas the two dimensional exceeding probability is the probability of an event that both variables exceed given thresholds which can be denoted as follows zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 1 p p x x y y 1 u v c u v where x and y are the random variables i e spi and sti in this study x and y are the given thresholds u and v are the cumulative probabilities when the random variables x and y are less than the thresholds x and y calculated by the best fitted marginal distribution functions the joint return periods rp related to the exceeding probability p can be computed as 2 rp 1 p 3 results 3 1 determination of the month most prone to cdhes for each station and each month spi were calculated at 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 12 month timescales correlation analysis was conducted between 1 month scale sti sti 1 and spis on each timescale so as to investigate the timescale of drought most closely related to heat and the months in which cdhes were most likely to occur proportions of stations with significant correlations p 0 05 between sti 1 and spis were displayed in fig 2 significantly positive correlations mainly appeared in cold season and the largest proportion of stations with significantly positive correlation was 28 which occurred between sti 1 and spi 4 spi on 4 month scale in december this means that after a period of precipitation deficit lower spis it more likely accompanied by lower temperatures lower stis in cold months from march to september the significant correlations between sti 1 and spis on different timescales were all negative in june and july the ratios of stations having significantly negative correlations were obviously greater than that in other months and that in july generally 0 8 were obviously greater than in june this indicates that heats higher stis in june and july are likely to be accompanied after a period of precipitation deficit lower spis in north china leading to high risk of cdhes the largest ratio of stations with significantly negative correlation appeared between sti 1 and spi 3 in july hence july can be determined as the month most prone to cdhes and 3 month scale drought is most closely related to heat in july in the following sections we will take spi 3 in july as an example to study the characteristics of cdhes 3 2 construction of bivariate joint distribution of spi and sti by using copulas in north china stations with significantly negative correlations between sti 1 and spi 3 in july are denoted by colored circles in fig 3 which are prone to cdhes stations denoted by grey circles are not studied as they don t have significant correlation between sti and spi as shown in fig 3 gev is the optimal marginal distribution function for both spi and sti at most stations and norm performs the best at some other stations the p value of k s test for marginal distribution of sti at each station is between 0 58 and 0 99 fig 3a and is between 0 29 and 0 99 for spi fig 3b indicating a better performance of the marginal distribution for sti than for spi six different copulas are used to link the marginal distributions of sti and spi at each station and aic is used to select the best copula function fig 4 shows that the symmetrised joe clayton copula is the optimal copula at most stations followed by student s t frank and gumbel copula three sites which represented different geographical background are selected as examples to show the joint cumulative probability distributions of sti and spi fitted by the optimal copula function fig 5 the three sites are weichang haiyang and raoyang located in northern mountainous area east costal area and mid western plain area respectively from the optimal copula functions we can obtain the joint cumulative probability at any sti and spi cdhe is the part that both values of spi and sti over 0 5 for example the probability of drought and heat intensity simultaneously 0 5 is 0 58 at weichang and 0 51 at haiyang fig 5 also reveals that the increasing trend of cumulative probability with increasing drought intensity is similar at the three stations however this is not the case for heat intensity for weichang and raoyang the cumulative probability remains near zero when heat intensity is 2 and the probability slightly increase when heat intensity is 2 however for the haiyang cumulative probability stops to further increase when heat intensity is 2 this indicates extreme heat events rarely occurred in haiyang based on eq 2 and the best fitted copula function joint return period of cdhes at any drought and heat intensity can be calculated we also take weichang haiyang and raoyang as examples to show the isolines of the five selected joint return periods fig 6 shows that compared to the other two stations the isolines at haiyang are more densely distributed in the direction of heat intensity this suggests that for cdhes with the same joint return periods if their drought intensities are also the same the compound events in weichang and raoyang need more intense heat than in haiyang for example for a cdhe with 50 year return period its drought intensity is 1 0 the corresponding heat intensity is 1 6 in haiyang while 2 3 and 2 2 in weichang and raoyang fig 6 also shows that the number of years that cdhes happened in weichang haiyang and raoyang during 1960 2019 are 9 9 and 11 respectively and the majority of them happened since 1990 3 3 characteristics of compound drought and heat events in different time periods characteristics of cdhes during different time periods are investigated as shown in fig 7a the frequency of cdhes in north china obviously increased the frequency in 2000 2019 was more than twice as that in 1960 1979 in addition the frequency of cdhes dominated by heat was obviously increased however the frequency of cdhes dominated by drought did not change much the cdfs of heat intensity sti of cdhes during 2000 2019 and 1980 1999 shifted to right relative to the period 1960 1979 fig 7b however the cdf of drought intensity spi of cdhes during 2000 2019 slightly shifted to left with respect to the period 1960 1979 fig 7c this suggests that heat intensities of cdhes substantially increased while their drought intensities slightly reduced during 2000 2019 relative to 1960 1979 this explains why more cdhes dominated by heats in 2000 2019 fig 7d shows that the cdf of joint return periods of cdhes during 2000 2019 slightly shifted to right relative to the period 1960 1979 indicating more extreme cdhes in 2000 2019 cdfs in fig 7e show that the cdhes in 2000 2019 had much wider scope than previous periods all in all the above results reveal that more frequent cdhes happened in 2000 2019 with respect to 1960 1979 and the cdhes with higher intensity and wider spatial extent were appeared in 2000 2019 which were mainly attributed to much serious heats 3 4 joint return periods of cdhes with different drought and heat intensities the joint return periods of cdhes for 16 combinations of drought and heat intensity levels in north china are shown in fig 8 cdhes with mild drought and mild heat have the shortest joint return periods which are generally less than 10 years fig 8a joint return periods increased with the increase of either heat intensity or drought intensity cdhes with extreme drought and heat seldom happened in north china with the joint return periods over 100 years in most regions fig 8p spatially joint return periods of cdhes are relatively shorter in mid western plain area and part of north mountainous area than in other areas indicating higher risk of cdhes what s more the joint return periods of cdhes in these two areas are more sensitive to drought intensity than heat as the increase of drought intensity the joint return period is much longer than that with the increase of heat intensity for instance the joint return periods of cdhes with extreme drought fig 8m are longer than that with extreme heat fig 8d in these two area in other regions the joint return periods of cdhes are relatively more sensitive to heat intensity 4 discussions 4 1 correlation between precipitation and temperature temperature and precipitation showed negative relation in warm season over many regions of world zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 gao et al 2020 which can be driven by the complex land atmosphere feedbacks and highly related to soil moisture chen et al 2019 for instance increased temperatures can exacerbate soil moisture deficit thereby reducing evaporation seneviratne et al 2010 according to energy balance reduced latent heat flux will lead to increase in sensible heat flux in turn further raising temperatures fischer et al 2007 furthermore increased potential evapotranspiration due to air temperature increases could skew the region towards greater aridity despite precipitation increases bennett et al 2020 in this study we revealed that the negative correlation between precipitation and temperature was also mainly appeared in warm season in north china however in cold season some stations had significant positive correlation this may be due to that cold atmosphere with limited water holding capacity reduced precipitation berg et al 2009 we further analyzed the correlation between sti 1 and spis when drought spi 0 5 or wetness spi 0 5 happened in july as shown in table 3 the correlation coefficients were all negative at 0 01 significant level when drought happened however the relationships between sti 1 and spis were not significant when wetness spi 0 5 happened hence we can infer that the negative correlation between precipitation and temperature in july is mainly caused by drought spi 0 5 concurrent with heat sti 0 5 rather than high spi concurrent with low sti 4 2 more frequent and serious cdhes in north china the number of cdhes in summer showed significant increase across many parts of the world such as the united states mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 europe sedlmeier et al 2018 and china chen et al 2019 wu et al 2019a the main trigger for land atmosphere feedback has shifted from the drought to the extreme temperatures in recent decades wu et al 2019b collins 2021 our findings further show that more frequent cdhes with higher intensity and wider spatial extent appeared in 2000 2019 relative to 1960 1979 and this mainly attributed to more serious heats fig 8 rising global average surface temperatures have been observed over the past few decades qiu et al 2021a and wang et al 2022 shown that the average annual temperature before and after the 1990s was 10 65 c and 11 49 c this leads to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events ababaei and chenu 2020 jakob and walland 2016 although china experienced warming hiatus after 1998 extremes heat still significantly increased shen et al 2018 li and amatus 2020 while there was no significant trend in drought wu et al 2019a simulations of future scenarios suggest that the likelihood and extend of cdhes will increase in future wu et al 2021a 2021b in studying the cdhes in july we only studied 3 month scale drought because this timescale is most closely related to heat in july fig 9 shows the correlation coefficients between spi 1 and spis on other timescales there were very strong positive correlations between spi 1 and spi on 2 to 12 month timescales in july this means that when july is dry there is a high probability that the drought has already occurred for a long period heat is exacerbated by a prolonged drought leading to occurrence of cdhes in july hence although we only studied cdhes with 3 month scale drought the results would no significant difference if we used other timescales we also analyze the characteristics of cdhes in june see figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material the spatial and temporal characteristics of cdhes in june shown no big difference with that in july our results from july can illustrate the characteristics of cdhes in north china 4 3 relationship between cdhes and agriculture production in north china agriculture is the most sensitive sector to cdhes north china is considered as the vital agricultural area and summer maize growing season last from mid june to early october in this region zhang et al 2021b the phenological stage of six leave fully emerged to tasseling for summer maize is most vulnerable to drought and extreme heat and this stage mainly occurred on july to early august in north china zhang et al 2021b the present study showed that the cdhes mainly appeared in june and july in north china hence it tends to be an effective way to mitigate the potential effects of cdhes by postponing the sowing date of summer maize so as to make the sensitive tasseling stage occurred at august when the cdhes less happened xiao et al 2022 also found that proper delaying sowing date of summer maize can reduce the effects of extreme heat stress on maize production our results provide a better understanding of the characteristics of cdhes and are essential for developing adaptation strategies to reduce meteorological disaster risk to agricultural productivity agricultural activities may also in turn influence the occurrence of cdhes in north china irrigated agriculture in north china plain has experienced great expansion which may have significant impact on the surface temperature irrigation is one of the main contributors for the risk of high temperature and heatwave in north china kang and eltahir 2018 and the area equipped for irrigation is much higher in the mid western region of the north china plain than other area kang and eltahir 2018 heat is the main reason for frequently occurred cdhes in recent years so that explains the higher risk of cdhes in mid western region fig 8 5 conclusions in summary we can obtain the following conclusions in this study 1 in north china the proportion of stations with significant negative correlations between spis and sti 1 was the most in july especially for 3 month scale spi 87 the negative correlation was mainly caused by drought spi 0 5 concurrent with heat sti 0 5 rather than high spi concurrent with low sti hence july is the month most prone to cdhes 2 taking 3 month scale drought in july as example the symmetrized joe clayton copula was the best to construct the joint dependence probability distribution between drought and heat in most stations cdhes were more frequently happened in 2000 2019 with much higher intensity and wider spatial extent this mainly due to more frequent and severe heats 3 the joint return periods of cdhes in july were relatively shorter in mid western plain area and north mountainous area over the study period these two areas were more prone to cdhes and the joint return period of cdhes in both areas were more sensitive to drought intensity our findings provide a better understanding of cdhes in north china which is one of the most sensitive and vulnerable regions to global warming and is also a major agricultural production area in china the findings could offer a valuable reference for disaster risk prevention and future disaster risk preparation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9311,compound drought and heat cdhe is frequently occurred worldwide and leads to disproportionate impacts on agricultural production than univariate climate extremes hence continues to receive research attention however the driving mechanism and occurrence characteristics of cdhes remain unclear in some agro ecological sensitive regions here we adopted standardized precipitation index spi and standardized temperature index sti to identify the intensity of drought and heat respectively in north china and then to identify the month and area that most prone to cdhes copulas can simulate the dependence between variables hence were proposed to construct joint cumulative probability distributions of spi and sti so as to simulate the occurrence characteristic of cdhes the results demonstrated that in cold season there were some stations with significant positive correlations between the spi and sti however 80 of stations had significant negative correlations between the two variables in july the month of the year with the most stations hence july is considered as the month most prone to cdhes among the year in north china we also found that the symmetrized joe clayton copula was the best to construct joint probability distributions of spi and sti in most stations in july cdhes occurred more frequently after 1990s with much higher intensity and wider spatial extent which was mainly attributed to more severe heats spatially mid western plain and north mountainous areas were more prone to cdhes our findings provide a better understanding of cdhes in north china and could offer valuable references for meteorological disaster risk prevention in agriculture production keywords compound events copula model standardized precipitation index standardized temperature index north china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate extremes continues to receive research attention due to their disproportionate impacts on society and agroecosystem ipcc 2012 especially some of the most serious impacts are often caused by a combination of climatic extremes that termed as compound event ipcc 2013 compound events involve more than one variable zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 which usually have excessive impacts than univariate climate extremes drought and extreme heat often co occurred under global warming which is one of the most concerned compound events types compound drought and heat event cdhe seriously affected vegetation production ciais et al 2005 de boeck et al 2011 wolf et al 2016 caused tree mortality allen et al 2010 promoted insect outbreaks williams et al 2010 and wildfires flannigan et al 2009 negatively affected agriculture sector in addition extreme heat and dry conditions are conducive to the spread of diseases and thus severely affect human health chretien et al 2007 padmanabha et al 2010 bandyopadhyay et al 2012 therefore understanding concurrent characteristics of compound drought and heat events is of crucial importance to provide relevant information for disaster mitigation former studies mainly focus on investigating the disasters from univariate perspective hence leading to underestimate the impacts of compound events the magnitudes of individual hazards will increase as climate extremes co occurred shukla et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2014 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 in addition drought and extreme heat interact with each other for instance surface drought caused by precipitation deficit can induce less evaporation leading to atmospheric heating mueller and seneviratne 2012 found that the number of high temperature days is closely related to the previous lack of precipitation in many parts of the world on the other hand extreme heat will significantly increase evaporation demand thereby exacerbating the severity of drought dai 2013 this can also explain why cdhe is one of the most frequent types of compound events under global warming in recent years there were some studies concerning compound events ridder et al 2020 zscheischler et al 2020 the most common approach was to define and identify the compound events so as to analyze the spatial and temporal distributions of historical occurrence frequencies chen and li 2017 wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 in different studies the definitions may be different for instance zhang et al 2020 defined the short term concurrent drought and heatwave events from evapotranspiration soil moisture and surface temperature to study their historical occurrence frequency around the world wu et al 2019b used 25th percentile of precipitation and 75th percentile of temperature to define compound precipitation and temperature extreme events in china this is a straight forward approach to improve our understanding of compound events in history however as the compound events are extreme events this kind of studies always require long term series data to contain more samples moreover because compound events are multi variable issues this kind of studies didn t capture the dependence structure between variables which is essential in estimating the probability of compound events and their potential effects hao et al 2018 some other studies on compound events used multivariate joint distribution to simulate the dependence between variables and to present the occurrence probability of compound events among them the copula models are the most commonly used especially for bivariate issues zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 chen et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2020 collins 2021 in high dimensions meta gaussian model has been proposed hao et al 2018 before performing joint distribution for two or more variables the marginal distribution of univariate must be fitted separately the advantage of copulas is allowing the correlate variables without the necessity of similar marginal distributions wazneh et al 2020 in the studies of cdhes the marginal distributions of precipitation collins 2021 or some drought indexes such as standardized precipitation index spi hao et al 2018 palmer drought severity index pdsi chen et al 2019 were fitted to denote drought water deficit and the marginal distributions of maximum temperature collins 2021 the number of high temperature days chen et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2020 were commonly used to denote extreme heat however the indexes to denote drought and heat in the joint probability modeling were not comparable for example drought indexes are commonly standardized but heat indexes are not this may have potential adverse effects on exploring the dominant drivers of compound events and the dependence between variables so far the exploration of concurrent event is increasing however the existing studies were most on global or national scale targeted researches on some sensitive and vulnerable agricultural areas are still missing in addition the driving mechanism and occurrence characteristics of cdhes in these areas are remain unclear moreover the current methodology applied to investigate compound events has some defects as described above hence in this study cdhes were studied in north china which is susceptible to cdhes and is a major agriculture area in china kang and eltahir 2018 two comparable indexes spi and standardized temperature index sti were adopted to denote intensities of drought and heat respectively copulas were used to link the marginal distributions of the two variables which can capture the dependence between variables the main objectives were 1 to identify the most frequently occurred month and areas of cdhes across north china during period 1961 2019 2 to explore the dominant driven factor of interannual variation of cdhes and 3 to study the spatial distributions of joint return periods of cdhes with different drought and heat intensities 2 dataset and methodology 2 1 study area the north china 112 1 122 42 e 34 22 42 35 n consists of beijing tianjin hebei shandong and northern henan with an area of 400 000 km2 fig 1 it is the most important winter wheat and summer maize production area in china this region has a temperate continental monsoon climate which is cold and dry in winter and hot and rainy in summer seventy percent of the annual precipitation occurs from june to september with large interannual variability hence there is frequently drought because north china plain has experienced great expansion of irrigated agriculture with significant impact on the surface temperature the risk of high temperature and heatwave in north china has increased since 1970 kang and eltahir 2018 owing to climate change and human interference this region is more prone to cdhes and the potential losses for agricultural production are huge 2 2 dataset the dataset including daily precipitation and average temperature data from 39 national weather stations during the period 1960 2019 was collected from china meteorological data network https data cma cn site index html which has been performed rigorous quality control procedures it is one of the best daily meteorological datasets in china chen and li 2017 and is widely used qiu et al 2021b 2022 2 3 methods 2 3 1 definition of compound drought and heat events in this study we investigated the monthly cdhes for a certain month when drought and heat happened simultaneously this month can be defined as cdhe occurred four characteristics of cdhes in different time periods are evaluated in this study intensity dominated factor spatial extent and joint return period we studied the intensities of drought and heat in the cdhes if heat intensity is higher than its drought intensity this cdhe can be defined as heat dominated the spatial extent of cdhes in a certain month is defined as the proportion of stations with compound events happened in north china in that month risk of cdhes is expressed by its return period a region with shorter return period means this region is more prone to cdhes and with higher risk to identify the drought a commonly used index spi was selected the main advantage of using spi is that it can be compared across different locations and calculated at various timescales to calculate spi the data of precipitation are fitted by the gamma distribution then converted to the standard normal distribution droughts are the negative anomalies when spi 0 5 mckee et al 1993 detailed calculation processes can be found elsewhere yao et al 2018 since heat is closely related to the previous lack of precipitation mueller and seneviratne 2012 spi were calculated at 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 12 month timescales in this study so as to investigate the timescale of drought most closely related to heat to identify heat we adopted the sti index which is computed in a similar spirit with spi zscheischler et al 2014 since temperature anomalies can be assumed to be normally distributed hansen et al 2012 zscheischler et al 2014 time series of monthly average temperature can be directly fitted by a normal distribution to calculate sti heat is defined as the positive anomalies when sti 0 5 according to previous studies mckee et al 1993 zscheischler et al 2014 categories of drought heat intensity based on spi sti can be divided into four levels as shown in table 1 hence 16 corresponding bivariate permutations are generated we will examine cdhes of these 16 drought and heat intensity combinations in this study the opposite values of spi spi were used to represent the drought intensity hence higher value of spi represents stronger drought this makes it more convenient for subsequent fitting of probability distributions 2 3 2 copulas and bivariate joint return periods any multivariate joint distribution can be written in terms of univariate marginal distribution functions and a joint model such as copula which describes the dependence structure between variables nelsen 2007 copula enables the flexible selection of arbitrary marginal distribution structures xu et al 2021 and has been widely used in hydrology and meteorology mellak and souag gamane 2020 zhang et al 2021a zhu et al 2019 one of the objectives of this study is to estimate the joint cumulative probability distribution of cdhes six copula functions are evaluated to link the marginal distributions of drought denoted by spi and heat intensities denoted by sti the specific functions and parameter ranges are shown in table 2 the akaike information criterion aic is used to illustrate the fitting goodness of the six copulas akaike 2011 in this study the candidate univariate marginal distributions include the normal distribution norm the extreme value distribution ev and the generalized extreme value distribution gev the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test is used to select the optimal marginal distribution function massey 1951 and p value near to 1 indicates the marginal distribution function fits the data very well the k s test is also used to assess the differences between the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of compound events in different time periods p value 0 05 indicates the data from the two periods are draw from different distributions at a 0 05 significance level the bivariate joint return periods of cdhes are computed from the fitted copulas the two dimensional exceeding probability is the probability of an event that both variables exceed given thresholds which can be denoted as follows zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 1 p p x x y y 1 u v c u v where x and y are the random variables i e spi and sti in this study x and y are the given thresholds u and v are the cumulative probabilities when the random variables x and y are less than the thresholds x and y calculated by the best fitted marginal distribution functions the joint return periods rp related to the exceeding probability p can be computed as 2 rp 1 p 3 results 3 1 determination of the month most prone to cdhes for each station and each month spi were calculated at 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 12 month timescales correlation analysis was conducted between 1 month scale sti sti 1 and spis on each timescale so as to investigate the timescale of drought most closely related to heat and the months in which cdhes were most likely to occur proportions of stations with significant correlations p 0 05 between sti 1 and spis were displayed in fig 2 significantly positive correlations mainly appeared in cold season and the largest proportion of stations with significantly positive correlation was 28 which occurred between sti 1 and spi 4 spi on 4 month scale in december this means that after a period of precipitation deficit lower spis it more likely accompanied by lower temperatures lower stis in cold months from march to september the significant correlations between sti 1 and spis on different timescales were all negative in june and july the ratios of stations having significantly negative correlations were obviously greater than that in other months and that in july generally 0 8 were obviously greater than in june this indicates that heats higher stis in june and july are likely to be accompanied after a period of precipitation deficit lower spis in north china leading to high risk of cdhes the largest ratio of stations with significantly negative correlation appeared between sti 1 and spi 3 in july hence july can be determined as the month most prone to cdhes and 3 month scale drought is most closely related to heat in july in the following sections we will take spi 3 in july as an example to study the characteristics of cdhes 3 2 construction of bivariate joint distribution of spi and sti by using copulas in north china stations with significantly negative correlations between sti 1 and spi 3 in july are denoted by colored circles in fig 3 which are prone to cdhes stations denoted by grey circles are not studied as they don t have significant correlation between sti and spi as shown in fig 3 gev is the optimal marginal distribution function for both spi and sti at most stations and norm performs the best at some other stations the p value of k s test for marginal distribution of sti at each station is between 0 58 and 0 99 fig 3a and is between 0 29 and 0 99 for spi fig 3b indicating a better performance of the marginal distribution for sti than for spi six different copulas are used to link the marginal distributions of sti and spi at each station and aic is used to select the best copula function fig 4 shows that the symmetrised joe clayton copula is the optimal copula at most stations followed by student s t frank and gumbel copula three sites which represented different geographical background are selected as examples to show the joint cumulative probability distributions of sti and spi fitted by the optimal copula function fig 5 the three sites are weichang haiyang and raoyang located in northern mountainous area east costal area and mid western plain area respectively from the optimal copula functions we can obtain the joint cumulative probability at any sti and spi cdhe is the part that both values of spi and sti over 0 5 for example the probability of drought and heat intensity simultaneously 0 5 is 0 58 at weichang and 0 51 at haiyang fig 5 also reveals that the increasing trend of cumulative probability with increasing drought intensity is similar at the three stations however this is not the case for heat intensity for weichang and raoyang the cumulative probability remains near zero when heat intensity is 2 and the probability slightly increase when heat intensity is 2 however for the haiyang cumulative probability stops to further increase when heat intensity is 2 this indicates extreme heat events rarely occurred in haiyang based on eq 2 and the best fitted copula function joint return period of cdhes at any drought and heat intensity can be calculated we also take weichang haiyang and raoyang as examples to show the isolines of the five selected joint return periods fig 6 shows that compared to the other two stations the isolines at haiyang are more densely distributed in the direction of heat intensity this suggests that for cdhes with the same joint return periods if their drought intensities are also the same the compound events in weichang and raoyang need more intense heat than in haiyang for example for a cdhe with 50 year return period its drought intensity is 1 0 the corresponding heat intensity is 1 6 in haiyang while 2 3 and 2 2 in weichang and raoyang fig 6 also shows that the number of years that cdhes happened in weichang haiyang and raoyang during 1960 2019 are 9 9 and 11 respectively and the majority of them happened since 1990 3 3 characteristics of compound drought and heat events in different time periods characteristics of cdhes during different time periods are investigated as shown in fig 7a the frequency of cdhes in north china obviously increased the frequency in 2000 2019 was more than twice as that in 1960 1979 in addition the frequency of cdhes dominated by heat was obviously increased however the frequency of cdhes dominated by drought did not change much the cdfs of heat intensity sti of cdhes during 2000 2019 and 1980 1999 shifted to right relative to the period 1960 1979 fig 7b however the cdf of drought intensity spi of cdhes during 2000 2019 slightly shifted to left with respect to the period 1960 1979 fig 7c this suggests that heat intensities of cdhes substantially increased while their drought intensities slightly reduced during 2000 2019 relative to 1960 1979 this explains why more cdhes dominated by heats in 2000 2019 fig 7d shows that the cdf of joint return periods of cdhes during 2000 2019 slightly shifted to right relative to the period 1960 1979 indicating more extreme cdhes in 2000 2019 cdfs in fig 7e show that the cdhes in 2000 2019 had much wider scope than previous periods all in all the above results reveal that more frequent cdhes happened in 2000 2019 with respect to 1960 1979 and the cdhes with higher intensity and wider spatial extent were appeared in 2000 2019 which were mainly attributed to much serious heats 3 4 joint return periods of cdhes with different drought and heat intensities the joint return periods of cdhes for 16 combinations of drought and heat intensity levels in north china are shown in fig 8 cdhes with mild drought and mild heat have the shortest joint return periods which are generally less than 10 years fig 8a joint return periods increased with the increase of either heat intensity or drought intensity cdhes with extreme drought and heat seldom happened in north china with the joint return periods over 100 years in most regions fig 8p spatially joint return periods of cdhes are relatively shorter in mid western plain area and part of north mountainous area than in other areas indicating higher risk of cdhes what s more the joint return periods of cdhes in these two areas are more sensitive to drought intensity than heat as the increase of drought intensity the joint return period is much longer than that with the increase of heat intensity for instance the joint return periods of cdhes with extreme drought fig 8m are longer than that with extreme heat fig 8d in these two area in other regions the joint return periods of cdhes are relatively more sensitive to heat intensity 4 discussions 4 1 correlation between precipitation and temperature temperature and precipitation showed negative relation in warm season over many regions of world zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 gao et al 2020 which can be driven by the complex land atmosphere feedbacks and highly related to soil moisture chen et al 2019 for instance increased temperatures can exacerbate soil moisture deficit thereby reducing evaporation seneviratne et al 2010 according to energy balance reduced latent heat flux will lead to increase in sensible heat flux in turn further raising temperatures fischer et al 2007 furthermore increased potential evapotranspiration due to air temperature increases could skew the region towards greater aridity despite precipitation increases bennett et al 2020 in this study we revealed that the negative correlation between precipitation and temperature was also mainly appeared in warm season in north china however in cold season some stations had significant positive correlation this may be due to that cold atmosphere with limited water holding capacity reduced precipitation berg et al 2009 we further analyzed the correlation between sti 1 and spis when drought spi 0 5 or wetness spi 0 5 happened in july as shown in table 3 the correlation coefficients were all negative at 0 01 significant level when drought happened however the relationships between sti 1 and spis were not significant when wetness spi 0 5 happened hence we can infer that the negative correlation between precipitation and temperature in july is mainly caused by drought spi 0 5 concurrent with heat sti 0 5 rather than high spi concurrent with low sti 4 2 more frequent and serious cdhes in north china the number of cdhes in summer showed significant increase across many parts of the world such as the united states mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 europe sedlmeier et al 2018 and china chen et al 2019 wu et al 2019a the main trigger for land atmosphere feedback has shifted from the drought to the extreme temperatures in recent decades wu et al 2019b collins 2021 our findings further show that more frequent cdhes with higher intensity and wider spatial extent appeared in 2000 2019 relative to 1960 1979 and this mainly attributed to more serious heats fig 8 rising global average surface temperatures have been observed over the past few decades qiu et al 2021a and wang et al 2022 shown that the average annual temperature before and after the 1990s was 10 65 c and 11 49 c this leads to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events ababaei and chenu 2020 jakob and walland 2016 although china experienced warming hiatus after 1998 extremes heat still significantly increased shen et al 2018 li and amatus 2020 while there was no significant trend in drought wu et al 2019a simulations of future scenarios suggest that the likelihood and extend of cdhes will increase in future wu et al 2021a 2021b in studying the cdhes in july we only studied 3 month scale drought because this timescale is most closely related to heat in july fig 9 shows the correlation coefficients between spi 1 and spis on other timescales there were very strong positive correlations between spi 1 and spi on 2 to 12 month timescales in july this means that when july is dry there is a high probability that the drought has already occurred for a long period heat is exacerbated by a prolonged drought leading to occurrence of cdhes in july hence although we only studied cdhes with 3 month scale drought the results would no significant difference if we used other timescales we also analyze the characteristics of cdhes in june see figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material the spatial and temporal characteristics of cdhes in june shown no big difference with that in july our results from july can illustrate the characteristics of cdhes in north china 4 3 relationship between cdhes and agriculture production in north china agriculture is the most sensitive sector to cdhes north china is considered as the vital agricultural area and summer maize growing season last from mid june to early october in this region zhang et al 2021b the phenological stage of six leave fully emerged to tasseling for summer maize is most vulnerable to drought and extreme heat and this stage mainly occurred on july to early august in north china zhang et al 2021b the present study showed that the cdhes mainly appeared in june and july in north china hence it tends to be an effective way to mitigate the potential effects of cdhes by postponing the sowing date of summer maize so as to make the sensitive tasseling stage occurred at august when the cdhes less happened xiao et al 2022 also found that proper delaying sowing date of summer maize can reduce the effects of extreme heat stress on maize production our results provide a better understanding of the characteristics of cdhes and are essential for developing adaptation strategies to reduce meteorological disaster risk to agricultural productivity agricultural activities may also in turn influence the occurrence of cdhes in north china irrigated agriculture in north china plain has experienced great expansion which may have significant impact on the surface temperature irrigation is one of the main contributors for the risk of high temperature and heatwave in north china kang and eltahir 2018 and the area equipped for irrigation is much higher in the mid western region of the north china plain than other area kang and eltahir 2018 heat is the main reason for frequently occurred cdhes in recent years so that explains the higher risk of cdhes in mid western region fig 8 5 conclusions in summary we can obtain the following conclusions in this study 1 in north china the proportion of stations with significant negative correlations between spis and sti 1 was the most in july especially for 3 month scale spi 87 the negative correlation was mainly caused by drought spi 0 5 concurrent with heat sti 0 5 rather than high spi concurrent with low sti hence july is the month most prone to cdhes 2 taking 3 month scale drought in july as example the symmetrized joe clayton copula was the best to construct the joint dependence probability distribution between drought and heat in most stations cdhes were more frequently happened in 2000 2019 with much higher intensity and wider spatial extent this mainly due to more frequent and severe heats 3 the joint return periods of cdhes in july were relatively shorter in mid western plain area and north mountainous area over the study period these two areas were more prone to cdhes and the joint return period of cdhes in both areas were more sensitive to drought intensity our findings provide a better understanding of cdhes in north china which is one of the most sensitive and vulnerable regions to global warming and is also a major agricultural production area in china the findings could offer a valuable reference for disaster risk prevention and future disaster risk preparation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9312,accurate measurement of soil moisture θ is key to hydrology and agriculture research soil moisture sensor technology is the predominant method for measuring θ and such measurements are used as a standard for evaluating results from remote sensing and data assimilation therefore improving the θ measurement accuracy of soil moisture sensors is of great significance this study used the capacitance based soil moisture sensor 5tm decagon devices inc as an example to illustrate the necessity of calibration the 5tm soil moisture sensor calculates θ by measuring the dielectric constant ε of the soil medium and ε is affected by soil properties texture salinity soil organic matter etc consequently a common calibration model ccm was developed to calibrate θ from the 5tm sensor by incorporating the soil properties using soil samples collected from 17 sites in 13 provinces in china at 4 different depths first the θ change experiments were conducted in the laboratory for each soil sample second a linear calibration model lcm was applied to calibrate the 5tm measured soil moisture θ 5 tm based on true soil moisture θ true assessed through the gravimetric method the results indicated 1 high correlation coefficient r 0 95 was found for θ 5 tm and θ true but with a high root mean square error rmse of 0 051 m 3 m 3 and a more significant underestimation with increasing θ 2 lcm calibration results θ lcm showed a higher r 0 99 and a lower rmse 0 017 m 3 m 3 finally the ccm was established through relating the lcm coefficients a lcm and b lcm and soil properties based on multiple regression with rmse of 0 126 m 3 m 3 and 0 023 m 3 m 3 for a ccm and b ccm respectively the ccm calibrated result θ ccm showed an rmse of 0 02 m 3 m 3 and r of 0 98 ccm can almost replace lcm in terms of similar accuracy in this study a ccm for soil moisture sensors is proposed which provides a new approach for soil moisture sensor calibration keywords soil moisture content soil organic matter soil texture 5tm sensor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important part of land surface water soil moisture affects the energy exchange between land and atmosphere and has a profound impact on the earth s water cycle and climate change therefore accurately determining soil moisture is a key step in hydrological research guillod et al 2015 mccoll et al 2017 moreover accurate determination of soil moisture can be helpful for research on climate change and surface evapotranspiration as well as for disaster monitoring drought prediction and crop yield estimation seneviratne et al 2010 massari et al 2014 holzman et al 2014 approaches for measuring soil moisture content θ mainly include ground observation remote sensing inversion and data assimilation methods jackson 1993 robinson et al 2008 ground observation methods are most accurate for measuring θ but they are cost intensive and it is difficult to determine θ on a wide spatial scale or globally seneviratne et al 2010 compared with ground observation methods remote sensing has the advantage of continuous spatial coverage however there are still uncertainties regarding soil moisture inversion schmugge et al 2002 wagner et al 2007 data assimilation methods can be used to determine θ in deep soil layers but require large amounts of driven datasets vereecken et al 2008 ground observation is very important because of its high accuracy and the respective results are commonly used to validate and calibrate remote sensing and data assimilation based θ measurements robock et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2010 ground observation approaches mainly include 1 gravimetric measurements which destroy the original soil structure and thus preclude continuous monitoring of θ at the same location robinson et al 2008 seneviratne et al 2010 2 measurements using hand held devices which facilitates verification on the soil surface but makes it difficult to measure θ at multiple depths and 3 automatic observation stations which are suitable for continuous monitoring at multiple depths dean et al 1987 establishing a θ monitoring network is a common approach to measuring θ at a regional scale observation networks typically rely on numerous observation points and soil moisture sensors to measure and store real time data including soil moisture and temperature for example the international soil moisture network ismn and the ecohydrological wireless sensor network ehwsn dorigo et al 2011 vaz et al 2013 time domain reflectometry tdr and capacitance measurement are two common methods used in observation networks cassel et al 1994 topp and reynolds 1998 fares and polyakov 2006 robinson et al 2008 tdr sensors are typically operated at a higher measurement frequency and provide higher accuracy capacity based sensors with smaller probes are cheaper than tdr sensors and are widely used in monitoring networks robinson et al 2008 seneviratne et al 2010 both technologies assess θ based on the dielectric constant ε in the soil medium arulanandan 1991 mittelbach et al 2011 the ε is affected by θ and by the combined effects of soil texture salinity soil organic matter som bulk density and soil temperature topp et al 1980 however factory calibration equations typically do not simultaneously consider the effects of these factors when soil properties at the sensor installation locations differ from the factory calibrated soil properties measurement accuracy is considerably reduced bircher et al 2015 kim et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the relationship between ε and θ varies markedly with different soil properties and ε of fine grained soil is significantly lower than that of coarse grained soil at the same θ a high fine grained soil content increases the surface area of soil particles thus the bound water content is higher than that in coarse grained soils jacobsen and schjønning 1993 topp et al 1980 proposed an equation for ε and θ in soil samples from sandy loam to heavy clay however the relationship between ε and different soil properties has not been explored kim et al 2020 evaluated and calibrated six soil moisture sensors in sandy loam soils to improve their accuracy from 0 04 to 0 025 m 3 m 3 however it is difficult to generalize the results to other areas bircher et al 2015 demonstrated a significant deviation in measured θ in organic rich soils som 30 but the factory calibration formula was reliable at som 10 high soil salinity leads to an overestimation of ε mainly because there are more free electrolytes in the soil medium noborio et al 1994 bellingham 2007 fares et al 2009 skierucha 2000 obtained the responses of the tdr sensor to θ in mineral soil organic soil and soil mixtures of peat silt and peat sand using the gravimetric method where the effects of different bulk densities on ε used in the tdr sensor calibration equations reduced the measurement error by a factor of two hence soil moisture sensors must be calibrated with respect to the specific soil properties parvin and degré 2016 however these studies did not consider the combined effects of various soil properties on the evaluation and calibration of soil moisture sensors factory calibration errors of soil moisture sensors are not effectively solved resulting in the reduced applicability and generalizability of the calibration equations many previous studies on soil dielectric models accounted for the effects of soil properties on ε wang and schmugge 1980 dobson 1985 and mironov et al 2009 considered that soil is composed of four components free water combined water solids and air their models calculate ε of the soil medium by summing the weighted ε of each component jin et al 2017 wang s model indicated that free water and bound water exert different effects on ε wang and schmugge 1980 dobson s model combined the contributions of free and bound water in the soil to ε dobson 1985 the minronov s model also considers the influence of clay content on ε mironov et al 2009 liu et al 2014 established a semi empirical dielectric model with som as the input based on the minronov et al model szypłowska et al 2021 proposed a dielectric model considering the influence of som on ε with som ranging from 0 1 to 21 1 however the model s performance depends not only on texture and som of the soil sample but also on the variation in conductivity due to salinity wei et al 2017 improved the semi empirical medium mixing model by introducing soil salinity into the dobson model based on experimental data therefore the existing research results regarding soil properties and ε in dielectric models should be fully utilized and a common calibration model ccm for soil moisture sensors integrating various soil properties should be developed the objective of this study was to propose a ccm for soil moisture sensors applicable to natural soils and to improve θ measurement accuracy by considering the effects of various soil properties on ε this paper includes the following aspects 1 obtaining measured θ values of soil moisture sensors under different θ conditions through calibration experiments and calibrating them using a linear calibration model lcm 2 analyzing the relationship between soil properties and linear calibration model coefficients and 3 proposing a ccm and evaluating its calibration effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and soil samples this study was based on the wireless monitoring network established by the chinese academy of sciences this network is a long term observation system which can continuously measure soil moisture and temperature at multiple depths the network s 17 sites jingyuetan guyuan hefei haibei jiangshanjiao xitianshan minqin hulunbeier xilinhaote qiyang dongtinghu guangzhou yucheng nanjing qingdao qianyanzhou and naqu are located in 13 provinces in china fig 1 the longitude and latitude ranges were approximately 81 18 e to 128 96 e and 23 24 n to 49 34 n respectively the locations of the 17 sites covered a variety of ecological types including grassland farmland desert and forest each site covered an area of 1 ha approximately and a total of 40 capacitance based sensors 5tm decagon devices inc were installed at four depths of 5 10 20 and 40 cm soil samples were collected at 17 sites at four depth layers approximately 0 5 7 5 12 5 17 5 22 5 and 37 5 42 5 cm approximately 70 kg of each layer was collected for soil specific calibration experiments the clay silt and sand content ranged from 1 09 20 94 10 71 85 42 and 3 29 87 94 respectively fig 2 a c the soil types at the 17 sites were mainly silty loam jingyuetan jiangshanjiao xitianshan hulunbeier qiyang dongtinghu guangzhou yucheng nanjing and qingdao sites according to the united states department of agriculture usda classification system liebens 2001 silt was the dominant soil type in the hefei haibei and qianyanzhou sites with silt content accounting for more than 80 of the soil particle size the soil types in the xilinhaote and naqu sites were loam with roughly the same sand and silt content the minqin site was located in the gobi desert where surface sand content was 87 9 the som content and soil salinity ranges were approximately 0 17 17 45 and 0 003 1 73 respectively fig 2 d e in the vertical direction som in the surface layer 5 cm was markedly higher than that in the deep layer 40 cm and the trend of salinity was the opposite appendix a 2 2 calibration experiment for 5tm soil moisture sensors 2 2 1 5tm sensor the 5tm soil moisture sensors in the observation network were capacitance based sensors the measurement range of ε was 1 air 80 water and the measurement range of temperature was 40 50 c at 1 c accuracy the size of the 5tm sensor was 10 3 2 0 7 cm length width depth and probe length was 5 cm the electrical properties of ε differ with regard to soil texture salinity and som and the 5tm sensor had a factory calibration error of approximately 3 4 in general mineral media this error can be reduced to 1 2 after calibration for specific soil types decagon devices inc 2010 θ was calculated using topp s equation after measuring ε at a frequency of 70 mhz eq 1 1 θ a ε a 3 b ε a 2 c ε a d where coefficient a is 4 3 10 6 b is 5 5 10 4 c is 2 92 10 2 and d is 5 3 10 2 topp et al 1980 bellingham 2007 2 2 2 experimental design and process to calibrate and improve the measurement accuracy of the 5tm soil moisture sensor a calibration experiment was designed to simulate measurements at different moisture contents under various soil properties the calibration experiment was a process of seven steps and simulated θ of soil samples from dry to saturated 1 soil samples were passed through a 5 mm sieve to remove structures such as rocks and plants the soil samples were oven dried at 75 c until constant weight and higher temperatures were avoided to prevent excessive destruction of the som then 2 3 weight water was added to the soil samples of step 1 fig 3a and 3 soil samples were homogenized thereafter fig 3b 4 three 5tm sensors were used to record 5 6 measurements 2 min each the 5tm sensors were kept at sufficient distance to each other to avoid interference the average measurement values of the three 5tm sensors are shown in fig 3c 5 soil samples were collected from the locations where the sensors had been inserted and the true θ values were measured using the gravimetric method fig 3d 6 the soil samples were added to maintain constant weight to facilitate the addition of 3 water the weight of the added soil sample was equal to that of the gravimetric samples 7 steps 2 6 were repeated until θ of the soil sample indicated saturation calibration experiments were conducted using soil samples from four depths at 17 sites owing to the differences in soil properties and vertical heterogeneity at different sites the water saturation of soil samples also differed therefore the number of simulated θ gradients varied in calibration experiments with different soil samples in the calibration experiment 7 12 θ gradients were used based on the θ state of the soil samples a total of 611 simulations and gravimetric sample collections were performed for all soil samples from the 17 sites in the calibration experiment 2 3 calibration methods 2 3 1 linear calibration model lcm after calibration experiments at 17 sites the θ values of the 5tm sensor measurements θ 5 tm and gravimetric method measurements θ true were obtained it was found that the θ 5 tm had a favorable linear relationship with θ true in all soil samples the θ 5 tm values of the jingyuetan guyuan hefei minqin and qingdao sites were relatively close to θ true during the calibration experiments from dry soil to saturation the rmse range was approximately 0 008 0 049 m 3 m 3 and bias range was approximately 0 033 0 017 m 3 m 3 however θ was markedly underestimated at the haibei jiangshanjiao hulunbeier yucheng nanjing and naqu sites the maximum values of rmse and bias were 0 13 m 3 m 3 and 0 11 m 3 m 3 respectively fig 4 despite the underestimation of θ 5 tm there was a favorable linear relationship between θ 5 tm and θ true for the 17 sites with all correlation coefficients r exceeding 0 93 appendix b therefore it is feasible to calibrate θ 5 tm using a linear model the calibration process for the lcm was as follows 1 the coefficients of lcm a lcm and b lcm were determined by integrating θ 5 tm and θ true into eq 2 each soil sample had its own calibration coefficient for θ 5 tm in eq 2 θ 5 tm is the independent variable θ true is the dependent variable 2 the θ value of the lcm θ lcm was calculated using eq 3 and the coefficients a lcm and b lcm were used for θ 5 tm 2 θ true i j k a lcm i j θ 5 tm i j k b lcm i j 3 θ lcm i j k a lcm i j θ 5 tm i j k b lcm i j where a lcm and b lcm are coefficients in lcm i j k represent different sites with a range of 1 17 soil samples at different depths with a range of 1 4 and soil samples with different θ in the calibration experiments with a range of 1 12 2 3 2 common calibration model ccm the lcm can effectively improve the accuracy of θ 5 tm but it is not suitable for calibration with respect to large scale regions owing to the large workload of calibration experiments the ccm was proposed to make the calibration method of soil moisture sensors more convenient and scientific after normalizing the soil properties the correlations showed that the soil properties exerted different significant effects on a lcm and b lcm which showed a positive correlation with clay and silt content but a negative correlation with sand content a lcm was negatively correlated with salinity and b lcm showed a strong positive correlation with som fig 5 the soil properties were considered to have different fitting relationships for a lcm and b lcm therefore a lcm and b lcm can be expressed using the weighted relationships between soil texture som and salinity eq 4 the weighting coefficients and constants of the soil properties α 1 α 5 and β indicate the magnitude of the contribution of different soil properties to ε the relationships between soil properties and lcm coefficients were calculated for all soil samples from the 17 sites by applying multiple regression methods for quantification appendix a the α 1 α 5 and β incorporated a variety of soil properties to obtain the coefficients a ccm and b ccm to achieve a common calibration model the θ in the ccm method θ ccm was calculated using eq 5 4 y α 1 clay α 2 silt α 3 sand α 4 som α 5 salinity β 5 θ ccm i j k a ccm θ 5 tm i j k b ccm where y is the coefficient of the two calibration methods a lcm b lcm a ccm and b ccm α i is the coefficient of the soil properties and β is a constant the i j k represent different sites layers and gradients respectively 2 4 evaluation indicators three statistical indicators were used to quantify the accuracy of the two calibration models rmse bias and r the rmse was used to describe the accuracy error between the calibrated and true values eq 6 the bias was used to measure the deviation of the overall calibration results eq 7 r describes the linear correlation between the calibrated and true values eq 8 6 rmse e sm m sm true 2 7 bias e sm m e sm true 8 r i 1 n sm m i e sm m sm true i e sm true i 1 n sm m i e sm m 2 i 1 n sm true i e sm true 2 where e is the mean value sm m is the measured value of the 5tm sensors θ 5 tm or calibration values θ lcm and θ ccm and sm true is the gravimetric method value θ true 3 results 3 1 comparison of 5tm measured and lcm calibrated soil moisture the calibration results showed that θ 5 tm was widely underestimated as demonstrated by a total of 611 datasets for soil samples from 17 sites in the calibration experiment the underestimation of θ 5 tm was evident with an increase in θ fig 4 only 39 7 of the θ 5 tm results achieved a factory accuracy of 0 03 m 3 m 3 appendix b the 5tm soil moisture sensors had significant errors in the experiments although they could capture the trend of the dynamic changes in θ after the linear calibration of the lcm the results of all experimental data showed that its r improved from 0 95 to 0 99 and its accuracy improved from 0 051 m 3 m 3 to 0 017 m 3 m 3 table 1 the lcm effectively reduced the bias of 5tm sensor measurements the accuracy of θ 5 tm was not stable with a high measurement accuracy in low θ environments and a significant decrease in measurement accuracy at high θ fig 4 the bias of the θ 5 tm at five sites haibei jiangshanjiao qiyang nanjing and naqu exceeded 0 1 m 3 m 3 at the θ of 0 4 m 3 m 3 combined with the soil properties it was found that all five sites had high som among which the clay content was higher at the qiyang site and the sand content was also higher at the naqu site at the θ of 0 15 m 3 m 3 the haibei and jiangshanjiao sites also had bias of 0 046 m 3 m 3 and 0 045 m 3 m 3 respectively this instability may be caused by a variety of soil properties of soil samples from 17 sites at different depths indicating that a combination of multiple soil properties is necessary to calibrate the 5tm soil moisture sensor 3 2 comparison of 5tm measured and ccm calibrated soil moisture as shown in fig 4 a variety of soil properties had different effects on the 5tm soil moisture sensors at 17 sites thus it is necessary to propose a common calibration model ccm to comprehensively consider the effects of various soil properties on measured θ values this study incorporated a variety of soil properties by establishing a multiple regression relationship between soil properties and lcm coefficients a lcm and b lcm the coefficients a ccm and b ccm were calculated using eq 4 and the coefficients and constants α 1 α 5 and β are listed in table 2 because of the strong negative correlation between sand and silt content in the soil samples sand was not used in the fitting process fig 5b c g and h the ccm coefficients showed strong correlations compared to the lcm coefficients supporting the accuracy of this method fig 6 the r values of the coefficient a ccm was 0 99 and b ccm was 0 38 rmse were 0 126 and 0 023 respectively lcm and ccm improved the accuracy of θ 5 tm after calibration with the ccm the bias of θ 5 tm was reduced from 0 03 m 3 m 3 to 0 001 m 3 m 3 although the accuracy of θ ccm was slightly lower than θ lcm θ ccm was markedly better than uncalibrated θ 5 tm the rmse for θ 5 tm was 0 051 m 3 m 3 for all samples of 17 sites while θ lcm and θ ccm had similar accuracy of 0 017 m 3 m 3 and 0 02 m 3 m 3 respectively table 1 the uncalibrated θ 5 tm significantly underestimated θ by 0 085 m 3 m 3 when θ was 0 4 m 3 m 3 fig 7a after calibration of θ 5 tm θ lcm and θ ccm showed high accuracy and strong correlations fig 7b and c the ccm calibrated with soil properties can almost replace the lcm in soil specific calibration experiments 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic correction considering vertical heterogeneity of soil properties the soil properties differed between the four depths i e 5 10 20 and 40 cm at most of the 17 sites clay and salinity content increased with increasing soil depth whereas the content of sand and som showed the opposite trend fig 2 this indicated regular vertical heterogeneity of soil properties the calibration of θ using soil properties corresponding to the depth can effectively improve calibration accuracy at different depths compared with θ 5 tm this calibration method improved the accuracy of θ ccm by 60 8 the improvement in the measurement accuracy differed between soil samples at different sites and depths fig 8 shows the accuracy results of θ ccm and θ 5 tm compared at 17 sites at different depths a factory accuracy of 0 03 m 3 m 3 was used as the reference standard and θ 5 tm had the lowest accuracy in the surface layer 5 cm with only seven sites achieving this accuracy a comparison of the four depths measurements showed that accuracy increased with depth regarding calibration results of the deeper layer 40 cm an accuracy of 0 03 m 3 m 3 was achieved at most sites under the same depth conditions measurement accuracy also differed significantly with respect to soil properties the accuracy of θ 5 tm in the surface layers of the haibei jiangshanjiao and naqu sites was low and accuracy was significantly improved after ccm calibration the θ 5 tm measurement accuracy at the guyuan haibei xilinhaote and qingdao sites improved although they were at factory standard as shown in fig 8 the accuracy of θ at some sites was exceeded 0 03 m 3 m 3 after calibration such as at the naqu site in 5 cm depth guangzhou at 10 cm depth hulunbeier and qingdao in 20 cm depth and haibei and xilinhaote at 40 cm depth the reasons are as follows 1 measurement errors existed in the calibration experiment including human operation errors and sensor measurement errors and 2 differences in soil properties were significantly different from those of other soil samples in the multiple regression process a few extreme points could not be fitted effectively the calibration accuracy results for all depths at each site showed that the measurement errors of the 5tm sensors were related to the geographic environment of the location in addition it is necessary to calibrate soil properties in some areas the haibei and jiangshanjiao sites showed that the equations were not applicable to the factory calibration and the accuracies after the calibration of soil properties exceeded 0 03 m 3 m 3 accuracy index except for the 40 cm layer in haibei the properties of the soil samples from the haibei and jiangshanjiao sites showed high som at all depths this phenomenon demonstrated that som is one of the main factors affecting measurement accuracy 4 2 the measurement error of 5tm increases with soil moisture the results of the lcm and ccm indicated that the rmse and bias of θ 5 tm increased linearly with increasing θ whereas the accuracy of the calibrated θ was stable at different θ states the rmse and bias were 0 1211 m 3 m 3 and 0 1172 m 3 m 3 when θ was approximately 0 4 0 5 m 3 m 3 the accuracy of calibrated θ θ lcm and θ ccm was better than 0 03 m 3 m 3 and the bias was less than 0 02 m 3 m 3 fig 9 the accuracy of θ 5 tm is related to θ and the contribution of fine grained soil clay and silt to ε decreases with increasing θ a comparison of the soil properties of the minqin and xilinhaote sites revealed that low clay content produced high accuracy appendix a however in the relationships between soil properties comparing θ 5 tm and θ ccm separately the ccm using soil properties resulted in a significantly higher consistency of measurement accuracy fig 10 the rmse and bias increased with increasing silt and som content the rmse and bias were unstable when silt content exceeded 75 fig 10 b and g the effect of som on rmse and bias was similarly unstable at less than 5 however at som 5 the error increased significantly with increasing som and r of som with rmse and bias was 0 4 and 0 43 respectively fig 10 d and i the difference was that rmse and bias decreased with increasing sand content when the sand content exceeded 15 but there was no significant correlation when the sand content was less than 15 regarding the relationship between salinity and error rmse and bias decreased in a logarithmic pattern with increasing salinity when salinity was 0 1 it had a stronger effect on the measurement error 4 3 influence of temperature on soil moisture sensors calibration temperature has different effects on ε of bound water and free water in soil for example the amount of bound water released in fine soils clay increases with soil temperature which results in the decrease of soil ε however with a low surface area of soil particles such as in coarse soil sand ε decreases with increasing temperature rosenbaum et al 2011 fares et al 2016 a previous study of temperature calibration of 5tm soil moisture sensors found that θ was underestimated under high temperature and high θ conditions and was overestimated in low θ environments schwartz et al 2019 in the field temperature fluctuations at the soil surface caused by sunlight have a marked effect on ε measurements this study was carried out in the laboratory at 25 c and the results apply only at this room temperature the effects of temperature change should be considered in this calibration process this is a limitation of this study and further respective research will be conducted in the future 5 conclusions the θ values measured by 5tm soil moisture sensors are generally underestimated and it is necessary to improve measurement accuracy in different soil media an lcm was developed by comparing the measured values of the 5tm sensors θ 5 tm with the true values of the gravimetric method θ true after the calibration of lcm θ lcm accuracy was improved by 3 4 compared to that of θ 5 tm despite the high accuracy of the lcm calibration experiments on soil samples require considerable time and manpower this study proposes a ccm based on soil properties the ccm calibration coefficients a ccm and b ccm were calculated by multiple regression of soil properties texture som and salinity and the lcm method coefficients a lcm and b lcm the accuracy of θ ccm calibrated by soil properties improved by 3 1 in the ccm overall the results of this study suggest that ccm using a combination of soil properties is feasible and the accuracy of θ ccm is very close to θ lcm thus it can almost replace specific soil experiments funding this study was supported by grants

9312,accurate measurement of soil moisture θ is key to hydrology and agriculture research soil moisture sensor technology is the predominant method for measuring θ and such measurements are used as a standard for evaluating results from remote sensing and data assimilation therefore improving the θ measurement accuracy of soil moisture sensors is of great significance this study used the capacitance based soil moisture sensor 5tm decagon devices inc as an example to illustrate the necessity of calibration the 5tm soil moisture sensor calculates θ by measuring the dielectric constant ε of the soil medium and ε is affected by soil properties texture salinity soil organic matter etc consequently a common calibration model ccm was developed to calibrate θ from the 5tm sensor by incorporating the soil properties using soil samples collected from 17 sites in 13 provinces in china at 4 different depths first the θ change experiments were conducted in the laboratory for each soil sample second a linear calibration model lcm was applied to calibrate the 5tm measured soil moisture θ 5 tm based on true soil moisture θ true assessed through the gravimetric method the results indicated 1 high correlation coefficient r 0 95 was found for θ 5 tm and θ true but with a high root mean square error rmse of 0 051 m 3 m 3 and a more significant underestimation with increasing θ 2 lcm calibration results θ lcm showed a higher r 0 99 and a lower rmse 0 017 m 3 m 3 finally the ccm was established through relating the lcm coefficients a lcm and b lcm and soil properties based on multiple regression with rmse of 0 126 m 3 m 3 and 0 023 m 3 m 3 for a ccm and b ccm respectively the ccm calibrated result θ ccm showed an rmse of 0 02 m 3 m 3 and r of 0 98 ccm can almost replace lcm in terms of similar accuracy in this study a ccm for soil moisture sensors is proposed which provides a new approach for soil moisture sensor calibration keywords soil moisture content soil organic matter soil texture 5tm sensor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important part of land surface water soil moisture affects the energy exchange between land and atmosphere and has a profound impact on the earth s water cycle and climate change therefore accurately determining soil moisture is a key step in hydrological research guillod et al 2015 mccoll et al 2017 moreover accurate determination of soil moisture can be helpful for research on climate change and surface evapotranspiration as well as for disaster monitoring drought prediction and crop yield estimation seneviratne et al 2010 massari et al 2014 holzman et al 2014 approaches for measuring soil moisture content θ mainly include ground observation remote sensing inversion and data assimilation methods jackson 1993 robinson et al 2008 ground observation methods are most accurate for measuring θ but they are cost intensive and it is difficult to determine θ on a wide spatial scale or globally seneviratne et al 2010 compared with ground observation methods remote sensing has the advantage of continuous spatial coverage however there are still uncertainties regarding soil moisture inversion schmugge et al 2002 wagner et al 2007 data assimilation methods can be used to determine θ in deep soil layers but require large amounts of driven datasets vereecken et al 2008 ground observation is very important because of its high accuracy and the respective results are commonly used to validate and calibrate remote sensing and data assimilation based θ measurements robock et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2010 ground observation approaches mainly include 1 gravimetric measurements which destroy the original soil structure and thus preclude continuous monitoring of θ at the same location robinson et al 2008 seneviratne et al 2010 2 measurements using hand held devices which facilitates verification on the soil surface but makes it difficult to measure θ at multiple depths and 3 automatic observation stations which are suitable for continuous monitoring at multiple depths dean et al 1987 establishing a θ monitoring network is a common approach to measuring θ at a regional scale observation networks typically rely on numerous observation points and soil moisture sensors to measure and store real time data including soil moisture and temperature for example the international soil moisture network ismn and the ecohydrological wireless sensor network ehwsn dorigo et al 2011 vaz et al 2013 time domain reflectometry tdr and capacitance measurement are two common methods used in observation networks cassel et al 1994 topp and reynolds 1998 fares and polyakov 2006 robinson et al 2008 tdr sensors are typically operated at a higher measurement frequency and provide higher accuracy capacity based sensors with smaller probes are cheaper than tdr sensors and are widely used in monitoring networks robinson et al 2008 seneviratne et al 2010 both technologies assess θ based on the dielectric constant ε in the soil medium arulanandan 1991 mittelbach et al 2011 the ε is affected by θ and by the combined effects of soil texture salinity soil organic matter som bulk density and soil temperature topp et al 1980 however factory calibration equations typically do not simultaneously consider the effects of these factors when soil properties at the sensor installation locations differ from the factory calibrated soil properties measurement accuracy is considerably reduced bircher et al 2015 kim et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the relationship between ε and θ varies markedly with different soil properties and ε of fine grained soil is significantly lower than that of coarse grained soil at the same θ a high fine grained soil content increases the surface area of soil particles thus the bound water content is higher than that in coarse grained soils jacobsen and schjønning 1993 topp et al 1980 proposed an equation for ε and θ in soil samples from sandy loam to heavy clay however the relationship between ε and different soil properties has not been explored kim et al 2020 evaluated and calibrated six soil moisture sensors in sandy loam soils to improve their accuracy from 0 04 to 0 025 m 3 m 3 however it is difficult to generalize the results to other areas bircher et al 2015 demonstrated a significant deviation in measured θ in organic rich soils som 30 but the factory calibration formula was reliable at som 10 high soil salinity leads to an overestimation of ε mainly because there are more free electrolytes in the soil medium noborio et al 1994 bellingham 2007 fares et al 2009 skierucha 2000 obtained the responses of the tdr sensor to θ in mineral soil organic soil and soil mixtures of peat silt and peat sand using the gravimetric method where the effects of different bulk densities on ε used in the tdr sensor calibration equations reduced the measurement error by a factor of two hence soil moisture sensors must be calibrated with respect to the specific soil properties parvin and degré 2016 however these studies did not consider the combined effects of various soil properties on the evaluation and calibration of soil moisture sensors factory calibration errors of soil moisture sensors are not effectively solved resulting in the reduced applicability and generalizability of the calibration equations many previous studies on soil dielectric models accounted for the effects of soil properties on ε wang and schmugge 1980 dobson 1985 and mironov et al 2009 considered that soil is composed of four components free water combined water solids and air their models calculate ε of the soil medium by summing the weighted ε of each component jin et al 2017 wang s model indicated that free water and bound water exert different effects on ε wang and schmugge 1980 dobson s model combined the contributions of free and bound water in the soil to ε dobson 1985 the minronov s model also considers the influence of clay content on ε mironov et al 2009 liu et al 2014 established a semi empirical dielectric model with som as the input based on the minronov et al model szypłowska et al 2021 proposed a dielectric model considering the influence of som on ε with som ranging from 0 1 to 21 1 however the model s performance depends not only on texture and som of the soil sample but also on the variation in conductivity due to salinity wei et al 2017 improved the semi empirical medium mixing model by introducing soil salinity into the dobson model based on experimental data therefore the existing research results regarding soil properties and ε in dielectric models should be fully utilized and a common calibration model ccm for soil moisture sensors integrating various soil properties should be developed the objective of this study was to propose a ccm for soil moisture sensors applicable to natural soils and to improve θ measurement accuracy by considering the effects of various soil properties on ε this paper includes the following aspects 1 obtaining measured θ values of soil moisture sensors under different θ conditions through calibration experiments and calibrating them using a linear calibration model lcm 2 analyzing the relationship between soil properties and linear calibration model coefficients and

of temperature was 40 50 c at 1 c accuracy the size of the 5tm sensor was 10 3 2 0 7 cm length width depth and probe length was 5 cm the electrical properties of ε differ with regard to soil texture salinity and som and the 5tm sensor had a factory calibration error of approximately 3 4 in general mineral media this error can be reduced to 1 2 after calibration for specific soil types decagon devices inc 2010 θ was calculated using topp s equation after measuring ε at a frequency of 70 mhz eq 1 1 θ a ε a 3 b ε a 2 c ε a d where coefficient a is 4 3 10 6 b is 5 5 10 4 c is 2 92 10 2 and d is 5 3 10 2 topp et al 1980 bellingham 2007 2 2 2 experimental design and process to calibrate and improve the measurement accuracy of the 5tm soil moisture sensor a calibration experiment was designed to simulate measurements at different moisture contents under various soil properties the calibration experiment was a process of seven steps and simulated θ of soil samples from dry to saturated 1 soil samples were passed through a 5 mm sieve to remove structures such as rocks and plants the soil samples were oven dried at 75 c until constant weight and higher temperatures were avoided to prevent excessive destruction of the som then 2 3 weight water was added to the soil samples of step 1 fig 3a and 3 soil samples were homogenized thereafter fig 3b 4 three 5tm sensors were used to record 5 6 measurements 2 min each the 5tm sensors were kept at sufficient distance to each other to avoid interference the average measurement values of the three 5tm sensors are shown in fig 3c 5 soil samples were collected from the locations where the sensors had been inserted and the true θ values were measured using the gravimetric method fig 3d 6 the soil samples were added to maintain constant weight to facilitate the addition of 3 water the weight of the added soil sample was equal to that of the gravimetric samples 7 steps 2 6 were repeated until θ of the soil sample indicated saturation calibration experiments were conducted using soil samples from four depths at 17 sites owing to the differences in soil properties and vertical heterogeneity at different sites the water saturation of soil samples also differed therefore the number of simulated θ gradients varied in calibration experiments with different soil samples in the calibration experiment 7 12 θ gradients were used based on the θ state of the soil samples a total of 611 simulations and gravimetric sample collections were performed for all soil samples from the 17 sites in the calibration experiment 2 3 calibration methods 2 3 1 linear calibration model lcm after calibration experiments at 17 sites the θ values of the 5tm sensor measurements θ 5 tm and gravimetric method measurements θ true were obtained it was found that the θ 5 tm had a favorable linear relationship with θ true in all soil samples the θ 5 tm values of the jingyuetan guyuan hefei minqin and qingdao sites were relatively close to θ true during the calibration experiments from dry soil to saturation the rmse range was approximately 0 008 0 049 m 3 m 3 and bias range was approximately 0 033 0 017 m 3 m 3 however θ was markedly underestimated at the haibei jiangshanjiao hulunbeier yucheng nanjing and naqu sites the maximum values of rmse and bias were 0 13 m 3 m 3 and 0 11 m 3 m 3 respectively fig 4 despite the underestimation of θ 5 tm there was a favorable linear relationship between θ 5 tm and θ true for the 17 sites with all correlation coefficients r exceeding 0 93 appendix b therefore it is feasible to calibrate θ 5 tm using a linear model the calibration process for the lcm was as follows 1 the coefficients of lcm a lcm and b lcm were determined by integrating θ 5 tm and θ true into eq 2 each soil sample had its own calibration coefficient for θ 5 tm in eq 2 θ 5 tm is the independent variable θ true is the dependent variable 2 the θ value of the lcm θ lcm was calculated using eq 3 and the coefficients a lcm and b lcm were used for θ 5 tm 2 θ true i j k a lcm i j θ 5 tm i j k b lcm i j 3 θ lcm i j k a lcm i j θ 5 tm i j k b lcm i j where a lcm and b lcm are coefficients in lcm i j k represent different sites with a range of 1 17 soil samples at different depths with a range of 1 4 and soil samples with different θ in the calibration experiments with a range of 1 12 2 3 2 common calibration model ccm the lcm can effectively improve the accuracy of θ 5 tm but it is not suitable for calibration with respect to large scale regions owing to the large workload of calibration experiments the ccm was proposed to make the calibration method of soil moisture sensors more convenient and scientific after normalizing the soil properties the correlations showed that the soil properties exerted different significant effects on a lcm and b lcm which showed a positive correlation with clay and silt content but a negative correlation with sand content a lcm was negatively correlated with salinity and b lcm showed a strong positive correlation with som fig 5 the soil properties were considered to have different fitting relationships for a lcm and b lcm therefore a lcm and b lcm can be expressed using the weighted relationships between soil texture som and salinity eq 4 the weighting coefficients and constants of the soil properties α 1 α 5 and β indicate the magnitude of the contribution of different soil properties to ε the relationships between soil properties and lcm coefficients were calculated for all soil samples from the 17 sites by applying multiple regression methods for quantification appendix a the α 1 α 5 and β incorporated a variety of soil properties to obtain the coefficients a ccm and b ccm to achieve a common calibration model the θ in the ccm method θ ccm was calculated using eq 5 4 y α 1 clay α 2 silt α 3 sand α 4 som α 5 salinity β 5 θ ccm i j k a ccm θ 5 tm i j k b ccm where y is the coefficient of the two calibration methods a lcm b lcm a ccm and b ccm α i is the coefficient of the soil properties and β is a constant the i j k represent different sites layers and gradients respectively 2 4 evaluation indicators three statistical indicators were used to quantify the accuracy of the two calibration models rmse bias and r the rmse was used to describe the accuracy error between the calibrated and true values eq 6 the bias was used to measure the deviation of the overall calibration results eq 7 r describes the linear correlation between the calibrated and true values eq 8 6 rmse e sm m sm true 2 7 bias e sm m e sm true 8 r i 1 n sm m i e sm m sm true i e sm true i 1 n sm m i e sm m 2 i 1 n sm true i e sm true 2 where e is the mean value sm m is the measured value of the 5tm sensors θ 5 tm or calibration values θ lcm and θ ccm and sm true is the gravimetric method value θ true 3 results 3 1 comparison of 5tm measured and lcm calibrated soil moisture the calibration results showed that θ 5 tm was widely underestimated as demonstrated by a total of 611 datasets for soil samples from 17 sites in the calibration experiment the underestimation of θ 5 tm was evident with an increase in θ fig 4 only 39 7 of the θ 5 tm results achieved a factory accuracy of 0 03 m 3 m 3 appendix b the 5tm soil moisture sensors had significant errors in the experiments although they could capture the trend of the dynamic changes in θ after the linear calibration of the lcm the results of all experimental data showed that its r improved from 0 95 to 0 99 and its accuracy improved from 0 051 m 3 m 3 to 0 017 m 3 m 3 table 1 the lcm effectively reduced the bias of 5tm sensor measurements the accuracy of θ 5 tm was not stable with a high measurement accuracy in low θ environments and a significant decrease in measurement accuracy at high θ fig 4 the bias of the θ 5 tm at five sites haibei jiangshanjiao qiyang nanjing and naqu exceeded 0 1 m 3 m 3 at the θ of 0 4 m 3 m 3 combined with the soil properties it was found that all five sites had high som among which the clay content was higher at the qiyang site and the sand content was also higher at the naqu site at the θ of 0 15 m 3 m 3 the haibei and jiangshanjiao sites also had bias of 0 046 m 3 m 3 and 0 045 m 3 m 3 respectively this instability may be caused by a variety of soil properties of soil samples from 17 sites at different depths indicating that a combination of multiple soil properties is necessary to calibrate the 5tm soil moisture sensor 3 2 comparison of 5tm measured and ccm calibrated soil moisture as shown in fig 4 a variety of soil properties had different effects on the 5tm soil moisture sensors at 17 sites thus it is necessary to propose a common calibration model ccm to comprehensively consider the effects of various soil properties on measured θ values this study incorporated a variety of soil properties by establishing a multiple regression relationship between soil properties and lcm coefficients a lcm and b lcm the coefficients a ccm and b ccm were calculated using eq 4 and the coefficients and constants α 1 α 5 and β are listed in table 2 because of the strong negative correlation between sand and silt content in the soil samples sand was not used in the fitting process fig 5b c g and h the ccm coefficients showed strong correlations compared to the lcm coefficients supporting the accuracy of this method fig 6 the r values of the coefficient a ccm was 0 99 and b ccm was 0 38 rmse were 0 126 and 0 023 respectively lcm and ccm improved the accuracy of θ 5 tm after calibration with the ccm the bias of θ 5 tm was reduced from 0 03 m 3 m 3 to 0 001 m 3 m 3 although the accuracy of θ ccm was slightly lower than θ lcm θ ccm was markedly better than uncalibrated θ 5 tm the rmse for θ 5 tm was 0 051 m 3 m 3 for all samples of 17 sites while θ lcm and θ ccm had similar accuracy of 0 017 m 3 m 3 and 0 02 m 3 m 3 respectively table 1 the uncalibrated θ 5 tm significantly underestimated θ by 0 085 m 3 m 3 when θ was 0 4 m 3 m 3 fig 7a after calibration of θ 5 tm θ lcm and θ ccm showed high accuracy and strong correlations fig 7b and c the ccm calibrated with soil properties can almost replace the lcm in soil specific calibration experiments 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic correction considering vertical heterogeneity of soil properties the soil properties differed between the four depths i e 5 10 20 and 40 cm at most of the 17 sites clay and salinity content increased with increasing soil depth whereas the content of sand and som showed the opposite trend fig 2 this indicated regular vertical heterogeneity of soil properties the calibration of θ using soil properties corresponding to the depth can effectively improve calibration accuracy at different depths compared with θ 5 tm this calibration method improved the accuracy of θ ccm by 60 8 the improvement in the measurement accuracy differed between soil samples at different sites and depths fig 8 shows the accuracy results of θ ccm and θ 5 tm compared at 17 sites at different depths a factory accuracy of 0 03 m 3 m 3 was used as the reference standard and θ 5 tm had the lowest accuracy in the surface layer 5 cm with only seven sites achieving this accuracy a comparison of the four depths measurements showed that accuracy increased with depth regarding calibration results of the deeper layer 40 cm an accuracy of 0 03 m 3 m 3 was achieved at most sites under the same depth conditions measurement accuracy also differed significantly with respect to soil properties the accuracy of θ 5 tm in the surface layers of the haibei jiangshanjiao and naqu sites was low and accuracy was significantly improved after ccm calibration the θ 5 tm measurement accuracy at the guyuan haibei xilinhaote and qingdao sites improved although they were at factory standard as shown in fig 8 the accuracy of θ at some sites was exceeded 0 03 m 3 m 3 after calibration such as at the naqu site in 5 cm depth guangzhou at 10 cm depth hulunbeier and qingdao in 20 cm depth and haibei and xilinhaote at 40 cm depth the reasons are as follows 1 measurement errors existed in the calibration experiment including human operation errors and sensor measurement errors and 2 differences in soil properties were significantly different from those of other soil samples in the multiple regression process a few extreme points could not be fitted effectively the calibration accuracy results for all depths at each site showed that the measurement errors of the 5tm sensors were related to the geographic environment of the location in addition it is necessary to calibrate soil properties in some areas the haibei and jiangshanjiao sites showed that the equations were not applicable to the factory calibration and the accuracies after the calibration of soil properties exceeded 0 03 m 3 m 3 accuracy index except for the 40 cm layer in haibei the properties of the soil samples from the haibei and jiangshanjiao sites showed high som at all depths this phenomenon demonstrated that som is one of the main factors affecting measurement accuracy 4 2 the measurement error of 5tm increases with soil moisture the results of the lcm and ccm indicated that the rmse and bias of θ 5 tm increased linearly with increasing θ whereas the accuracy of the calibrated θ was stable at different θ states the rmse and bias were 0 1211 m 3 m 3 and 0 1172 m 3 m 3 when θ was approximately 0 4 0 5 m 3 m 3 the accuracy of calibrated θ θ lcm and θ ccm was better than 0 03 m 3 m 3 and the bias was less than 0 02 m 3 m 3 fig 9 the accuracy of θ 5 tm is related to θ and the contribution of fine grained soil clay and silt to ε decreases with increasing θ a comparison of the soil properties of the minqin and xilinhaote sites revealed that low clay content produced high accuracy appendix a however in the relationships between soil properties comparing θ 5 tm and θ ccm separately the ccm using soil properties resulted in a significantly higher consistency of measurement accuracy fig 10 the rmse and bias increased with increasing silt and som content the rmse and bias were unstable when silt content exceeded 75 fig 10 b and g the effect of som on rmse and bias was similarly unstable at less than 5 however at som 5 the error increased significantly with increasing som and r of som with rmse and bias was 0 4 and 0 43 respectively fig 10 d and i the difference was that rmse and bias decreased with increasing sand content when the sand content exceeded 15 but there was no significant correlation when the sand content was less than 15 regarding the relationship between salinity and error rmse and bias decreased in a logarithmic pattern with increasing salinity when salinity was 0 1 it had a stronger effect on the measurement error 4 3 influence of temperature on soil moisture sensors calibration temperature has different effects on ε of bound water and free water in soil for example the amount of bound water released in fine soils clay increases with soil temperature which results in the decrease of soil ε however with a low surface area of soil particles such as in coarse soil sand ε decreases with increasing temperature rosenbaum et al 2011 fares et al 2016 a previous study of temperature calibration of 5tm soil moisture sensors found that θ was underestimated under high temperature and high θ conditions and was overestimated in low θ environments schwartz et al 2019 in the field temperature fluctuations at the soil surface caused by sunlight have a marked effect on ε measurements this study was carried out in the laboratory at 25 c and the results apply only at this room temperature the effects of temperature change should be considered in this calibration process this is a limitation of this study and further respective research will be conducted in the future 5 conclusions the θ values measured by 5tm soil moisture sensors are generally underestimated and it is necessary to improve measurement accuracy in different soil media an lcm was developed by comparing the measured values of the 5tm sensors θ 5 tm with the true values of the gravimetric method θ true after the calibration of lcm θ lcm accuracy was improved by 3 4 compared to that of θ 5 tm despite the high accuracy of the lcm calibration experiments on soil samples require considerable time and manpower this study proposes a ccm based on soil properties the ccm calibration coefficients a ccm and b ccm were calculated by multiple regression of soil properties texture som and salinity and the lcm method coefficients a lcm and b lcm the accuracy of θ ccm calibrated by soil properties improved by 3 1 in the ccm overall the results of this study suggest that ccm using a combination of soil properties is feasible and the accuracy of θ ccm is very close to θ lcm thus it can almost replace specific soil experiments funding this study was supported by grants

9313,cascade cropping systems in soilless horticulture where drainage collected from the main crop is used in fertigation of secondary crops are potentially interesting for mediterranean countries as they enhance water and nutrient use efficiency however their agronomic and long term environmental impact has been poorly addressed in this case study lettuce grown hydroponically or in soil previously exposed to drainage for five years was fertigated throughout the cultivation period with a nutrient solution composed of 0 25 50 or 100 of drainage 0d 25d 50d and 100d mixed with a fresh nutrient solution plant performance analysis included growth parameters and leaf mineral composition drainage was analyzed for nutrients and plant protection products ppp residues and bioassays were performed exposing aquatic organisms raphidocelis subcapitata aliivibrio fischeri and daphnia magna to drainage and soil elutriate when analyzing plant performance in both cultivation systems a significant effect was only found at 100d in hydroponics resulting in 41 less leaf area 20 smaller head diameter and 43 lower yield drainage analysis showed high nutrient content presence of ppp residues up to 6 substances reaching 3 29 µg l 1 in total and revealed toxicity to d magna ec50 66 6 moreover soil elutriate presented toxicity to r subcapitata ec50 20 6 and to a fischeri ec50 14 9 this study demonstrates the potential of using relatively high drainage percentages up to 50 from soilless cultivation systems if applied to hydroponically grown secondary crops however attention should be paid to the use of cascade cropping systems when drainages are applied to fertigate soil grown crops as it may contribute to soil degradation and environmental pollution on a long run graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecotoxicity horticulture lactuca sativa l nutrient emission plant protection products emission water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction when growing horticultural crops without soil so called soilless cultivation plants can be supplied with a nutrient solution directly circulating in the root zone hydroponic cultivation or through the fertigation of an organic e g peat moss coir or pinetree bark or inorganic e g rockwool perlite or vermiculite substrate the use of soilless production systems are becoming increasingly common in the horticultural sector worldwide due to i the ease of implementation in places without suitable soils for agriculture including contaminated soils salinized soils etc ii need to avoid soil borne pathogens often as a result of monoculture practices without crop rotation and iii the highest efficiency in using resources such as water nutrients and plant protection products ppp putra and yuliando 2015 the soilless cultivation systems are also often divided in two main categories concerning the use or not of the drainage closed or open irrigation systems respectively thus when plants are grown in substrate the supply of nutrient solution i e fertigation with water and nutrients is intentionally excessive in order to avoid the accumulation of salts at the root zone giuffrida et al 2003 this surplus that drains through the substrate hereafter referred as drainage commonly reaches 30 40 of the fertigation volume so its reuse is desirable from an economic and environmental point of view kooten et al 2004 actually closed irrigation systems with recirculation of drainages are mandatory in the netherlands since 2002 stanghellini et al 2005 van der salm et al 2020 due to the high risk of eutrophication of freshwater reservoirs other central and northern european countries have also been taking measures against drainage emissions from greenhouses for instance in belgium their discharges are not allowed since 2006 van der salm et al 2020 besides this clear environmental benefit of the closed irrigation systems they also have a greater performance in terms of resources use efficiency namely water and fertilizers as they are reused conceptually the implementation of closed systems is not complicated since the drainages can be easily collected in reservoirs from where they are pumped back to the fertigation system after being disinfected bar yosef 2008 savvas et al 2013 this disinfection procedure reduces the risks of disease dissemination but also has the advantage of converting hazardous contaminants into non hazardous contaminants or less toxic compounds that are more stable less mobile and or inert zheng 2018 nevertheless in several regions of the world with low abundance of good quality water and where a less technologically based horticulture prevails the so called open systems with drainage running freely to the environment are still very common also due to their simplicity and low cost massa et al 2010 katsoulas et al 2014 garcía caparrós et al 2018 mielcarek et al 2019 this is for instance the case of the several mediterranean countries with warmer climate where drainage salinity levels increase more rapidly including portugal santos et al 2017 in those countries the use of closed systems is quite limited particularly due to the higher investment and running costs as well as the need for more technical knowledge for managing crop fertigation and for avoiding root pathogen disease dissemination massa et al 2010 gianquinto et al 2013 one alternative to the open irrigation systems are the semi open systems also called cascade cropping systems in which the drainage from the main crop is collected in reservoirs and further reused for the fertigation of different secondary crops savvas et al 2013 either in greenhouses or open air in land parcels contiguous to the soilless crop muñoz et al 2017 in general those secondary crops have a higher salt tolerance compared with the one at the top of the cascade garcía caparrós et al 2018 moreover they are not from the same family of the main crop reducing the risks of disease dissemination and therefore growers often do not invest in drainage disinfection systems semi open systems have been recommended in the mediterranean region mainly because of the water and nutrient savings several experiments have been using this typology of production system either in soil or soilless production and the performance of plants receiving the drainage treatments has been compared with fertigation using fresh nutrient solutions used as control for example incrocci et al 2003 showed that drainages from tomato cultivated in rockwool when diluted with water in a 3 1 proportion could be used for fertigation of the more salt tolerant cherry tomato grown in nutrient film technique nft but a yield reduction of 25 in cherry tomato was registered garcía caparrós et al 2018 proposed reusing drainage from horticultural crops in the fertigation of ornamental crops after testing the application of drainage from melon cucumis melo cultivated in coir in the growth of rosemary rosmarinus officinalis cultivated in a mixture of sphagnum peat moss and perlite despite recording yield reductions of up to 36 in drainage fertigated rosemary plants either when drainage was applied directly 100 or after being blended with mains water 50 the authors recommended this strategy because of the water savings 18 and nutrient removal from the drainages recently muñoz et al 2017 performed an experiment in which drainage from greenhouse tomato grown in perlite was used without dilutions in an open field rotation sequence consisting in growing lettuce tomato and endive in soil the authors only observed decreased marketable yield in lettuce 15 whereas no effect of drainage was found for the other crops therefore although yield reductions can occur due to drainage use such drawbacks have been referred as being clearly compensated by the increased water and nutrient use efficiency that these systems represent being considered economically and most of all environmentally relevant incrocci et al 2003 muñoz et al 2017 garcía caparrós et al 2018 nonetheless the assessment of the suitability of semi open systems has been essentially focused on yield parameters and quantification of savings in terms of water and nutrients whereas the prolonged effects of drainage on soil quality and food safety e g nitrate content remain to be documented and clarified the present study aimed at i assessing the effect on plant performance and product quality of using different drainage percentages mixed with fresh nutrient solution for the fertigation in a cascade cropping system and ii analyzing the potential environmental risk of long term drainage emission to the environment through an ecotoxicological approach to this end lettuce was grown in two production systems hydroponics and in a soil with long exposure to drainages being irrigated with nutrient solutions composed of different percentages of drainage 0 control 25 50 and 100 obtained from a commercial strawberry farm with a semi open soilless production system lettuce was chosen as a model crop due to its economic importance moderate sensitiveness to salinity and propensity to accumulate nitrate in the leaves which is an aspect of particular importance in leafy vegetables regarding human health gent 2003 machado and serralheiro 2017 xavier et al 2018 this study was developed within the scope of the eu project agrinupes www agrinupes eu whose main objective is to improve fertigation management supporting the growers and authorities in achieving higher sustainability in the horticultural sector 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant growth conditions and experimental setup peat root blocked plantlets of batavia type green lettuce lactuca sativa alision rijk zwaan portugal lda were obtained from a local plant nursery with approximately 8 cm height and 8 leaves 1 cm these plants were used to conduct two simultaneous experiments from 27

sensing system wisecrop porto portugal the experimental layout was a completely randomized block design with three independent replicates per treatment each replicate was composed of five or two plants respectively for exp 1 and 2 thus in exp 1 twelve independent nft systems 4 fertigation treatments 3 replicates were constructed with pvc tubes each system having a reservoir with rubber hoses and one pump set to 150 l h 1 into each tube for recirculation of the fertigation solutions the tubes were installed with a 3 slope and planting was performed at 25 plants m 2 after root washing with deionized water to remove substrate residues in exp 2 plants were grown in plastic pots 4 fertigation treatments 3 replicates of 7 3 l each 380 160 120 mm two plantlets were planted per pot leading to a plant density of 25 plants m 2 pots were prepared with 1 cm layer of a commercial volcanic gravel at the bottom and filled up with soil obtained from a commercial greenhouse and which had been exposed to drainages from a soilless cultivation system for five years the soil was first air dried at room temperature for five days and sieved 4 mm and further mixed and humidified with deionized water to reach about 60 of its maximum water holding capacity whcmax pots were placed in the greenhouse contiguously to the nft systems in both experiments plants were acclimated for four days with all treatments receiving a nutrient solution with an electrical conductivity ec of 1 5 ds m 1 and ph of 6 2 thereafter fertigation treatments were implemented until harvest i e more 28 days in the nft system exp 1 the aerated nutrient solution was permanently in contact with the root zone during the cultivation period to avoid nutrient depletion as the crop was growing the solution in the

different percentages of drainage with fns 0d 25d 50d and 100d were prepared as follows the drainages were obtained from a commercial grower that produced strawberry main crop in a semi open soilless system cascade system in that farm plants were cultivated in substrate mixture of coco peat blond peat and coconut fiber and the drainage was collected and stored in a reservoir being further reused for the fertigation of several secondary horticultural crops cultivated in soil within a greenhouse for our trials drainage was collected from the tubing system before reaching the reservoir installed at the commercial farm owed to logistic limitations this was done in two different periods corresponding to batch 1 and batch 2 which also allowed to evaluate the possible variation existing in these solutions batch 1 was used during the first half of the experiments from 31 may to 11 june acclimatation period excluded and batch 2 was used during the second half from 12 to 27 june for each batch 200 l of drainage were collected in plastic jerry cans for the preparation of the fertigation treatments one sample of 400 ml was collected in a glass bottle for the ecotoxicological assays

and stems in the plants from hydroponics leaf na concentration of lettuce from hydroponics and leaf mg concentration in the plants from both experiments the correspondent statistical analysis for those exceptions is mentioned along the text and tables 3 results 3 1 drainage analysis nutrients and ppp residues following the chemical analysis of the drainage from both batches the greatest differences were found in the total nitrogen and magnesium levels the concentrations of these elements in batch 1 were respectively 2 19 and 1 65 times higher than those for batch 2 in contrast batch 1 had a lower zinc concentration being below the detection limit table 1 concerning the ppp residues of the drainages table 2 six active ingredients were detected in batch 1 drainage accounting for a total concentration of ppp of 3 29 µg l 1 including four fungicides azoxystrobin boscalid myclobutanil and pyraclostrobin and two insecticides chlorpyrifos ethyl and dimethoate boscalid was the substance found at highest concentration in batch 2 only three active ingredients were detected totalizing 0 62 µg l 1 all of them being fungicides abamectin acrinathrin clofentezine difenoconazole formetanate lufenuron methiocarb spinosad and trifloxystrobin were not detected in both drainage batches 3 2 plant growth parameters the effect of the drainage percentage on the studied plant growth parameters was clearly dependent on the lettuce production system table 3 in plants grown in hydroponics it significantly affected la f 3 11 5 838 p 0 021 ø head h 3 8 465 p 0 037 and yield f 3 11 8 395 p 0 007 however significant differences were only found when comparing control plants with plants irrigated with 100d although in the latter plants the tdw including roots was not significantly affected the leaf sink strength was significantly lower lower dry matter partitioning to the leaves for 100d in hydroponics table 4 which resulted in significantly lower la 41 decrease ø head 20 decrease and crop yield 43 decrease in contrast lettuce grown in soil and irrigated with different percentages of drainage showed no significant differences in all the studied plant growth parameters table 3 when analyzing in more detail the dry matter partitioning in plants from exp 2 the effect of drainage incorporation f 3 11 16 311 p 0 001 translated to a significantly higher percentage of leaf dry matter in plants from 100d more 15 as compared with control plants table 4 finally although it was not the focus of this study it is important to notice that plants cultivated hydroponically had a generalized higher growth rate as compared to the ones cultivated in the soil system table 3 3 3 leaf mineral composition the foliar analyses revealed that the drainage percentage changed the mineral composition of the leaf tissues in both experiments but to a greater extent in plants grown hydroponically table 5 as it significantly affected nine out of the 15 studied minerals whereas in the soil system only four minerals were significantly influenced for instance in hydroponics the drainage percentage affected both the leaf nitrate f 3 11 10 795 p 0 001 and total nitrogen concentrations f 3 11 35 445 p 0 001 leaf nitrate reached its highest level in 0d grown lettuce 2 46 0 13 g kg 1 fw and this parameter was significantly lower in all treatments with drainage incorporated in the nutrient solution ranging from 31 to 51 decrease compared with the control on the contrary in the soil experiment neither the nitrate nor the total nitrogen concentrations in leaves were affected by the drainage percentage regarding other macronutrients the drainage percentage significantly affected the concentration of sulfur in both experiments the magnesium concentration was only affected in plants from hydroponics and the phosphorus concentration was only affected in plants from the soil experiment the most marked changes occurred in the micronutrients content for example in hydroponics the drainage percentage increased the concentration of molybdenum above factor 3 3 5 fold in 100d and 4 8 fold in 50d and copper and zinc practically doubled in treatment 100d when compared with the control in contrast the manganese concentration was significantly lower in all treatments with incorporation of drainage ranging from 28 to 78 decrease compared with the control in the soil experiment the only micronutrient whose concentration was affected by the drainage percentage was boron f 3 11 6 032 p 0 019 which was significantly lower in all treatments with drainage incorporated ranging from 39 to 51 compared with the control the drainage percentage also caused an impact on sodium concentration in both hydroponics h 3 10 385 p 0 016 and soil experiments f 3 11 17 858 p 0 001 but it was only significantly higher at 100d resulting in 63 increase in lettuce grown hydroponically and 47 increase in soil the aluminum concentration was not affected in plants from both experiments 3 4 drainage and soil elutriate analysis ecotoxicological assays when analyzing the average growth rate of the microalgae r subcapitata exposed to increasing percentages of drainage solutions fig 1 a it was found that batch 1 caused a significant stimulation on the growth of the microalgae f 15 20 4 359 p 0 012 from 64 drainage up to 100 drainage levels with a maximum effect of 7 for the non diluted drainage compared with the control i e 0 drainage the batch 2 drainage caused a significant inhibition f 15 20 3 024 p 0 044 on the growth rate 45 decrease but only at the highest concentration tested thus no effective concentrations ec20 and ec50 could be calculated from the data concerning the growth rate of the microalgae when exposed to the soil elutriate it was significantly affected f 15 20 50 775 p 0 001 as a high toxicity to r subcapitata was found already at 41 soil elutriate concentration mixed with mbl medium fig 1 b table 6 summarizes the toxicity endpoints that were estimated in the ecotoxicological assays performed for r subcapitata both batch 1 and batch 2 drainages were non toxic to the microalgae whereas the high toxicity of the soil elutriate was translated in low ec20 6 9 and ec50 20 6 the microtox test showed that the drainages were non toxic to a fischeri since the highest effect observed was a decrease of 10 2 in bioluminescence of the bacteria batch 1 whereas in batch 2 it even increased the bioluminescence highest effect 18 8 nonetheless the soil elutriate revealed to be highly toxic to a fischeri ec50 14 9 relatively to d magna the immobilization test showed that batch 1 drainage significantly affected the cladocerans with high toxicity after 48 h exposure ec20 61 9 ec50 66 6 table 6 despite no significant effect was observed after 24 h data not shown in contrast batch 2 drainage and the soil elutriate were non toxic to d magna 4 discussion 4 1 impact of drainage percentage on plant growth and leaf mineral composition in this study different proportions of drainage obtained from a commercial strawberry semi open soilless cultivation system were incorporated in the fertigation of lettuce grown in two production systems hydroponics and soil to assess its impact on plant development and leaf mineral composition in what regards the potential use of drainage in cascade cropping systems this case study showed that an incorporation as high as 50 treatment 50d combined with fresh nutrient solution has not affected any growth parameter in plants grown in both systems only in treatment 100d in hydroponics it was observed a negative effect on la ø head and yield table 3 since for the generality of crops it is recommended a 20 50 leaching fraction mainly depending on the irradiation levels and crop stage of development giuffrida et al 2003 signore et al 2016 these results alone give good prospects for drainage recycling the cultivation time of the experiments 32 days was sufficient for lettuce from hydroponics to reach a size that could be adequate for their harvest in a commercial production system yücel et al 2013 while in relation to soil cultivation the growth recorded was half of the expected for the same period escobar gutiérrez et al 2002 nicoletto et al 2014 lee et al 2015 this can be possibly related to a phytotoxic potential of the soil as it has been exposed to drainages for five years and had a demonstrated toxic effect in the ecotoxicological tests with the microalgae r subcapitata fig 1 b moreover since lettuce is an acid sensitive crop its yield may also have been affected by the soil acidity ph 5 1 as shown by other authors when lettuce was grown at ph levels below 5 7 hemphill and jackson 1982 rodríguez and flórez 2012 thus sub optimal availability of nutrients to support plant growth might have resulted from the low soil ph since this chemical property largely modulates the dynamics of cations exchange alongside with the existing soil colloids dinkecha and tsegaye 2017 from the analysis of the two drainage batches used in these experiments collected with two weeks interval it was found that they differed substantially in relation to their nutrient profile table 1 this calls the attention to the importance of knowing the drainage composition in a timely and precise manner namely with real time monitoring with reliable sensing systems to support growers in fertigation management as is the main goal of the agrinupes project nowadays most growers basically rely on the ec non discriminatory parameter to roughly assess the overall nutrient content of the drainages in their farms without knowing the nutrient profile of these effluents mishra et al 2020 hence effective monitoring of individual nutrients will also be extremely relevant to increase their confidence in recycling drainages as this perceived variable composition is one of the main limitations santos et al 2017 van der salm et al 2020 another main issue related to recirculation of the nutrient solution has been consistently referred as being the accumulation of sodium and chloride breś 2009 rodríguez and flórez 2012 which are introduced by the water used in their preparation as well as by some substrates lee et al 2018 savvas and gruda 2018 according to schrӧder and lieth 2002 a good quality water for use in closed systems should have an ec below 0 4 ds m 1 and the water used in these experiments ec 0 2 ds m 1 met that criterium in our study it was shown that in both cultivation systems exp 1 and exp 2 the drainage percentage only had a significant impact on the na accumulation in the leaf tissues at 100d table 5 finally sodium accumulation was notably more dependent on the cultivation system than drainage incorporation as na concentrations were clearly higher in the soil grown lettuce than in those from hydroponics even under control conditions in fact na concentrations of lettuce from the soil system were considerably above those reported elsewhere for soil grown lettuce smoleń et al 2015 sofo et al 2016 and it may have been one of the reasons for the overall slow development of the plants from the soil experiment ünlükara et al 2008 machado and serralheiro 2017 despite the variability observed in both exp 1 and exp 2 regarding leaf mineral composition the main highlight was in terms of na in plants from the soil system since the other minerals were within ranges expectable for lettuce fallovo et al 2009 baslam et al 2013 smoleń et al 2015 sofo et al 2016 sönmez et al 2017 at the beginning of the experiment the soil ec was 0 9 ds m 1 thus below the threshold of 1 3 ds m 1 indicated for lettuce but most likely it became increasingly salinized after successive fertigation ünlükara et al 2008 particularly at the highest drainage percentage 100d besides crop yield the validation of using a given percentage of drainage in fertigation has to meet food safety criteria following the eu legislation in this respect monitoring the nitrate content is of utmost importance qiu et al 2014 this is particularly the case in leafy vegetables such as lettuce because the accumulation of nitrate in plants is higher in petioles and leaves when compared to other edible organs such as fruits or tubers umar and iqbal 2007 in lettuce grown under cover the eu regulation no 1258 2011 authorizes a maximum level of 5 g kg 1 of no3 in plants harvested from 1 october to 31 march and 4 g kg 1 in plants harvested from 1 april to 30 september european commission 2011 in our study lettuce was harvested in june and the leaf nitrate content never overcame the limit although it was quite close to the threshold in the case of the soil culture in plants grown hydroponically the nitrate and total n concentrations were significantly lower in all treatments using drainage in their fertigation compared with the control whereas the opposite situation was found concerning leaf mg concentration with the highest levels in plants that received drainage table 5 this was probably due to lesser availability of no3 anions in the drainages compared with the fns possibly intensified by the accumulation of chloride in drainage solutions van der boon et al 1990 additionally significant differences were also observed in terms of leaf concentration of some micronutrients when comparing the control plants with plants that received drainage in their fertigation including mn cu and zn table 5 overall the results show that the composition of the nutrient solution in this case the percentages of drainage incorporated affects the lettuce tissue composition particularly in the hydroponic system which is in accordance with previous studies frezza et al 2005 fallovo et al 2009 song et al 2020 moreover although the mineral composition of the drainage might not match the proportions of the fns as the fns are prepared accordingly to the target crop species following their specific requirements the growth of lettuce was not limited by the lack of any plant nutrient it is well known that cu and al can cause phytotoxicity foy et al 1978 pillay and jonnalagadda 2007 teklić et al 2008 smoleń et al 2015 sönmez et al 2017 in relation to cu which is simultaneously a micronutrient and a ppp despite the drainage percentage significantly increased its concentration in lettuce leaves grown hydroponically it remained within a range also reported in other studies on lettuce mineral composition pillay and jonnalagadda 2007 smoleń et al 2015 sönmez et al 2017 and well below levels that could cause phytotoxicity to this crop teklić et al 2008 in turn the concentration of al was not affected by the drainage percentage 4 2 ecotoxicological assays the ecotoxicological assays revealed distinct aspects associated to both the drainages and to the soil elutriate the drainages were non toxic to r subcapitata and a fischeri table 6 one reason for the non toxicity of the drainages to the microalgae may have been the presence of nutrients which may have masked the toxicity of the ppp residues recorded table 2 nonetheless it is important to notice that those residues were from fungicides and insecticides being present at low concentrations according to ma et al 2006 the most problematic type of ppp to algae are the herbicides given their evolutionary proximity to plants however this type of products are not applied in soilless production systems the species d magna was the test organism more sensitive to the drainages at least for batch 1 table 6 considering that this species is tolerant to salinity as for example martínez jerónimo and martínez jerónimo 2007 reported a lc50 of 5 48 g l 1 of nacl corresponding to a measured conductivity of 9 79 ds m 1 which is well above the conductivity of both batches of drainages the acute toxic effects recorded cannot be attributed to salts in the drainage the mixture of the ppp residues present in the batch 1 may have been responsible for the toxicity to the cladocerans all the aquatic species used in this study are susceptible to metals and fertigation solutions are rich in elements of this typology including those which are plant essential nutrients k ca fe zn and cu and those that end up being introduced into the solutions despite not being desired na and al all these elements are potential contaminants in fresh water and among them zn and cu may be the most problematic ones because they can be detrimental to living organisms suter and tsao 1996 in our study no toxicity to d magna was observed in batch 2 drainage table 6 despite the zn content 0 42 mg l 1 was well above the benchmark indicated by suter and tsao 1996 as lowest chronic value for daphnids 0 047 mg l 1 regarding r subcapitata a significant reduction on their growth was observed when the algae were exposed to batch 2 drainage but only at the highest concentration 100 fig 1 a koukal et al 2003 reported an ec50 of 0 39 mg l 1 of zn for r subcapitata but the authors also showed that zn toxicity was significantly reduced in the presence of humic acids which are often found in hydroponic substrates silber 2019 copper was detected in both drainage batches but at concentrations well below levels that could affect the tested species suter and tsao 1996 horvatić et al 2007 machado and soares 2016 the bacteria a fischeri despite being sensitive to cu and zn can show enhanced bioluminescence when exposed to low levels of those elements cook et al 2000 christofi et al 2002 it has also been referred that in part metal toxicity may be diminished in nutrient rich matrices and with dissolved organic matter due to lesser bioavailability of the toxicants competition between nutrients and toxicants or improved metabolism of the organisms lozano and pratt 1994 loureiro et al 2005 we must bear in mind however that bioavailability of metals changes to a large extent according to ph so the effects of our tested substances could be considerably different in other environments such as natural compartments magalhães et al 2015 conclusions relative to ecotoxicity of drainages from soilless cultivation are challenging given their complex composition generally the nutrient content of the fertigation solutions is known when they are prepared but after draining through the root media their profile may have been greatly altered bar yosef 2008 in accordance with this batch 1 and batch 2 drainages differed substantially either in terms of quantity e g n or absence presence of a given nutrient e g zn the practice of applying ppp via fertigation or the possibility of their residues to accidentally end up in the drainages due to run off after their application by other means to the plants also contribute to the unpredictability of drainage composition alsanius et al 2013 regarding the soil elutriate a higher salt accumulation in the soil particularly of sodium and chloride caused by its long term exposure to drainages for irrigation of the secondary crops may have compromised algae growth savvas and gruda 2018 simmons 2012 exposed r subcapitata formerly pseudokirchneriella subcapitata to different salts recording ec50 values between 1 7 and 5 8 ds m 1 being the microalgae more sensitive to kcl and nacl thus the ec of the elutriate 1 6 ds m 1 suggests that soil salinity may have caused the toxicity observed for r subcapitata despite an imbalance of nutrients may not be disregarded in turn salinity ec of the elutriate cannot be the cause of the toxicity neither to the marine bacteria a fischeri nor to the cladoceran d magna martínez jerónimo and martínez jerónimo 2007 thus suggesting that an imbalance of nutrients or even the presence of ppp in the soil and its mobility to the aqueous phase of the elutriate could have been responsible for its toxicity to both species therefore the ecotoxicological assays with the soil elutriate indicate that long term application of drainage from soilless cultivation to soil might compromise its quality and retention function for contaminants consequently this practice may also represent a risk of pollution of water bodies in the vicinity of the production farms using this fertigation strategy hence ecotoxicological assays may constitute a valuable mean to assess the environmental hazard associated to the emission of drainages from soilless cultivation finally the fact that the drainages were found to be toxic only at concentrations above 50 in the battery of bioassays we performed table 6 suggests they do not represent a risk to the crop itself at least when they were used up to that threshold i e in 25d and 50d fertigation treatments 4 3 importance of guidelines for a proper use of drainage from soilless cultivation in our experiments we utilized drainages from soilless cultivation of strawberry because of the low ec normally applied in this salt sensitive crop saied et al 2005 this way we could utilize them to grow lettuce without dilutions or any further alteration other than the necessary correction of ph moreover strawberry is a crop commonly affected by many pests and diseases sójka et al 2015 so it can be considered a worst case scenario and we expected to find ppp residues in the drainages as it came to be confirmed the cultivation of highly demanding crops such as for example tomato cucumber or rose have been referred as important sources of nutrient emissions to the environment raviv et al 1998 breś 2009 vermeulen et al 2017 savvas and gruda 2018 albeit the drainages from soilless cultivation of strawberry might not be as nutrient rich as drainages from those crops both batch 1 and batch 2 drainages revealed chemical compositions that could contribute to environmental disturbances and pollution including soil degradation if released to the environment obviously this includes their application to agricultural soils the overall results from the ecotoxicological assays highlight the importance of developing guidelines for the use of drainage from soilless cultivation for fertigation of soil grown crops in light of the eu norms liquid effluents of this typology are considered industrial wastewater that need specific authorization for the purpose of irrigation european economic community eec 1991 although the use of wastewaters has been increasingly encouraged in the eu minimum requirements for using drainage from soilless cultivation in fertigation of soil grown crops are yet to be defined as the european directives published to date only state that the use of wastewater should increase and be authorized when the utilization is considered adequate by the member state without objective specifications assigned to industrial wastewater regarding their use as irrigation water european economic community eec 1991 european commission 2000 despite this limitation in the meantime one can take as a reference the emission limit values elv for n and p in wastewaters that stablish minimum requirement for their release to soils and water bodies according to the decree law no 236 98 of the portuguese legislation ministério do ambiente 1998 the elv in portugal for n is 15 mg l 1 and the elv for p is 10 mg l 1 considering these thresholds the total n was 7 1 fold and 3 3 fold higher than the elv in batch 1 and batch 2 drainages respectively and the p content was 5 fold and 6 5 fold above the limit in batch 1 and batch 2 respectively further evidencing the problem of using cascade cropping systems combining soilless and soil cultivation without clear guidelines that could prevent pollution 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that combines an agronomic with an ecotoxicological approach to perform a comprehensive analysis of the implications of implementing cascade cropping systems taking into account the plant growth parameters and yield this study showed the potential of incorporating high drainage percentages up to 50 from soilless cultivation in the fertigation of secondary crops nevertheless this practice should be combined with a systematic and dynamic monitoring of the chemical composition of the mixed nutrient solutions following drainage incorporation as also validated in terms of nitrate and ppp residues in the products in order to meet food safety criteria eu regulation and increased consumer demand for fresh products with no chemical residues from the environmental point of view despite the obvious advantages in terms of water and nutrient use efficiency this study showed that drainage originated from cascade systems should target hydroponically grown secondary crops rather than the fertigation of soil grown crops in this regard the ecotoxicological assays clearly demonstrated that a long term drainage application to soil grown crops without proper treatment or specific good practice guidelines might contribute to soil quality degradation and constitute a risk of environmental pollution this risk results from increased salinization and deposition of ppp residues and high levels of nutrients in soils as well as in water bodies receiving run offs originating from these production systems it is here pointed out the urgent need for further research studies on assessing the long term application of drainage solutions from soilless cultivation to agricultural soils that would be a major contribution for assessing the sustainability of cascade cropping systems which include soil cultivation funding the authors would

performed exposing aquatic organisms raphidocelis subcapitata aliivibrio fischeri and daphnia magna to drainage and soil elutriate when analyzing plant performance in both cultivation systems a significant effect was only found at 100d in hydroponics resulting in 41 less leaf area 20 smaller head diameter and 43 lower yield drainage analysis showed high nutrient content presence of ppp

this study demonstrates the potential of using relatively high drainage percentages up to 50 from soilless cultivation systems if applied to hydroponically grown secondary crops however attention should be paid to the use of cascade cropping systems when drainages are applied to fertigate soil grown crops as it may contribute to soil degradation and environmental pollution on a long run graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecotoxicity horticulture lactuca sativa l nutrient emission plant protection products emission water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction when growing horticultural crops without soil so called soilless cultivation plants can be supplied with a nutrient solution directly circulating in the root zone hydroponic cultivation or through the fertigation of an organic e g peat moss coir or pinetree bark or inorganic e g rockwool perlite or vermiculite substrate the use of soilless production systems are becoming increasingly common in the horticultural sector worldwide due to i the ease of implementation in places without suitable soils for agriculture including contaminated soils salinized soils etc ii need to avoid soil borne pathogens often as a result of monoculture practices without crop rotation and iii the highest efficiency in using resources such as water nutrients and plant protection products ppp putra and yuliando 2015 the soilless cultivation systems are also often divided in two main categories concerning the use or not of the drainage closed or open irrigation systems respectively thus when plants are grown in substrate the supply of nutrient solution i e fertigation with water and nutrients is intentionally excessive in order to avoid the accumulation of salts at the root zone giuffrida et al 2003 this surplus that drains through the substrate hereafter referred as drainage commonly reaches 30 40 of the fertigation volume so its reuse is desirable from an economic and environmental point of view kooten et al 2004 actually closed irrigation systems with recirculation of drainages are mandatory in the netherlands since 2002 stanghellini et al 2005 van der salm et al 2020 due to the high risk of eutrophication of freshwater reservoirs other central and northern european countries have also been taking measures against drainage emissions from greenhouses for instance in belgium their discharges are not allowed since 2006 van der salm et al 2020 besides this clear environmental benefit of the closed irrigation systems they also have a greater performance in terms of resources use efficiency namely water and fertilizers as they are reused conceptually the implementation of closed systems is not complicated since the drainages can be easily collected in reservoirs from where they are pumped back to the fertigation system after being disinfected bar yosef 2008 savvas et al 2013 this disinfection procedure reduces the risks of disease dissemination but also has the advantage of converting hazardous contaminants into non hazardous contaminants or less toxic compounds that are more stable less mobile and or inert zheng 2018 nevertheless in several regions of the world with low abundance of good quality water and where a less technologically based horticulture prevails the so called open systems with drainage running freely to the environment are still very common also due to their simplicity and low cost massa et al 2010 katsoulas et al 2014 garcía caparrós et al 2018 mielcarek et al 2019 this is for instance the case of the several mediterranean countries with warmer climate where drainage salinity levels increase more rapidly including portugal santos et al 2017 in those countries the use of closed systems is quite limited particularly due to the higher investment and running costs as well as the need for more technical knowledge for managing crop fertigation and for avoiding root pathogen disease dissemination massa et al 2010 gianquinto et al 2013 one alternative to the open irrigation systems are the semi open systems also called cascade cropping systems in which the drainage from the main crop is collected in reservoirs and further reused for the fertigation of different secondary crops savvas et al 2013 either in greenhouses or open air in land parcels contiguous to the soilless crop muñoz et al 2017 in general those secondary crops have a higher salt tolerance compared with the one at the top of the cascade garcía caparrós et al 2018 moreover they are not from the same family of the main crop reducing the risks of disease dissemination and therefore growers often do not invest in drainage disinfection systems semi open systems have been recommended in the mediterranean region mainly because of the water and nutrient savings several experiments have been using this typology of production system either in soil or soilless production and the performance of plants receiving the drainage treatments has been compared with fertigation using fresh nutrient solutions used as control for example incrocci et al 2003 showed that drainages from tomato cultivated in rockwool when diluted with water in a 3 1 proportion could be used for fertigation of the more salt tolerant cherry tomato grown in nutrient film technique nft but a yield reduction of 25 in cherry tomato was registered garcía caparrós et al 2018 proposed reusing drainage from horticultural crops in the fertigation of ornamental crops after testing the application of drainage from melon cucumis melo cultivated in coir in the growth of rosemary rosmarinus officinalis cultivated in a mixture of sphagnum peat moss and perlite despite recording yield reductions of up to 36 in drainage fertigated rosemary plants either when drainage was applied directly 100 or after being blended with mains water 50 the authors recommended this strategy because of the water savings 18 and nutrient removal from the drainages recently muñoz et al 2017 performed an experiment in which drainage from greenhouse tomato grown in perlite was used without dilutions in an open field rotation sequence consisting in growing lettuce tomato and endive in soil the authors only observed decreased marketable yield in lettuce 15 whereas no effect of drainage was found for the other crops therefore although yield reductions can occur due to drainage use such drawbacks have been referred as being clearly compensated by the increased water and nutrient use efficiency that these systems represent being considered economically and most of all environmentally relevant incrocci et al 2003 muñoz et al 2017 garcía caparrós et al 2018 nonetheless the assessment of the suitability of semi open systems has been essentially focused on yield parameters and quantification of savings in terms of water and nutrients whereas the prolonged effects of drainage on soil quality and food safety e g nitrate content remain to be documented and clarified the present study aimed at i assessing the effect on plant performance and product quality of using different drainage percentages mixed with fresh nutrient solution for the fertigation in a cascade cropping system and ii analyzing the potential environmental risk of long term drainage emission to the environment through an ecotoxicological approach to this end lettuce was grown in two production systems hydroponics and in a soil with long exposure to drainages being irrigated with nutrient solutions composed of different percentages of drainage 0 control 25 50 and 100 obtained from a commercial strawberry farm with a semi open soilless production system lettuce was chosen as a model crop due to its economic importance moderate sensitiveness to salinity and propensity to accumulate nitrate in the leaves which is an aspect of particular importance in leafy vegetables regarding human health gent 2003 machado and serralheiro 2017 xavier et al 2018 this study was developed within the scope of the eu project agrinupes www agrinupes eu whose main objective is to improve fertigation management supporting the growers and authorities in achieving higher sustainability in the horticultural sector 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant growth conditions and experimental setup peat root blocked plantlets of batavia type green lettuce lactuca

different percentages of drainage with fns 0d 25d 50d and 100d were prepared as follows the drainages were obtained from a commercial grower that produced strawberry main crop in a semi open soilless system cascade system in that farm plants were cultivated in substrate mixture of coco peat blond peat and coconut fiber and the drainage was collected and stored in a reservoir being further reused for the fertigation of several secondary horticultural crops cultivated in soil within a greenhouse for our trials drainage was collected from the tubing system before reaching the reservoir installed at the commercial farm owed to logistic limitations this was done in two different periods corresponding to batch 1 and batch 2 which also allowed to evaluate the possible variation existing in these

those exceptions is mentioned along the text and tables 3 results 3 1 drainage analysis nutrients and ppp residues following the chemical analysis of the drainage from both batches the greatest differences were found in the total nitrogen and magnesium levels the concentrations of these elements in batch 1 were respectively 2 19 and 1 65 times higher than those for batch 2 in contrast batch 1 had a lower zinc concentration being below the detection limit table 1 concerning the ppp residues of the drainages table 2 six active ingredients were detected in batch 1 drainage accounting for a total concentration of ppp of 3 29 µg l 1 including four fungicides azoxystrobin boscalid myclobutanil and pyraclostrobin and two insecticides chlorpyrifos ethyl and dimethoate boscalid was the substance found at highest concentration in batch 2 only three active ingredients were detected totalizing 0 62 µg l 1 all of them being fungicides abamectin acrinathrin clofentezine difenoconazole formetanate lufenuron methiocarb spinosad and trifloxystrobin were not detected in both drainage batches 3 2 plant growth parameters the effect of the drainage percentage on the studied plant growth parameters was clearly dependent on the lettuce production system table 3 in plants grown in hydroponics it significantly affected la f 3 11 5 838 p 0 021 ø head h 3 8 465 p 0 037 and yield f 3 11 8 395 p 0 007 however significant differences were only found when comparing control plants with plants irrigated with 100d although in the latter plants the tdw including roots was not significantly affected the leaf sink strength was significantly lower lower dry matter partitioning to the leaves for 100d in hydroponics table 4 which resulted in significantly lower la 41 decrease ø head 20 decrease and crop yield 43 decrease in contrast lettuce grown in soil and irrigated with different percentages of drainage showed no significant differences in all the studied plant growth parameters table 3 when analyzing in more detail the dry matter partitioning in plants from exp 2 the effect of drainage incorporation f 3 11 16 311 p 0 001 translated to a significantly higher percentage of leaf dry matter in plants from 100d more 15 as compared with control plants table 4 finally although it was not the focus of this study it is important to notice that plants cultivated hydroponically had a generalized higher growth rate as compared to the ones cultivated in the soil system table 3 3 3 leaf mineral composition the foliar analyses revealed that the drainage percentage changed the mineral composition of the leaf tissues in both experiments but to a greater extent in plants grown hydroponically table 5 as it significantly affected nine out of the 15 studied minerals whereas in the soil system only four minerals were significantly influenced for instance in hydroponics the drainage percentage affected both the leaf nitrate f 3 11 10 795 p 0 001 and total nitrogen concentrations f 3 11 35 445 p 0 001 leaf nitrate reached its highest level in 0d grown lettuce 2 46 0 13 g kg 1 fw and this parameter was significantly lower in all treatments with drainage incorporated in the nutrient solution ranging from 31 to 51 decrease compared with the control on the contrary in the soil experiment neither the nitrate nor the total nitrogen concentrations in leaves were affected by the drainage percentage regarding other macronutrients the drainage percentage significantly affected the concentration of sulfur in both experiments the magnesium concentration was only affected in plants from hydroponics and the phosphorus concentration was only affected in plants from the soil experiment the most marked changes occurred in the micronutrients content for example in hydroponics the drainage percentage increased the concentration of molybdenum above factor 3 3 5 fold in 100d and 4 8 fold in 50d and copper and zinc practically doubled in treatment 100d when compared with the control in contrast the manganese concentration was significantly lower in all treatments with incorporation of drainage ranging from 28 to 78 decrease compared with the control in the soil experiment the only micronutrient whose concentration was affected by the drainage percentage was boron f 3 11 6 032 p 0 019 which was significantly lower in all treatments with drainage incorporated ranging from 39 to 51 compared with the control the drainage percentage also caused an impact on sodium concentration in both hydroponics h 3 10 385 p 0 016 and soil experiments f 3 11 17 858 p 0 001 but it was only significantly higher at 100d resulting in 63 increase in lettuce grown hydroponically and 47 increase in soil the aluminum concentration was not affected in plants from both experiments 3 4 drainage and soil elutriate analysis ecotoxicological assays when analyzing the average growth rate of the microalgae r subcapitata exposed to increasing percentages of drainage solutions fig 1 a it was found that batch 1 caused a significant stimulation on the growth of the microalgae f 15 20 4 359 p 0 012 from 64 drainage up to 100 drainage levels with a maximum effect of 7 for the non diluted drainage compared with the control i e 0 drainage the batch 2 drainage caused a significant inhibition f 15 20 3 024 p 0 044 on the growth rate 45 decrease but only at the highest concentration tested thus no effective concentrations ec20 and ec50 could be calculated from the data concerning the growth rate of the microalgae when exposed to the soil elutriate it was significantly affected f 15 20 50 775 p 0 001 as a high toxicity to r subcapitata was found already at 41 soil elutriate concentration mixed with mbl medium fig 1 b table 6 summarizes the toxicity endpoints that were estimated in the ecotoxicological assays performed for r subcapitata both batch 1 and batch 2 drainages were non toxic to the microalgae whereas the high toxicity of the soil elutriate was translated in low ec20 6 9 and ec50 20 6 the microtox test showed that the drainages were non toxic to a fischeri since the highest effect observed was a decrease of 10 2 in bioluminescence of the bacteria batch 1 whereas in batch 2 it even increased the bioluminescence highest effect 18 8 nonetheless the soil elutriate revealed to be highly toxic to a fischeri ec50 14 9 relatively to d magna the immobilization test showed that batch 1 drainage significantly affected the cladocerans with high toxicity after 48 h exposure ec20 61 9 ec50 66 6 table 6 despite no significant effect was observed after 24 h data not shown in contrast batch 2 drainage and the soil elutriate were non toxic to d magna 4 discussion 4 1 impact of drainage percentage on plant growth and leaf mineral composition in this study different proportions of drainage obtained from a commercial strawberry semi open soilless cultivation system were incorporated in the fertigation of lettuce grown in two production systems hydroponics and soil to assess its impact on plant development and leaf mineral composition in what regards the potential use of drainage in cascade cropping systems this case study showed that an incorporation as high as 50 treatment 50d combined with fresh nutrient solution has not affected any growth parameter in plants grown in both systems only in treatment 100d in hydroponics it was observed a negative effect on la ø head and yield table 3 since for the generality of crops it is recommended a 20 50 leaching fraction mainly depending on the irradiation levels and crop stage of development giuffrida et al 2003 signore et al 2016 these results alone give good prospects for drainage recycling the cultivation time of the experiments 32 days was sufficient for lettuce from hydroponics to reach a size that could be adequate for their harvest in a commercial production system yücel et al 2013 while in relation to soil cultivation the growth recorded was half of the expected for the same period escobar gutiérrez et al 2002 nicoletto et al 2014 lee et al 2015 this can be possibly related to a phytotoxic potential of the soil as it has been exposed to drainages for five years and had a demonstrated toxic effect in the ecotoxicological tests with the microalgae r subcapitata fig 1 b moreover since lettuce is an acid sensitive crop its yield may also have been affected by the soil acidity ph 5 1 as shown by other authors when lettuce was grown at ph levels below 5 7 hemphill and jackson 1982 rodríguez and flórez 2012 thus sub optimal availability of nutrients to support plant growth might have resulted from the low soil ph since this chemical property largely modulates the dynamics of cations exchange alongside with the existing soil colloids dinkecha and tsegaye 2017 from the analysis of the two drainage batches used in these experiments collected with two weeks interval it was found that they differed substantially in relation to their nutrient profile table 1 this calls the attention to the importance of knowing the drainage composition in a timely and precise manner namely with real time monitoring with reliable sensing systems to support growers in fertigation management as is the main goal of the agrinupes project nowadays most growers basically rely on the ec non discriminatory parameter to roughly assess the overall nutrient content of the drainages in their farms without knowing the nutrient profile of these effluents mishra et al 2020 hence effective monitoring of individual nutrients will also be extremely relevant to increase their confidence in recycling drainages as this perceived variable composition is one of the main limitations santos et al 2017 van der salm et al 2020 another main issue related to recirculation of the nutrient solution has been consistently referred as being the accumulation of sodium and chloride breś 2009 rodríguez and flórez 2012 which are introduced by the water used in their preparation as well as by some substrates lee et al 2018 savvas and gruda 2018 according to schrӧder and lieth 2002 a good quality water for use in closed systems should have an ec below 0 4 ds m 1 and the water used in these experiments ec 0 2 ds m 1 met that criterium in our study it was shown that in both cultivation systems exp 1 and exp 2 the drainage percentage only had a significant impact on the na accumulation in the leaf tissues at 100d table 5 finally sodium accumulation was notably more dependent on the cultivation system than drainage incorporation as na concentrations were clearly higher in the soil grown lettuce than in those from hydroponics even under control conditions in fact na concentrations of lettuce from the soil system were considerably above those reported elsewhere for soil grown lettuce smoleń et al 2015 sofo et al 2016 and it may have been one of the reasons for the overall slow development of the plants from the soil experiment ünlükara et al 2008 machado and serralheiro 2017 despite the variability observed in both exp 1 and exp 2 regarding leaf mineral composition the main highlight was in terms of na in plants from the soil system since the other minerals were within ranges expectable for lettuce fallovo et al 2009 baslam et al 2013 smoleń et al 2015 sofo et al 2016 sönmez et al 2017 at the beginning of the experiment the soil ec was 0 9 ds m 1 thus below the threshold of 1 3 ds m 1 indicated for lettuce but most likely it became increasingly salinized after successive fertigation ünlükara et al 2008 particularly at the highest drainage percentage 100d besides crop yield the validation of using a given percentage of drainage in fertigation has to meet food safety criteria following the eu legislation in this respect monitoring the nitrate content is of utmost importance qiu et al 2014 this is particularly the case in leafy vegetables such as lettuce because the accumulation of nitrate in plants is higher in petioles and leaves when compared to other edible organs such as fruits or tubers umar and iqbal 2007 in lettuce grown under cover the eu regulation no 1258 2011 authorizes a maximum level of 5 g kg 1 of no3 in plants harvested from 1 october to 31 march and 4 g kg 1 in plants harvested from 1 april to 30 september european commission 2011 in our study lettuce was harvested in june and the leaf nitrate content never overcame the limit although it was quite close to the threshold in the case of the soil culture in plants grown hydroponically the nitrate and total n concentrations were significantly lower in all treatments using drainage in their fertigation compared with the control whereas the opposite situation was found concerning leaf mg concentration with the highest levels in plants that received drainage table 5 this was probably due to lesser availability of no3 anions in the drainages compared with the fns possibly intensified by the accumulation of chloride in drainage solutions van der boon et al 1990 additionally significant differences were also observed in terms of leaf concentration of some micronutrients when comparing the control plants with plants that received drainage in their fertigation including mn cu and zn table 5 overall the results show that the composition of the nutrient solution in this case the percentages of drainage incorporated affects the lettuce tissue composition particularly in the hydroponic system which is in accordance with previous studies frezza et al 2005 fallovo et al 2009 song et al 2020 moreover although the mineral composition of the drainage might not match the proportions of the fns as the fns are prepared accordingly to the target crop species following their specific requirements the growth of lettuce was not limited by the lack of any plant nutrient it is well known that cu and al can cause phytotoxicity foy et al 1978 pillay and jonnalagadda 2007 teklić et al 2008 smoleń et al 2015 sönmez et al 2017 in relation to cu which is simultaneously a micronutrient and a ppp despite the drainage percentage significantly increased its concentration in lettuce leaves grown hydroponically it remained within a range also reported in other studies on lettuce mineral composition pillay and jonnalagadda 2007 smoleń et al 2015 sönmez et al 2017 and well below levels that could cause phytotoxicity to this crop teklić et al 2008 in turn the concentration of al was not affected by the drainage percentage 4 2 ecotoxicological assays the ecotoxicological assays revealed distinct aspects associated to both the drainages and to the soil elutriate the drainages were non toxic to r subcapitata and a fischeri table 6 one reason for the non toxicity of the drainages to the microalgae may have been the presence of nutrients which may have masked the toxicity of the ppp residues recorded table 2 nonetheless it is important to notice that those residues were from fungicides and insecticides being present at low concentrations according to ma et al 2006 the most problematic type of ppp to algae are the herbicides given their evolutionary proximity to plants however this type of products are not applied in soilless production systems the species d magna was the test organism more sensitive to the drainages at least for batch 1 table 6 considering that this species is tolerant to salinity as for example martínez jerónimo and martínez jerónimo 2007 reported a lc50 of 5 48 g l 1 of nacl corresponding to a measured conductivity of 9 79 ds m 1 which is well above the conductivity of both batches of drainages the acute toxic effects recorded cannot be attributed to salts in the drainage the mixture of the ppp residues present in the batch 1 may have been responsible for the toxicity to the cladocerans all the aquatic species used in this study are susceptible to metals and fertigation solutions are rich in elements of this typology including those which are plant essential nutrients k ca fe zn and cu and those that end up being introduced into the solutions despite not being desired na and al all these elements are potential contaminants in fresh water and among them zn and cu may be the most problematic ones because they can be detrimental to living organisms suter and tsao 1996 in our study no toxicity to d magna was observed in batch 2 drainage table 6 despite the zn content 0 42 mg l 1 was well above the benchmark indicated by suter and tsao 1996 as lowest chronic value for daphnids 0 047 mg l 1 regarding r subcapitata a significant reduction on their growth was observed when the algae were exposed to batch 2 drainage but only at the highest concentration 100 fig 1 a koukal et al 2003 reported an ec50 of 0 39 mg l 1 of zn for r subcapitata but the authors also showed that zn toxicity was significantly reduced in the presence of humic acids which are often found in hydroponic substrates silber 2019 copper was detected in both drainage batches but at concentrations well below levels that could affect the tested species suter and tsao 1996 horvatić et al 2007 machado and soares 2016 the bacteria a fischeri despite being sensitive to cu and zn can show enhanced bioluminescence when exposed to low levels of those elements cook et al 2000 christofi et al 2002 it has also been referred that in part metal toxicity may be diminished in nutrient rich matrices and with dissolved organic matter due to lesser bioavailability of the toxicants competition between nutrients and toxicants or improved metabolism of the organisms lozano and pratt 1994 loureiro et al 2005 we must bear in mind however that bioavailability of metals changes to a large extent according to ph so the effects of our tested substances could be considerably different in other environments such as natural compartments magalhães et al 2015 conclusions relative to ecotoxicity of drainages from soilless cultivation are challenging given their complex composition generally the nutrient content of the fertigation solutions is known when they are prepared but after draining through the root media their profile may have been greatly altered bar yosef 2008 in accordance with this batch 1 and batch 2 drainages differed substantially either in terms of quantity e g n or absence presence of a given nutrient e g zn the practice of applying ppp via fertigation or the possibility of their residues to accidentally end up in the drainages due to run off after their application by other means to the plants also contribute to the unpredictability of drainage composition alsanius et al 2013 regarding the soil elutriate a higher salt accumulation in the soil particularly of sodium and chloride caused by its long term exposure to drainages for irrigation of the secondary crops may have compromised algae growth savvas and gruda 2018 simmons 2012 exposed r subcapitata formerly pseudokirchneriella subcapitata to different salts recording ec50 values between 1 7 and 5 8 ds m 1 being the microalgae more sensitive to kcl and nacl thus the ec of the elutriate 1 6 ds m 1 suggests that soil salinity may have caused the toxicity observed for r subcapitata despite an imbalance of nutrients may not be disregarded in turn salinity ec of the elutriate cannot be the cause of the toxicity neither to the marine bacteria a fischeri nor to the cladoceran d magna martínez jerónimo and martínez jerónimo 2007 thus suggesting that an imbalance of nutrients or even the presence of ppp in the soil and its mobility to the aqueous phase of the elutriate could have been responsible for its toxicity to both species therefore the ecotoxicological assays with the soil elutriate indicate that long term application of drainage from soilless cultivation to soil might compromise its quality and retention function for contaminants consequently this practice may also represent a risk of pollution of water bodies in the vicinity of the production farms using this fertigation strategy hence ecotoxicological assays may constitute a valuable mean to assess the environmental hazard associated to the emission of drainages from soilless cultivation finally the fact that the drainages were found to be toxic only at concentrations above 50 in the battery of bioassays we performed table 6 suggests they do not represent a risk to the crop itself at least when they were used up to that threshold i e in 25d and 50d fertigation treatments 4 3 importance of guidelines for a proper use of drainage from soilless cultivation in our experiments we utilized drainages from soilless cultivation of strawberry because of the low ec normally applied in this salt sensitive crop saied et al 2005 this way we could utilize them to grow lettuce without dilutions or any further alteration other than the necessary correction of ph moreover strawberry is a crop commonly affected by many pests and diseases sójka et al 2015 so it can be considered a worst case scenario and we expected to find ppp residues in the drainages as it came to be confirmed the cultivation of highly demanding crops such as for example tomato cucumber or rose have been referred as important sources of nutrient emissions to the environment raviv et al 1998 breś 2009 vermeulen et al 2017 savvas and gruda 2018 albeit the drainages from soilless cultivation of strawberry might not be as nutrient rich as drainages from those crops both batch 1 and batch 2 drainages revealed chemical compositions that could contribute to environmental disturbances and pollution including soil degradation if released to the environment obviously this includes their application to agricultural soils the overall results from the ecotoxicological assays highlight the importance of developing guidelines for the use of drainage from soilless cultivation for fertigation of soil grown crops in light of the eu norms liquid effluents of this typology are considered industrial wastewater that need specific authorization for the purpose of irrigation european economic community eec 1991 although the use of wastewaters has been increasingly encouraged in the eu minimum requirements for using drainage from soilless cultivation in fertigation of soil grown crops are yet to be defined as the european directives published to date only state that the use of wastewater should increase and be authorized when the utilization is considered adequate by the member state without objective specifications assigned to industrial wastewater regarding their use as irrigation water european economic community eec 1991 european commission 2000 despite this limitation in the meantime one can take as a reference the emission limit values elv for n and p in wastewaters that stablish minimum requirement for their release to soils and water bodies according to the decree law no 236 98 of the portuguese legislation ministério do ambiente 1998 the elv in portugal for n is 15 mg l 1 and the elv for p is 10 mg l 1 considering these thresholds the total n was 7 1 fold and 3 3 fold higher than the elv in batch 1 and batch 2 drainages respectively and the p content was 5 fold and 6 5 fold above the limit in batch 1 and batch 2 respectively further evidencing the problem of using cascade cropping systems combining soilless and soil cultivation without clear guidelines that could prevent pollution 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that combines an agronomic with an ecotoxicological approach to perform a comprehensive analysis of the implications of implementing cascade cropping systems taking into account the plant growth parameters and yield this study showed the potential of incorporating high drainage percentages up to 50 from soilless cultivation in the fertigation of secondary crops nevertheless this practice should be combined with a systematic and dynamic monitoring of the chemical composition of the mixed nutrient solutions following drainage incorporation as also validated in terms of nitrate and ppp residues in the products in order to meet food safety criteria eu regulation and increased consumer demand for fresh products with no chemical residues from the environmental point of view despite the obvious advantages in terms of water and nutrient use efficiency this study showed that drainage originated from cascade systems should target hydroponically grown secondary crops rather than the fertigation of soil grown crops in this regard the ecotoxicological assays clearly demonstrated that a long term drainage application to soil grown crops without proper treatment or specific good practice guidelines might contribute to soil quality degradation and constitute a risk of environmental pollution this risk results from increased salinization and deposition of ppp residues and high levels of nutrients in soils as well as in water bodies receiving run offs originating from these production systems it is here pointed out the urgent need for further research studies on assessing the long term application of drainage solutions from soilless cultivation to agricultural soils that would be a major contribution for assessing the sustainability of cascade cropping systems which include soil cultivation funding the authors would

9314,as peanuts are sensitive to salinity physiological and agronomic responses to mulching and varied potassium rates were explored to boost peanut yield during 2013 14 and 2014 15 a field study with 12 treatment combinations using three levels of saline irrigation water control 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 and mulching plastic mulch and control as main plot and three levels of potassium treatment control 30 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 assisted in sub plots results revealed that application of irrigation water at 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 salinity exhibited 46 7 133 3 lower nodule count and pod yield reduced by 22 5 at successive increase in salinity over best availability water with 0 ds m 1 salinity levels lowered free amino acids and oil content but protein and sugar quantities rose modestly polythene mulch enhanced peanut pod production haulm yield and oil content by 23 9 24 6 and 49 5 respectively potash fertilizer applied at 60 kg ha 1 has a greater impact on pod yield 2 50 mg ha 1 than lower potassium fertilizer levels external potassium application didn t affect peanut biochemistry adopting polythene mulch with 2 0 ds m 1 salinity level irrigation water increased pod yield by 6 37 116 1 polythene mulch 60 kg k2o ha 1 2 0 ds m 1 increased 100 pod weight 88 4 g root length 8 67 cm nodules 9 00 and oil content 50 2 over other combinations five principal component analysis pca main components explained 84 4 variation with pc1 explaining 52 and correlating positively with yield related traits nodule numbers and oil content polythene mulch containing 30 60 kg k2o ha 1 increased peanut yield biochemical parameters and oil content under similar growing conditions therefore use of polythene mulch with combination of optimum potassium fertilizer application can be effectively used with salinity irrigation water up to 2 0 ds m 1 without compromising in yield and quality loss of peanut keywords polythene mulch potassium saline water irrigation salinity peanut data

al 2020 priyanka et al 2020 researchers around the world have been focusing on this issue as salinity is not a local or regional problem rather a global concern however some reclamation strategies are regularly suggested for minimizing salinity stress to sustain crop productivity sharma et al 2016 hussain et al 2016 islam et al 2019 unlike some other leguminous crops peanut is comparatively sensitive to saline stress conditions meena et al 2012 nitrogen fixation is adversely affected as nodule number and their dry mass is reduced in leguminous crops due to soil and water salinity correia et al 2009 fabra et al 2010 meena et al 2016 though it has been conveyed that nodulated crops might be more tolerant than fertilized crops under such abiotic stresses kirova et al 2008 shukla et al 2011 heba et al 2020 the saline condition also hampers peanut seed germination and biomass production mensah et al 2006 wong et al 2008 salwa et al 2010 meena et al 2018 islam et al 2019 despite that it is often grown on marginal and sub marginal lands and production of peanut could be improved with optimal input use and proper agronomic practices under saline stress conditions in several portions

transparent polythene mulch due to alteration in the soil microclimate sharma et al 2011 and quashes the diverse weed flora jinger et al 2017 choudhary et al 2022 transparent polythene mulch has played a foremost role in crop cultivation by generating mechanical protection at the soil surface and a micro climate modification in term of temperature dissemination retaining of humidity and the supply of co2 to lower leaves of small plants through the stomata maeda martinez 1989 otsuki et al 2000 additionally soil mulching can be used as a better field management strategy to reduce salt evaporation and migration upward which will reduce salt accumulation in the root zone chen et al 2016 taia et al 2016 however potassium fertilization did not influence directly on mitigating salinity but due to its competitive nature with sodium for binding and maintaining plant water status potassium helps plants tolerate salinity capula rodríguez et al 2016 the k na ratio can be raised by fertilizing plants with k in order to increase their tolerance to salinity stress elhindi et al 2016 adhikari et al 2020 concurrently the role of potassium minimizing the salinity effect in peanut crop was earlier evidenced by chakraborty et al 2016 meena et al 2018 and pronounced mulching result has been perceived by jain et al 2017 although the deleterious effects of imposed salinity stress on overall plant growth and biochemical traits of peanut have been well documented meena and yadav 2018 meena et al 2016 but no information was available on application of polythene mulch especially in field condition for biochemical traits growth yields and yield attributes of peanut under salinity stress condition thus in the present study we are focusing on the differential response in ameliorative effect of polythene mulching and supplementary application of potassium under salt stress in field condition however the use of plastic mulch for field crops especially under salinity stresses conditions remains at an evolving phase in india hence this study aims for enhancing the productivity of summer peanut through mitigating the adverse effect of salinity by application of polythene mulch and potassium application under diverse salinity stress conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details and treatments a two year field study was carried out during summer seasons of 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 at the research farm of icar directorate of groundnut research junagadh india 21 52º n 70 47º e 100 m above msl having soil classified as vertic ustochrepts medium black clayey shallow and marginally alkaline ph 7 8 8 0 in nature the experiment was laid out in a split split plot design with 12 treatment combinations and three replications by using three levels

nutrients applied to plots at the time of sowing during the entire period of cropping the crop was irrigated with a regular interim of ten days 2 2 salinity treatment details saline water treatment was imposed after three weeks of emergence peanut seedlings the 2 0 s2 and 4 0 s3 ds m 1 salinity levels in the irrigation water were generated by dissolving requisite quantity of commercially available common salt 2 6 and 5 2 kg in 2000 l irrigation water to induce 22 and 44 m nacl solution respectively which ideally represented the desired salinity levels 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 during both study years the best quality irrigation water available was used in control plots of 0 ds m 1 the irrigation water used for this study has its place to the classes from c1s1 to c2s1 usda classification richards 1954 having no sodium hazard sar 10 and residual sodium carbonate rsc 1 00 meq l 1 with adequate soluble sodium percentage 2 3 measurements the peanut plants were washed under with tap water and were determined for various morphological parameters growth observations were recorded from three plants for each experimental unit and destructive sampling has been adopted shoot and root lengths measured with a graduated ruler at 45 and 90 days after sowing das and at harvest uprooted samples were kept in over drying at 65 c for 4 days and recorded root and shoot dry weights similarly number of nodules was manually counted from these samples subsequently supplementary yield traits including 100 pod weight g and 100 kernel weight g were recorded at the time of harvesting pod and haulm yield kg ha 1 were calculated on per hectare basis the shelling percentage was calculated as per the formula as per eq 1 1 shelling percentage kernel weight kg ha 1 pod weight kg ha 1

conductivity ec and ph of soil samples phs were measured by portable hanna make ph ec meter in saturation extract of soil paste and soil water saturation paste with distilled water respectively 2 5 statistical analysis all the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova for a split split design by using r software r core 4 0 2021 to find out the statistically significance between the treatments comparison between treatments was done with the help of lsd values at p 0 05 gomez and gomez 1984 principal component analysis pca was realized using past statistical software hammer et al 2001 3 results 3 1 root parameters root length and dry root weight of peanut were significantly p 0 05 influenced by mulching salinity and potash application at 45 and 90 days period application of polythene mulch increased root length by 27 2 and 16 7 under salinity level of 0 ds m 1 28 3 and 3 4 under 2 0 ds m 1 and 20 8 and 7 5 under 4 0 ds m 1 at 45 and 90 days after sowing das than without polythene mulch respectively but at harvest both the treatments remain at par with each other table 1 similarly dry root weight also increased by 40 7 27 8 17 1 under 0 ds m 1 65 0 45 5 25 7 under 2 0 ds m 1 and 43 5 25 6 10 3 under 4 0 ds m 1 salinity at 45 90 das and at harvest compared to without polythene mulch respectively though effects of salinity and potash treatments were non significant for root length and dry root weights yet slight differences in treatments were observed avoiding potassium application resulted in highest root length at 90 das and at harvest but potassium levels did not show significant effect on root dry weight at all the growth stages the number of nodules was not influenced significantly by mulching and salinity levels at 45 das on pooled mean basis though root nodules did not influence significantly with mulching plastic mulching enhanced root nodules by 28 6 86 1 as compared to no mulch plots at 90 das likewise imposing salinity levels influenced root nodules significantly and root nodules increased by 46 7 and 133 3 under salinity stress level of 0 ds m 1 37 4 and 89 5 under 2 0 ds m 1 salinity stress and 5 0 and 64 2 under 4 0 ds m 1 salinity stress s3 with polythene mulch compared to without polythene mulch at 45 and 90 das respectively table 1 among potassium treatments application of 60 kg k2o ha 1 applied plots recorded significantly p 0 05 higher root nodules at 45 days after sowing than lower levels of potassium application 3 2 shoot parameters shoot length and shoot dry weight at 45 and 90 days of peanut growth stages affected significantly by mulching salinity levels and potassium application but at harvest stage did not show any significant effect mean maximum value of shoot length and dry shoot weight was highest in 0 ds m 1 salinity level compared to 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 at 45 and 90 das table 2 polythene mulch showed tremendous positive effect on shoot length linearly with increase of salinity stress 0 ds m 1 to 4 0 ds m 1 compared to no mulch plots polythene mulch increased shoot length by 28 7 18 4 18 7 under 0 dsm 1 salinity 36 0 22 2 7 8 under 2 0 ds m 1 salinity and 34 6 25 9 13 1 under 4 0 dsm 1 salinity at 45 90 das and at harvest respectively likewise application of polythene mulch increased dry shoot weight by 61 9 67 7 37 8 under 0 ds m 1 salinity 81 7 71 6 24 5 under 2 0 ds m 1 salinity and 60 1 51 4 11 9 under 4 0 ds m 1 salinity at 45 90 das and at harvest than no polythene mulch plots respectively similarly potassium application enhanced shoot length significantly at 45 90 das and at harvest however no application of potassium control and 30 kg k2o ha 1 enhanced shoot length significantly at all the growth stages over 60 kg k2o ha 1 potassium applied plots interestingly 60 kg k2o ha 1 applied plots recorded highest dry shoot weight than others however these treatments did not differ significantly except at 45 days after sowing 3 3 yield and yield attributes peanut pod and haulm yields varied significantly under variable salinity mulching and potash application levels table 3 application of polythene mulch increased pod yield and haulm yield of peanut by 23 9 and 24 6 respectively compared to without mulch plots likewise salinity imposed treatments reduced pod and haulm yields especially at the higher stress level significantly higher pod yield 2 61 mg ha 1 was recorded with 2 0 ds m 1 salinity and it was 22 5 higher compared to 4 0 ds m 1 salinity level similarly imposition of salinity stress drastically reduced haulm yield by 21 4 at 4 0 ds m 1 salinity compared to no salinity stress plots potassium application had significant impact on pod yield and it was significantly higher under 60 kg k2o ha 1 2 50 mg ha 1 applied plots over other plots though potassium application did not influence haulm yield significantly yet it was highest in no potassium applied plots 3 88 mg ha 1 and least was observed with 60 kg k2o applied plots 3 59 mg ha 1 therefore the combined effect of mulching salinity potassium levels was significant and it was highest for the treatment combination of 2 0 ds m 1 salinity 30 kg k2o ha 1 plastic mulching s2 k2 m1 2 42 mg ha 1 over other combinations and it was at par with s2 k1 m1 table 3 yield attributes like 100 pod weight and100 kernel weight were did not influenced significantly by salinity and mulching applied plots during 2014 and 2015 though yield attributes did not influence significantly polythene mulch applied plots exhibited higher 100 pod weight 100 kernel weight and shelling percent by 6 3 6 0 and 1 4 respectively over non mulch plots during the study seasons similarly the highest 100 pod weight recorded at no salinity stress plots 0 ds m 1 81 5 g which was 12 4 higher than that of 4 0 ds m 1 salinity 74 6 g table 3 however salinity levels did not differ significantly on 100 kernel weight during 2014 and 2015 whereas potassium fertilization influenced significantly on 100 pod weight 100 kernel weight and shelling per cent during 2014 and 2015 application of potassium at 60 kg k2o ha 1 improved pooled 100 pod weight 81 1 g and shelling percent 67 9 significantly compared to lower levels of potassium application the combined effect of salinity mulching potash was significant on 100 pod weight and shelling percent significantly higher 100 pod weight of 88 4 g was recorded with 2 0 ds m 1 salinity 60 kg k2o ha 1 plastic mulching over other combinations table 3 3 4 biochemical traits biochemical traits except phenols were influenced significantly by mulching salinity stress and potassium application during 2014 and 2015 table 4 polythene mulching exhibited significantly higher oil content 49 5 over no mulch plots whereas as no mulch plots recorded significantly higher sugar content 6 0 and free amino acids faa 0 12 over polythene mulch plots though application of polythene mulch increased oil content by 0 3 sugar content significantly decreased by 2 83 fig 1 however protein content and phenols did not influence significantly by mulching treatments salinity levels influenced significantly on protein content oil content sugar content and faa during both the crop seasons lower level of salinity 2 0 ds m 1 and no salinity stress plots enhanced oil content and faa whereas for protein and sugar contents were marginally increased with increase in salinity stress significantly higher oil content 49 5 and faa 0 122 were recorded with 2 0 ds m 1 and no salinity stress plots over 4 0 ds m 1 salinity plots the oil content decreased by 1 78 under salinity imposed plots compared to control plots fig 1 however higher salinity level of 4 0 ds m 1 enhanced protein and sugar content significantly in peanut seeds over lower levels of salinity likewise application of potassium at 60 kg k2o ha 1 recorded significantly higher oil content 49 6 over lower levels of potassium application interestingly protein content in peanut seeds decreased with increased levels of potassium application whereas no application of potassium recorded significantly higher protein content 29 9 and sugar content 5 92 over application of potassium fertilizers however potassium application did not show any significant difference on phenols and faa of peanut 3 5 potassium and sodium accumulation partitioning of peanut plant parts showed that mulching salinity and potassium application had greater impact on potassium and sodium accumulation fig 2 3 irrespective of treatment effects na concentration was found to be in the order of root shell shoot kernel fig 2 3 salinity treatment resulted in significant increase in na concentration in different plant parts with maximum increment observed in root tissues peanut showed comparatively less na accumulation in roots under polythene mulching compared to no mulching control however the na accumulation was much similar in shell shoot and kernel under both mulch treatments unlike tissue na content the k content showed an opposite trend and a sequential decrease in k uptake was observed with increasing level of salinity fig 2 3 differential accumulation of k was observed under salinity stress in different plant parts and the tissue concentration was found in the order of kernel shoot shell root a slight increase in k content was observed under polythene mulching than that of no mulching in all the plant parts further application of k also reduced the uptake of na and enhances the k uptake by adjusting the tissue ionic balance to some extent which suggested an ameliorative effect of polythene mulching and supplementary k in saline stress environment principal component analysis pca was performed to study performance of mulching and potash application under saline conditions by using all the traits under study and is presented in fig 5 and table s1 pca identified five significant principal components which together explained 84 4 variation in the data breakdown of this cumulative variance revealed contribution of 52 1 and 11 9 for pc 1 and pc 2 respectively components 3 pc 3 and 4 pc 4 contributed 8 9 and 6 9 towards cumulative variance discriminating power of principle components as

inferior for the characters under study treatment biplot fig 5 made a clear distinction between mulching treatments as m1 polythene mulch and m2 no mulch treatments were clustered separately both the m1 and m2clusters further were divided into two sub clusters each with the treatment involving s3 4 0 ds m 1 forming one sub cluster whereas s1 0 ds m 1 and s2 2 0 ds m 1 forming the other sub cluster 4 discussion our findings from this study suggested that imposing salinity stress had a negative impact on overall plant growth and physiological processes pal et al 2021 response and adaptability to a stressful environment were significantly different under polythene mulching and potassium fertilization chakraborty et al 2016 el mageed et al 2016 because vertisols of the semi arid tropics lack optimum soil water and favorable soil temperature in the seed zone even though sufficient water is present in the lower part of the soil profile seedling emergence of peanut is frequently limited ghosh et al 2006 for most of the parameters studied polythene mulch and external potassium fertilization improved salt tolerance particularly under stress conditions previous research has shown that mulching with various materials is a promising technique for reducing agricultural salinity bezborodov and pang et al 2010 2010 thus we focus on the differential response of polythene mulch and supplementary potassium fertilization on peanut under salinity stress 4 1 mulching effect application of polythene mulch keeps the root zone moist for longer periods and dilutes salt concentration jain et al 2017 el mageed et al 2016 in the current study for both 2013 14 and 2014 15 study years most of the growth yield and yield contributing characters of peanut in were significantly influenced by mulch treatments all the cases control plots no mulch had the lowest performance polythene mulch exhibited higher pod haulm yield and oil content of peanut by 23 9 24 6 and 49 5 than without mulch plots respectively table 3 the improved growth and yield attributes of peanut under polythene mulch could be attributed to reduced evaporation losses caused by less weed growth which resulted in increased soil moisture content thus polythene mulch plots exhibited higher growth and yield attributes of peanut several field studies have shown that mulches improve yield in peanut ravankar et al 2003 pawar etal 2004 ghosh et al 2006 jain et al 2017 meena et al 2018 in maize xu et al 2015 and sunflower zhao et al 2016 concurrently polythene mulching increased germination due to increased soil water and soil temperature according to shaikh et al 2004 ghosh et al 2006 jain et al 2017 the time required for seedling emergence was also shortened due to increase in soil temperature by 4 50 c under polythene mulch than without mulching similarly peanut root length and dry root weight were significantly higher under polythene mulch than in non mulch plots at 45 90 das and harvest under different salinity stress conditions table 1 2 in this study a thin film of mulch gauge 7 mm produced higher pod yield of summer peanut than thick film 50 mm and could be retained throughout the growing season samui and ambhore 2000 kathmale et al 2000 jain et al 2017 similarly the association of growth yield and biochemical traits under mulching plots revealed that all growth traits contributed positively for obtaining higher yield and biochemical traits in peanut fig s1 the polythene mulching consistently assisted in retaining lower electrical conductivity ec ph and na concentration with high k concentration in soil figs 2 3 4 it could be because of mulch prevents direct evaporation of soil water resulting in higher soil moisture in the root zone than no mulch however polythene mulching retained more soil water with low salt concentration ec and na in root zone from germination to maturity fig 4 thus low salt concentration and high soil water under polythene mulching during the crop growth period to achieve higher pod yield and haulm yield of peanut el mageed et al 2016 retention of low electrical conductivity ec with lower na concentration in root zone reduces the deleterious effect of salts on overall plant growth and yield attributing traits due to maintaining favorable high soil water under polythene mulching throughout the crop growth especially at relatively sensitive growth stages germination and pod development a higher number of nodules improves nitrogen fixation relative water content flower numbers mature pod numbers and pod yield per plant similarly sedaghati et al 2016 found that using plastic mulch reduced soil surface salinity from 30 8 to 51 8 when compared to the control optimum soil moisture with low electrical conductivity ph and na concentration under polythene mulching during pod development stage boosts crop growth resulting in better pod and seed development of peanut khan 2002 khistaria et al 1994 as a result enhanced yields under polythene mulching exhibited significantly higher oil content 49 4 over no mulch plots while no mulch plots had significantly higher sugar content 5 88 and free amino acids faa 0 12 over polythene mulch plots table 4 4 2 salinity plant growth is generally hampered by salinity stress first due to its osmotic effect and then due to the more deleterious specific ion toxicity effect thus plants began to exhibit altered plant water status during the phase i stage of soil salinity with little effect on cell turgor munns 2005 plant salt tolerance is typically associated with a relative loss of biomass in saline versus non saline condition over a relatively long period greenway and munns 1980 islam et al 2019 with a few exceptions salinity levels significantly influenced most of the growth yield and yield contributing characters of peanut studied in this current study when compared to no salinity levels imposing salinity stress increased nodule count by 46 4 133 2 table 1 however higher salinity stress reduced pod yield by 22 5 pal et al 2021 meena et al 2017 2018 under non saline 0 ds m 1 conditions polythene mulch produced significantly p 0 05 more biomass both pod and haulm yield than higher salinity levels of 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 with imposition of salinity stress the reduction in growth yield yield attributes and biochemical parameters was observed and this reduction was less under polythene mulching than without mulching jain et al 2017 it has been noticed that increasing salinity reduces oil while increasing protein and sugar content fig 1 however effect of salinity on biochemical composition of peanut was well documented by meena and yadav 2018 pal et al 2021 but biochemical traits influenced with polythene mulch application is a novel work in vertisols as a result in the current study salinity levels significantly reduced free amino acids faa and oil content from 49 6 0 ds m 1 to 48 7 4 0 ds m 1 however protein and sugar contents increased marginally with increasing salinity stress under verisols reduction in phenol and free amino acids under higher salinity levels was also observed by meena et al 2014 mahatma et al 2016 a significant negative correlation between oil protein and sugar contents under polythene mulching and no mulching seed was observed at the different salinity levels and it was observed to be at its greatest at the highest salinity level similarly association of growth yield and biochemical traits under salinity plots showed positivity towards each other traits in peanut crop exhibited that all the growth traits contributed positively for obtaining higher yield and biochemical traits fig s2 4 3 potassium application potassium a crucial regulator of plant metabolic processes appeared to enhance plant water uptake by controlling the osmotic potential and hydraulic conductivity of membranes by inducing a hyperactive response of plasma membrane bound aquaporins and specific k channels in the root tissue under osmotic stress conditions brought on by salinity or drought heinen et al 2009 therefore fertilization of potassium offset salinity induced yield loss and the effect was comparatively more significant under polythene mulching compared to no mulching when external potassium was applied this result advocated that application of 60 kg k2o ha 1 k3 higher availability of k even in saline conditions helped peanut to maintain better physiological status possibly through higher uptake of k or better retention of tissue k than under no k2o and 30 kg k2o ha 1 conditions because the availability of nutrients to plants including k is often hampered in saline conditions adequate availability of k in the growing environment is essential for plant growth meena et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2016 ashraf and sultana 2000 munns 2005 exogenously applied k has been shown in previous studies to promote growth and biomass production in a wide range of crops ikeda and akram et al 2005 2009 it is possible that in a saline environment with high salt concentrations the amount of naturally occurring k may inhibit plant growth chen et al 2007 in such instances increasing the k concentration in the growing medium may improve k absorption and thus offset the negative effect of salt stress zheng et al 2008 dardanelli et al 2009 and heba et al 2020 emphasized the importance of potassium fertilization in peanut under sandy loam soils of india s indo gangetic plains external potassium fertilization on the other hand had no significant effect on the biochemical traits of peanut 4 4 interaction effect the combined effect of salinity mulching potash on 100 pod weight shelling percent pod yield and haulm yield during both the study years was significant the combination of 2 0 ds m 1 salinity 30 kg k2o ha 1 plastic mulching s2 k2 m1 produced a significantly higher pod yield of 2 42 mg ha 1 over other combinations table 3 therefore using polythene mulch with 30 kg k2o ha 1 under 2 0 ds m 1 salinity level increased pod yield by 6 4 116 1 over other combinations while polythene mulch 60 kg k2o ha 1 2 0 ds m 1 salinity also resulted in higher oil content 50 2 compared to other combinations thus higher potassium availability 60 kg k2o ha 1 even in saline condition facilitated both mulching treatments in maintaining better biochemical and physiological status compared to no potassium application table 4 because the availability of essential nutrients to plants including potassium is frequently hampered in saline conditions adequate availability of these essential nutrients in growing environments created by the application of polythene mulching for plant growth is required ghosh et al 2006 meena et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2016 it is possible that in a saline environment with high salt concentrations the amount of naturally occurring potassium may suppress plant growth chen et al 2007 increasing potassium concentration with application of polythene mulching in such situations may improve availability of essential nutrient absorption including potassium and counter balance the adverse effect of salt stress meena et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2016 zheng et al 2008 this was further corroborated by pca treatment biplot fig 5 table s1 figs s1 and s2 wherein mulch and non mulch treatments formed one sub cluster and high salinity treatment 4 0 ds m 1 formed another group in the pca treatment biplot treatment combinations involving m2s3 were towards extreme left with low pod yield whereas m1s2 and m1s1 were on extreme right with high pod yield it is always desirable for peanut to have non saline and high nutrient rich environment to express its full yield potential but in presence of salinity stress nutrient availability was limited which reduces yield drastically 5 conclusion in vertisols of western india adopting plastic mulch exhibiting higher yields under lower levels of salinity polythene mulch owing to its impermeability to hot air ensures optimum temperature enhances growth and yield parameters of peanut therefore use of thin polythene mulch gauge 7 mm which is relatively a cheaper may be a right proposition for peanut growers and found to be best management practice for increasing peanut productivity in both saline and non saline conditions peanut can sustain lower level of salinity 2 0 dsm 1 to great extent with polythene mulch and also by providing optimum potassium fertilizers so using of polythene mulch with 2 0 4 0 ds m 1 salinity and 30 kg k2o ha 1could help farmers to increase the water content and to increase production levels in peanut further research on the use of mulches under higher salinity levels in peanut could provide valuable insights on soil physical and chemical properties however need to study biological properties under polythene mulching coupled with saline irrigation water and potassium application for

9314,as peanuts are sensitive to salinity physiological and agronomic responses to mulching and varied potassium rates were explored to boost peanut yield during 2013 14 and 2014 15 a field study with 12 treatment combinations using three levels of saline irrigation water control 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 and mulching plastic mulch and control as main plot and three levels of potassium treatment control 30 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 assisted in sub plots results revealed that application of irrigation water at 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 salinity exhibited 46 7 133 3 lower nodule count and pod yield reduced by 22 5 at successive increase in salinity over best availability water with 0 ds m 1 salinity levels lowered free amino acids and oil content but protein and sugar quantities rose modestly polythene mulch enhanced peanut pod production haulm yield and oil content by 23 9 24 6 and 49 5 respectively potash fertilizer applied at 60 kg ha 1 has a greater impact on pod yield 2 50 mg ha 1 than lower potassium fertilizer levels external potassium application didn t affect peanut biochemistry adopting polythene mulch with 2 0 ds m 1 salinity level irrigation water increased pod yield by 6 37 116 1 polythene mulch 60 kg k2o ha 1 2 0 ds m 1 increased 100 pod weight 88 4 g root length 8 67 cm nodules 9 00 and oil content 50 2 over other combinations five principal component analysis pca main components explained 84 4 variation with pc1 explaining 52 and correlating positively with yield related traits nodule numbers and oil content polythene mulch containing 30 60 kg k2o ha 1 increased peanut yield biochemical parameters and oil content under similar growing conditions therefore use of polythene mulch with combination of optimum potassium fertilizer application can be effectively used with salinity irrigation water up to 2 0 ds m 1 without compromising in yield and quality loss of peanut keywords polythene mulch potassium saline water irrigation salinity peanut data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction peanut arachis hypogaea l is a good source of protein consumed equally as oilseed and confectionary purposes worldwide salinity is one of the key threats to soil health crop production and productivity meena et al 2016 it often retards the soil microbial activities and hence restricts the soil nutrient availability meena et al 2017 thus soil salinization causes an appraised 1 2 of land to become non arable per annum paul and lade 2014 moreover irrigation water quality has deteriorated over the years cai and rosegrant 2003 and therefore the availability of freshwater for agricultural production is gradually shrinking howell 2001 salt toxicity has many fold undesirable effects on soil properties due to salt import like high ph high sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage esp poor soil physical structure and low water permeability janda et al 2016 sharma et al 2016 islam et al 2019 adhikari et al 2020 priyanka et al 2020 researchers around the world have been focusing on this issue as salinity is not a local or regional problem rather a global concern however some reclamation strategies are regularly suggested for minimizing salinity stress to sustain crop productivity sharma et al 2016 hussain et al 2016 islam et al 2019 unlike some other leguminous crops peanut is comparatively sensitive to saline stress conditions meena et al 2012 nitrogen fixation is adversely affected as nodule number and their dry mass is reduced in leguminous crops due to soil and water salinity correia et al 2009 fabra et al 2010 meena et al 2016 though it has been conveyed that nodulated crops might be more tolerant than fertilized crops under such abiotic stresses kirova et al 2008 shukla et al 2011 heba et al 2020 the saline condition also hampers peanut seed germination and biomass production mensah et al 2006 wong et al 2008 salwa et al 2010 meena et al 2018 islam et al 2019 despite that it is often grown on marginal and sub marginal lands and production of peanut could be improved with optimal input use and proper agronomic practices under saline stress conditions in several portions of the globe transparent polythene mulching has been largely used as water conserving agronomic management tool it stifles the impact of ecological dynamics on the topsoil by increasing soil temperature adjusting diurnal seasonal variations in soil temperature ghosh et al 2006 jain et al 2017 though the magnitude differs by microclimate soil type thickness of polythene used as mulch polythene mulch positively affects the soil conserved moisture regime by checking evaporation from the soil surface ji et al 2001 pawar et al 2004 jain et al 2017 advances soil moisture retention period kladivko and unger 1994 and expedites condensation of soil moisture during night owed to temperature reverses tisdall et al 1991 early emergence of seedling was favored by application of transparent polythene mulch due to alteration in the soil microclimate sharma et al 2011 and quashes the diverse weed flora jinger et al 2017 choudhary et al 2022 transparent polythene mulch has played a foremost role in crop cultivation by generating mechanical protection at the soil surface and a micro climate modification in term of temperature dissemination retaining of humidity and the supply of co2 to lower leaves of small plants through the stomata maeda martinez 1989 otsuki et al 2000 additionally soil mulching can be used as a better field management strategy to reduce salt evaporation and migration upward which will reduce salt accumulation in the root zone chen et al 2016 taia et al 2016 however potassium fertilization did not influence directly on mitigating salinity but due to its competitive nature with sodium for binding and maintaining plant water status potassium helps plants tolerate salinity capula rodríguez et al 2016 the k na ratio can be raised by fertilizing plants with k in order to increase their tolerance to salinity stress elhindi et al 2016 adhikari et al 2020 concurrently the role of potassium minimizing the salinity effect in peanut crop was earlier evidenced by chakraborty et al 2016 meena et al 2018 and pronounced mulching result has been perceived by jain et al 2017 although the deleterious effects of imposed salinity stress on overall plant growth and biochemical traits of peanut have been well documented meena and yadav 2018 meena et al 2016 but no information was available on application of polythene mulch especially in field condition for biochemical traits growth yields and yield attributes of peanut under salinity stress condition thus in the present study we are focusing on the differential response in ameliorative effect of polythene mulching and supplementary application of potassium under salt stress in field condition however the use of plastic mulch for field crops especially under salinity stresses conditions remains at an evolving phase in india hence this study aims for enhancing the productivity of summer peanut through mitigating the adverse effect of salinity by application of polythene mulch and potassium application under diverse salinity stress conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details and treatments a two year field study was carried out during summer seasons of 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 at the research farm of icar directorate of groundnut research junagadh india 21 52º n 70 47º e 100 m above msl having soil classified as vertic ustochrepts medium black clayey shallow and marginally alkaline ph 7 8 8 0 in nature the experiment was laid out in a split split plot design with 12 treatment combinations and three replications by using three levels of saline irrigation water s1 control s2 2 0 and s3 4 0 ds m 1 as main plot two mulching treatments m1 transparent polythene mulch m2 without mulch as sub plot and three levels of potassium treatment k1 control k2 30 kg k2o ha 1 k3 60 kg k2o ha 1 as sub sub plot the transparent polythene mulch gauge 7 mm has been manually installed in the respective treatment the net plot size of each treatment was 7 6 m where peanut seeds var tg 37 a were sown at a spacing of 30 10 cm the crop was grown following standard agronomic management practices and suggested doses of n 25 kg ha 1 and p2o5 50 kg ha 1 nutrients applied to plots at the time of sowing during the entire period of cropping the crop was irrigated with a regular interim of ten days 2 2 salinity treatment details saline water treatment was imposed after three weeks of emergence peanut seedlings the 2 0 s2 and 4 0 s3 ds m 1 salinity levels in the irrigation water were generated by dissolving requisite quantity of commercially available common salt 2 6 and 5 2 kg in 2000 l irrigation water to induce 22 and 44 m nacl solution respectively which ideally represented the desired salinity levels 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 during both study years the best quality irrigation water available was used in control plots of 0 ds m 1 the irrigation water used for this study has its place to the classes from c1s1 to c2s1 usda classification richards 1954 having no sodium hazard sar 10 and residual sodium carbonate rsc 1 00 meq l 1 with adequate soluble sodium percentage 2 3 measurements the peanut plants were washed under with tap water and were determined for various morphological parameters growth observations were recorded from three plants for each experimental unit and destructive sampling has been adopted shoot and root lengths measured with a graduated ruler at 45 and 90 days after sowing das and at harvest uprooted samples were kept in over drying at 65 c for 4 days and recorded root and shoot dry weights similarly number of nodules was manually counted from these samples subsequently supplementary yield traits including 100 pod weight g and 100 kernel weight g were recorded at the time of harvesting pod and haulm yield kg ha 1 were calculated on per hectare basis the shelling percentage was calculated as per the formula as per eq 1 1 shelling percentage kernel weight kg ha 1 pod weight kg ha 1

turgid weight dry weight 100 sound mature kernel samples were crushed to a fine meal and utilized for analyzing various biochemical traits like oil protein sugar phenol and free amino acid faa using an instalab 700 near infrared analyzer dickey john auburn illinois likewise oil content in peanut kernel was estimated by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique tiwari and burk 1980 2 4 plant and soil analysis procedure the oven dried plant samples collected at harvesting were finely ground and dry materials were exposed to tri acid digestion as distinct plant parts the k and na content from the root shoot shell and kernel samples were resolved separately employing a flame photometer excluding the extraction was wiped out neutral 1 n ammonium acetate solution the electrical conductivity ec and ph of soil samples phs were measured by portable hanna make ph ec meter in saturation extract of soil paste and soil water saturation paste with distilled water respectively 2 5 statistical analysis all the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova for a split split design by using r software r core 4 0 2021 to find out the statistically significance between the treatments comparison between treatments was done with the help of lsd values at p 0 05 gomez and gomez 1984 principal component analysis pca was realized using past statistical software hammer et al 2001 3 results 3 1 root parameters root length and dry root weight of peanut were significantly p 0 05 influenced by mulching salinity and potash application at 45 and 90 days period application of polythene mulch increased root length by 27 2 and 16 7 under salinity level of 0 ds m 1 28 3 and 3 4 under 2 0 ds m 1 and 20 8 and 7 5 under 4 0 ds m 1 at 45 and 90 days after sowing das than without polythene mulch respectively but at harvest both the treatments remain at par with each other table 1 similarly dry root weight also increased by 40 7 27 8 17 1 under 0 ds m 1 65 0 45 5 25 7 under 2 0 ds m 1 and 43 5 25 6 10 3 under 4 0 ds m 1 salinity at 45 90 das and at harvest compared to without polythene mulch respectively though effects of salinity and potash treatments were non significant for root length and dry root weights yet slight differences in treatments were observed avoiding potassium application resulted in highest root length at 90 das and at harvest but potassium levels did not show significant effect on root dry weight at all the growth stages the number of nodules was not influenced significantly by mulching and salinity levels at 45 das on pooled mean basis though root nodules did not influence significantly with mulching plastic mulching enhanced root nodules by 28 6 86 1 as compared to no mulch plots at 90 das likewise imposing salinity levels influenced root nodules significantly and root nodules increased by 46 7 and 133 3 under salinity stress level of 0 ds m 1 37 4 and 89 5 under 2 0 ds m 1 salinity stress and 5 0 and 64 2 under 4 0 ds m 1 salinity stress s3 with polythene mulch compared to without polythene mulch at 45 and 90 das respectively table 1 among potassium treatments application of 60 kg k2o ha 1 applied plots recorded significantly p 0 05 higher root nodules at 45 days after sowing than lower levels of potassium application 3 2 shoot parameters shoot length and shoot dry weight at 45 and 90 days of peanut growth stages affected significantly by mulching salinity levels and potassium application but at harvest stage did not show any significant effect mean maximum value of shoot length and dry shoot weight was highest in 0 ds m 1 salinity level compared to 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 at 45 and 90 das table 2 polythene mulch showed tremendous positive effect on shoot length linearly with increase of salinity stress 0 ds m 1 to 4 0 ds m 1 compared to no mulch plots polythene mulch increased shoot length by 28 7 18 4 18 7 under 0 dsm 1 salinity 36 0 22 2 7 8 under 2 0 ds m 1 salinity and 34 6 25 9 13 1 under 4 0 dsm 1 salinity at 45 90 das and at harvest respectively likewise application of polythene mulch increased dry shoot weight by 61 9 67 7 37 8 under 0 ds m 1 salinity 81 7 71 6 24 5 under 2 0 ds m 1 salinity and 60 1 51 4 11 9 under 4 0 ds m 1 salinity at 45 90 das and at harvest than no polythene mulch plots respectively similarly potassium application enhanced shoot length significantly at 45 90 das and at harvest however no application of potassium control and 30 kg k2o ha 1 enhanced shoot length significantly at all the growth stages over 60 kg k2o ha 1 potassium applied plots interestingly 60 kg k2o ha 1 applied plots recorded highest dry shoot weight than others however these treatments did not differ significantly except at 45 days after sowing 3 3 yield and yield attributes peanut pod and haulm yields varied significantly under variable salinity mulching and potash application levels table 3 application of polythene mulch increased pod yield and haulm yield of peanut by 23 9 and 24 6 respectively compared to without mulch plots likewise salinity imposed treatments reduced pod and haulm yields especially at the higher stress level significantly higher pod yield 2 61 mg ha 1 was recorded with 2 0 ds m 1 salinity and it was 22 5 higher compared to 4 0 ds m 1 salinity level similarly imposition of salinity stress drastically reduced haulm yield by 21 4 at 4 0 ds m 1 salinity compared to no salinity stress plots potassium application had significant impact on pod yield and it was significantly higher under 60 kg k2o ha 1 2 50 mg ha 1 applied plots over other plots though potassium application did not influence haulm yield significantly yet it was highest in no potassium applied plots 3 88 mg ha 1 and least was observed with 60 kg k2o applied plots 3 59 mg ha 1 therefore the combined effect of mulching salinity potassium levels was significant and it was highest for the treatment combination of 2 0 ds m 1 salinity 30 kg k2o ha 1 plastic mulching s2 k2 m1 2 42 mg ha 1 over other combinations and it was at par with s2 k1 m1 table 3 yield attributes like 100 pod weight and100 kernel weight were did not influenced significantly by salinity and mulching applied plots during 2014 and 2015 though yield attributes did not influence significantly polythene mulch applied plots exhibited higher 100 pod weight 100 kernel weight and shelling percent by 6 3 6 0 and 1 4 respectively over non mulch plots during the study seasons similarly the highest 100 pod weight recorded at no salinity stress plots 0 ds m 1 81 5 g which was 12 4 higher than that of 4 0 ds m 1 salinity 74 6 g table 3 however salinity levels did not differ significantly on 100 kernel weight during 2014 and 2015 whereas potassium fertilization influenced significantly on 100 pod weight 100 kernel weight and shelling per cent during 2014 and 2015 application of potassium at 60 kg k2o ha 1 improved pooled 100 pod weight 81 1 g and shelling percent 67 9 significantly compared to lower levels of potassium application the combined effect of salinity mulching potash was significant on 100 pod weight and shelling percent significantly higher 100 pod weight of 88 4 g was recorded with 2 0 ds m 1 salinity 60 kg k2o ha 1 plastic mulching over other combinations table 3 3 4 biochemical traits biochemical traits except phenols were influenced significantly by mulching salinity stress and potassium application during 2014 and 2015 table 4 polythene mulching exhibited significantly higher oil content 49 5 over no mulch plots whereas as no mulch plots recorded significantly higher sugar content 6 0 and free amino acids faa 0 12 over polythene mulch plots though application of polythene mulch increased oil content by 0 3 sugar content significantly decreased by 2 83 fig 1 however protein content and phenols did not influence significantly by mulching treatments salinity levels influenced significantly on protein content oil content sugar content and faa during both the crop seasons lower level of salinity 2 0 ds m 1 and no salinity stress plots enhanced oil content and faa whereas for protein and sugar contents were marginally increased with increase in salinity stress significantly higher oil content 49 5 and faa 0 122 were recorded with 2 0 ds m 1 and no salinity stress plots over 4 0 ds m 1 salinity plots the oil content decreased by 1 78 under salinity imposed plots compared to control plots fig 1 however higher salinity level of 4 0 ds m 1 enhanced protein and sugar content significantly in peanut seeds over lower levels of salinity likewise application of potassium at 60 kg k2o ha 1 recorded significantly higher oil content 49 6 over lower levels of potassium application interestingly protein content in peanut seeds decreased with increased levels of potassium application whereas no application of potassium recorded significantly higher protein content 29 9 and sugar content 5 92 over application of potassium fertilizers however potassium application did not show any significant difference on phenols and faa of peanut 3 5 potassium and sodium accumulation partitioning of peanut plant parts showed that mulching salinity and potassium application had greater impact on potassium and sodium accumulation fig 2 3 irrespective of treatment effects na concentration was found to be in the order of root shell shoot kernel fig 2 3 salinity treatment resulted in significant increase in na concentration in different plant parts with maximum increment observed in root tissues peanut showed comparatively less na accumulation in roots under polythene mulching compared to no mulching control however the na accumulation was much similar in shell shoot and kernel under both mulch treatments unlike tissue na content the k content showed an opposite trend and a sequential decrease in k uptake was observed with increasing level of salinity fig 2 3 differential accumulation of k was observed under salinity stress in different plant parts and the tissue concentration was found in the order of kernel shoot shell root a slight increase in k content was observed under polythene mulching than that of no mulching in all the plant parts further application of k also reduced the uptake of na and enhances the k uptake by adjusting the tissue ionic balance to some extent which suggested an ameliorative effect of polythene mulching and supplementary k in saline stress environment principal component analysis pca was performed to study performance of mulching and potash application under saline conditions by using all the traits under study and is presented in fig 5 and table s1 pca identified five significant principal components which together explained 84 4 variation in the data breakdown of this cumulative variance revealed contribution of 52 1 and 11 9 for pc 1 and pc 2 respectively components 3 pc 3 and 4 pc 4 contributed 8 9 and 6 9 towards cumulative variance discriminating power of principle components as

inferior for the characters under study treatment biplot fig 5 made a clear distinction between mulching treatments as m1 polythene mulch and m2 no mulch treatments were clustered separately both the m1 and m2clusters further were divided into two sub clusters each with the treatment involving s3 4 0 ds m 1 forming one sub cluster whereas s1 0 ds m 1 and s2 2 0 ds m 1 forming the other sub cluster 4 discussion our findings from this study suggested that imposing salinity stress had a negative impact on overall plant growth and physiological processes pal et al 2021 response and adaptability to a stressful environment were significantly different under polythene mulching and potassium fertilization chakraborty et al 2016 el mageed et al 2016 because vertisols of the semi arid tropics lack optimum soil water and favorable soil temperature in the seed zone even though sufficient water is present in the lower part of the soil profile seedling emergence of peanut is frequently limited ghosh et al 2006 for most of the parameters studied polythene mulch and external potassium fertilization improved salt tolerance particularly under stress conditions previous research has shown that mulching with various materials is a promising technique for reducing agricultural salinity bezborodov and pang et al 2010 2010 thus we focus on the differential response of polythene mulch and supplementary potassium fertilization on peanut under salinity stress 4 1 mulching effect application of polythene mulch keeps the root zone moist for longer periods and dilutes salt concentration jain et al 2017 el mageed et al 2016 in the current study for both 2013 14 and 2014 15 study years most of the growth yield and yield contributing characters of peanut in were significantly influenced by mulch treatments all the cases control plots no mulch had the lowest performance polythene mulch exhibited higher pod haulm yield and oil content of peanut by 23 9 24 6 and 49 5 than without mulch plots respectively table 3 the improved growth and yield attributes of peanut under polythene mulch could be attributed to reduced evaporation losses caused by less weed growth which resulted in increased soil moisture content thus polythene mulch plots exhibited higher growth and yield attributes of peanut several field studies have shown that mulches improve yield in peanut ravankar et al 2003 pawar etal 2004 ghosh et al 2006 jain et al 2017 meena et al 2018 in maize xu et al 2015 and sunflower zhao et al 2016 concurrently polythene mulching increased germination due to increased soil water and soil temperature according to shaikh et al 2004 ghosh et al 2006 jain et al 2017 the time required for seedling emergence was also shortened due to increase in soil temperature by 4 50 c under polythene mulch than without mulching similarly peanut root length and dry root weight were significantly higher under polythene mulch than in non mulch plots at 45 90 das and harvest under different salinity stress conditions table 1 2 in this study a thin film of mulch gauge 7 mm produced higher pod yield of summer peanut than thick film 50 mm and could be retained throughout the growing season samui and ambhore 2000 kathmale et al 2000 jain et al 2017 similarly the association of growth yield and biochemical traits under mulching plots revealed that all growth traits contributed positively for obtaining higher yield and biochemical traits in peanut fig s1 the polythene mulching consistently assisted in retaining lower electrical conductivity ec ph and na concentration with high k concentration in soil figs 2 3 4 it could be because of mulch prevents direct evaporation of soil water resulting in higher soil moisture in the root zone than no mulch however polythene mulching retained more soil water with low salt concentration ec and na in root zone from germination to maturity fig 4 thus low salt concentration and high soil water under polythene mulching during the crop growth period to achieve higher pod yield and haulm yield of peanut el mageed et al 2016 retention of low electrical conductivity ec with lower na concentration in root zone reduces the deleterious effect of salts on overall plant growth and yield attributing traits due to maintaining favorable high soil water under polythene mulching throughout the crop growth especially at relatively sensitive growth stages germination and pod development a higher number of nodules improves nitrogen fixation relative water content flower numbers mature pod numbers and pod yield per plant similarly sedaghati et al 2016 found that using plastic mulch reduced soil surface salinity from 30 8 to 51 8 when compared to the control optimum soil moisture with low electrical conductivity ph and na concentration under polythene mulching during pod development stage boosts crop growth resulting in better pod and seed development of peanut khan 2002 khistaria et al 1994 as a result enhanced yields under polythene mulching exhibited significantly higher oil content 49 4 over no mulch plots while no mulch plots had significantly higher sugar content 5 88 and free amino acids faa 0 12 over polythene mulch plots table 4 4 2 salinity plant growth is generally hampered by salinity stress first due to its osmotic effect and then due to the more deleterious specific ion toxicity effect thus plants began to exhibit altered plant water status during the phase i stage of soil salinity with little effect on cell turgor munns 2005 plant salt tolerance is typically associated with a relative loss of biomass in saline versus non saline condition over a relatively long period greenway and munns 1980 islam et al 2019 with a few exceptions salinity levels significantly influenced most of the growth yield and yield contributing characters of peanut studied in this current study when compared to no salinity levels imposing salinity stress increased nodule count by 46 4 133 2 table 1 however higher salinity stress reduced pod yield by 22 5 pal et al 2021 meena et al 2017 2018 under non saline 0 ds m 1 conditions polythene mulch produced significantly p 0 05 more biomass both pod and haulm yield than higher salinity levels of 2 0 and 4 0 ds m 1 with imposition of salinity stress the reduction in growth yield yield attributes and biochemical parameters was observed and this reduction was less under polythene mulching than without mulching jain et al 2017 it has been noticed that increasing salinity reduces oil while increasing protein and sugar content fig 1 however effect of salinity on biochemical composition of peanut was well documented by meena and yadav 2018 pal et al 2021 but biochemical traits influenced with polythene mulch application is a novel work in vertisols as a result in the current study salinity levels significantly reduced free amino acids faa and oil content from 49 6 0 ds m 1 to 48 7 4 0 ds m 1 however protein and sugar contents increased marginally with increasing salinity stress under verisols reduction in phenol and free amino acids under higher salinity levels was also observed by meena et al 2014 mahatma et al 2016 a significant negative correlation between oil protein and sugar contents under polythene mulching and no mulching seed was observed at the different salinity levels and it was observed to be at its greatest at the highest salinity level similarly association of growth yield and biochemical traits under salinity plots showed positivity towards each other traits in peanut crop exhibited that all the growth traits contributed positively for obtaining higher yield and biochemical traits fig s2 4 3 potassium application potassium a crucial regulator of plant metabolic processes appeared to enhance plant water uptake by controlling the osmotic potential and hydraulic conductivity of membranes by inducing a hyperactive response of plasma membrane bound aquaporins and specific k channels in the root tissue under osmotic stress conditions brought on by salinity or drought heinen et al 2009 therefore fertilization of potassium offset salinity induced yield loss and the effect was comparatively more significant under polythene mulching compared to no mulching when external potassium was applied this result advocated that application of 60 kg k2o ha 1 k3 higher availability of k even in saline conditions helped peanut to maintain better physiological status possibly through higher uptake of k or better retention of tissue k than under no k2o and 30 kg k2o ha 1 conditions because the availability of nutrients to plants including k is often hampered in saline conditions adequate availability of k in the growing environment is essential for plant growth meena et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2016 ashraf and sultana 2000 munns 2005 exogenously applied k has been shown in previous studies to promote growth and biomass production in a wide range of crops ikeda and akram et al 2005 2009 it is possible that in a saline environment with high salt concentrations the amount of naturally occurring k may inhibit plant growth chen et al 2007 in such instances increasing the k concentration in the growing medium may improve k absorption and thus offset the negative effect of salt stress zheng et al 2008 dardanelli et al 2009 and heba et al 2020 emphasized the importance of potassium fertilization in peanut under sandy loam soils of india s indo gangetic plains external potassium fertilization on the other hand had no significant effect on the biochemical traits of peanut 4 4 interaction effect the combined effect of salinity mulching potash on 100 pod weight shelling percent pod yield and haulm yield during both the study years was significant the combination of 2 0 ds m 1 salinity 30 kg k2o ha 1 plastic mulching s2 k2 m1 produced a significantly higher pod yield of 2 42 mg ha 1 over other combinations table 3 therefore using polythene mulch with 30 kg k2o ha 1 under 2 0 ds m 1 salinity level increased pod yield by 6 4 116 1 over other combinations while polythene mulch 60 kg k2o ha 1 2 0 ds m 1 salinity also resulted in higher oil content 50 2 compared to other combinations thus higher potassium availability 60 kg k2o ha 1 even in saline condition facilitated both mulching treatments in maintaining better biochemical and physiological status compared to no potassium application table 4 because the availability of essential nutrients to plants including potassium is frequently hampered in saline conditions adequate availability of these essential nutrients in growing environments created by the application of polythene mulching for plant growth is required ghosh et al 2006 meena et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2016 it is possible that in a saline environment with high salt concentrations the amount of naturally occurring potassium may suppress plant growth chen et al 2007 increasing potassium concentration with application of polythene mulching in such situations may improve availability of essential nutrient absorption including potassium and counter balance the adverse effect of salt stress meena et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2016 zheng et al 2008 this was further corroborated by pca treatment biplot fig 5 table s1 figs s1 and s2 wherein mulch and non mulch treatments formed one sub cluster and high salinity treatment 4 0 ds m 1 formed another group in the pca treatment biplot treatment combinations involving m2s3 were towards extreme left with low pod yield whereas m1s2 and m1s1 were on extreme right with high pod yield it is always desirable for peanut to have non saline and high nutrient rich environment to express its full yield potential but in presence of salinity stress nutrient availability was limited which reduces yield drastically 5 conclusion in vertisols of western india adopting plastic mulch exhibiting higher yields under lower levels of salinity polythene mulch owing to its impermeability to hot air ensures optimum temperature enhances growth and yield parameters of peanut therefore use of thin polythene mulch gauge 7 mm which is relatively a cheaper may be a right proposition for peanut growers and found to be best management practice for increasing peanut productivity in both saline and non saline conditions peanut can sustain lower level of salinity 2 0 dsm 1 to great extent with polythene mulch and also by providing optimum potassium fertilizers so using of polythene mulch with 2 0 4 0 ds m 1 salinity and 30 kg k2o ha 1could help farmers to increase the water content and to increase production levels in peanut further research on the use of mulches under higher salinity levels in peanut could provide valuable insights on soil physical and chemical properties however need to study biological properties under polythene mulching coupled with saline irrigation water and potassium application for
