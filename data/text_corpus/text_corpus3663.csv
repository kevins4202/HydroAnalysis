18315,microbial regrowth during drinking water distribution can result in a variety of problems such as a deviating taste and odor and may even pose a risk to public health frequent monitoring is essential to anticipate events of biological instability and relevant microbial parameters for operational control of biostability of drinking water should be developed here online flow cytometry and derived biological metrics were used to assess the biological stability of a full scale drinking water tower during normal and disturbed flow regime pronounced operational events such as switching from drinking water source and seasonal changes were detected in the total cell counts and regrowth was observed despite the short hydraulic residence time of 6 8 h based on the flow cytometric fingerprints the bray curtis dissimilarity was calculated and was developed as unambiguous parameter to indicate or warn for changing microbial drinking water quality during operational events in the studied water tower drastic microbial water quality changes were reflected in the bray curtis dissimilarity which demonstrates its use as an indicator to follow up and detect microbial quality changes in practice hence the bray curtis dissimilarity can be used in an online setup as a straightforward parameter during full scale operation of drinking water distribution and combined with the cell concentration it serves as an early warning system for biological instability graphical abstract image 1 keywords biostability drinking water flow cytometry online microbial monitoring drinking water distribution water tower 1 introduction excessive microbial regrowth may result in a variety of problems during drinking water distribution microbial growth and activity can entail aesthetical issues such as deviating taste and odor and may eventually form a threat to public health skjevrak et al 2004 wingender and flemming 2011 biofilms adhered to the pipe walls may cause operational problems such as loss of pressure and can accelerate pipe corrosion liu et al 2016 therefore it is important to produce drinking water that is biologically stable which implies sensu stricto that the microbial community composition and its abundance remain unchanged during distribution lautenschlager et al 2013 rittman and snoeyinck 1984 who 2011 biostability is a theoretical concept that is now becoming an operational goal prest et al 2016a biostability is most often enforced through the addition and maintenance of various disinfectants in the distribution network to eliminate the presence of viable bacteria zhang et al 2002 however disinfectants such as chlorine only have a temporary effect and may furthermore result in the availability of dead organic matter that can be used during necrotrophic and heterotrophic growth resulting in a biologically unstable system temmerman et al 2006 carcinogenic disinfection by products are known to be formed when reacting with organic matter li and mitch 2018 this has encouraged countries such as switzerland and the netherlands to focus on achieving biostability without maintaining disinfection residuals in the network but by limiting nutrients and carbon availability van der kooij et al 2013 to evaluate biostability of drinking water heterotrophic plate counts hpc are commonly used as this technique is the legal standard european communities 1998 us congress 1996 who 2011 however samples are not taken frequently enough e g weekly and the time to result 2 7 days is too long to anticipate events of biological instability to facilitate decision making when detecting events in the abundance or changes in the composition of the microbial community implementation of online monitoring techniques is necessary though they are only sporadically implemented at full scale a variety of techniques for online microbial drinking water quality monitoring are available online atp measurements allow fast i e 10 min quantification of microbial activity based on luciferin luciferase enzymatic reactions de vera and wert 2019 vang et al 2014 though cellular atp is an indicator for bacterial activity atp quantification is prone to interferences of extracellular atp and is not always correlated to regrowth nescerecka et al 2016 vang et al 2014 vital et al 2012 other enzymatic techniques have been developed for near real time selective detection of escherichia coli presence targeting the specific enzyme β glucuronidase hesari et al 2016 koschelnik et al 2015 results can be acquired within 1 2 h with good accuracy although this selective method provides information about the hygienic quality of the water it does not indicate events of general biological instability alternatively recently developed online particle counters and online flow cytometry fcm allow the direct quantification of microbial abundance in water using optical technology within 10 min besmer et al 2016 hammes et al 2012 højris et al 2016 2018 flow cytometry is the most established research technique and when combined with advanced data analysis it allows assessment of the microbial community characteristics such as viability and phenotypic diversity gillespie et al 2014 props et al 2016 established ecological biodiversity metrics such as the alpha diversity or the within sample diversity and the beta diversity or the community turnover can be calculated from the flow cytometry data based on the phenotypic traits of a microbial community props et al 2016 whittaker 1972 correspondence between the phenotypic and genotypic diversity was shown by props et al 2016 the multidimensional flow cytometric data summarized in the so called cytometric fingerprint reacts quickly to changing water quality and conditions besmer et al 2017 the advanced community data analysis is more valuable than the cell counts for decision making as it takes into account both changes in the composition and abundance of the microbial community yet as previously stated it is not often used for microbial monitoring because translation and interpretation of the results into warnings or concrete actions is currently lacking this was also one of the major conclusions of an extended review by safford and bischel 2019 concerning the implementation of fcm as microbial monitoring tool in drinking water a key point is to obtain better understanding of the microbial dynamics in full scale drinking water networks to being able to generate fundamental knowledge about the system and to define the degree of acceptable change during events of biological instability prest et al 2016a this study aims at demonstrating that advanced data analysis of flow cytometric data can be used for the development of a straightforward parameter to define the microbial water quality in a more holistic way by not only taking into account the microbial abundance but also the stability of the microbial community composition therefore a water tower with incoming drinking water produced from two different sources was chosen as full scale model setup during regular and disturbed flow regime microbial regrowth in the water tower was evaluated through total cell counts also biological metrics calculated from the flow cytometric fingerprint such as the bray curtis dissimilarity with a value between 0 and 1 that expresses how different two cytometric fingerprints are was used for the detection of operational events that resulted in a drastic microbial water quality change greenacre and primicerio 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 water tower characteristics the microbial dynamics of a water tower in flanders belgium were monitored in spring 2018 april 18th 27th and summer 2018 august 6th 27th before entering the distribution network the water is treated and disinfected after which the drinking water is transported to the water tower through a high pressure piping and from which it flows to the customers through a low pressure network fig 1 this water tower was selected specifically because two drinking water feed streams produced from different source waters enter the reservoir the first feed is produced from surface water length feeder to tower 47 58 km diameter 0 7 1 0 m and the second feed stream is produced from groundwater length feeder to tower 24 44 km diameter 1 0 m this way the most important types of drinking water i e produced from either surface water groundwater or a mixture of both are included in the monitoring setup the physicochemical characteristics of the incoming and exiting streams of the water tower are summarized in table 1 the water tower complex has a total buffering capacity of 6 500 m³ based on the average daily intake 72 48 19 14 of the drinking water entering the tower is produced from surface water with an average residence time of 6 8 h during the monitoring period in april the water composition was altered in two different ways by closing one of the two feeders during these events the incoming water consisted out of drinking water either mostly produced from surface water or completely produced from groundwater fig 1 during the first event on april 24th 07h34 23h19 the feed originated for almost 100 from surface water which is referred to as event 1 on april 26th 09h06 15h29 and also on april 27th 09h13 12h30 the feed was 100 produced from groundwater further referred to as event 2 and event 3 fig 3 during event 2 and event 3 drinking water produced from groundwater was entering through both feeders fig 1 as seasonal differences are an important factor known to affect the microbial drinking water quality during distribution systems nescerecka et al 2018 pinto et al 2014 prest et al 2016b monitoring was repeated in august 2018 without disturbances in the flow to evaluate the seasonal impact on the biostability of drinking water 2 2 flow cytometric measurements dynamics of the microbial community of the incoming streams and exiting stream were monitored with online flow cytometry samples from all streams were taken automatically every 40 min were stained and incubated for 20 2 min at 37 c prior to measurement to allow for stable staining of all cell types no pre treatment nor dilution was performed during the monitoring period in april 933 flow cytometric samples were taken 311 samples per stream and during the monitoring period in august 2049 samples were taken 683 samples per stream for automation of these measurements an oncyt oncyt microbiology ag switzerland robot was coupled to an accuri c6 flow cytometer or an accuri c6 plus flow cytometer bd biosciences belgium the flow cytometers are equipped with a blue 20 mw 488 nm and a red laser 12 5 mw 640 nm two scatter detectors configured on the blue laser and four fluorescence detectors with bandpass filters three of the bandpass filters are for the blue laser emission fl1 533 30 nm fl2 585 40 nm and fl3 670 lp and one is for the red laser emission fl4 675 25 nm the lower detection limit of flow cytometry in this type of application is in the order of 102 cells ml and the instrument precision error is below 5 independent of the cell concentration hammes et al 2008 2010 the cell concentrations in this study were at least 10 times higher than the lower detection limit ensuring accurate and precise quantification of cell concentrations in all streams milliq merck belgium was used as sheath fluid a bacteriostatic concentrate solution containing 4 65 edta and 0 82 sodium fluoride bd biosciences belgium was added 0 79 vol final concentration to prevent bacterial growth in the sheath fluid during the course of the experiments staining was performed using a 1000x dilution of sybr green i concentrate invitrogen belgium in tris buffer with ph 8 2 with a 10 vol final concentration flow cytometry samples were run in fixed volume mode 50 μl at a flow rate of 66 μl min a cavro xcalibur pump tecan trading ag switzerland with 12 channels connects the necessary fluidics air and waste with the three chambers in the oncyt robot the pump regime is adapted to the desired sampling frequency 40 min interval and size 800 μl total volume using the oncyt software 2 3 data analysis flow cytometric data was analyzed in r v3 4 4 flow cytometry standard fcs files were imported using the flowcore package v1 44 2 hahne et al 2009 the flowai package v1 14 0 was used to check the flow cytometry data quality and to remove events having anomalous values in terms of flow rate stability signal acquisition and the dynamic range caused by technical issues monaco et al 2016 background noise caused by abiotic interferences was removed by manually drawing a gate based on the fl1 and fl3 fluorescence data as the combination of these two fluorescence parameters results in the most optimal signal and noise separation for drinking water samples hammes and egli 2005 2010 further data processing was done using the phenoflow package v1 1 1 based on the signal height values with rescaling based on the maximum fl1 fluorescence signal height fl1 h after gating of the bacterial population as described by props et al 2016 to detect the impact of the disturbed flow regimes on the microbiological quality of water phenotypic community analysis was performed on the fcm data by the use of advanced fingerprinting props et al 2016 rogers and holyst 2009 in this analysis the flow cytometry data of every sample is transformed discretized and concatenated into a one dimensional vector that serves as basis for further phenotypic community analysis fingerprinting was performed using probability binning approach of the package flowfp v1 40 1 constructing a model grid with 5 recursions 25 bins rogers and holyst 2009 the model was built based on the fluorescence signal height values fl1 h and fl3 h of all samples from these fingerprints beta diversity analysis and bray curtis dissimilarity calculations were performed using the vegan package v2 5 4 oksanen et al 2019 resampling to the lowest sample size n 124 cells was performed prior to beta diversity analysis to account for size dependent differences the bray curtis dissimilarity was chosen above other biological metrics derived from the cytometric fingerprints e g phenotypic typing fig s1 and diversity analysis to evaluate differences between the microbial community of samples as with regard to the industry s needs this is an easily interpretable unequivocal parameter quantifying the difference between two cytometric fingerprints furthermore this is a frequently used quantitative dissimilarity index with ecological value bray and curtis 1957 legendre and legendre 2012 two identical fingerprints will have a bray curtis dissimilarity of 0 whereas two fingerprints that have no non empty bins in common will have a bray curtis dissimilarity of 1 greenacre and primicerio 2014 a sufficiently large representative set of samples taken during normal operation of the water tower at the beginning of each monitoring period was taken as a baseline n 104 in april n 106 in august for dissimilarity comparison the bray curtis dissimilarity that was assigned to a sample was calculated as the average of the bray curtis dissimilarities between that sample and all of the baseline samples fig 5 as a basis for decisions concerning biological instability a threshold for event detection was set at the average bray curtis dissimilarity calculated between all baseline samples plus three times the standard deviation of this distribution this is a rather conservative threshold that finds its origin in the normal distribution where it will include 99 87 of the data and thus regard the remaining 0 13 as deviating events howell et al 1998 this method was carried out to account for inter sample variability resulting in a threshold of 0 301 in the case of the monitoring period in april fig 5 2 4 statistics correlation between variables was calculated using the pearson correlation coefficient rp for linear correlations prior to calculation of correlations the normality and homoscedasticity of the data was checked and approved fig s2 all statistical analyses were performed in r using the stats package v 3 5 2 the anosim analysis in the vegan package v2 5 4 with 100 permutations was used to determine differences between the cytometric fingerprints of different water types 2 5 data availability the raw flow cytometry data sets have been deposited on flowrepository and are publicly available under accession id fr fcm z25u april monitoring campaign and accession id fr fcm z25t august monitoring campaign 3 results a water tower was monitored in spring using online flow cytometry to simultaneously assess the microbial dynamics in the incoming and exiting streams at high frequency obtaining the results in real time by taking a sample of all streams every 40 min fig 1 incoming drinking water produced from groundwater had a lower average cell density 3 1 0 8 103 cells ml than incoming drinking water produced from surface water 1 8 0 3 104 cells ml fig 2 the cell concentrations in the exiting water stream were the highest 2 7 0 7 104 cells ml and followed the dynamics of the incoming water produced from surface water rp 0 74 p 0 001 the exiting flow showed a recurring diurnal pattern in function of the water demand with a peak in the morning and consisted mainly i e 72 48 19 14 of water produced from surface water fig 3 during the monitoring period in april the water composition was altered in two different ways by closing of one of the two feeders during event 1 the water entering the tower originated nearly 100 from surface water whilst during event 2 and event 3 the water entering the tower was 100 produced from groundwater during the switch towards 100 of drinking water produced from groundwater the cell density in the incoming water produced from surface water dropped as well as groundwater was flowing through both feeders fig 1 during all flow regimes the total exiting flow rate remained unaffected fig 3 to evaluate the changes and differences in the microbial community based on the cytometric fingerprints beta diversity analysis was performed using principal coordinates analysis pcoa of the cytometric fingerprints the analysis reduces the dimension of the cytometric fingerprints and allows visualization of differences between cytometric fingerprints as the proximity of samples hence samples containing microbial communities with similar phenotypic traits are plotted closer to each other this analysis showed three significantly separated r 0 55 p 0 01 perm 100 anosim communities associated with both incoming waters and the exiting water fig 4 the difference between the samples of the microbial community of the exiting water red and the incoming drinking water produced from surface water blue was less pronounced as the latter comprises for 72 48 19 14 of the incoming feed during the events the fingerprint of the exiting water changed as most of the variance of the data set was captured within the first axis x axis the severity of the change of the cytometric fingerprint of the exiting water during event 2 and 3 fig 4b that followed this axis was substantially larger than the shift during event 1 fig 4a the biggest differences between exiting samples and their steady state position were observed at the end of events as the aim was to provide an unequivocal parameter for online microbial drinking water assessment using advanced flow cytometry data analysis the proximity of events was calculated using the bray curtis dissimilarity a sufficiently large representative set of samples taken during normal operation of the water tower at the beginning of the monitoring period was taken as a baseline n 104 for dissimilarity comparison fig 5 based on the distribution of the baseline bray curtis dissimilarity a threshold of 0 301 was set for event detection in the exiting stream this method indicated a microbial water quality change when switching towards a single feed water produced from groundwater event 2 and event 3 the feed change towards nearly 100 drinking water produced from surface water event 1 was not indicated as a microbial water quality change as all bray curtis dissimilarities compared to the baseline regime were below 0 301 during that event monitoring was repeated in august to evaluate the seasonal influences on the biostability of the drinking water the regrowth i e the proportional difference between the average cell concentration in the exiting and incoming water in august was not higher than the regrowth measured in april although on average the temperature was higher and free chlorine concentrations were lower table 2 the exiting stream contained a higher 6 1 2 1 104 cells ml average cell density than incoming drinking water produced from surface water 4 7 1 8 104 cells ml fig 6 a the cell concentrations in the feed produced from groundwater were the lowest 3 3 1 9 104 cells ml compared to the measurements in spring the measured cell concentrations were higher on average in all streams with a ten times higher microbial load in the incoming water produced from groundwater the microbial cell density in the incoming water produced from surface water was 2 5 times higher and the exiting water had a 2 2 times higher microbial load than in april the bacterial cell concentration in both incoming waters showed a steadily increase over time as a result of the loss of residual free chlorine in the system and an exceptionally high water temperature during the extremely hot summer months as confirmed by the drinking water provider based on the distribution of the baseline bray curtis dissimilarity n 106 a threshold of 0 391 was set for event detection in the exiting stream the gradual regrowth attributed to a loss of chlorine residual was not indicated as event in the exiting stream only at the end of the monitoring period the bray curtis dissimilarity indicated a change in microbial drinking water quality fig 6d this is in contrast to the incoming streams where gradual changes were reflected in the bray curtis dissimilarity around august 14 17th fig 6bc for the incoming streams the threshold was 0 457 and 0 303 for the stream produced from groundwater and surface water respectively 4 discussion 4 1 continuous full scale monitoring of microbial drinking water quality using online flow cytometry online flow cytometric measurements of the incoming and exiting streams of a water tower showed clear regrowth despite the short hydraulic residence time of 6 8 h fig 2 the cell concentration of the exiting stream followed the fluctuations of the cell concentration of the incoming water produced from surface water because this feed stream accounted for 72 48 19 14 of the total incoming feed these fluctuations can be interpreted as short term operational variability and are most likely caused by changes in the drinking water production and or source water quality nescerecka et al 2018 mixing of both incoming waters may result in a more balanced nutrient composition and hence facilitate bacterial regrowth in the water tower because both streams may have different limiting nutrients which may on the long term result in higher biological instability this mixing effect has been previously observed in grab samples of full scale drinking water distribution systems where the biological instability or regrowth potential was higher in mixed samples than samples produced from single water sources nescerecka et al 2014 2018 niquette et al 2001 however in this study regrowth was the highest when feeding the tower only with drinking water produced from surface water on the contrary shifting towards a single groundwater source steeply decreased the cell concentration of the exiting stream these effects stem from the differences in water source as groundwater generally harbors a 10 100 times lower microbial load than surface water besmer and hammes 2016 this is often attributed to the lower nutrient concentration with lower organic carbon concentrations in particular hofmann and griebler 2018 prest et al 2016b this is also the case for this study in which the total organic carbon concentration toc of the drinking water produced from groundwater was lower 0 74 0 12 mg l average of 2018 measured at the production site than the drinking water produced from surface water 1 77 0 48 mg l average of 2018 measured at the production site both disturbed flow regimes were reflected in the cell concentration measured using online flow cytometry showing its value as parameter for monitoring microbial drinking water quality and event detection monitoring was repeated in august to evaluate the long term biostability of the water with higher water temperatures and lower free chlorine concentrations table 2 fig 6a compared to the measurements in spring the measured cell concentrations were higher on average in all streams with even a ten times higher microbial load in the incoming water produced from groundwater furthermore the bacterial cell concentration of this stream showed a steady increase over time due to the loss of residual free chlorine at the entrance of the system after august 14th which was confirmed by the drinking water provider also the extremely hot summer months of 2018 resulted in exceptionally high water temperature up to 20 c for longer periods of time sustaining bacterial regrowth in the network seasonal changes influencing the drinking water temperature have been previously observed to affect biostability of drinking water systems nescerecka et al 2018 pinto et al 2014 prest et al 2016b also the loss of residual chlorine caused a clear increase in the microbial abundance in the usually stable incoming stream produced from groundwater this means that the bacterial community in the water tower is not truly biostable as bacterial regrowth occurs substantially when the chlorine residual is no longer detected lautenschlager et al 2013 monitoring of the bacterial regrowth is thus valuable to understand biostability in the drinking water network besides this interpretation of the high dimensional flow cytometric data and quantification of microbial water quality changes in an unambiguous way are needed for full scale operational use in the drinking water industry safford and bischel 2019 we therefore propose the development of a parameter derived from flow cytometric fingerprinting for online event detection as it not only takes into account the microbial abundance but also changes in the microbial community composition as basis for indicating water quality changes 4 2 cytometric fingerprinting for online event detection in a full scale system to evaluate the effect of operational changes in flow regime on the microbial community the cytometric fingerprints of the microbial communities were compared fig 4 the pcoa analysis revealed that samples taken from the feed produced from groundwater harbor a different community than samples taken from both other streams based on the multidimensional fcm data this was confirmed in an additional analysis in which the communities were divided in two different community types using k medoids clustering based on their cytometric fingerprint as described by props et al 2018 fig s1 this algorithm could distinguish two different community types indicating that the bacterial community in the feed water produced from groundwater was different from the bacterial communities in both other streams in line with these analyses the events when groundwater was used as the single drinking water source for the tower could be detected based on the cytometric fingerprints however the outcome of these analyses is abstract and lacks nuance making it difficult to interpret consequently is less suited for operational decision making in practice concerning microbial water quality changes complementary to the total cell concentration we propose the additional implementation of the pairwise bray curtis dissimilarity between fingerprints as straightforward metric to detect deviating events that caused a microbial water quality change fig 5 fig 6 bcd based on the average bray curtis dissimilarity between cytometric fingerprints of samples taken in the baseline regime plus three times the standard deviation a conservative threshold was determined for event detection the two independent data sets of april and august showed similar results an average baseline bray curtis dissimilarity during normal regime of 0 19 0 04 and 0 22 0 05 respectively resulting in a threshold of 0 301 and 0 391 in this respect we define an event as two or more subsequent samples having a higher bray curtis dissimilarity relative to the baseline single outlying data points e g august 10th 13h36 in exiting stream fig 6d are therefore not considered as real event of biological instability caused by a water quality change as the detection of a single event could be caused by imperfect measurements or a short nonstructural change when evaluating the monitoring campaign in april this method indicated a microbial water quality change when switching towards a single feed water produced from groundwater event 2 and event 3 the feed change towards nearly 100 drinking water produced from surface water event 1 was not indicated as a microbial water quality change as all bray curtis dissimilarities compared to the baseline regime were below 0 301 this is in line with our expectations as the change from 72 towards a nearly pure feed almost 100 originating from surface water is smaller compared to the changing from 28 to 100 feed produced from groundwater sudden and large changes were unambiguously detected however during the monitoring period in august gradual regrowth attributed to the temperature increase and the loss of chlorine residual was not indicated as event in the exiting stream only at the end of the monitoring period the bray curtis dissimilarity indicated a change in microbial drinking water quality fig 6d this is in contrast to the incoming streams where gradual changes were reflected in the bray curtis dissimilarity around august 14 17th fig 6bc these changes were also observed in the cell concentrations of these streams increase of the drinking water temperature combined with a loss of chlorine residual will result in regrowth and thus biological instability gillespie et al 2014 hoefel et al 2005 nescerecka et al 2014 the effect of temperature increase and chlorine residual loss was observed in both the bray curtis dissimilarity and the cell concentrations overall we present the bray curtis dissimilarity as a straightforward basis for decision making concerning the degree of acceptable change based on high dimensional flow cytometric data hereby we define the degree of acceptable change as all bray curtis dissimilarities below the threshold which is calculated as compared to a representative set of samples taken during the normal flow regime the combination of the total cell concentration and the bray curtis dissimilarity is a more holistic approach for microbial drinking water quality changes than considering solely the cell concentration as it also considers the stability of the microbial community composition the meaning of the bray curtis dissimilarity between cytometric fingerprints can be interpreted in a complementary way to the cell concentration in the water for example increasing cell concentrations in combination with a stable bray curtis dissimilarity over time e g event 1 indicate a community that is structurally stable despite the occurrence of limited regrowth hence the information of both parameters should be combined for the detection of water quality changes and the development of early warning systems in the drinking water industry more specifically the combination of a static alarm based on the total cell concentration to indicate excessive regrowth and a dynamic alarm based on the bray curtis dissimilarity compared to a representative normal baseline situation forms a holistic basis for a first smart screening for further decision making concerning the microbial drinking water quality when placed at strategic points in the drinking water network such as the water tower discussed in this research it can be realistically implemented to safeguard the drinking water quality as cost effective technology providing easily interpretable parameters to the industry 5 conclusion flow cytometric monitoring of drinking water networks allows the collection of extensive and detailed data compared to e g weekly plating from this full scale monitoring campaign it was concluded that even though the microbial water quality complies with the legal standards the studied full scale drinking water tower is not always biologically stable changes in drinking water source increase in temperature and lack of residual chlorine drastically impacted both the cell concentrations and bray curtis dissimilarity derived from the flow cytometric fingerprints compared to the baseline situation we demonstrated that the analysis of flow cytometric data can be used as basis for the development of straightforward parameters to define the microbial water quality in a holistic way by combining the microbial abundance cell concentrations and the stability of the microbial community composition bray curtis dissimilarity this is an example on full scale of how flow cytometric fingerprinting can be used as sensitive early warning system for changes in water quality declaration of competing interest the

diversity gillespie et al 2014 props et al 2016 established ecological biodiversity metrics such as the alpha diversity or the within sample diversity and the beta diversity or the community turnover can be calculated from the flow cytometry data based on the phenotypic traits of a microbial community props et al 2016 whittaker 1972 correspondence between the phenotypic and genotypic diversity was shown by props et al 2016 the multidimensional flow cytometric data summarized in the so called cytometric fingerprint reacts quickly to changing water quality and conditions besmer et al 2017 the advanced community data analysis is more valuable than the cell counts for decision making as it takes into account both changes in the composition and abundance of the microbial community yet as previously stated it is not often used for microbial monitoring because translation and interpretation of the results into warnings or concrete actions is currently lacking this was also one of the major conclusions of an extended review by safford and bischel 2019 concerning the implementation of fcm as microbial monitoring tool in drinking water a key point is to obtain better understanding of the microbial dynamics in full scale drinking water networks to being able to generate fundamental knowledge about the system and to define the degree of acceptable change during events of biological instability prest et al 2016a this study aims at demonstrating that advanced data analysis of flow cytometric data can be used for the development of a straightforward parameter to define the microbial water quality in a more holistic way by not only taking into account the microbial abundance but also the stability of the microbial community composition therefore a water tower with incoming drinking water produced from two different sources was chosen as full scale model setup during regular and disturbed flow regime microbial regrowth in the water tower was evaluated through total cell counts also biological metrics calculated from the flow cytometric fingerprint such as the bray curtis dissimilarity with a value between 0 and 1 that expresses how different two cytometric fingerprints are was used for the detection of operational events that resulted in a drastic microbial water quality change greenacre and primicerio 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 water tower characteristics the microbial dynamics of a water tower in flanders belgium were monitored in spring 2018 april 18th 27th and summer 2018 august 6th 27th before entering the distribution network the water is treated and disinfected after which the drinking water is transported to the water tower through a high pressure piping and from which it flows to the customers through a low pressure network fig 1 this water tower was selected specifically because two drinking water feed streams produced from different source waters enter the reservoir the first feed is produced from surface water length feeder to tower 47 58 km diameter 0 7 1 0 m and the second feed stream is produced from groundwater length feeder to tower 24 44 km diameter 1 0 m this way the most important types of drinking water i e produced from either surface water groundwater or a mixture of both are included in the monitoring setup the physicochemical characteristics of the incoming and exiting streams of the water tower are summarized in table 1 the water tower complex has a total buffering capacity of 6 500 m³ based on the average daily intake 72 48 19 14 of the drinking water entering the tower is produced from surface water with an average residence time of 6 8 h during the monitoring period in april the water composition was altered in two different ways by closing one of the two feeders during these events the incoming water consisted out of drinking water either mostly produced from surface water or completely produced from groundwater fig 1 during the first event on april 24th 07h34 23h19 the feed originated for almost 100 from surface water which is referred to as event 1 on april 26th 09h06 15h29 and also on april 27th 09h13 12h30 the feed was 100 produced from groundwater further referred to as event 2 and event 3 fig 3 during event 2 and event 3 drinking water produced from groundwater was entering through both feeders fig 1 as seasonal differences are an important factor known to affect the microbial drinking water quality during distribution systems nescerecka et al 2018 pinto et al 2014 prest et al 2016b monitoring was repeated in august 2018 without disturbances in the flow to evaluate the seasonal impact on the biostability of drinking water 2 2 flow cytometric measurements dynamics of the microbial community of the incoming streams and exiting stream were monitored with online flow cytometry samples from all streams were taken automatically every 40 min were stained and incubated for 20 2 min at 37 c prior to measurement to allow for stable staining of all cell types no pre treatment nor dilution was performed during the monitoring period in april 933 flow cytometric samples were taken 311 samples per stream and during the monitoring period in august 2049 samples were taken 683 samples per stream for automation of these measurements an oncyt oncyt microbiology ag switzerland robot was coupled to an accuri c6 flow cytometer or an accuri c6 plus flow cytometer bd biosciences belgium the flow cytometers are equipped with a blue 20 mw 488 nm and a red laser 12 5 mw 640 nm two scatter detectors configured on the blue laser and four fluorescence detectors with bandpass filters three of the bandpass filters are for the blue laser emission fl1 533 30 nm fl2 585 40 nm and fl3 670 lp and one is for the red laser emission fl4 675 25 nm the lower detection limit of flow cytometry in this type of application is in the order of 102 cells ml and the instrument precision error is below 5 independent of the cell concentration hammes et al 2008 2010 the cell concentrations in this study were at least 10 times higher than the lower detection limit ensuring accurate and precise quantification of cell concentrations in all streams milliq merck belgium was used as sheath fluid a bacteriostatic concentrate solution containing 4 65 edta and 0 82 sodium fluoride bd biosciences belgium was added 0 79 vol final concentration to prevent bacterial growth in the sheath fluid during the course of the experiments staining was performed using a 1000x dilution of sybr green i concentrate invitrogen belgium in tris buffer with ph 8 2 with a 10 vol final concentration flow cytometry samples were run in fixed volume mode 50 μl at a flow rate of 66 μl min a cavro xcalibur pump tecan trading ag switzerland with 12 channels connects the necessary fluidics air and waste with the three chambers in the oncyt robot the pump regime is adapted to the desired sampling frequency 40 min interval and size 800 μl total volume using the oncyt software 2 3 data analysis flow cytometric data was analyzed in r v3 4 4 flow cytometry standard fcs files were imported using the flowcore package v1 44 2 hahne et al 2009 the flowai package v1 14 0 was used to check the flow cytometry data quality and to remove events having anomalous values in terms of flow rate stability signal acquisition and the dynamic range caused by technical issues monaco et al 2016 background noise caused by abiotic interferences was removed by manually drawing a gate based on the fl1 and fl3 fluorescence data as the combination of these two fluorescence parameters results in the most optimal signal and noise separation for drinking water samples hammes and egli 2005 2010 further data processing was done using the phenoflow package v1 1 1 based on the signal height values with rescaling based on the maximum fl1 fluorescence signal height fl1 h after gating of the bacterial population as described by props et al 2016 to detect the impact of the disturbed flow regimes on the microbiological quality of water phenotypic community analysis was performed on the fcm data by the use of advanced fingerprinting props et al 2016 rogers and holyst 2009 in this analysis the flow cytometry data of every sample is transformed discretized and concatenated into a one dimensional vector that serves as basis for further phenotypic community analysis fingerprinting was performed using probability binning approach of the package flowfp v1 40 1 constructing a model grid with 5 recursions 25 bins rogers and holyst 2009 the model was built based on the fluorescence signal height values fl1 h and fl3 h of all samples from these fingerprints beta diversity analysis and bray curtis dissimilarity calculations were performed using the vegan package v2 5 4 oksanen et al 2019 resampling to the lowest sample size n 124 cells was performed prior to beta diversity analysis to account for size dependent differences the bray curtis dissimilarity was chosen above other biological metrics derived from the cytometric fingerprints e g phenotypic typing fig s1 and diversity analysis to evaluate differences between the microbial community of samples as with regard to the industry s needs this is an easily interpretable unequivocal parameter quantifying the difference between two cytometric fingerprints furthermore this is a frequently used quantitative dissimilarity index with ecological value bray and curtis 1957 legendre and legendre 2012 two identical fingerprints will have a bray curtis dissimilarity of 0 whereas two fingerprints that have no non empty bins in common will have a bray curtis dissimilarity of 1 greenacre and primicerio 2014 a sufficiently large representative set of samples taken during normal operation of the water tower at the beginning of each monitoring period was taken as a baseline n 104 in april n 106 in august for dissimilarity comparison the bray curtis dissimilarity that was assigned to a sample was calculated as the average of the bray curtis dissimilarities between that sample and all of the baseline samples fig 5 as a basis for decisions concerning biological instability a threshold for event detection was set at the average bray curtis dissimilarity calculated between all baseline samples plus three times the standard deviation of this distribution this is a rather conservative threshold that finds its origin in the normal distribution where it will include 99 87 of the data and thus regard the remaining 0 13 as deviating events howell et al 1998 this method was carried out to account for inter sample variability resulting in a threshold of 0 301 in the case of the monitoring period in april fig 5 2 4 statistics correlation between variables was calculated using the pearson correlation coefficient rp for linear correlations prior to calculation of correlations the normality and homoscedasticity of the data was checked and approved fig s2 all statistical analyses were performed in r using the stats package v 3 5 2 the anosim analysis in the vegan package v2 5 4 with 100 permutations was used to determine differences between the cytometric fingerprints of different water types 2 5 data availability the raw flow cytometry data sets have been deposited on flowrepository and are publicly available under accession id fr fcm z25u april monitoring campaign and accession id fr fcm z25t august monitoring campaign 3 results a water tower was monitored in spring using online flow cytometry to simultaneously assess the microbial dynamics in the incoming and exiting streams at high frequency obtaining the results in real time by taking a sample of all streams every 40 min fig 1 incoming drinking water produced from groundwater had a lower average cell density 3 1 0 8 103 cells ml than incoming drinking water produced from surface water 1 8 0 3 104 cells ml fig 2 the cell concentrations in the exiting water stream were the highest 2 7 0 7 104 cells ml and followed the dynamics of the incoming water produced from surface water rp 0 74 p 0 001 the exiting flow showed a recurring diurnal pattern in function of the water demand with a peak in the morning and consisted mainly i e 72 48 19 14 of water produced from surface water fig 3 during the monitoring period in april the water composition was altered in two different ways by closing of one of the two feeders during event 1 the water entering the tower originated nearly 100 from surface water whilst during event 2 and event 3 the water entering the tower was 100 produced from groundwater during the switch towards 100 of drinking water produced from groundwater the cell density in the incoming water produced from surface water dropped as well as groundwater was flowing through both feeders fig 1 during all flow regimes the total exiting flow rate remained unaffected fig 3 to evaluate the changes and differences in the microbial community based on the cytometric fingerprints beta diversity analysis was performed using principal coordinates analysis pcoa of the cytometric fingerprints the analysis reduces the dimension of the cytometric fingerprints and allows visualization of differences between cytometric fingerprints as the proximity of samples hence samples containing microbial communities with similar phenotypic traits are plotted closer to each other this analysis showed three significantly separated r 0 55 p 0 01 perm 100 anosim communities associated with both incoming waters and the exiting water fig 4 the difference between the samples of the microbial community of the exiting water red and the incoming drinking water produced from surface water blue was less pronounced as the latter comprises for 72 48 19 14 of the incoming feed during the events the fingerprint of the exiting water changed as most of the variance of the data set was captured within the first axis x axis the severity of the change of the cytometric fingerprint of the exiting water during event 2 and 3 fig 4b that followed this axis was substantially larger than the shift during event 1 fig 4a the biggest differences between exiting samples and their steady state position were observed at the end of events as the aim was to provide an unequivocal parameter for online microbial drinking water assessment using advanced flow cytometry data analysis the proximity of events was calculated using the bray curtis dissimilarity a sufficiently large representative set of samples taken during normal operation of the water tower at the beginning of the monitoring period was taken as a baseline n 104 for dissimilarity comparison fig 5 based on the distribution of the baseline bray curtis dissimilarity a threshold of 0 301 was set for event detection in the exiting stream this method indicated a microbial water quality change when switching towards a single feed water produced from groundwater event 2 and event 3 the feed change towards nearly 100 drinking water produced from surface water event 1 was not indicated as a microbial water quality change as all bray curtis dissimilarities compared to the baseline regime were below 0 301 during that event monitoring was repeated in august to evaluate the seasonal influences on the biostability of the drinking water the regrowth i e the proportional difference between the average cell concentration in the exiting and incoming water in august was not higher than the regrowth measured in april although on average the temperature was higher and free chlorine concentrations were lower table 2 the exiting stream contained a higher 6 1 2 1 104 cells ml average cell density than incoming drinking water produced from surface water 4 7 1 8 104 cells ml fig 6 a the cell concentrations in the feed produced from groundwater were the lowest 3 3 1 9 104 cells ml compared to the measurements in spring the measured cell concentrations were higher on average in all streams with a ten times higher microbial load in the incoming water produced from groundwater the microbial cell density in the incoming water produced from surface water was 2 5 times higher and the exiting water had a 2 2 times higher microbial load than in april the bacterial cell concentration in both incoming waters showed a steadily increase over time as a result of the loss of residual free chlorine in the system and an exceptionally high water temperature during the extremely hot summer months as confirmed by the drinking water provider based on the distribution of the baseline bray curtis dissimilarity n 106 a threshold of 0 391 was set for event detection in the exiting stream the gradual regrowth attributed to a loss of chlorine residual was not indicated as event in the exiting stream only at the end of the monitoring period the bray curtis dissimilarity indicated a change in microbial drinking water quality fig 6d this is in contrast to the incoming streams where gradual changes were reflected in the bray curtis dissimilarity around august 14 17th fig 6bc for the incoming streams the threshold was 0 457 and 0 303 for the stream produced from groundwater and surface water respectively 4 discussion 4 1 continuous full scale monitoring of microbial drinking water quality using online flow cytometry online flow cytometric measurements of the incoming and exiting streams of a water tower showed clear regrowth despite the short hydraulic residence time of 6 8 h fig 2 the cell concentration of the exiting stream followed the fluctuations of the cell concentration of the incoming water produced from surface water because this feed stream accounted for 72 48 19 14 of the total incoming feed these fluctuations can be interpreted as short term operational variability and are most likely caused by changes in the drinking water production and or source water quality nescerecka et al 2018 mixing of both incoming waters may result in a more balanced nutrient composition and hence facilitate bacterial regrowth in the water tower because both streams may have different limiting nutrients which may on the long term result in higher biological instability this mixing effect has been previously observed in grab samples of full scale drinking water distribution systems where the biological instability or regrowth potential was higher in mixed samples than samples produced from single water sources nescerecka et al 2014 2018 niquette et al 2001 however in this study regrowth was the highest when feeding the tower only with drinking water produced from surface water on the contrary shifting towards a single groundwater source steeply decreased the cell concentration of the exiting stream these effects stem from the differences in water source as groundwater generally harbors a 10 100 times lower microbial load than surface water besmer and hammes 2016 this is often attributed to the lower nutrient concentration with lower organic carbon concentrations in particular hofmann and griebler 2018 prest et al 2016b this is also the case for this study in which the total organic carbon concentration toc of the drinking water produced from groundwater was lower 0 74 0 12 mg l average of 2018 measured at the production site than the drinking water produced from surface water 1 77 0 48 mg l average of 2018 measured at the production site both disturbed flow regimes were reflected in the cell concentration measured using online flow cytometry showing its value as parameter for monitoring microbial drinking water quality and event detection monitoring was repeated in august to evaluate the long term biostability of the water with higher water temperatures and lower free chlorine concentrations table 2 fig 6a compared to the measurements in spring the measured cell concentrations were higher on average in all streams with even a ten times higher microbial load in the incoming water produced from groundwater furthermore the bacterial cell concentration of this stream showed a steady increase over time due to the loss of residual free chlorine at the entrance of the system after august 14th which was confirmed by the drinking water provider also the extremely hot summer months of 2018 resulted in exceptionally high water temperature up to 20 c for longer periods of time sustaining bacterial regrowth in the network seasonal changes influencing the drinking water temperature have been previously observed to affect biostability of drinking water systems nescerecka et al 2018 pinto et al 2014 prest et al 2016b also the loss of residual chlorine caused a clear increase in the microbial abundance in the usually stable incoming stream produced from groundwater this means that the bacterial community in the water tower is not truly biostable as bacterial regrowth occurs substantially when the chlorine residual is no longer detected lautenschlager et al 2013 monitoring of the bacterial regrowth is thus valuable to understand biostability in the drinking water network besides this interpretation of the high dimensional flow cytometric data and quantification of microbial water quality changes in an unambiguous way are needed for full scale operational use in the drinking water industry safford and bischel 2019 we therefore propose the development of a parameter derived from flow cytometric fingerprinting for online event detection as it not only takes into account the microbial abundance but also changes in the microbial community composition as basis for indicating water quality changes 4 2 cytometric fingerprinting for online event detection in a full scale system to evaluate the effect of operational changes in flow regime on the microbial community the cytometric fingerprints of the microbial communities were compared fig 4 the pcoa analysis revealed that samples taken from the feed produced from groundwater harbor a different community than samples taken from both other streams based on the multidimensional fcm data this was confirmed in an additional analysis in which the communities were divided in two different community types using k medoids clustering based on their cytometric fingerprint as described by props et al 2018 fig s1 this algorithm could distinguish two different community types indicating that the bacterial community in the feed water produced from groundwater was different from the bacterial communities in both other streams in line with these analyses the events when groundwater was used as the single drinking water source for the tower could be detected based on the cytometric fingerprints however the outcome of these analyses is abstract and lacks nuance making it difficult to interpret consequently is less suited for operational decision making in practice concerning microbial water quality changes complementary to the total cell concentration we propose the additional implementation of the pairwise bray curtis dissimilarity between fingerprints as straightforward metric to detect deviating events that caused a microbial water quality change fig 5 fig 6 bcd based on the average bray curtis dissimilarity between cytometric fingerprints of samples taken in the baseline regime plus three times the standard deviation a conservative threshold was determined for event detection the two independent data sets of april and august showed similar results an average baseline bray curtis dissimilarity during normal regime of 0 19 0 04 and 0 22 0 05 respectively resulting in a threshold of 0 301 and 0 391 in this respect we define an event as two or more subsequent samples having a higher bray curtis dissimilarity relative to the baseline single outlying data points e g august 10th 13h36 in exiting stream fig 6d are therefore not considered as real event of biological instability caused by a water quality change as the detection of a single event could be caused by imperfect measurements or a short nonstructural change when evaluating the monitoring campaign in april this method indicated a microbial water quality change when switching towards a single feed water produced from groundwater event 2 and event 3 the feed change towards nearly 100 drinking water produced from surface water event 1 was not indicated as a microbial water quality change as all bray curtis dissimilarities compared to the baseline regime were below 0 301 this is in line with our expectations as the change from 72 towards a nearly pure feed almost 100 originating from surface water is smaller compared to the changing from 28 to 100 feed produced from groundwater sudden and large changes were unambiguously detected however during the monitoring period in august gradual regrowth attributed to the temperature increase and the loss of chlorine residual was not indicated as event in the exiting stream only at the end of the monitoring period the bray curtis dissimilarity indicated a change in microbial drinking water quality fig 6d this is in contrast to the incoming streams where gradual changes were reflected in the bray curtis dissimilarity around august 14 17th fig 6bc these changes were also observed in the cell concentrations of these streams increase of the drinking water temperature combined with a loss of chlorine residual will result in regrowth and thus biological instability gillespie et al 2014 hoefel et al 2005 nescerecka et al 2014 the effect of temperature increase and chlorine residual loss was observed in both the bray curtis dissimilarity and the cell concentrations overall we present the bray curtis dissimilarity as a straightforward basis for decision making concerning the degree of acceptable change based on high dimensional flow cytometric data hereby we define the degree of acceptable change as all bray curtis dissimilarities below the threshold which is calculated as compared to a representative set of samples taken during the normal flow regime the combination of the total cell concentration and the bray curtis dissimilarity is a more holistic approach for microbial drinking water quality changes than considering solely the cell concentration as it also considers the stability of the microbial community composition the meaning of the bray curtis dissimilarity between cytometric fingerprints can be interpreted in a complementary way to the cell concentration in the water for example increasing cell concentrations in combination with a stable bray curtis dissimilarity over time e g event 1 indicate a community that is structurally stable despite the occurrence of limited regrowth hence the information of both parameters should be combined for the detection of water quality changes and the development of early warning systems in the drinking water industry more specifically the combination of a static alarm based on the total cell concentration to indicate excessive regrowth and a dynamic alarm based on the bray curtis dissimilarity compared to a representative normal baseline situation forms a holistic basis for a first smart screening for further decision making concerning the microbial drinking water quality when placed at strategic points in the drinking water network such as the water tower discussed in this research it can be realistically implemented to safeguard the drinking water quality as cost effective technology providing easily interpretable parameters to the industry 5 conclusion flow cytometric monitoring of drinking water networks allows the collection of extensive and detailed data compared to e g weekly plating from this full scale monitoring campaign it was concluded that even though the microbial water quality complies with the legal standards the studied full scale drinking water tower is not always biologically stable changes in drinking water source increase in temperature and lack of residual chlorine drastically impacted both the cell concentrations and bray curtis dissimilarity derived from the flow cytometric fingerprints compared to the baseline situation we demonstrated that the analysis of flow cytometric data can be used as basis for the development of straightforward parameters to define the microbial water quality in a holistic way by combining the microbial abundance cell concentrations and the stability of the microbial community composition bray curtis dissimilarity this is an example on full scale of how flow cytometric fingerprinting can be used as sensitive early warning system for changes in water quality declaration of competing interest the

18316,lead contamination in municipal drinking water is a national public health issue and is generally the result of water contact with leaded distribution piping and on premise plumbing as a result the us environmental protection agency s lead and copper rule requires point of use sampling methods at a small fraction of consumer taps on the public water distribution system while this approach is practical it leaves large gaps of consumers without direct monitoring and protection in response a novel contest based crowdsourcing study was conducted to engage the public in monitoring their own water quality at their home taps and study factors that shaped participation in drinking water monitoring participants were asked to collect samples of their household drinking water through social media postings kiosks and community events with the chance to win a cash prize the project distributed approximately 800 sampling packets and received 147 packets from participants of which 93 had at least partially completed surveys on average private wells were found to have higher lead levels than the public water supply and the higher lead levels were not attributed to older building age there is also no statistical relevance between the participants perceived and actual tap water quality survey responses indicated that citizens were motivated to participate in the project due to concerns about their own health and or the health of their families in contrast participants reported that they were not motivated by the cash prize this project helps inform future public engagement with water quality monitoring create new knowledge about the influence of personal motivations for participation and provide recommendations to help increase awareness of water quality issues graphical abstract image 1 keywords citizen science crowdsourcing lead and copper rule lead in consumer taps drinking water quality monitoring public supply and private wells participation motivations 1 introduction improvements in drinking water technology have contributed greatly to public health protection in the last century cutler and miller 2005 however lead is still a recurring and pervasive problem for residents across the united states us a survey conducted by the american water works association in 2016 estimated that there are 6 1 million lead service lines either full or partial which serve 15 to 22 million people cornwell et al 2016 homeowners who do not have lead pipes but have lead solder and or brass fittings in the premise plumbing are also susceptible to lead contamination by corrosion nrc 2006 lead consumption through drinking water is estimated to account for more than 20 of american s total lead exposure usepa 2018a this percentage can increase to 85 or more of total exposure for infants who consume mostly formula made with tap water roy and edwards 2018 usepa 2018a lead can have damaging effects on the cardiovascular nervous and hematopoietic systems especially the developing nerve systems of young children infants and fetuses eubig et al 2010 kim et al 2015 who 2018 the amount and rate of lead release is affected by a variety of factors including stagnation time flow rate scale composition system configuration and water quality doré et al 2019 roy and edwards 2018 schock 1990 for example the water crisis in flint mi occurred after the city switched its drinking water source to the flint river without implementing corrosion controls which resulted in accelerated leaching and dangerously high lead levels pieper et al 2017 the crisis affected approximately 100 000 residents and its repair is estimated to cost us 1 5 billion craft blacksheare 2017 gostin 2016 ruble et al 2018 unfortunately flint mi is not alone in its struggles as pollution and aged infrastructure create disparate impacts for vulnerable populations across the us bullard 2008 campbell et al 2016 realization of the severe health implications of lead consumption pushed the us congress to amend the safe drinking water act in 1986 which prohibited the use of leaded pipes solder and flux in public water systems usepa 1989 in 1991 the lead and copper rule lcr was established to address lead issues in us public drinking water systems the lcr controls lead and copper in drinking water by establishing treatment techniques and requiring systems to regularly monitor drinking water at consumer taps the lcr set an action level for lead of 15 ppb or 0 015 μg l if more than 10 of taps selected for monitoring usually based on a tiered system prioritizing locations with the highest risk of lead contamination exceed this action level the municipality is required to take additional corrosion control measures as well as recommend precautionary steps to the public while the action level serves as a practical guide for management actions there is no known safe level of lead exposure cfr 2018 usepa 2018b who 2018 furthermore more than 13 million us households relying on private wells are not subject to the lcr and hence have less access and protection from established services liu et al 2005 nrc 2006 pieper et al 2015a usepa 2018c the lcr is also limited in the high labor and time cost related to its execution and the difficulty in gaining access to private properties at desired times as a result sampling is generally conducted for less than 0 1 of the end users serviced and oftentimes the same tap locations are monitored for each sampling period awwarf 2008 nrc 2006 zhang et al 2009 because of these limitations the environmental protection agency epa is looking to improve the lcr with the goal of minimizing lead exposure designing clearer and more enforceable requirements creating stronger consumer education programs addressing environmental justice and integrating drinking water with cross media lead reduction efforts usepa 2016 achieving this goal requires looking beyond the traditional monitoring and data collection strategies over the last two decades a rapidly growing body of research has demonstrated that crowdsourcing and engaging members of the public in environmental monitoring can increase capacities to address complex problems like the public health crisis from drinking water contamination bonney et al 2014 conrad and hilchey 2011 fox et al 2016 crowdsourcing has traditionally been used as a low cost solution to large scale tasks that can be addressed by widely distributed and independent citizens howe 2006 jeppesen and lakhani 2010 malone et al 2010 when applied to water quality monitoring a crowdsourcing scheme is able to utilize the resources and knowledge of citizens to substantially reduce the cost time and professional labor needed for sample collection and or analysis increase the efficiency of individual monitoring activities and help better allocate limited public resources bonney et al 2009 silvertown 2009 previous projects that utilize citizen science in environmental monitoring are often focused on natural resources and ecosystem services such as wildlife water resources soil and plants rather than engineered systems bonney et al 2009 2014 conrad and hilchey 2011 dickinson et al 2012 jollymore et al 2017 pandya 2012 shirk et al 2012 silvertown 2009 wiggins and crowston 2011 examples of the few efforts which have examined citizen science in the context of public drinking water monitoring include recent studies that involved collaborations between citizens and researchers to understand the severity of the flint water crisis goovaerts 2019 roy and edwards 2019 a few studies have taken an empirical approach to studying social outcomes of citizen science such as motivations perceptions and behaviors boakes et al 2016 raddick et al 2009 seymour and haklay 2017 however these studies have not focused on the area of public drinking water monitoring furthermore understanding and strengthening maintaining participation in crowdsourcing projects remains a key challenge in the business realm contest based crowdsourcing is increasingly used to solicit innovative solutions related to computer programming process graphic design pharmaceutical development etc boudreau and lakhani 2013 lakhani 2016 riedl et al 2016 contests are often shown to be an effective way in attracting a broader audience and generating more desirable solutions king and lakhani 2013 lakhani et al 2013 furthermore latest findings from crowdsourcing researchers indicate that crowds after being solicited through contests are more likely to self organize into a larger number of teams that could function more effectively than artificially matched teams blasco et al 2013 the effect of contests in crowdsourced water quality monitoring however remain unknown in this study we designed an innovative city scale contest based crowdsourced water quality monitoring scheme at the consumer tap to address some of the aforementioned limitations related to the current lcr and investigated its effectiveness by applying the crowdsourcing scheme we engaged citizens to collect their own tap water samples through contests and we then tested lead concentration in these samples and conducted analyses to better understand the intersections of participation program design and social environmental outcomes 2 methodology 2 1 project design this

public 35 private and the strong support of the local water utility on this project a schematic of the overall project design is provided in fig 1 a total of 13 expert interviews with regulators utility operators public health experts etc and a pilot project on the university of new hampshire unh campus were conducted prior to the start of the project for preparation and testing purposes suggestions provided by the experts and lessons learned from the pilot project were used to inform the design of the current project participant recruitment initiated on august 5 2018 we applied four different recruitment strategies including informational kiosks social media word of mouth and direct interaction at a public event five information kiosks fig 2 a containing sampling packets were distributed across the city at highly trafficked locations including two local grocery stores a shopping mall a community center and a public library the kiosks allowed people to take and return sampling packets directly facebook was selected as our social media platform based upon the presence of existing groups focused on local issues we created a dedicated page about the project and launched a campaign specifically targeting residents of the area during the participant recruitment stage the page was updated weekly with the latest news about the project a local facebook group was also approached and utilized to promulgate the project to approximately 940 of their followers word of mouth recruitment approaches were conducted through developing relationships with a local church with 700 parishioners church leadership informed members at weekly mass who distributed and collected samples directly lastly the project team tabled at the local farmer s market on one occasion to evaluate direct interaction with the public the official sample collection period ended on august 31 2018 late samples were accepted through mid november each recruited participant received a sampling packet that contained a pre survey that requested sampling locations contact information and social data related to participant perceptions and participation in the project the packets also included an empty 50 ml sampling vial and instructions on collecting first draw samples without contaminating the sample fig s1 of the supporting information sample vials were screw top wide mouth and fit easily under most kitchen faucets participants returned the water sample either via pre paid mail service or returning it to the sampling informational kiosks upon receipt triple distilled 70 ultra high purity nitric acid 400 μl was added directly to the collected samples for preservation and samples were stored at 4 c until the time of analysis analyses were conducted over two efforts the first in september 2018 and the second in november 2018 as sample packet were received analytical analysis was conducted at the unh plasma geochemistry lab via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms in accordance with epa 200 8 brockhoff et al 1999 external calibration curves using a certified standard spex certiprep metuchen nj were conducted at the start and conclusion of each run along with constant calibration verification standards and blanks every 10 samples all water quality results were reported to project participants by the end of november 2018 primarily through individual email communications or us mail when no email was provided correspondence included the concentration of lead in their water sample guidance on interpretation and potential protective action that should be taken base upon their results and a post survey all lead levels less than 1 μg l were reported as 1 μg l protective guidance suggestions were broken into four lead concentration brackets 1 μg l 1 5 μg l 5 15 μg l and 15 μg l following resources provided by the new hampshire department of environmental services nhdes resources nhdes 2016 retesting was offered for participants who had elevated lead levels 15 μg l participants were encouraged to contact research staff with questions or concerns regarding their results our social science survey design was informed by the tailored design method tdm dillman et al 2014 we used a pre and post survey design to describe patterns and identify outcomes from participation in the project both the pre and post survey were also administered using qualtrics the surveys asked questions about participants socio economic characteristics water quality perception how participants found out about the project motivations to participate intended actions related to water quality information among others we also built from the developing validating and implementing situated evaluation instruments devise framework using an adapted scales for motivations to participate in crowdsourcing philips et al 2017 and for environmental action porticella et al 2017 to test the role of monetary incentives in motivating the public in tap water quality monitoring two contest schemes were designed and implemented namely go getter and ambassador each with 200 cash rewards the go getter scheme rewards the participant who collected the most samples from different locations the ambassador scheme rewards the participant who introduced the highest number of new recruits to the program 2 2 data treatment and analysis the project received a total of 149 returned packets either via mail or kiosk drop off two of these packets did not contain a sample four additional packets did not include any form of contact information hence a total of 142 packets were analyzed for lead concentrations for participants who were offered retests the average of their original and retested sample concentrations was used in the data analysis a total of 136 pre survey responses and 42 post survey responses had more than 50 questions answered and hence were included in the survey analyses out of these responses 36 pre and post surveys were matched for comparison survey responses were analyzed using ibm spss version 25 we conducted descriptive and bi variate statistical tests t test and chi square to describe patterns of participation perceptions about water quality and associations between independent variables we ran a principal components analysis pca with a varimax rotation to assess the underlying factors that shaped participant motivations and tested the internal reliability of this scale using cronbach s alpha pca is a method used to transform a large number of related variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables using linear combinations creating a simpler basis to describe the data everitt and hothorn 2011 jackson 2005 we also used the georeferencing technique in arcmap to plot sampled locations in this project and compared against the current lcr sampling sites provided by the nhdes based upon their physical addresses granit 2019 nhdes 2018 standard deviation ellipses were then constructed which contain two standard deviations of locations for each of the lcr and sampled datasets the ellipses were then used to compare the area coverages of the two datasets 3 results and discussions 3 1 program efficacy the return rate of this project was around 18 142 analyzed samples out of 800 distributed packets the sample collection period lasted for a total of 26 days and the entire project lasted for around 58 days fig 3 shows the location of samples collected through this project as well as the samples collected under the latest lcr sampling protocol this study was able to almost double the number of households tested as compared to the current lcr protocol 77 households the area covered through this project was around 140 4 km2 based upon the standard deviation ellipse which was around 2 3 times of the area covered by the lcr protocol 65 5 km2 the samples collected through this project were well spread throughout the testbed city this project has also effectively extended lead monitoring to households relying on private wells of the returned samples around 67 were from families connected with the public drinking water supply and 33 were from households that rely on private wells this was comparable to the city as a whole in which the municipality served 65 of residences interview 2018 when asked if they would be willing to participate in another project like this if given the opportunity 77 of participants who responded to this question in the post contest survey selected yes and 19 selected maybe this suggested the project s potential to retain volunteers that were relatively easily accessible for future monitoring testing activities 3 2 water sample analysis all samples were collected from kitchen faucets except for one sample which was taken from a garden hose and six which were taken from bathroom faucets the majority of the samples tested around 68 had a lead concentration below 1 μg l fig 4 a around 3 of the samples tested had a higher lead concentration than the epa action level all of which were from private wells an additional 7 had a lead concentration between 5 and 15 μg l all of which were also from private wells about 57 of well samples had 1 μg l or greater lead concentrations whereas 20 of public supply samples had 1 ppb or greater all public supply samples were below 5 μg l but 30 of private well samples were at or above 5 μg l the average lead concentration of private well samples was 7 22 μg l with a standard deviation of 23 49 without the retested sample the average was 3 81 μg l and the standard deviation was 5 52 while the average lead concentration of public supply samples was 0 613 μg l with a standard deviation of 0 840 lead in drinking water was often assumed to be only a problem of public supply as attention is often centered on the failures and preventive management of large pipeline networks nevertheless our study shows that households that rely on private wells are not necessarily free of lead contaminations in fact they could be even more the case potential sources of lead in well water include submersible pumps with leaded brass components plumping components imported from outside the us where lead is not as strictly regulated and or older well packer elements cdc 2018 another potential cause for high lead levels could be the use of ion exchange devices to reduce the hardness of sourced groundwater thus making it more corrosive nhdes 2009 usgs 2016 some studies however indicate that ion exchange softening does not affect the corrosivity of water sorg et al 1998 in general low ph water high dissolved oxygen high temperature and high levels of dissolved solids increase corrosion rates sadiq et al 2007 the higher lead concentration in private wells naturally invites the assumption that the buildings that rely on private wells might be older than the ones that rely on public supply to obtain the age of the buildings being sampled we searched the sampling site addresses within the city s public property assessment records database building ages that were not available on the database were obtained by running sampling site addresses through real estate search engines costar group 2018 nar 2018 zillow 2018 this analysis assumed that private wells were constructed the same year as their respective buildings building ages were eventually obtained for 124 samples and matched with sample analysis results obtained for the respective sample location fig 4 b presents the building age in relation to their actual lead measurements in fact the highest lead concentrations were found in some of the newest homes in the region since the use of lead containing solders in potable water systems was banned nationwide in 1986 we particularly investigated the measured lead concentrations for homes that were constructed before and after 1986 half of the homes that were tested higher than the epa action level were built after 1986 and one was less than 50 years old around 11 of the homes that were built after 1986 less than 33 years old have a lead concentration above 5 μg l and around 21 of the homes that are between 32 and 50 years old have a lead concentration above 5 μg l however this number is 3 for buildings between 50 and 100 years old and over 100 years old 3 3 demographics and recruitment patterns although this project aimed to encourage communication between participants specifically with the advertisement of the go getter and ambassador contests only 11 of participants who completed relevant survey questions indicated learning about the project via word of mouth and only 8 from social media this shows the limitations of cash incentives and social media recruitment in a drinking water monitoring testing project targeting a small spatially constrained population tabling at the farmer s market also saw little success with many citizens stating i don t want to know when offered free water testing this introduces a challenging barrier of access to those who do not wish to know what is in their water as this study did not survey those who chose not to participate it is difficult to draw conclusions to exactly why they were deterred these barriers would be worth investigating in future studies meanwhile 53 of surveyed participants indicated they learned about the project when they saw a kiosk in person this implies that persons of interest are more likely to participate if the project materials are directly accessible to them survey results indicate that about half of the participants had an annual household income below the city s median household income table 1 this supports this method s ability to reach lower income consumers who have often been reported as socially disadvantaged groups facing inequities in water quality and are typically harder for researchers to reach due to project cost and time constraints bonevski et al 2014 vanderslice 2011 around 26 of the participants rented their homes while 70 owned them persons occupying home rentals often face limited capacity in accessing resources to make changes to their homes especially in urban areas mee et al 2014 the results also show that our methods were more effective in recruiting more educated population as the percentage of participants with a bachelor s degree or higher was 15 5 higher than the city mean and the percentage of participants with less than high school education was 7 8 lower this indicates education might have a positive effect on people s willingness in participating a program like this furthermore we found that our project had a higher success in recruiting older citizens with a median age of 55 which is 14 years older than the city wide median age of 41 uscb 2018b this is also a trend seen in other environmentally focused citizen science projects merenlender et al 2016 trumbull et al 2000 around 22 of the respondents had children under the age of six in their home which was significantly higher than the national average of 11 6 households family and non family with children under six in their home uscb 2016 2018a this indicates that having a young child in the home could be a potential motivator for participating in this project 3 4 lead concentration versus water quality perception and preventive actions another question we investigated through the study was how people s perception was correlated to their actual water quality fig 5 of the four participants whose lead concentrations were above the epa action level three of them considered their water quality to be very good or good around 42 of the participants with a lead concentration above 5 μg l considered their water quality to be excellent or very good we then recoded lead levels as a continuous data type into a binary category where scores of 1ug l were recoded as 1 lead and scores 1 were recoded as 0 no lead similarly we recoded water quality perceptions into binary categories where original rankings of excellent very good and good were recoded as 1 good and fair and poor as 0 bad there was no statistically significant relationship between evidence of lead in water and perceptions about water quality x2 150 df 1 p 0 699 table s1 in si this is may in part be due to lead in drinking water being tasteless odorless and colorless and therefore undetectable to the consumer cdc 2016 those who ranked their drinking water as of poor quality likely did so by noticing detectable water quality issues lead along with some other drinking water contaminants are often not directly observable by end users this could potentially hinder people s timely response to prevent potential harms we also asked participants whether or not they run their tap to flush their water before using it each day another chi squared test was conducted to test the association between the respondents water quality perceptions and actions to reduce the potential harm results of a pearson chi square analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between perceptions about drinking water quality good or bad and choice to run the tap yes or no in the pre survey responses x2 0 108 df 1 p 0 743 table s2 in si this may be due to a lack of awareness of the benefits of flushing one s tap which shows the importance of raising the public awareness of the potential drinking water issues and their preventive measures while flushing has been widely recognized as an effective short term method for tap water containing high lead levels insufficient flushing time might result in increased rather than reduced lead exposure katner et al 2018 hence it is important to provide the public with clear flushing guidelines while acknowledging its practical limitations 3 5 motivation for participation participation in this project was mostly motivated by wanting to learn about drinking water quality around 94 of the participants either agreed or strongly agreed in the pre survey and concerns about personal health and or family health around 95 either agreed or strongly agreed in the pre survey a pca on the pre survey responses further identified three main motivation factors which we labelled health and identity extrinsic incentives and personal satisfaction table 2 the health and identity factor corresponded with the highest rated mean motivations providing further evidence that health and identity related factors were key factors that motivated participation in the contest this finding has implications for recommendations of how to design communication plans to help encourage people to participate in household drinking water monitoring activities on the other hand the contest and the cash prize were found to be an ineffective motivator for people to participate this project around 67 of participants either disagreed or strongly disagreed that they were motivated to participate by the cash prize and 21 were neutral additionally when asked which contest the participant hoped to win 82 of participants responded neither in the pre survey table s3 in the si for those who participated and also responded to the post survey 92 n 39 indicated they were not participating in either of the contest options a paired t test comparing responses to pre and post survey questions on motivation revealed no significant differences in overall motivations before and after the project table s4 in the si however participants do show a decrease in motivation to learn about water quality we interpreted this result to indicate that the project may have helped satisfy their motivation for learning about water quality 4 conclusions this project has demonstrated that well designed crowdsourcing approaches can identify lead concentrations at the consumer tap while actively engaging and informing the public which directly addresses a large portion of the epa s lcr revision goals an important finding in this study is that lead concentrations were statistically higher at locations served by private wells than the public system and the lead concentrations are not corresponding to the age of the households this is consistent with several studies conducted over the past 5 decades in north carolina pennsylvania and virginia francis et al 1984 maas and patch 1990 pieper et al 2015b swistock et al 1993 while lead exposure has decreased in public systems exposure from private systems remains a large data gap in lead exposure which may pose challenges in achieving the federal goal to eliminate elevated blood lead levels in children by 2020 dhhs 2012 perceptions of water quality was found to be neither linked with the actual lead concentration nor the preventive actions people take to minimize harm i e flush tap indicating a potential barrier protection of public health our participant recruitment has a higher success with female more educated and older populations though our hands off recruitment approach was useful in reducing time and resource requirements for researchers it should be noted that methods such as door to door may be more effective in achieving higher return rates furthermore personal contact with the kiosks was found to be the most effective approach to recruitment participants are mostly motivated by health and identity factors these findings have implications on the future design of communication strategies to improve communication efficacy and engage the under represented groups we envision the design of the crowdsourced scheme developed in this study could be expanded to other contaminants of concern outcomes from this project have demonstrated the effectiveness of such a scheme in terms of the amount of households sampled and the area covered however the usefulness and broader adoption of such a scheme in monitoring water quality also depends on the availability of easy to understand use sampling and analysis methods as well as low cost contaminant analysis techniques in our project we utilized a different method than the standard lead testing method because the standard method requires collection of 1 l of water sample which would have been a barrier for transporting and testing those samples in one centralized location in our design we were not able to allow participants to directly analyze their samples due to the lack of low cost but accurate lead testing techniques that can be freely distributed to the participants a direction of potential future research is to develop such low cost measuring techniques sensors or surrogate indicators for household water quality monitoring we expect the availability of such techniques would greatly enhance our capability in providing continuous or random water quality checks for public health

18316,lead contamination in municipal drinking water is a national public health issue and is generally the result of water contact with leaded distribution piping and on premise plumbing as a result the us environmental protection agency s lead and copper rule requires point of use sampling methods at a small fraction of consumer taps on the public water distribution system while this approach is practical it leaves large gaps of consumers without direct monitoring and protection in response a novel contest based crowdsourcing study was conducted to engage the public in monitoring their own water quality at their home taps and study factors that shaped participation in drinking water monitoring participants were asked to collect samples of their household drinking water through social media postings kiosks and community events with the chance to win a cash prize the project distributed approximately 800 sampling packets and received 147 packets from participants of which 93 had at least partially completed surveys on average private wells were found to have higher lead levels than the public water supply and the higher lead levels were not attributed to older building age there is also no statistical relevance between the participants perceived and actual tap water quality survey responses indicated that citizens were motivated to participate in the project due to concerns about their own health and or the health of their families in contrast participants reported that they were not motivated by the cash prize this project helps inform future public engagement with water quality monitoring create new knowledge about the influence of personal motivations for participation and provide recommendations to help increase awareness of water quality issues graphical abstract image 1 keywords citizen science crowdsourcing lead and copper rule lead in consumer taps drinking water quality monitoring public supply and private wells participation motivations 1 introduction improvements in drinking water technology have contributed greatly to public health protection in the last century cutler and miller 2005 however lead is still a recurring and pervasive problem for residents across the united states us a survey conducted by the american water works association in 2016 estimated that there are 6 1 million lead service lines either full or partial which serve 15 to 22 million people cornwell et al 2016 homeowners who do not have lead pipes but have lead solder and or brass fittings in the premise plumbing are also susceptible to lead contamination by corrosion nrc 2006 lead consumption through drinking water is estimated to account for more than 20 of american s total lead exposure usepa 2018a this percentage can increase to 85 or more of total exposure for infants who consume mostly formula made with tap water roy and edwards 2018 usepa 2018a lead can have damaging effects on the cardiovascular nervous and hematopoietic systems especially the developing nerve systems of young children infants and fetuses eubig et al 2010 kim et al 2015 who 2018 the amount and rate of lead release is affected by a variety of factors including stagnation time flow rate scale composition system configuration and water quality doré et al 2019 roy and edwards 2018 schock 1990 for example the water crisis in flint mi occurred after the city switched its drinking water source to the flint river without implementing corrosion controls which resulted in accelerated leaching and dangerously high lead levels pieper et al 2017 the crisis affected approximately 100 000 residents and its repair is estimated to cost us 1 5 billion craft blacksheare 2017 gostin 2016 ruble et al 2018 unfortunately flint mi is not alone in its struggles as pollution and aged infrastructure create disparate impacts for vulnerable populations across the us bullard 2008 campbell et al 2016 realization of the severe health implications of lead consumption pushed the us congress to amend the safe drinking water act in 1986 which prohibited the use of leaded pipes solder and flux in public water systems usepa 1989 in 1991 the lead and copper rule lcr was established to address lead issues in us public drinking water systems the lcr controls lead and copper in drinking water by establishing treatment techniques and requiring systems to regularly monitor drinking water at consumer taps the lcr set an action level for lead of 15 ppb or 0 015 μg l if more than 10 of taps selected for monitoring usually based on a tiered system prioritizing locations with the highest risk of lead contamination exceed this action level the municipality is required to take additional corrosion control measures as well as recommend precautionary steps to the public while the action level serves as a practical guide for management actions there is no known safe level of lead exposure cfr 2018 usepa 2018b who 2018 furthermore more than 13 million us households relying on private wells are not subject to the lcr and hence have less access and protection from established services liu et al 2005 nrc 2006 pieper et al 2015a usepa 2018c the lcr is also limited in the high labor and time cost related to its execution and the difficulty in gaining access to private properties at desired times as a result sampling is generally conducted for less than 0 1 of the end users serviced and oftentimes the same tap locations are monitored for each sampling period awwarf 2008 nrc 2006 zhang et al 2009 because of these limitations the environmental protection agency epa is looking to improve the lcr with the goal of minimizing lead exposure designing clearer and more enforceable requirements creating stronger consumer education programs addressing environmental justice and integrating drinking water with cross media lead reduction efforts usepa 2016 achieving this goal requires looking beyond the traditional monitoring and data collection strategies over the last two decades a rapidly growing body of research has demonstrated that crowdsourcing and engaging members of the public in environmental monitoring can increase capacities to address complex problems like the public health crisis from drinking water contamination bonney et al 2014 conrad and hilchey 2011 fox et al 2016 crowdsourcing has traditionally been used as a low cost solution to large scale tasks that can be addressed by widely distributed and independent citizens howe 2006 jeppesen and lakhani 2010 malone et al 2010 when applied to water quality monitoring a crowdsourcing scheme is able to utilize the resources and knowledge of citizens to substantially reduce the cost time and professional labor needed for sample collection and or analysis increase the efficiency of individual monitoring activities and help better allocate limited public resources bonney et al 2009 silvertown 2009 previous projects that utilize citizen science in environmental monitoring are often focused on natural resources and ecosystem services such as wildlife water resources soil and plants rather than engineered systems bonney et al 2009 2014 conrad and hilchey 2011 dickinson et al 2012 jollymore et al 2017 pandya 2012 shirk et al 2012 silvertown 2009 wiggins and crowston 2011 examples of the few efforts which have examined citizen science in the context of public drinking water monitoring include recent studies that involved collaborations between citizens and researchers to understand the severity of the flint water crisis goovaerts 2019 roy and edwards 2019 a few studies have taken an empirical approach to studying social outcomes of citizen science such as motivations perceptions and behaviors boakes et al 2016 raddick et al 2009 seymour and haklay 2017 however these studies have not focused on the area of public drinking water monitoring furthermore understanding and strengthening maintaining participation in crowdsourcing projects remains a key challenge in the business realm contest based crowdsourcing is increasingly used to solicit innovative solutions related to computer programming process graphic design pharmaceutical development etc boudreau and lakhani 2013 lakhani 2016 riedl et al 2016 contests are often shown to be an effective way in attracting a broader audience and generating more desirable solutions king and lakhani 2013 lakhani et al 2013 furthermore latest findings from crowdsourcing researchers indicate that crowds after being solicited through contests are more likely to self organize into a larger number of teams that could function more effectively than artificially matched teams blasco et al 2013 the effect of contests in crowdsourced water quality monitoring however remain unknown in this study we designed an innovative city scale contest based crowdsourced water quality monitoring scheme at the consumer tap to address some of the aforementioned limitations related to the current lcr and investigated its effectiveness by applying the crowdsourcing scheme we engaged citizens to collect their own tap water samples through contests and we then tested lead concentration in these samples and conducted analyses to better understand the intersections of participation program design and social environmental outcomes 2 methodology 2 1 project design this study was carried out in a new hampshire city which in 2017 had a population of around 30 797 people and 12 953 households uscb 2018b the city was selected based upon its diverse water source 65 public 35 private and the strong support of the local water utility on this project a schematic of the overall project design is provided in fig 1 a total of 13 expert interviews with regulators utility operators public health experts etc and a pilot project on the university of new hampshire unh campus were conducted prior to the start of the project for preparation and testing purposes suggestions provided by the experts and lessons learned from the pilot project were used to inform the design of the current project participant recruitment initiated on august 5 2018 we applied four different recruitment strategies including informational kiosks social media word of mouth and direct interaction at a public event five information kiosks fig 2 a containing sampling packets were distributed across the city at highly trafficked locations including two local grocery stores a shopping mall a community center and a public library the kiosks allowed people to take and return sampling packets directly facebook was selected as our social media platform based upon the presence of existing groups focused on local issues we created a dedicated page about the project and launched a campaign specifically targeting residents of the area during the participant recruitment stage the page was updated weekly with the latest news about the project a local facebook group was also approached and utilized to promulgate the project to approximately 940 of their followers word of mouth recruitment approaches were conducted through developing relationships with a local church with 700 parishioners church leadership informed members at weekly mass who distributed and collected samples directly lastly the project team tabled at the local farmer s market on one occasion to evaluate direct interaction with the public the official sample collection period ended on august 31 2018 late samples were accepted through mid november each recruited participant received a sampling packet that contained a pre survey that requested sampling locations contact information and social data related to participant perceptions and participation in the project the packets also included an empty 50 ml sampling vial and instructions on collecting first draw samples without contaminating the sample fig s1 of the supporting information sample vials were screw top wide mouth and fit easily under most kitchen faucets participants returned the water sample either via pre paid mail service or returning it to the sampling informational kiosks upon receipt triple distilled 70 ultra high purity nitric acid 400 μl was added directly to the collected samples for preservation and samples were stored at 4 c until the time of analysis analyses were conducted over two efforts the first in september 2018 and the second in november 2018 as sample packet were received analytical analysis was conducted at the unh plasma geochemistry lab via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms in accordance with epa 200 8 brockhoff et al 1999 external calibration curves using a certified standard spex certiprep metuchen nj were conducted at the start and conclusion of each run along with constant calibration verification standards and blanks every 10 samples all water quality results were reported to project participants by the end of november 2018 primarily through individual email communications or us mail when no email was provided correspondence included the concentration of lead in their water sample guidance on interpretation and potential protective action that should be taken base upon their results and a post survey all lead levels less than 1 μg l were reported as 1 μg l protective guidance suggestions were broken into four lead concentration brackets 1 μg l 1 5 μg l 5 15 μg l and 15 μg l following resources provided by the new hampshire department of environmental services nhdes resources nhdes 2016 retesting was offered for participants who had elevated lead levels 15 μg l participants were encouraged to contact research staff with questions or concerns regarding their results our social science survey design was informed by the tailored design method tdm dillman et al 2014 we used a pre and post survey design to describe patterns and identify outcomes from participation in the project both the pre and post survey were also administered using qualtrics the surveys asked questions about participants socio economic characteristics water quality perception how participants found out about the project motivations to participate intended actions related to water quality information among others we also built from the developing validating and implementing situated evaluation instruments devise framework using an adapted scales for motivations to participate in crowdsourcing philips et al 2017 and for environmental action porticella et al 2017 to test the role of monetary incentives in motivating the public in tap water quality monitoring two contest schemes were designed and implemented namely go getter and ambassador each with 200 cash rewards the go getter scheme rewards the participant who collected the most samples from different locations the ambassador scheme rewards the participant who introduced the highest number of new recruits to the program 2 2 data treatment and analysis the project received a total of 149 returned packets either via mail or kiosk drop off two of these packets did not contain a sample four additional packets did not include any form of contact information hence a total of 142 packets were analyzed for lead concentrations for participants who were offered retests the average of their original and retested sample concentrations was used in the data analysis a total of 136 pre survey responses and 42 post survey responses had more than 50 questions answered and hence were included in the survey analyses out of these responses 36 pre and post surveys were matched for comparison survey responses were analyzed using ibm spss version 25 we conducted descriptive and bi variate statistical tests t test and chi square to describe patterns of participation perceptions about water quality and associations between independent variables we ran a principal components analysis pca with a varimax rotation to assess the underlying factors that shaped

constructed which contain two standard deviations of locations for each of the lcr and sampled datasets the ellipses were then used to compare the area coverages of the two datasets 3 results and discussions 3 1 program efficacy the return rate of this project was around 18 142 analyzed samples out of 800 distributed packets the sample collection period lasted for a total of 26 days and the entire project lasted for around 58 days fig 3 shows the location of samples collected through this project as well as the samples collected under the latest lcr sampling protocol this study was able to almost double the number of households tested as compared to the current lcr protocol 77 households the area covered through this project was around 140 4 km2 based upon the standard deviation ellipse which was around 2 3 times of the area covered by the lcr protocol 65 5 km2 the samples collected through this project were well spread throughout the testbed city this project has also effectively extended lead monitoring to households relying on private wells of the returned samples around 67 were from families connected with the public drinking water supply and 33 were from households that rely on private wells this was comparable to the city as a whole in which the municipality served 65 of residences interview 2018 when asked if they would be willing to participate in another project like this if given the opportunity 77 of participants who responded to this question in the post contest survey selected yes and 19 selected maybe this suggested the project s potential to retain volunteers that were relatively easily accessible for future monitoring testing activities 3 2 water sample analysis all samples were collected from kitchen faucets except for one sample which was taken from a garden hose and six which were taken from bathroom faucets the majority of the samples tested around 68 had a lead concentration below 1 μg l fig 4 a around 3 of the samples tested had a higher lead concentration than the epa action level all of which were from private wells an additional 7 had a lead concentration between 5 and 15 μg l all of which were also from private wells about 57 of well samples had 1 μg l or greater lead concentrations whereas 20 of public supply samples had 1 ppb or greater all public supply samples were below 5 μg l but 30 of private well samples were at or above 5 μg l the average lead concentration of private well samples was 7 22 μg l with a standard deviation of 23 49 without the retested sample the average was 3 81 μg l and the standard deviation was 5 52 while the average lead concentration of public supply samples was 0 613 μg l with a standard deviation of 0 840 lead in drinking water was often assumed to be only a problem of public supply as attention is often centered on the failures and preventive management of large pipeline networks nevertheless our study shows that households that rely on private wells are not necessarily free of lead contaminations in fact they could be even more the case potential sources of lead in well water include submersible pumps with leaded brass components plumping components imported from outside the us where lead is not as strictly regulated and or older well packer elements cdc 2018 another potential cause for high lead levels could be the use of ion exchange devices to reduce the hardness of sourced groundwater thus making it more corrosive nhdes 2009 usgs 2016 some studies however indicate that ion exchange softening does not affect the corrosivity of water sorg et al 1998 in general low ph water high dissolved oxygen high temperature and high levels of dissolved solids increase corrosion rates sadiq et al 2007 the higher lead concentration in private wells naturally invites the assumption that the buildings that rely on private wells might be older than the ones that rely on public supply to obtain the age of the buildings being sampled we searched the sampling site addresses within the city s public property assessment records database building ages that were not available on the database were obtained by running sampling site addresses through real estate search engines costar group 2018 nar 2018 zillow 2018 this analysis assumed that private wells were constructed the same year as their respective buildings building ages were eventually obtained for 124 samples and matched with sample analysis results obtained for the respective sample location fig 4 b presents the building age in relation to their actual lead measurements in fact the highest lead concentrations were found in some of the newest homes in the region since the use of lead containing solders in potable water systems was banned nationwide in 1986 we particularly investigated the measured lead concentrations for homes that were constructed before and after 1986 half of the homes that were tested higher than the epa action level were built after 1986 and one was less than 50 years old around 11 of the homes that were built after 1986 less than 33 years old have a lead concentration above 5 μg l and around 21 of the homes that are between 32 and 50 years old have a lead concentration above 5 μg l however this number is 3 for buildings between 50 and 100 years old and over 100 years old 3 3 demographics and recruitment patterns although this project aimed to encourage communication between participants specifically with the advertisement of the go getter and ambassador contests only 11 of participants who completed relevant survey questions indicated learning about the project via word of mouth and only 8 from social media this shows the limitations of cash incentives and social media recruitment in a drinking water monitoring testing project targeting a small spatially constrained population tabling at the farmer s market also saw little success with many citizens stating i don t want to know when offered free water testing this introduces a challenging barrier of access to those who do not wish to know what is in their water as this study did not survey those who chose not to participate it is difficult to draw conclusions to exactly why they were deterred these barriers would be worth investigating in future studies meanwhile 53 of surveyed participants indicated they learned about the project when they saw a kiosk in person this implies that persons of interest are more likely to participate if the project materials are directly accessible to them survey results indicate that about half of the participants had an annual household income below the city s median household income table 1 this supports this method s ability to reach lower income consumers who have often been reported as socially disadvantaged groups facing inequities in water quality and are typically harder for researchers to reach due to project cost and time constraints bonevski et al 2014 vanderslice 2011 around 26 of the participants rented their homes while 70 owned them persons occupying home rentals often face limited capacity in accessing resources to make changes to their homes especially in urban areas mee et al 2014 the results also show that our methods were more effective in recruiting more educated population as the percentage of participants with a bachelor s degree or higher was 15 5 higher than the city mean and the percentage of participants with less than high school education was 7 8 lower this indicates education might have a positive effect on people s willingness in participating a program like this furthermore we found that our project had a higher success in recruiting older citizens with a median age of 55 which is 14 years older than the city wide median age of 41 uscb 2018b this is also a trend seen in other environmentally focused citizen science projects merenlender et al 2016 trumbull et al 2000 around 22 of the respondents had children under the age of six in their home which was significantly higher than the national average of 11 6 households family and non family with children under six in their home uscb 2016 2018a this indicates that having a young child in the home could be a potential motivator for participating in this project 3 4 lead concentration versus water quality perception and preventive actions another question we investigated through the study was how people s perception was correlated to their actual water quality fig 5 of the four participants whose lead concentrations were above the epa action level three of them considered their water quality to be very good or good around 42 of the participants with a lead concentration above 5 μg l considered their water quality to be excellent or very good we then recoded lead levels as a continuous data type into a binary category where scores of 1ug l were recoded as 1 lead and scores 1 were recoded as 0 no lead similarly we recoded water quality perceptions into binary categories where original rankings of excellent very good and good were recoded as 1 good and fair and poor as 0 bad there was no statistically significant relationship between evidence of lead in water and perceptions about water quality x2 150 df 1 p 0 699 table s1 in si this is may in part be due to lead in drinking water being tasteless odorless and colorless and therefore undetectable to the consumer cdc 2016 those who ranked their drinking water as of poor quality likely did so by noticing detectable water quality issues lead along with some other drinking water contaminants are often not directly observable by end users this could potentially hinder people s timely response to prevent potential harms we also asked participants whether or not they run their tap to flush their water before using it each day another chi squared test was conducted to test the association between the respondents water quality perceptions and actions to reduce the potential harm results of a pearson chi square analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between perceptions about drinking water quality good or bad and choice to run the tap yes or no in the pre survey responses x2 0 108 df 1 p 0 743 table s2 in si this may be due to a lack of awareness of the benefits of flushing one s tap which shows the importance of raising the public awareness of the potential drinking water issues and their preventive measures while flushing has been widely recognized as an effective short term method for tap water containing high lead levels insufficient flushing time might result in increased rather than reduced lead exposure katner et al 2018 hence it is important to provide the public with clear flushing guidelines while acknowledging its practical limitations 3 5 motivation for participation participation in this project was mostly motivated by wanting to learn about drinking water quality around 94 of the participants either agreed or strongly agreed in the pre survey and concerns about personal health and or family health around 95 either agreed or strongly agreed in the pre survey a pca on the pre survey responses further identified three main motivation factors which we labelled health and identity extrinsic incentives and personal satisfaction table 2 the health and identity factor corresponded with the highest rated mean motivations providing further evidence that health and identity related factors were key factors that motivated participation in the contest this finding has implications for recommendations of how to design communication plans to help encourage people to participate in household drinking water monitoring activities on the other hand the contest and the cash prize were found to be an ineffective motivator for people to participate this project around 67 of participants either disagreed or strongly disagreed that they were motivated to participate by the cash prize and 21 were neutral additionally when asked which contest the participant hoped to win 82 of participants responded neither in the pre survey table s3 in the si for those who participated and also responded to the post survey 92 n 39 indicated they were not participating in either of the contest options a paired t test comparing responses to pre and post survey questions on motivation revealed no significant differences in overall motivations before and after the project table s4 in the si however participants do show a decrease in motivation to learn about water quality we interpreted this result to indicate that the project may have helped satisfy their motivation for learning about water quality 4 conclusions this project has demonstrated that well designed crowdsourcing approaches can identify lead concentrations at the consumer tap while actively engaging and informing the public which directly addresses a large portion of the epa s lcr revision goals an important finding in this study is that lead concentrations were statistically higher at locations served by private wells than the public system and the lead concentrations are not corresponding to the age of the households this is consistent with several studies conducted over the past 5 decades in north carolina pennsylvania and virginia francis et al 1984 maas and patch 1990 pieper et al 2015b swistock et al 1993 while lead exposure has decreased in public systems exposure from private systems remains a large data gap in lead exposure which may pose challenges in achieving the federal goal to eliminate elevated blood lead levels in children by 2020 dhhs 2012 perceptions of water quality was found to be neither linked with the actual lead concentration nor the preventive actions people take to minimize harm i e flush tap indicating a potential barrier protection of public health our participant recruitment has a higher success with female more educated and older populations though our hands off recruitment approach was useful in reducing time and resource requirements for researchers it should be noted that methods such as door to door may be more effective in achieving higher return rates furthermore personal contact with the kiosks was found to be the most effective approach to recruitment participants are mostly motivated by health and identity factors these findings have implications on the future design of communication strategies to improve communication efficacy and engage the under represented groups we envision the design of the crowdsourced scheme developed in this study could be expanded to other contaminants of concern outcomes from this project have demonstrated the effectiveness of such a scheme in terms of the amount of households sampled and the area covered however the usefulness and broader adoption of such a scheme in monitoring water quality also depends on the availability of easy to understand use sampling and analysis methods as well as low cost contaminant analysis techniques in our project we utilized a different method than the standard lead testing method because the standard method requires collection of 1 l of water sample which would have been a barrier for transporting and testing those samples in one centralized location in our design we were not able to allow participants to directly analyze their samples due to the lack of low cost but accurate lead testing techniques that can be freely distributed to the participants a direction of potential future research is to develop such low cost measuring techniques sensors or surrogate indicators for household water quality monitoring we expect the availability of such techniques would greatly enhance our capability in providing continuous or random water quality checks for public health

18317,the release of silver nanomaterials agnms from extensive use poses potential risks to human health and ecological environments although previous studies have reported the negative effects of agnms on various microorganisms little is known about the response of bacteria under the exposure of agnms at the cellular level here we report the multiple responses of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 pao1 under the exposure of two types of agnms including spherical silver nanoparticles agnps and fibrous silver nanorods agnrs by physiological experiments microscopy synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy xas flow cytometry and genome wide rna sequencing our results demonstrated that the exposure to both types of agnms could inhibit the growth of pao1 accompanied by the overproduction of oxidative stress and inducing cell membrane damage transmission electron microscopy revealed the roughened cell membrane under both agnms treatment in addition both agnms repressed the expression of quorum sensing and metal efflux related genes in pao1 but stimulated denitrification glycerol and amino acid metabolisms sos response and pyocin overproduction of pao1 compared to agnrs agnps exposure showed a much lower threshold concentration to trigger the inhibitory effect and induced greater transcriptional responses of pao1 this study suggested that agnms could cause multiple effects on the proliferation metabolism virulence and pathogenesis of pao1 which might further affect the corresponding environmental microbial communities overall our findings offer insights into the interactions between agnms and bacteria at the molecular level graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver nanomaterials pyocin quorum sensing genome wide rna sequencing denitrification 1 introduction engineered metal based nanomaterials have been intensively used in various industrial sectors for example silver nanomaterials agnms have been increasingly used in food processing water treatment consumer products such as cosmetics textiles plastics metal products cleaning agents paint and antibacterial medicine yu et al 2013 the estimated consumption amount of agnms is over 500 tons annually worldwide piccinno et al 2012 consequently increasing concentrations of agnms in surface water and wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been detected over the last decade coll et al 2016 furthermore the transformation and persistence of agnms in aquatic environments varies depending on the size elemental composition and surface modification levard et al 2012 agnms are seen to have a board spectrum antibacterial ability franci et al 2015 however details of the cellular responses to these nanomaterials are yet to be determined previous studies on eco toxicity of agnms have focused on revealing the effective concentration ec50 or minimal inhibitory concentrations mics on microorganisms as well as examining the transformation of agnms within engineered systems that include bioreactor anaya et al 2016 sewer brunetti et al 2015 and wwtps kaegi et al 2011 as well as in complicated aquatic systems sheng and liu 2017 in these studies it is suggested that the inhibitory effects of agnms are induced through the dissolution of silver ions choi et al 2008 liu and hurt 2010 generation of reactive oxygen species ros carlson et al 2008 or by direct disruption of bacterial membranes anaya et al 2016 choi et al 2008 moreover the toxicity of agnms seems to be concentration and size shape dependent hong et al 2016 sheng and liu 2017 small sized silver nanoparticles agnps d90 20 nm are found to elicit more inhibitory effects in comparison to large sized agnps d90 100 nm this is due to their larger surface to volume ratios morones et al 2005 and more capabilities to enter the cells hsiao et al 2015 and cause cytotoxic effects via increasing ros production carlson et al 2008 in addition previous studies mainly focused on macro parameters e g growth inhibition rate oxygen uptake rate and substrate utilization rate and a few studies tracked the expression of a limited subset of genes associated with the oxidative stress membrane and dna repair using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt pcr sheng and liu 2011 yang and alvarez 2015 however there lacks a comprehensive understanding of the cellular responses to agnms this could be achieved by combining detected responses of physiological features with variations in genome wide expression profiles singh et al 2019 such a comparative analysis could advance the current understanding of how agnms affect individual bacterial physiology and cellular functions including cellular processes signaling information storage processing and metabolism in clinical settings such an approach might improve the understanding of potential impacts of agnms on bacteria antimicrobial resistance virulence and pathogenesis in environmental settings such a study might provide insights for the impacts of agnms on the microbe that participates in important environmental processes e g nitrogen and carbon cycling organic matter biodegradation as well as electron transfer the objectives of this study were to investigate the response of bacteria under the exposure of agnms at the cellular level and to compare whether the bacterial response is size dependent in order to achieve these aims we investigated the effects of agnms at bacteriostatic to biocidal concentrations by applying agnps spherical d90 20 nm and silver nanorods agnrs d90 100 200 nm 5 10 μm in length to the well studied model microorganism pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 p aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can thrive in various environments among immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis patients p aeruginosa infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality rosenfeld et al 2003 it is also a ubiquitous denitrifier that participates in nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment processes by combining the physiological responses profiles transmission electron microscopy tem synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy xas flow cytometry and genome wide rna sequencing we determined the microbial response to the exposure of agnps or agnrs and revealed potential mechanisms of agnms on p aeruginosa our study provides molecular insights into the understanding of potential impacts of agnms on bacteria in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 silver nanomaterials two types of agnms differing in both size and shape spherical agnps nm300 10 16 w w and fibrous agnrs nm302 8 6 wt were purchased from fraunhofer germany as standard reference nanomaterials according to the procedure described in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd test guideline for the testing and assessment of manufactured nanomaterials oecd guideline 2009 according to tem analysis and uv vis spectra the agnps have a spherical shape and the average particle size is 15 nm 90 20 nm the agnrs have the diameter from 100 to 200 nm and range from 5 to 10 μm in length fresh agnps and agnrs stock dispersions with various concentrations were prepared and ultrasonically treated before use according to a previous study wang et al 2016 2 2 bacterial strain and growth conditions inhibition assay of agnps and agnrs treatments on pao1 p aeruginosa pao1 dsm no 22644 was purchased from the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen gmbh dsmz germany the bacteria were inoculated in rubber stopper sealed sterile serum bottles containing 150 ml of anaerobic glym9 medium in an anaerobic chamber then incubated with shaking 150 rpm at 30 c webb et al 2003 a series of different dosages of agnps 0 0 5 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 50 mg l and agnrs 0 1 10 20 30 50 100 150 and 300 mg l were separately added into the cultures at around 14 h after the incubation when the cultures were in the early log phase of growth with the optical density at 600 nm od600 at around 0 2 the antimicrobial susceptibilities of agnps and agnrs were studied spectrophotometrically at od600 by the turbidity method for 24 h at 2 h intervals by using a genesys 10s uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific australia the superimposed light absorption by agnps and agnrs was corrected by subtracting the absorption contributed by agnms using a serial of abiotic controls dosed with the corresponding agnms concentrations the live and dead cells percentages following the treatment with agnps and agnrs were investigated by staining with live dead kit containing syto9 and propidium iodide solution baclighttm bacterial viability kit l7012 propidium iodide solution was also used for detecting cell membrane permeability after subtracting dead cell population the dye 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcf da abcam uk was used to evaluate the intracellular ros generation both live dead percentage cell membrane permeability and ros generation were detected under a facsaria ii bd biosciences san jose ca flow cytometer using previously described methods lu et al 2018 all experiments were conducted in biological triplicates 2 3 chemical analyses the concentration of nitrogen species nitrate nitrite and glycerol during the incubation were detected across the 24 h experimental period after filtering pore size 0 22 μm merck millipore usa nitrogen species in samples were analyzed on a lachat quikchem 8000 flow injection analyzer fia and the glycerol was detected via a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2 4 tem of nanomaterials treated pao1 tem characterization was performed on a jem 1010 jeol usa transmission electron microscope cells of p aeruginosa after 2 h treatment with agnps 0 20 25 and 30 mg l and agnrs 0 30 and 300 mg l were observed under tem in order to elucidate the different antibacterial mechanism of agnps and agnrs according to previously described methods guo et al 2017 2 5 silver speciation by synchrotron based xas the speciation of ag in the treated cell cultures under exposure of agnps 20 mg l and agnrs 30 mg l was assessed in situ using ag k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy with a agno3 control the xanes spectra were collected at the xas beamline at the australian synchrotron melbourne using a liquid helium cryostat the detailed method is described in text s1 2 6 rna extraction rna sequencing bioinformatic analysis and data availability pao1 samples were taken for rna extraction from agnps and agnrs treated and the control cultures after 2 h of nanoparticles addition total rna extraction was conducted using qiagen mirneasy mini kit catalog no 217004 strand specific cdna library construction and illumina paired end sequencing hiseq 2500 illumina inc san diego ca was conducted by macrogen seoul korea rna sequencing data processing method is similar with our previous study lu et al 2018 which is described in text s2 briefly changes in expression values were calculated between the untreated control agnps treated 1 20 and 25 mg l and agnrs treated 1 30 and 300 mg l p aeruginosa by determining the log2 fold change lfc of the averaged fragments per kilobase of a gene per million mapped reads fpkm values the raw sequencing data was uploaded to the ncbi s gene expression omnibus database and can be accessed through the geo series accession no gse139104 3 results and discussion 3 1 agnms inhibit p aeruginosa proliferation 3 1 1 cell growth of p aeruginosa inhibited by agnps and agnrs the 24 h growth kinetics of pao1 under various agnms exposure conditions were reflected by the turbidity at 600 nm od600 the od600 profiles of all the agnms treatments were shown in fig s1 the od600 profiles under selected agnps 0 1 20 25 and 30 mg l and agnrs 0 1 30 and 300 mg l concentrations were presented in the main text both agnps and agnrs were found to inhibit pao1 growth at high concentrations fig 1 a in terms of the pao1 growth in response to agnps the low dosage level 1 mg l of agnps did not have a significant effect on pao1 growth throughout the whole 24 h exposure period p 0 05 after 2 h addition of 20 25 and 30 mg l agnps the growth of pao1 stopped fig 1a this was distinctly inhibited p 0 01 for the rest of the 22 h period at 30 mg l agnps exposure but it recovered after 8 h at 20 mg l agnps and after 12 h at 25 mg l agnps for agnrs concentrations from 1 to 30 mg l did not significantly affect the pao1 growth p 0 05 but agnrs dosage at 300 mg l significantly p 0 01 inhibited the cell proliferation fig 1a noteworthy although the superimposed light absorption by agnms was corrected by subtracting the absorption contributed by agnms immediately after the initial dosage at 0 h agnms could still aggregate or precipitate during the testing period thus the aggregation or precipitation might result in a nonhomogeneous change in the turbidity which might be the reason of the sudden increase of od600 after 2 h dosage of 20 25 and 30 mg l agnps in order to confirm the effects of agnps and agnrs on the cell growth of p aeruginosa we further measured the cell density and viability in the p aeruginosa cultures amended without and with different levels of agnps and agnrs through flow cytometry results showed that the viable cell percentage dramatically decreased from 98 3 7 9 under control conditions after 2 h to 7 8 3 7 at 20 mg l agnps 4 3 0 7 at 25 mg l agnps 3 8 0 6 at 30 mg l agnps and 40 2 1 6 at 300 mg l agnrs after 2 h exposure p 0 01 this decrease lasted to 24 h under 30 mg l agnps and 300 mg l agnrs treatments in contrast the percentage of live cells increased to 13 6 1 7 and 10 7 1 5 at 24 h under 20 and 25 mg l agnps treatment respectively which might due to the regrowth after 8 h of 20 mg l agnps treatment and 12 h of 25 mg l agnps treatment fig 1b 3 1 2 agnps and agnrs induce oxidative stress membrane damage and sos response it is reported that agnms could generate ros which may also affect the cell membrane membrane proteins and induce dna damage carlson et al 2008 choi and hu 2008 moreover agnps could directly damage cell membrane render bacteria more permeable marambio jones and hoek 2010 sondi and salopek sondi 2004 in this study we found that at low concentrations both agnps 1 mg l and agnrs 1 and 30 mg l did not significantly p 0 05 increase the cellular ros generation or the cell membrane permeability however the cellular ros generation and the cell membrane permeability significantly p 0 05 p 0 01 increased during exposures of 20 25 and 30 mg l agnps and 300 mg l agnrs fig 1c and d furthermore tem images revealed that the agnps and agnrs accumulated surrounding the pao1 cells and was associated with the cell membrane damage fig 1f and g compared to untreated pao1 fig 1e the cell borders of pao1 under 20 mg l agnps figs 1f and 300 mg l agnrs fig 1g were indistinct and cytoplasm leakage was evident such alterations in the cell morphology could also be observed from tem images under the exposure of 25 and 30 mg l agnps figs s2a and b but could not be distinguishably observed under 30 mg l agnrs treatment fig s2c we further evaluated the pao1 molecular response to agnps and agnrs by using the genome wide rna sequencing genes were considered differentially regulated if log2 fold change lfc of fpkm 1 and false discovery rate fdr 0 001 differentially expressed genes within all agnps concentrations fig s3a within all agnrs concentrations fig s3b and between 1 mg l agnps and agnrs concentrations fig s3c are shown in venn diagrams overall we detected 1042 1657 and 603 genes showed increased transcripts and 560 1433 and 97 genes were down regulated in response to the exposures of 1 20 and 25 mg l agnps respectively in contrast only 83 29 and 154 genes were up regulated while 12 9 and 46 were genes were down regulated in response to the exposures of 1 30 and 300 mg l agnrs respectively the overall numbers of differentially expressed genes belonging to different functional categories of orthologous groups cog categories triggered by agnps and agnrs were shown in figs s3d and s3e respectively in particular there are the largest number of differently regulated genes in the cog class of metabolism when exposed to both agnms the rna expression profiles revealed several transcripts coding for the enzymes involved in oxidative stress ahpc ahpf kata sodb soxa soxb soxd and soxg and sos response lexa muts pa0962 pa4671 reca recf and recn were highly up regulated lfc 2 across all concentrations 1 20 and 25 mg l of agnps dosage fig 1h in comparison these genes were moderately up regulated lfc 2 after exposure to all agnrs concentrations after 12 h treatment fig 1h likewise the genes coding for outer membrane porins were also highly up regulated lfc 2 under agnps exposure fig 1h since outer membrane porins function as diffusion channels increased porin levels will lead to increased cell membrane permeability nikaido 2003 which might increase the sensitivity of pao1 to agnps additionally the genes involved in osmotic stress amgr osmc and osme were highly up regulated under agnps dosage e g with lfc of 2 86 1 87 and 2 29 at 20 mg l agnps dosage respectively but did not differ under agnrs exposure fig 1h these results might indicate the intracellular concertation of ag increased during the exposure to agnps but not to agnrs possibly the agnps penetrate the cell or facilitate the entry of ag into the cells due to nanoparticle induced permeability pogodin et al 2012 interestingly the expression levels of genes coding for resistance nodulation cell division rnd metal cation efflux system czcab rnd multidrug efflux membrane fusion protein mexcdefghi multidrug efflux outer membrane protein oprjn and multidrug resistance efflux pump pa1237 pa1238 pa4375 pa5160 and pa5294 were significantly down regulated lfc 2 under all exposure levels of agnps in contrast the expression levels of those efflux related genes in the agnrs treated cells did not vary compared to the untreated control 2 lfc 0 fig 1h these efflux systems function to modulate the resistance of pao1 towards antimicrobials and metal cations caille et al 2007 dieppois et al 2012 li et al 1998 sanchez et al 2002 consequently the lowered expression of these efflux systems might increase the intracellular level of ag ion and cause the increased sensitivity to antimicrobials 3 2 agnms stimulate the metabolism of p aeruginosa pao1 3 2 1 agnps accelerate the specific denitrification rate as a typical model denitrifier p aeruginosa pao1 can reduce nitrate no3 to molecular nitrogen n2 through a series of intermediate processes via anaerobic respiration in this study the metabolic activity of pao1 was measured through the denitrification and glycerol catabolism fig s4 and fig 2 a the overall nitrate reduction rates at low concentrations of agnps 1 mg l and all concentrations of agnrs treated samples were very similar to that of the untreated control in contrast the overall denitrification rates were significantly reduced when exposed to 25 and 30 mg l agnps p 0 05 in total 57 mg n l nitrate was converted into nitrite at the initial 2 h under 30 mg l agnps exposure neither glycerol utilization fig s4 or nitrate reduction was detected afterward fig 2a at this time the growth of pao1 had stopped fig 1a cell activity had ceased and were likely dead fig 1b in contrast at the exposure of 20 mg l agnps the overall denitrification rate was only slightly lower than that of the untreated control the overall denitrification rate under the exposure of 20 mg l agnps was 15 5 mg n l h which was lower than untreated control of 18 4 mg n l h p 0 05 fig 2a however the viable cell percentage of 20 mg l agnps treated pao1 was only 13 6 1 7 after 24 h exposure after normalization the calculated denitrification rate per cell of the 20 mg l agnps treated pao1 was enhanced to 5 2 ng n l h per cell which was significantly p 0 01 higher than that of the control group 367 5 pg n l h per cell similarly the denitrification rates per cell of pao1 under the exposure of 25 mg l agnps and 300 mg l agnrs increased to 1 0 ng n l h per cell and 367 5 pg n l h per cell respectively which were significantly higher than the control p 0 01 thus it was seen that at certain concentrations of the exposure these agnms significantly enhanced the specific denitrification rate of pao1 the transcriptomic response also revealed that agnps treatment affected the expression of a large number of pao1 denitrification and energy conversion related genes in pao1 the complete denitrification pathway is performed by four enzymes nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos those enzymes are encoded by genes narghij nar nircmnqs nir norbcdefq nor and nosz nos fig 2b the genes coding for these enzymes and those involved in nitrite extrusion nirk1 and nirk2 were highly up regulated table s1 fig 2c during the exposure to all agnps concentrations particularly for the exposures of 1 and 20 mg l agnps fig 2c this might explain how the lower level of live cells 15 could still convert high levels of nitrate at the exposure of 20 mg l agnps at 24 h fig 2a in comparison the expression of those denitrification related genes were only slightly up regulated under all agnrs concentration and 30 mg l agnps 0 lfc 1 table s1 this might due to the limited uptake of silver when exposed to agnrs and cytotoxic effect posed by 30 mg l agnps which inhibited cellular response in contrast the transcription levels of these denitrification related genes were down regulated during the pao1 exposure to cuo nps particularly for 10 and 50 mg l which might indicates the nanomaterial specific bacterial response guo et al 2017 in addition to the denitrification genes mentioned above genes encoding the energy conversion atpa to atpi and electron transfer ubiacegh and nuoa to nuon were highly up regulated across all agnps and agnrs exposure concentrations fig 2c typically the respiratory denitrification activity would facilitate atp generation by contributing to the formation of the cellular proton motive force in p aeruginosa through the membrane bound atpase borrero de acuña et al 2016 3 2 2 agnms promote glycerol and amino acid metabolism as part of the increases in denitrification during the exposure to agnps it is expected that increased glycerol catabolism would occur in this study glycerol was provided as the electron donor and carbon source for the pao1 denitrification in pao1 glycerol is converted into glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate by consuming one atp molecule and then into pyruvate via the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway generates atp and nadh or entner duoforoff ed pathway generates nadph before being utilized in the tca cycle or metabolized into acetate for energy generation fig 3 a overall around 235 6 mg l glycerol was consumed across the 24 h period under the untreated control the glycerol consumption rates under the exposure to both agnms were similar to the control except under 25 and 30 mg l agnps only 19 2 mg l and 55 7 mg l glycerol were consumed under 25 and 30 mg l agnps after 24 h treatment fig s4 under the exposure to agnps the transcription of all the genes coding for enzymes involved in the entire glycerol catabolism had dramatically increased especially under 1 and 20 mg l agnps table s2 fig 3c while agnrs also moderately increased the expression of those genes 0 lfc 1 table s2 fig 3c additionally the genes encoding enzymes in the tca cycle sdhabcd sucabcd and glcdef were also up regulated under all agnps agnrs dosage table s3 in addition to energy conservation pyruvate and 3 phospho glycerate generated during glycerol catabolism could also be the substrates for amino acid synthesis in pao1 these related amino acids include serine alanine proline glutamine arginine and cysteine which can be involved in the inactivation of cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of silver ions fig 3a mulley et al 2014 our transcriptomic results also indicated the expression of all the genes related to those amino acids synthesis were up regulated fig 3c these responses may be playing a role in the tolerance of pao1 against agnps agnrs to illustrate cysteine contains thiol groups that can bind to heavy metal ion such as ag thereby neutralize the activity of silver nitrate against p aeruginosa paol liau et al 1997 such a mechanism is suggested to lead to the reduced antibacterial activities of agnps against staphylococcus aureus grade et al 2012 in this study we examined the transformations of agnps and agnrs together with agno3 after 24 exposure using xanes spectroscopy our results demonstrated that 84 3 4 of agnps was present as ag cysteine in the biomass with 16 3 3 of agnps as silver phytate fig 3b and table s4 for agnrs 46 5 6 of the agnrs were present as ag cysteine 17 6 9 as agcl and 35 4 0 as agnps fig 3b and table s4 these results indicated the majority of ag speciation from agnps agnrs was transformed into ag cysteine in pao1 which supports the suggestion that pao1 exhibits tolerance against agnps agnrs by over producing cysteine to reduce the bioavailability of ag from agnps agnrs 3 3 agnms affect pao1 pyocin production and quorum sensing 3 3 1 agnms induce pyocin production in pao1 many bacteria produce bacteriocins which are bactericidal against the same or closely related species bacteriocins produced by p aeruginosa are pyocins that include r type f type and s type michel briand and baysse 2002 specifically r type pyocins can provoke a depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane and dissipate the bacterial membrane potential by resembling contractile and inflexible tails of bacteriophages uratani and hoshino 1984a lee et al 1999 nakayama et al 2000 f type pyocins resemble non contractile but flexible bacteriophage tails nakayama et al 2000 while s type pyocins are protease sensitive colicin like proteins fig 4a in this study all the pyocins coding genes had increased expressions in agnps treated pao1 including genes coding for r type pyocins pa0617 pa0630 pa0717 pa0728 nakayama et al 2000 f type pyocins coding gene cluster pa0634 pa0648 nakayama et al 2000 and s type pyocins coding genes imm2 pa3866 pyos5 and pys2 fig 4 b and c these genes exhibited extreme increases table s5 of transcription when exposed to any concentration of agnps with up to a 503 fold lfc 8 98 change for the phage coat protein b encoding gene coab in the presence of 20 mg l agnps fig 4c it is reported that the over production of pyocins could be triggered by the sos response cirz et al 2006 the increased expression of the lexa and reca genes as part of the sos response is seen to be caused by mutagens such as mitomycin c or oxidative stress thus liberating the expression of the protein activator gene prtn by cleavage of the repressor prtr then up regulated prtn could activate the expression of r f and s type pyocin genes by binding to the p box in their promoters matsui et al 1993 therefore the increased pyocins production in pao1 induced by agnps might be due to the agnps induced sos response over expression of gene lexa and reca which is discussed above fig 1h in our previous study we also found that cuo nps could promote the expression of bacteriophage genes in pao1 via triggering the sos response huang et al 2018 which further indicated pao1 would initialize pyocins over expression upon mutagenic stress once synthesized r and f type pyocins could resemble the tails of bacteriophages without head structure nor nucleic acid content ishii et al 1965 after binding of a single pyocin particle the bacterium could be lysed by the dissipation of its membrane potential as an immediate consequence iijima 1978 uratani and hoshino 1984a which might partially contribute to the agnps induced cell death fig 1b however in regard to the pao1 community autolysis of a portion of the cells might be advantageous for the bacterial population at the multicellular level lewis 2000 for example cell lysis caused by pyocins could benefit a subpopulation of surviving cells and has an essential role in subsequent biofilm formation webb et al 2003 pyocin endolysin mediated cell lysis is seen to cause the production of bacterial membrane vesicles and the release of extracellular dna and cytosolic proteins this is seen in p aeruginosa biofilms where hollow centers in the biofilm form turnbull et al 2016 afterwards extracellular dna can facilitate the movement of cells in the development of the biofilm gloag et al 2013 subsequently biofilm development and dispersal could be a resistance mechanism to antimicrobial agents such as agnps costerton et al 1999 in this study we did observe planktonic p aeruginosa cells clustering together to form biofilm during the exposure to agnps these observations are in consistent with a previous report showing that sublethal concentrations of agnps stimulate biofilm development yang and alvarez 2015 together these effects may partially explain the regrowth of pao1 after 8 h of 20 mg l agnps treatment due to the biofilm contributed agnps tolerance fig 1a and fig 4b 3 3 2 agnms inhibit pao1 quorum sensing quorum sensing qs is a chemical communication signaling network that p aeruginosa uses to regulate the expression of pathogenic characters in this study we found that agnps significantly down regulated qs regulated genes specifically those genes coding for the virulence factors e g lasa protease lasb elastase rhamnolipid pqs anthranilate phenazine pyocyanin pyoverdine and pyochelin fig 4b and d these regulation alterations might start from increased expression of sigma factor coding gene rpos in response to agnps induced ros and dna damage sigma factor rpos activates the cellular protection in response to ros gerard et al 1999 and dna damage merrikh et al 2009 once activated rpos promotes the expression of rsma mukherjee et al 1998 a post transcriptional qs down regulator pessi et al 2001 together rpos and rsma represses the expression of rhl whiteley et al 2000 las pessi et al 2001 family genes and subsequently affect the downstream qs systems frederix and downie 2011 pessi et al 2001 qs could alter individual cell metabolism in order to coordinate the group behavior in pao1 qs deficient mutants are found to have increased metabolism by faster uptake of alanine and increased the release of acetate davenport et al 2015 thus the increased glycerol consumption and amino acid synthesis found in this study fig 3a and c during agnp exposure might have a potential correlation with the repressed qs related regulation moreover rhl and las qs systems are reported to repress pao1 denitrification activity toyofuku et al 2007 conversely the repressed rhl and las qs systems during agnps treatment might result in the stimulated denitrification activity of pao1 fig 2a and c it should be noted that one of the pao1 virulence factors pyocyanin not only can cause damage to host human tissues in pathogenic pao1 but also has antibiotic properties to control other microbes jayaseelan et al 2014 therefore on the clinical aspect the agnms repressed pyocyanin production might reduce the virulence of pathogenic pao1 on the environmental aspect the agnms repressed pyocyanin production might lead to a microbial population shift in the mixed culture environments containing pao1 by reducing the antibiotic activities of pyocyanin which should be further explored in the future 3 4 the multifaceted responses of pao1 to agnms exposure this study investigated the physiological responses of the ubiquitous denitrifier p aeruginosa pao1 towards various concentrations of agnps agnrs here we suggest a model to describe the multiple responses of pao1 against agnps agnrs stress fig 5 in the model for the exposure to agnps firstly the ros mediated oxidative stress towards pao1 is induced and this leads to the accumulation of intracellular silver via the down regulation of metal efflux furthermore agnps induced ros could cause the damages of the cell membrane dna and the subsequent sos response the sos response triggers the expression of r and f type pyocins that result in cell lysis meanwhile the agnps induced dna damage and sos response repressed the quorum sensing of pao1 consequently the repressed quorum sensing stimulates various metabolisms of pao1 such as carbon consumption energy conservation denitrification and amino acid synthesis additionally the enhanced metabolism of pao1 and release of cytosolic content from lysed cells could benefit biofilm development and increase the organism s resistance against agnps for exposure to agnrs at high levels the model suggests the induction of oxidative stress membrane damage and pyocins caused cell death however compared to agnps the response of pao1 to agnrs was less toxic even at much higher concentrations overall agnp exposure showed higher growth inhibition ros generation cell membrane damage carbon metabolism denitrification stimulation and quorum sensing repression effects towards pao1 compared to agnrs this is likely due to the better cellular uptake of agnps while agnrs cannot enter the cell due to its larger size the up regulation of osmotic stress response genes induced by agnps might also reflect the uptake of agnps our results might support the findings that the physiochemical properties of agnps e g size shape and concentration can cause differentiated toxicities prior to their cellular penetration and accumulation akter et al 2018 3 5 environmental implications in this study we demonstrated that the exposure to agnms at the environmental relevant concentrations e g 1 mg l and up to sublethal concentrations e g 20 or 30 mg l for agnps inhibited the pao1 growth via oxidative stress and pyocins production however pyocins produced this way could mediate the biofilm formation which could promote pao1 to develop resistance against silver yang and alvarez 2015 moreover the over production of pf filamentous bacteriophage type r pyocin could promote the colonization of pathogenic pao1 in human and prevent the clearance of pao1 infection sweere et al 2019 thus agnms contamination in the environment might exacerbate the pao1 virulence and pathogenesis as well as alter the pao1 resistance against antimicrobials additionally we revealed that agnms could reduce the pao1 quorum sensing via inducing dna damage and sos response in turn the down regulated quorum sensing could stimulate the metabolism of pao1 including specific denitrification rate toyofuku et al 2007 moreover reduced pao1 virulence factors production might favor the growth of pao1 competing microorganisms which increases the diversity of the community jayaseelan et al 2014 it is also noticeable that agnms could stimulate the growth of sulfate reducing bacterium desulfovibrio vulgaris chen et al 2018 thus the impact of agnms to the environment microorganisms might be species specific and even more complex lastly since qs systems of pseudomonas control the denitrification aromatics biodegradation as well as electricity harvest during wastewater treatment yong et al 2015 the impact of agnms on wastewater treatment requires further investigation 4 conclusion in summary we exposed a ubiquitous denitrifier pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 to two types of agnms with different sizes and combined physiological experiments microscopy synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy xas flow cytometry and genome wide rna sequencing to comprehensively analyze the bacterial response our findings demonstrated that the exposure to two types of agnms with different sizes could result in the overproduction of oxidative stress and cell membrane damage thereby inhibited the growth of pao1 in addition both agnms could stimulate the denitrification glycerol amino acid metabolisms sos response and pyocin overproduction while repress the quorum sensing and metal efflux related genes in pao1 the continuous release of agnms to the environment might exacerbate the pao1 virulence pathogenesis and resistance against antimicrobials this study advances the understanding of microbial susceptibility tolerance and resistance under the exposure of agnms and will assist in assessing the potential risks of agnms to the public health and the environment

18317,the release of silver nanomaterials agnms from extensive use poses potential risks to human health and ecological environments although previous studies have reported the negative effects of agnms on various microorganisms little is known about the response of bacteria under the exposure of agnms at the cellular level here we report the multiple responses of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 pao1 under the exposure of two types of agnms including spherical silver nanoparticles agnps and fibrous silver nanorods agnrs by physiological experiments microscopy synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy xas flow cytometry and genome wide rna sequencing our results demonstrated that the exposure to both types of agnms could inhibit the growth of pao1 accompanied by the overproduction of oxidative stress and inducing cell membrane damage transmission electron microscopy revealed the roughened cell membrane under both agnms treatment in addition both agnms repressed the expression of quorum sensing and metal efflux related genes in pao1 but stimulated denitrification glycerol and amino acid metabolisms sos response and pyocin overproduction of pao1 compared to agnrs agnps exposure showed a much lower threshold concentration to trigger the inhibitory effect and induced greater transcriptional responses of pao1 this study suggested that agnms could cause multiple effects on the proliferation metabolism virulence and pathogenesis of pao1 which might further affect the corresponding environmental microbial communities overall our findings offer insights into the interactions between agnms and bacteria at the molecular level graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver nanomaterials pyocin quorum sensing genome wide rna sequencing denitrification 1 introduction engineered metal based nanomaterials have been intensively used in various industrial sectors for example silver nanomaterials agnms have been increasingly used in food processing water treatment consumer products such as cosmetics textiles plastics metal products cleaning agents paint and antibacterial medicine yu et al 2013 the estimated consumption amount of agnms is over 500 tons annually worldwide piccinno et al 2012 consequently increasing concentrations of agnms in surface water and wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been detected over the last decade coll et al 2016 furthermore the transformation and persistence of agnms in aquatic environments varies depending on the size elemental composition and surface modification levard et al 2012 agnms are seen to have a board spectrum antibacterial ability franci et al 2015 however details of the cellular responses to these nanomaterials are yet to be determined previous studies on eco toxicity of agnms have focused on revealing the effective concentration ec50 or minimal inhibitory concentrations mics on microorganisms as well as examining the transformation of agnms within engineered systems that include bioreactor anaya et al 2016 sewer brunetti et al 2015 and wwtps kaegi et al 2011 as well as in complicated aquatic systems sheng and liu 2017 in these studies it is suggested that the inhibitory effects of agnms are induced through the dissolution of silver ions choi et al 2008 liu and hurt 2010 generation of reactive oxygen species ros carlson et al 2008 or by direct disruption of bacterial membranes anaya et al 2016 choi et al 2008 moreover the toxicity of agnms seems to be concentration and size shape dependent hong et al 2016 sheng and liu 2017 small sized silver nanoparticles agnps d90 20 nm are found to elicit more inhibitory effects in comparison to large sized agnps d90 100 nm this is due to their larger surface to volume ratios morones et al 2005 and more capabilities to enter the cells hsiao et al 2015 and cause cytotoxic effects via increasing ros production carlson et al 2008 in addition previous studies mainly focused on macro parameters e g growth inhibition rate oxygen uptake rate and substrate utilization rate and a few studies tracked the expression of a limited subset of genes associated with the oxidative stress membrane and dna repair using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt pcr sheng and liu 2011 yang and alvarez 2015 however there lacks a comprehensive understanding of the cellular responses to agnms this could be achieved by combining detected responses of physiological features with variations in genome wide expression profiles singh et al 2019 such a comparative analysis could advance the current understanding of how agnms affect individual bacterial physiology and cellular functions including cellular processes signaling information storage processing and metabolism in clinical settings such an approach might improve the understanding of potential impacts of agnms on bacteria antimicrobial resistance virulence and pathogenesis in environmental settings such a study might provide insights for the impacts of agnms on the microbe that participates in important environmental processes e g nitrogen and carbon cycling organic matter biodegradation as well as electron transfer the objectives of this study were to investigate the response of bacteria under the exposure of agnms at the cellular level and to compare whether the bacterial response is size dependent in order to achieve these aims we investigated the effects of agnms at bacteriostatic to biocidal concentrations by applying agnps spherical d90 20 nm and silver nanorods agnrs d90 100 200 nm 5 10 μm in length to the well studied model microorganism pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 p aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can thrive in various environments among immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis patients p aeruginosa infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality rosenfeld et al 2003 it is also a ubiquitous denitrifier that participates in nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment processes by combining the physiological responses profiles transmission electron microscopy tem synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy xas flow cytometry and genome wide rna sequencing we determined the microbial response to the exposure of agnps or agnrs and revealed potential mechanisms of agnms on p aeruginosa our study provides molecular insights into the understanding of potential impacts of agnms on bacteria in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 silver nanomaterials two types of agnms differing in both size and shape spherical agnps nm300 10 16 w w and fibrous agnrs nm302 8 6 wt were purchased from fraunhofer germany as standard reference nanomaterials according to the procedure described in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd test guideline for the testing and assessment of manufactured nanomaterials oecd guideline 2009 according to tem analysis and uv vis spectra the agnps have a spherical shape and the average particle size is 15 nm 90 20 nm the agnrs have the diameter from 100 to 200 nm and range from 5 to 10 μm in length fresh agnps and agnrs stock dispersions with various concentrations were prepared and ultrasonically treated before use according to a previous study wang et al 2016 2 2 bacterial strain and growth conditions inhibition assay of agnps and agnrs treatments on pao1 p aeruginosa pao1 dsm no 22644 was purchased from the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen gmbh dsmz germany the bacteria were inoculated in rubber stopper sealed sterile serum bottles containing 150 ml of anaerobic glym9 medium in an anaerobic chamber then incubated with shaking 150 rpm at 30 c webb et al 2003 a series of different dosages of agnps 0 0 5 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 50 mg l and agnrs 0 1 10 20 30 50 100 150 and 300 mg l were separately added into the cultures at around 14 h after the incubation when the cultures were in the early log phase of growth with the optical density at 600 nm od600 at around 0 2 the antimicrobial susceptibilities of agnps and agnrs were studied spectrophotometrically at od600 by the turbidity method for 24 h at 2 h intervals by using a genesys 10s uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific australia the superimposed light absorption by agnps and agnrs was corrected by subtracting the absorption contributed by agnms using a serial of abiotic controls dosed with the corresponding agnms concentrations the live and dead cells percentages following the treatment with agnps and agnrs were investigated by staining with live dead kit containing syto9 and propidium iodide solution baclighttm bacterial viability kit l7012 propidium iodide solution was also used for detecting cell membrane permeability after subtracting dead cell population the dye 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcf da abcam uk was used to evaluate the intracellular ros generation both live dead percentage cell membrane permeability and ros generation were detected under a facsaria ii bd biosciences san jose ca flow cytometer using previously described methods lu et al 2018 all experiments were conducted in biological triplicates 2 3 chemical analyses the concentration of nitrogen species nitrate nitrite and glycerol during the incubation were detected across the 24 h experimental period after filtering pore size 0 22 μm merck millipore usa nitrogen species in samples were analyzed on a lachat quikchem 8000 flow injection analyzer fia and the glycerol was detected via a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2 4 tem of nanomaterials treated pao1 tem characterization was performed on a jem 1010 jeol usa transmission electron microscope cells of p aeruginosa after 2 h treatment with agnps 0 20 25 and 30 mg l and agnrs 0 30 and 300 mg l were observed under tem in order to elucidate the different antibacterial mechanism of agnps and agnrs according to previously described methods guo et al 2017 2 5 silver speciation by synchrotron based xas the speciation of ag in the treated cell cultures under exposure of agnps 20 mg l and agnrs 30 mg l was assessed in situ using ag k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy with a agno3 control the xanes spectra were collected at the xas beamline at the australian synchrotron melbourne using a liquid helium cryostat the detailed method is described in text s1 2 6 rna extraction rna sequencing bioinformatic analysis and data availability pao1 samples were taken for rna extraction from agnps and agnrs treated and the control cultures after 2 h of nanoparticles addition total rna extraction was conducted using qiagen mirneasy mini kit catalog no 217004 strand specific cdna library construction and illumina paired end sequencing hiseq 2500 illumina inc san diego ca was conducted by macrogen seoul korea rna sequencing data processing method is similar with our previous study lu et al 2018 which is described in text s2 briefly changes in expression values were calculated between the untreated control agnps treated 1 20 and 25 mg l and agnrs treated 1 30 and 300 mg l p aeruginosa by determining the log2 fold change lfc of the averaged fragments per kilobase of a gene per million mapped reads fpkm values the raw sequencing data was uploaded to the ncbi s gene expression omnibus database and can be accessed through the geo series accession no gse139104 3 results and discussion 3 1 agnms inhibit p aeruginosa proliferation 3 1 1 cell growth of p aeruginosa inhibited by agnps and agnrs the 24 h growth kinetics of pao1 under various agnms exposure conditions were reflected by the turbidity at 600 nm od600 the od600 profiles of all the agnms treatments were shown in fig s1 the od600 profiles under selected agnps 0 1 20 25 and 30 mg l and agnrs 0 1 30 and 300 mg l concentrations were presented in the main text both agnps and agnrs were found to inhibit pao1 growth at high concentrations fig 1 a in terms of the pao1 growth in response to agnps the low dosage level 1 mg l of agnps did not have a significant effect on pao1 growth throughout the whole 24 h exposure period p 0 05 after 2 h addition of 20 25 and 30 mg l agnps the growth of pao1 stopped fig 1a this was distinctly inhibited p 0 01 for the rest of the 22 h period at 30 mg l agnps exposure but it recovered after 8 h at 20 mg l agnps and after 12 h at 25 mg l agnps for agnrs concentrations from 1 to 30 mg l did not significantly affect the pao1 growth p 0 05 but agnrs dosage at 300 mg l significantly p 0 01 inhibited the cell proliferation fig 1a noteworthy although the superimposed light absorption by agnms was corrected by subtracting the absorption contributed by agnms immediately after the initial dosage at 0 h agnms could still aggregate or precipitate during the testing period thus the aggregation or precipitation might result in a nonhomogeneous change in the turbidity which might be the reason of the sudden increase of od600 after 2 h dosage of 20 25 and 30 mg l agnps in order to confirm the effects of agnps and agnrs on the cell growth of p aeruginosa we further measured the cell density and viability in the p aeruginosa cultures amended without and with different levels of agnps and agnrs through flow cytometry results showed that the viable cell percentage dramatically decreased from 98 3 7 9 under control conditions after 2 h to 7 8 3 7 at 20 mg l agnps 4 3 0 7 at 25 mg l agnps 3 8 0 6 at 30 mg l agnps and 40 2 1 6 at 300 mg l agnrs after 2 h exposure p 0 01 this decrease lasted to 24 h under 30 mg l agnps and 300 mg l agnrs treatments in contrast the percentage of live cells increased to 13 6 1 7 and 10 7 1 5 at 24 h under 20 and 25 mg l agnps treatment respectively which might due to the regrowth after 8 h of 20 mg l agnps treatment and 12 h of 25 mg l agnps treatment fig 1b 3 1 2 agnps and agnrs induce oxidative stress membrane damage and sos response it is reported that agnms could generate ros which may also affect the cell membrane membrane proteins and induce dna damage carlson et al 2008 choi and hu 2008 moreover agnps could directly damage cell membrane render bacteria more permeable marambio jones and hoek 2010 sondi and salopek sondi 2004 in this study we found that at low concentrations both agnps 1 mg l and agnrs 1 and 30 mg l did not significantly p 0 05 increase the cellular ros generation or the cell membrane permeability however the cellular ros generation and the cell membrane permeability significantly p 0 05 p 0 01 increased during exposures of 20 25 and 30 mg l agnps and 300 mg l agnrs fig 1c and d furthermore tem images revealed that the agnps and agnrs accumulated surrounding the pao1 cells and was associated with the cell membrane damage fig 1f and g compared to untreated pao1 fig 1e the cell borders of pao1 under 20 mg l agnps figs 1f and 300 mg l agnrs fig 1g were indistinct and cytoplasm leakage was evident such alterations in the cell morphology could also be observed from tem images under the exposure of 25 and 30 mg l agnps figs s2a and b but could not be distinguishably observed under 30 mg l agnrs treatment fig s2c we further evaluated the pao1 molecular response to agnps and agnrs by using the genome wide rna sequencing genes were considered differentially regulated if log2 fold change lfc of fpkm 1 and false discovery rate fdr 0 001 differentially expressed genes within all agnps concentrations fig s3a within all agnrs concentrations fig s3b and between 1 mg l agnps and agnrs concentrations fig s3c are shown in venn diagrams overall we detected 1042 1657 and 603 genes showed increased transcripts and 560 1433 and 97 genes were down regulated in response to the exposures of 1 20 and 25 mg l agnps respectively in contrast only 83 29 and 154 genes were up regulated while 12 9 and 46 were genes were down regulated in response to the exposures of 1 30 and 300 mg l agnrs respectively the overall numbers of differentially expressed genes belonging to different functional categories of orthologous groups cog categories triggered by agnps and agnrs were shown in figs s3d and s3e respectively in particular there are the largest number of differently regulated genes in the cog class of metabolism when exposed to both agnms the rna expression profiles revealed several transcripts coding for the enzymes involved in oxidative stress ahpc ahpf kata sodb soxa soxb soxd and soxg and sos response lexa muts pa0962 pa4671 reca recf and recn were highly up regulated lfc 2 across all concentrations 1 20 and 25 mg l of agnps dosage fig 1h in comparison these genes were moderately up regulated lfc 2 after exposure to all agnrs concentrations after 12 h treatment fig 1h likewise the genes coding for outer membrane porins were also highly up regulated lfc 2 under agnps exposure fig 1h since outer membrane porins function as diffusion channels increased porin levels will lead to increased cell membrane permeability nikaido 2003 which might increase the sensitivity of pao1 to agnps additionally the genes involved in osmotic stress amgr osmc and osme were highly up regulated under agnps dosage e g with lfc of 2 86 1 87 and 2 29 at 20 mg l agnps dosage respectively but did not differ under agnrs exposure fig 1h these results might indicate the intracellular concertation of ag increased during the exposure to agnps but not to agnrs possibly the agnps penetrate the cell or facilitate the entry of ag into the cells due to nanoparticle induced permeability pogodin et al 2012 interestingly the expression levels of genes coding for resistance nodulation cell division rnd metal cation efflux system czcab rnd multidrug efflux membrane fusion protein mexcdefghi multidrug efflux outer membrane protein oprjn and multidrug resistance efflux pump pa1237 pa1238 pa4375 pa5160 and pa5294 were significantly down regulated lfc 2 under all exposure levels of agnps in contrast the expression levels of those efflux related genes in the agnrs treated cells did not vary compared to the untreated control 2 lfc 0 fig 1h these efflux systems function to modulate the resistance of pao1 towards antimicrobials and metal cations caille et al 2007 dieppois et al 2012 li et al 1998 sanchez et al 2002 consequently the lowered expression of these efflux systems might increase the intracellular level of ag ion and cause the increased sensitivity to antimicrobials 3 2 agnms stimulate the metabolism of p aeruginosa pao1 3 2 1 agnps accelerate the specific denitrification rate as a typical model denitrifier p aeruginosa pao1 can reduce nitrate no3 to molecular nitrogen n2 through a series of intermediate processes via anaerobic respiration in this study the metabolic activity of pao1 was measured through the denitrification and glycerol catabolism fig s4 and fig 2 a the overall nitrate reduction rates at low concentrations of agnps 1 mg l and all concentrations of agnrs treated samples were very similar to that of the untreated control in contrast the overall denitrification rates were significantly reduced when exposed to 25 and 30 mg l agnps p 0 05 in total 57 mg n l nitrate was converted into nitrite at the initial 2 h under 30 mg l agnps exposure neither glycerol utilization fig s4 or nitrate reduction was detected afterward fig 2a at this time the growth of pao1 had stopped fig 1a cell activity had ceased and were likely dead fig 1b in contrast at the exposure of 20 mg l agnps the overall denitrification rate was only slightly lower than that of the untreated control the overall denitrification rate under the exposure of 20 mg l agnps was 15 5 mg n l h which was lower than untreated control of 18 4 mg n l h p 0 05 fig 2a however the viable cell percentage of 20 mg l agnps treated pao1 was only 13 6 1 7 after 24 h exposure after normalization the calculated denitrification rate per cell of the 20 mg l agnps treated pao1 was enhanced to 5 2 ng n l h per cell which was significantly p 0 01 higher than that of the control group 367 5 pg n l h per cell similarly the denitrification rates per cell of pao1 under the exposure of 25 mg l agnps and 300 mg l agnrs increased to 1 0 ng n l h per cell and 367 5 pg n l h per cell respectively which were significantly higher than the control p 0 01 thus it was seen that at certain concentrations of the exposure these agnms significantly enhanced the specific denitrification rate of pao1 the transcriptomic response also revealed that agnps treatment affected the expression of a large number of pao1 denitrification and energy conversion related genes in pao1 the complete denitrification pathway is performed by four enzymes nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos those enzymes are encoded by genes narghij nar nircmnqs nir norbcdefq nor and nosz nos fig 2b the genes coding for these enzymes and those involved in nitrite extrusion nirk1 and nirk2 were highly up regulated table s1 fig 2c during the exposure to all agnps concentrations particularly for the exposures of 1 and 20 mg l agnps fig 2c this might explain how the lower level of live cells 15 could still convert high levels of nitrate at the exposure of 20 mg l agnps at 24 h fig 2a in comparison the expression of those denitrification related genes were only slightly up regulated under all agnrs concentration and 30 mg l agnps 0 lfc 1 table s1 this might due to the limited uptake of silver when exposed to agnrs and cytotoxic effect posed by 30 mg l agnps which inhibited cellular response in contrast the transcription levels of these denitrification related genes were down regulated during the pao1 exposure to cuo nps particularly for 10 and 50 mg l which might indicates the nanomaterial specific bacterial response guo et al 2017 in addition to the denitrification genes mentioned above genes encoding the energy conversion atpa to atpi and electron transfer ubiacegh and nuoa to nuon were highly up regulated across all agnps and agnrs exposure concentrations fig 2c typically the respiratory denitrification activity would facilitate atp generation by contributing to the formation of the cellular proton motive force in p aeruginosa through the membrane bound atpase borrero de acuña et al 2016 3 2 2 agnms promote glycerol and amino acid metabolism as part of the increases in denitrification during the exposure to agnps it is expected that increased glycerol catabolism would occur in this study glycerol was provided as the electron donor and carbon source for the pao1 denitrification in pao1 glycerol is converted into glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate by consuming one atp molecule and then into pyruvate via the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway generates atp and nadh or entner duoforoff ed pathway generates nadph before being utilized in the tca cycle or metabolized into acetate for energy generation fig 3 a overall around 235 6 mg l glycerol was consumed across the 24 h period under the untreated control the glycerol consumption rates under the exposure to both agnms were similar to the control except under 25 and 30 mg l agnps only 19 2 mg l and 55 7 mg l glycerol were consumed under 25 and 30 mg l agnps after 24 h treatment fig s4 under the exposure to agnps the transcription of all the genes coding for enzymes involved in the entire glycerol catabolism had dramatically increased especially under 1 and 20 mg l agnps table s2 fig 3c while agnrs also moderately increased the expression of those genes 0 lfc 1 table s2 fig 3c additionally the genes encoding enzymes in the tca cycle sdhabcd sucabcd and glcdef were also up regulated under all agnps agnrs dosage table s3 in addition to energy conservation pyruvate and 3 phospho glycerate generated during glycerol catabolism could also be the substrates for amino acid synthesis in pao1 these related amino acids include serine alanine proline glutamine arginine and cysteine which can be involved in the inactivation of cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of silver ions fig 3a mulley et al 2014 our transcriptomic results also indicated the expression of all the genes related to those amino acids synthesis were up regulated fig 3c these responses may be playing a role in the tolerance of pao1 against agnps agnrs to illustrate cysteine contains thiol groups that can bind to heavy metal ion such as ag thereby neutralize the activity of silver nitrate against p aeruginosa paol liau et al 1997 such a mechanism is suggested to lead to the reduced antibacterial activities of agnps against staphylococcus aureus grade et al 2012 in this study we examined the transformations of agnps and agnrs together with agno3 after 24 exposure using xanes spectroscopy our results demonstrated that 84 3 4 of agnps was present as ag cysteine in the biomass with 16 3 3 of agnps as silver phytate fig 3b and table s4 for agnrs 46 5 6 of the agnrs were present as ag cysteine 17 6 9 as agcl and 35 4 0 as agnps fig 3b and table s4 these results indicated the majority of ag speciation from agnps agnrs was transformed into ag cysteine in pao1 which supports the suggestion that pao1 exhibits tolerance against agnps agnrs by over producing cysteine to reduce the bioavailability of ag from agnps agnrs 3 3 agnms affect pao1 pyocin production and quorum sensing 3 3 1 agnms induce pyocin production in pao1 many bacteria produce bacteriocins which are bactericidal against the same or closely related species bacteriocins produced by p aeruginosa are pyocins that include r type f type and s type michel briand and baysse 2002 specifically r type pyocins can provoke a depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane and dissipate the bacterial membrane potential by resembling contractile and inflexible tails of bacteriophages uratani and hoshino 1984a lee et al 1999 nakayama et al 2000 f type pyocins resemble non contractile but flexible bacteriophage tails nakayama et al 2000 while s type pyocins are protease sensitive colicin like proteins fig 4a in this study all the pyocins coding genes had increased expressions in agnps treated pao1 including genes coding for r type pyocins pa0617 pa0630 pa0717 pa0728 nakayama et al 2000 f type pyocins coding gene cluster pa0634 pa0648 nakayama et al 2000 and s type pyocins coding genes imm2 pa3866 pyos5 and pys2 fig 4 b and c these genes exhibited extreme increases table s5 of transcription when exposed to any concentration of agnps with up to a 503 fold lfc 8 98 change for the phage coat protein b encoding gene coab in the presence of 20 mg l agnps fig 4c it is reported that the over production of pyocins could be triggered by the sos response cirz et al 2006 the increased expression of the lexa and reca genes as part of the sos response is seen to be caused by mutagens such as mitomycin c or oxidative stress thus liberating the expression of the protein activator gene prtn by cleavage of the repressor prtr then up regulated prtn could activate the expression of r f and s type pyocin genes by binding to the p box in their promoters matsui et al 1993 therefore the increased pyocins production in pao1 induced by agnps might be due to the agnps induced sos response over expression of gene lexa and reca which is discussed above fig 1h in our previous study we also found that cuo nps could promote the expression of bacteriophage genes in pao1 via triggering the sos response huang et al 2018 which further indicated pao1 would initialize pyocins over expression upon mutagenic stress once synthesized r and f type pyocins could resemble the tails of bacteriophages without head structure nor nucleic acid content ishii et al 1965 after binding of a single pyocin particle the bacterium could be lysed by the dissipation of its membrane potential as an immediate consequence iijima 1978 uratani and hoshino 1984a which might partially contribute to the agnps induced cell death fig 1b however in regard to the pao1 community autolysis of a portion of the cells might be advantageous for the bacterial population at the multicellular level lewis 2000 for example cell lysis caused by pyocins could benefit a subpopulation of surviving cells and has an essential role in subsequent biofilm formation webb et al 2003 pyocin endolysin mediated cell lysis is seen to cause the production of bacterial membrane vesicles and the release of extracellular dna and cytosolic proteins this is seen in p aeruginosa biofilms where hollow centers in the biofilm form turnbull et al 2016 afterwards extracellular dna can facilitate the movement of cells in the development of the biofilm gloag et al 2013 subsequently biofilm development and dispersal could be a resistance mechanism to antimicrobial agents such as agnps costerton et al 1999 in this study we did observe planktonic p aeruginosa cells clustering together to form biofilm during the exposure to agnps these observations are in consistent with a previous report showing that sublethal concentrations of agnps stimulate biofilm development yang and alvarez 2015 together these effects may partially explain the regrowth of pao1 after 8 h of 20 mg l agnps treatment due to the biofilm contributed agnps tolerance fig 1a and fig 4b 3 3 2 agnms inhibit pao1 quorum sensing quorum sensing qs is a chemical communication signaling network that p aeruginosa uses to regulate the expression of pathogenic characters in this study we found that agnps significantly down regulated qs regulated genes specifically those genes coding for the virulence factors e g lasa protease lasb elastase rhamnolipid pqs anthranilate phenazine pyocyanin pyoverdine and pyochelin fig 4b and d these regulation alterations might start from increased expression of sigma factor coding gene rpos in response to agnps induced ros and dna damage sigma factor rpos activates the cellular protection in response to ros gerard et al 1999 and dna damage merrikh et al 2009 once activated rpos promotes the expression of rsma mukherjee et al 1998 a post transcriptional qs down regulator pessi et al 2001 together rpos and rsma represses the expression of rhl whiteley et al 2000 las pessi et al 2001 family genes and subsequently affect the downstream qs systems frederix and downie 2011 pessi et al 2001 qs could alter individual cell metabolism in order to coordinate the group behavior in pao1 qs deficient mutants are found to have increased metabolism by faster uptake of alanine and increased the release of acetate davenport et al 2015 thus the increased glycerol consumption and amino acid synthesis found in this study fig 3a and c during agnp exposure might have a potential correlation with the repressed qs related regulation moreover rhl and las qs systems are reported to repress pao1 denitrification activity toyofuku et al 2007 conversely the repressed rhl and las qs systems during agnps treatment might result in the stimulated denitrification activity of pao1 fig 2a and c it should be noted that one of the pao1 virulence factors pyocyanin not only can cause damage to host human tissues in pathogenic pao1 but also has antibiotic properties to control other microbes jayaseelan et al 2014 therefore on the clinical aspect the agnms repressed pyocyanin production might reduce the virulence of pathogenic pao1 on the environmental aspect the agnms repressed pyocyanin production might lead to a microbial population shift in the mixed culture environments containing pao1 by reducing the antibiotic activities of pyocyanin which should be further explored in the future 3 4 the multifaceted responses of pao1 to agnms exposure this study investigated the physiological responses of the ubiquitous denitrifier p aeruginosa pao1 towards various concentrations of agnps agnrs here we suggest a model to describe the multiple responses of pao1 against agnps agnrs stress fig 5 in the model for the exposure to agnps firstly the ros mediated oxidative stress towards pao1 is induced and this leads to the accumulation of intracellular silver via the down regulation of metal efflux furthermore agnps induced ros could cause the damages of the cell membrane dna and the subsequent sos response the sos response triggers the expression of r and f type pyocins that result in cell lysis meanwhile the agnps induced dna damage and sos response repressed the quorum sensing of pao1 consequently the repressed quorum sensing stimulates various metabolisms of pao1 such as carbon consumption energy conservation denitrification and amino acid synthesis additionally the enhanced metabolism of pao1 and release of cytosolic content from lysed cells could benefit biofilm development and increase the organism s resistance against agnps for exposure to agnrs at high levels the model suggests the induction of oxidative stress membrane damage and pyocins caused cell death however compared to agnps the response of pao1 to agnrs was less toxic even at much higher concentrations overall agnp exposure showed higher growth inhibition ros generation cell membrane damage carbon metabolism denitrification stimulation and quorum sensing repression effects towards pao1 compared to agnrs this is likely due to the better cellular uptake of agnps while agnrs cannot enter the cell due to its larger size the up regulation of osmotic stress response genes induced by agnps might also reflect the uptake of agnps our results might support the findings that the physiochemical properties of agnps e g size shape and concentration can cause differentiated toxicities prior to their cellular penetration and accumulation akter et al 2018 3 5 environmental implications in this study we demonstrated that the exposure to agnms at the environmental relevant concentrations e g 1 mg l and up to sublethal concentrations e g 20 or 30 mg l for agnps inhibited the pao1 growth via oxidative stress and pyocins production however pyocins produced this way could mediate the biofilm formation which could promote pao1 to develop resistance against silver yang and alvarez 2015 moreover the over production of pf filamentous bacteriophage type r pyocin could promote the colonization of pathogenic pao1 in human and prevent the clearance of pao1 infection sweere et al 2019 thus agnms contamination in the environment might exacerbate the pao1 virulence and pathogenesis as well as alter the pao1 resistance against antimicrobials additionally we revealed that agnms could reduce the pao1 quorum sensing via inducing dna damage and sos response in turn the down regulated quorum sensing could stimulate the metabolism of pao1 including specific denitrification rate toyofuku et al 2007 moreover reduced pao1 virulence factors production might favor the growth of pao1 competing microorganisms which increases the diversity of the community jayaseelan et al 2014 it is also noticeable that agnms could stimulate the growth of sulfate reducing bacterium desulfovibrio vulgaris chen et al 2018 thus the impact of agnms to the environment microorganisms might be species specific and even more complex lastly since qs systems of pseudomonas control the denitrification aromatics biodegradation as well as electricity harvest during wastewater treatment yong et al 2015 the impact of agnms on wastewater treatment requires further investigation 4 conclusion in summary we exposed a ubiquitous denitrifier pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 to two types of agnms with different sizes and combined physiological experiments microscopy synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy xas flow cytometry and genome wide rna sequencing to comprehensively analyze the bacterial response our findings demonstrated that the exposure to two types of agnms with different sizes could result in the overproduction of oxidative stress and cell membrane damage thereby inhibited the growth of pao1 in addition both agnms could stimulate the denitrification glycerol amino acid metabolisms sos response and pyocin overproduction while repress the quorum sensing and metal efflux related genes in pao1 the continuous release of agnms to the environment might exacerbate the pao1 virulence pathogenesis and resistance against antimicrobials this study advances the understanding of microbial susceptibility tolerance and resistance under the exposure of agnms and will assist in assessing the potential risks of agnms to the public health and the environment

18318,the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa one of the most widely used brominated flame retardant was evaluated during peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation tbbpa degradation was ph dependent with peak degradation rate constants occurring at ph 8 0 9 0 which was distinct from some other phenolic compounds singlet oxygen and radicals were found to play negligible roles in tbbpa degradation tbbpa oxidation by pms mainly proceeded via a direct oxidation pathway and the in situ formed hobr was found to greatly accelerate its degradation rates the values of species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of pms with the tbbpa khso5 tbbpa khso5 tbbpa and khso 5 tbbpa2 were determined to be 1 11 0 84 10 2 8 05 2 31 10 2 and 1 34 0 25 10 1 m 1 s 1 respectively while the reaction rate constants for hobr obr with tbbpa khobr tbbpa khobr tbbpa khobr tbbpa2 and kobr tbbpa2 were determined to be 9 38 2 10 103 1 59 0 56 105 8 22 0 41 106 and 1 81 0 12 106 m 1 s 1 respectively the bromine mass balance analysis showed that bromide ion and hobr obr occupied 19 5 of total br and brominated organic compounds accounted for the remaining percentages at ph 7 0 no formation of bromate was observed based on the identified products a reaction pathway was proposed which included oxidation β scission hydroxylation and dimerization reaction pathways the results indicate that unactivated pms is useful for the remediation of tbbpa contaminated water graphical abstract image 1 keywords tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa peroxymonosulfate pms hobr oxidation water treatment 1 introduction tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is one of the most widely used brominated flame retardants bfr around the world and has been extensively detected in various environmental matrices such as soil water and sediments wong et al 2007 tbbpa has been recognized as an emerging contaminant and a potentially toxic endocrine disruptor alaee et al 2003 considering the persistence and toxicity aforementioned it is necessary to develop effective techniques for removal of tbbpa various methods have been developed to remove tbbpa from water including adsorption fasfous et al 2010 photocatalytic degradation xu et al 2011 microbial degradation lin et al 2009 shen et al 2018 and chemical oxidation feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 han et al 2008 lin et al 2009 pang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 zhong et al 2014 such as permanganate mn vii ferrate fe vi and free chlorine hocl recently peroxymonosulfate pms has been increasingly considered as an alternative method for pollutant removal duan et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 pms activation by heat light or transition metals generates so4 and ho radicals which are very known to be effective to eliminate a variety group of pollutants ding et al 2013 guan et al 2011 liu et al 2015 pms was also found to be selective to degrade electron rich substances via non radical reactions zhou et al 2018a 2018b for instance pms could directly oxidize sulfonamide antibiotics β lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolone antibiotics through attacking at the aniline moiety or thioether sulfur groups chen et al 2018 ji et al 2018 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a due to the lower oxidation capacity of so5 2 than hso5 the reaction rates of pms and antibiotics were generally reduced above ph 10 0 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a the oxidation of phenols by pms however showed increasing degradation rates with increasing ph autocatalysis of phenols were found in pms oxidation in alkaline conditions due to the contribution of singlet oxygen 1o2 which was produced from self decomposition of pms in alkaline ph the minor pathway and from activation of pms by quinone intermediates the major pathway zhou et al 2017 the increasing reaction rates with increasing ph were due to the enhanced generation of singlet oxygen under alkaline conditions chlorophenols e g chlorophenol dichlorophenol and trichlorophenol were found to be persistent at acidic ph but were greatly degraded at alkaline ph too li et al 2019 1o2 was also found to be the predominant reactive species in chlorophenols degradation and the trace amount of so4 and ho from direct activation of pms also contributed to their degradation li et al 2019 meanwhile chlorophenols degradation depended on the numbers of chlorine in phenol and the removal rates followed the order of trichlorophenol dichlorophenol chlorophenol tetrachlorophenol at alkaline ph li et al 2019 regarding to bromophenols there were some studies on their degradation in pms activated processes by carbon nanotube co ii and cufeo4 ding et al 2013 guan et al 2017 2018 ji et al 2016 information on brominated phenols including tbbpa by pms oxidation was rather limited bromide has been found to be one product from tbbpa degradation led by ferrate han et al 2018 and free chlorine oxidation gao et al 2016 pms oxidation of tbbpa may also release bromide ions guan et al 2018 bromide can be oxidized by pms to form free bromine hobr obr heeb et al 2014 zhou et al 2018b which is very reactive towards phenolic structures range 104 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 the reactions of free bromine with phenols are mainly via an electrophilic substitution and the depronated species generally have higher reaction rate constants than the undepronated ones acero et al 2005 criquet et al 2015 among those reactions bromide often acts as a catalyst heeb et al 2014 but few researches have reported the existence of such a catalytic reaction for the oxidation of bromophenols without introducing exogenous bromide ions in tbbpa degradation by hocl bromide released from tbbpa during chlorination was proposed to the main reason why the experimental observed rate constant was 2 orders of magnitude higher than the predicted one without considering hobr formation gao et al 2016 therefore in tbbpa degradation by pms oxidation multiple reaction species such as pms radicals so4 and ho 1o2 and hobr may get involved in to date little is known about the reactive species ph effects and mechanisms in tbbpa degradation by pms in this work the reactive species involved and the reaction mechanisms during pms oxidation of tbbpa were explored and the effects of ph were also investigated the results demonstrated that unactivated pms was capable of oxidizing tbbpa without explicit activation and identified that the in situ formed hobr played an important role in tbbpa degradation a reaction scheme was proposed to illustrate the reaction pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1

pms oxidation and the role of oxidative species fig 1 a shows the time course profiles of tbbpa degradation by pms over ph range of 4 0 10 0 the degradation of tbbpa showed a strong ph dependence tbbpa was completely degraded after 3 h at ph 7 0 9 0 but was barely degraded at ph 4 0 5 0 and 10 0 this was different from phenols and chlorophenols which showed accelerated degradation with ph increasing zhou et al 2017 li et al 2019 for comparison bpa as an unbrominated analogue of tbbpa was also evaluated for pms oxidation fig 1b bpa showed fastest degradation rates at ph 9 0 10 0 but was barely degraded at ph 5 0 8 0 which followed the featured degradation kinetics as phenols and chlorophenols the results suggested that the degradation pathways of tbbpa can be different from those previously reported phenols and chlorophenols to explore whether 1o2 was produced and contributed to tbbpa degradation epr experiments were performed by reacting pms with tbbpa using tmp as the trapping reagent tmp can readily react with 1o2 to form a stable radical tmpo which shows a typical three line epr spectrum with equal intensities an 16 9 g g 2 0054 li et al 2000 moan and wold 1979 song et al 2006 as shown in fig s1a the characteristic signal of 1o2 was observed both in pms solution alone and in the mixing solutions of pms and tbbpa the signal of 1o2 detected in pms solution is due to the self decomposition of pms zhou et al 2015 moreover the signals of 1o2 became bigger in the presence of tbbpa the results indicated that the catalytic degradation of tbbpa by pms was accompanied by the generation of 1o2 signals of 1o2 were also detected at different ph and different reaction times fig s1b c after 30 min reaction the concentration of 1o2 reached maximum the intensity of 1o2 signals suggested that 1o2 concentration was highest under ph 7 0 which was different from other phenols that produced more 1o2 with ph increasing the second order rate constant for the reaction of tbbpa with 1o2 was determined to be 2 317 107 m 1 s 1 using rose bengal as the photosensitizer and ffa as the competitor details provided in text s1 and fig s2 yang et al 2013 to probe the contribution of 1o2 in tbbpa oxidation ffa was added ffa reacted with pms and 1o2 k 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 yang et al 2018 when attributing the decay of ffa to 1o2 alone fig s3 the calculated steady state concentration of 1o2 was 2 05 10 13 m which only contributed to 5 of tbbpa degradation in 3 h at ph 7 0 when 1o2 alone was considered its contribution to tbbpa was less than 5 thus the results indicated that 1o2 could not be the main active specie for tbbpa degradation to testify the role of ho and so4 in tbbpa degradation by pms quenching experiments were performed by adding excessive ethanol 100 mm and tba 100 mm as scavengers the second order rate constant for the reaction of ethanol with so4 and ho were 1 6 7 7 107 and 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively li et al 2018 and the reaction of tba with so4 and ho were 3 8 7 6 107 and 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 respectively anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 fig 2 a suggested that both ethanol and tba exhibited negligible effects on tbbpa degradation demonstrating that neither so4 nor ho was responsible for tbbpa degradation further epr experiments showed that the characteristic signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts do not appear in the epr spectrum fig s4 suggesting that so4 and ho did not participate in this process or their concentrations were too low to be detected to confirm the role of superoxide radicals o2 nbt was used as a qualitative indicator as it could be reduced by o2 k 5 88 104 m 1 s 1 to form monoformazan which exhibit a maximum absorption at 530 nm bielski et al 1980 however no significant change was observed in the uv vis adsorption spectra of nbt in pms tbbpa process fig s5 suggesting that negligible formation of o2 in this system as such the degradation of tbbpa was mainly contributed by pms direct oxidation but it should be noted that the oxidation kinetics of tbbpa by pms cannot be fitted by pseudo first order or pseudo second order kinetics as shown in fig s6 tbbpa degradation rate was accelerated with reaction proceeding the consumption of pms at the tested ph range was less than 5 9 fig s7 it was suspected that the formation of new active substances accelerates the reaction we proposed that the c br bond in tbbpa may be cleavaged and the resulting br may be oxidized by pms to form hobr which further involves in tbbpa degradation guan et al 2018 ji et al 2016 zhou et al 2018b by using 2 6 dimethylphenol as a derivatization reagent which can react with hobr to form 4 bromo 2 6 dimethylphenol the formation of hobr was confirmed during pms oxidation of tbbpa fig 2b the trend of hobr production was consistent with that of tbbpa degradation at different phs fig 1a the scavenging experiments were also performed by adding excessive nh4 1 0 mm as the quenching agent for hobr 2 2 105 m 1 s 1 inman and johnson 1984 as the generated bromamines reacted much slower than hobr heeb et al 2017 as showed in fig 2a the degradation of tbbpa in the later 2 h was greatly suppressed in the presence of nh4 at ph 7 0 it proved that hobr played a role in accelerating the tbbpa degradation fig 2c shows tbbpa degradation percentages after 2 h pms oxidation with and without adding nh4 quencher over ph range of 5 0 10 0 the promotion of hobr to accelerate tbbpa degradation under acidic condition was more obvious than that under alkaline condition hobr was not in steady state concentration but gradually increased with the reaction fig 2b therefore with time prolonging the rate of tbbpa decay was higher than in the beginning stage as such the degradation of tbbpa was attributed to oxidation by both pms and hobr formed in situ fig 2d it should be noted that the degradation of bpa was found to be accelerated in the co presence of tbbpa during pms oxidation fig s8 this could be due to the reaction of bpa with the in situ generated hobr k 4 0 105 m 1s 1 criquet et al 2015 the results further confirmed the importance role of the in situ generated hobr 3 2 ph dependent reaction rates of pms and hobr with tbbpa tbbpa oxidation by pms showed a ph dependent trend with peak decay rates at ph 8 0 9 0 fig 1a the changes of ph would induce the dissociation of both tbbpa and pms sun et al 2008 yang et al 2018 thus the ph dependence of degradation was attributed to a combined effect of pms speciation hso5 and so5 2 and tbbpa speciation tbbpa tbbpa and tbbpa2 the pka1 and pka2 values of tbbpa are 7 5 and 8 5 respectively sun et al 2008 and pms also possesses two pka values pka1 0 and pka2 9 4 yang et al 2018 the main reactions between pms and tbbpa to describe the ph dependency of tbbpa degradation were proposed as eq 1 4 since dissociated pms so5 2 has a lower oxidizing reactivity than hso5 the reactions of so5 2 with undissociated tbbpa were not considered and only tbbpa2 was included to simplify the kinetic model chen et al 2018 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a the apparent second order rate constant could be expressed as follows 1 hso 5 tbbpa k 1 products 2 hso 5 tbbpa k 2 products 3 hso 5 tbbpa 2 k 3 products 4 so 5 2 tbbpa 2 k 4 products the second order rate constants for the reaction of tbbpa with pms were determined with the presence of nh4 and ffa over ph range of 5 0 10 0 the observed decay kinetics of tbbpa followed the puesdo first order kinetics fig s9 the determined second order rate constants for the reactions of pms and tbbpa are plotted as a function of the ph in fig 3 a the values of species specific second order rate constants k1 k2 and k3 for the reaction of pms with the tbbpa were 1 11 0 84 10 2 8 05 2 31 10 2 and 1 34 0 25 10 1 m 1 s 1 respectively the values of k4 was below 10 4 m 1 s 1 which further confirmed that the dissociated so5 2 can hardly oxidize tbbpa at ph 5 0 tbbpa was present in neutral molecul and molecular tbbpa was very difficult to be oxidized by hso5 similar results for tbbpa degradation were observed in other oxidant mediated systems e g kmno4 mno2 hocl 1o2 at acidic conditions gao et al 2016 han et al 2008 lin et al 2009 pang et al 2014 at ph 10 0 pms predominantly exists in ionic form since the so5 2 e so 5 2 so 4 2 0 1 22 v has a lower oxidizing reactivity than hso5 e hso 5 so 4 2 0 1 75 v spiro 1979 tbbpa was negligiblely degraded by pms in alkaline condition the reaction of hobr with phenols was also ph dependent criquet et al 2015 to determine the reaction rate constants for hobr oxidation of tbbpa a kinetic model considering the speciation of the oxidant and the target compound was applied criquet et al 2015 gallard et al 2003 because pka value of hobr was 9 3 heeb et al 2014 the kinetics of the reactions between the bromine species and tbbpa species hobr tbbpa and obr tbbpa hobr tbbpa2 and obr tbbpa cannot be distinguished kinetically since they have the same ph dependence it is usually assumed that only one of the two pathways is important criquet et al 2012 2015 in consideration of the higher electrophility of hobr than obr reactions of hobr with tbbpa and tbbpa2 are considered here eq 6 7 the second order rate constants were thus determined following eq 5 8 and phenol was used as a competitor over the ph range of 6 0 10 0 text s2 and fig s10 5 hobr tbbpa k 5 products 6 hobr tbbpa k 6 products 7 hobr tbbpa 2 k 7 products 8 obr tbbpa 2 k 8 products the determined apparent second order rate constants for the reactions between bromine and tbbpa are plotted as a function of ph as shown in fig 3b the values of k5 k6 k7 and k8 were 9 38 2 10 103 1 59 0 56 105 8 22 0 41 106 and 1 81 0 12 106 m 1 s 1 respectively the main reactions occurred between hobr and the deprotonated tbbpa the dissociated forms of tbbpa were more susceptible to be oxidized being consistent with other phenolic compounds table s1 the reaction rate constants of hobr with disscoiated forms of tbbpa close to dihalogenated phenols and lower than monohalogenated phenols a hammett σ based qsar approach with log khobr pho 7 8 3 5 σ was applied to calculate the reaction rate constant of hobr with the deprotonated tbbpa k7 gallard et al 2003 heeb et al 2014 and the σ value of tbbpa was estimated to be 0 37 gao et al 2016 the estimated value of k7 was about 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 close to the experimental data in this study at ph 7 0 the apparent second order reaction rate constant of bromine with tbbpa was 7 23 104 m 1 s 1 which was about 400 times higher than that of pms and tbbpa k 178 4 m 1 s 1 during pms oxidation of tbbpa hobr was increasingly produced at 0 05 0 5 μm with time prolonging thus tbbpa degradation was greatly enhanced with the formation of hobr hobr levels seemed to increase with increasing ph from 5 0 to 9 0 but they greatly decreased at ph 10 0 this could be related with the reaction rate of pms with br which was higher when reacting with hso5 than so5 2 eq 9 10 lente et al 2009 zhou et al 2018b 9 hso 5 br 0 7 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 h o b r 10 so 5 2 br 0 17 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 h o b r thus the overall degradation of tbbpa followed two stages the direct oxidation by pms and the oxidation by the in situ formed hobr to further illustrate the reaction pathways the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h for tbbpa degradation at ph 4 0 as shown in fig 1a and fig s11 tbbpa degradation in the beginning 4 h was quite low 13 1 which was due to the very low reaction rate between hso5 and undissociated tbbpa but after 4 h reaction tbbpa started to degrade fast and was fully eliminated after 24 h which can be attributed to the generation of hobr in the system 3 3 influence of ha and real water matrix to testify the influence of humic acid ha in tbbpa degradation by pms experiments were conducted at ph 7 0 with varying concentrations of ha as shown in fig 4 the degradation of tbbpa was greatly suppressed in the presence of ha and the suppression was enhanced with elevated ha concentrations with the concentrations of ha increasing from 0 2 to 2 mg c l 1 tbbpa degradation greatly decreased from 95 to 7 6 after 2 h it has been reported that ha can activate pms to generate 1o2 zhou et al 2015 in this process the addition of ha 1 0 mg c l 1 slightly increased the generation of 1o2 fig s12 however such low promotion of 1o2 concentration was not enough to accelerate tbbpa degradation the observed tbbpa degradation rate was much lower than the calculated one by using the measured pms concentrations in the presence of 1 mg c l 1 ha together with the secondary reaction rate constants of pms with tbbpa fig s13a the possible reason was that the direct oxidation of tbbpa by pms may proceed through single electron transfer reactions to generate tbbpa phenoxy radicals eq 11 ha not only served as antioxidants to compete for pms but also acted as quenchers to reduce tbbpa radicals back to tbbpa eq 12 canonica and laubscher 2008 feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 11 tbbpa pms tbbpa 12 tbbpa ha tbbpa the generation of phenoxy radical via one electron transfer was also proposed in previous studies on tbbpa oxidation by chlorine and laccase feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 a good linear correlation of 1 kapp with ha concentration can corroborate the role of ha as the quenching agent of the radical intermediates text s3 canonica and laubscher 2008 gao et al 2016 lu et al 2015 as shown in fig s13b it suggested that ha played a similar role in pms degradation of tbbpa by reducing the oxidation intermediate to parent tbbpa the tbbpa degradation by pms oxidation was also conducted in the surface water sample fig s14 a slower degradation rate of tbbpa was observed in the surface water than in deionized water di water but with the presence of 1 74 mg doc l 1 in the surface water the complete removal of tbbpa was still achieved after 3 h reaction it seemed that the properties of natural organic matter had great impacts on the inhibition of tbbpa degradation which deserved further investigation 3 4 oxidation products and pathways the mass balance of br was achieved by summation the concentrations of br ion hobr obr and total organic bromine tobr fig 5 about 19 5 of br was in the form of hobr obr and br ion after 3 h reaction while most br still existed in the form of organic bromine which indicated the mineralization degree of tbbpa degraded by pms was not very high due to the relatively weak oxidation capacity of pms no formation of bromate was observed during the reaction fang and shang 2012 li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the chemical structures of brominated oxidation products were further identified by lc ms ms using the bromine precursor ion scans of m z 79 and 81 fig s15 displayed the chromatograms of tbbpa degradation by pms at different reaction time at ph 7 0 the observed intermediates are presented in table s2 in the precursor ion scan of m z 79 and 81 tbbpa rt 19 36 min was observed at ion clusters of m z 539 541 543 545 547 with an isotopic ratio of 1 4 6 4 1 product a rt 12 75 min was observed at the m z cluster of 307 309 311 at an isotopic ratio of 1 2 1 indicating the formation of a dibromo compound it was proposed as 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol which was identified by the major fragments of 17 oh 59 ch3 2 c oh and 80 82 h79br h81br observed in the product ion scan spectra fig s16 this product has also been detected in other oxidation systems e g mn vii fe vi mno2 hocl and laccase catalyzed oxidation feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 lin et al 2009 pang et al 2014 product b rt 18 09 min contained 4 br as its ion clusters at m z 555 557 559 561 563 had an isotopic ratio of 1 4 6 4 1 fig s16 it might be a dimeric product which was also detected in other mild oxidation cases pang et al 2014 product c eluted at 17 71 min had ion clusters at m z 326 328 330 332 with an isotopic ratio of 1 3 3 1 indicating the formation of a tribromo compound which was assigned as 2 4 6 tribromophenol fig s16 product c was detected in hocl oxidation but not detected in mn vii oxidation in which 2 6 dibromophenol was the scission product it might be scission product 2 6 dibromophenol reacted with hobr forming 2 4 6 tribromophenol both hocl and pms can transfer bromide to hobr lei et al 2004 zhou et al 2018b product d eluted at 16 21 min had ion clusters at m z 322 324 326 with an isotopic ratio of 1 2 1 indicating the formation of a tribromo compound which was assigned as 2 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyacetic acid fig s16 product e and product f were detected just at 1 h at the chromatograms product e had ion clusters at m z 294 296 298 with an isotopic ratio of 1 2 1 which was assigned as 2 6 dibromo 4 1 hydroxyethyl phenol and product f was a debromination product the ion clusters at m z 460 462 464 466 with an isotopic ratio of 1 3 3 1 which was assigned as tribromobisphenol a according to the time dependent trend of products in fig s17 product a was first generated upon pms addition the intensity of product a increased with increasing time in the first hour and decreased afterwards product b c and d started to form after 0 5 h reaction and product b and c had peak concentrations after 2 h reaction whereas the concentration of product d kept level during the reaction course product e and f was only found in the sample after 1 h and then quickly disappeared the formation of small molecular organic acids was also observed formic acid and acetic acid were generated in tbbpa degradation process but no oxalic acid was observed as shown in fig s18 the maximum yields of 2 28 μm formic acid and 0 19 μm acetic acid were achieved at 1 h reaction time meanwhile the formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas were also tracked bromoform at 6 51 1 17 μg l was observed after 24 h reaction and the formation of haas was not observed 0 1 μg l the transformation pathway of tbbpa by pms oxidation was thus proposed as shown in fig 6 tbbpa was initially oxidized by pms via single electron transfer step to form a phenoxy radical r1 due to the charge distribution and spin densities the radical r1 was resonated to r2 then the r2 radical underwent β scission in para position bonds of the phenol moiety tbbpa to generate a 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol cationic r3 and a 2 6 dibromophenol radical r4 subsequently r3 is subjected to a series reactions for instance r3 may form product a via hydroxylation and then combine with r4 to form a dimer product b or further oxidation to form carboxylation product d and demethylation product e in addition r4 would be further oxidized to 2 4 6 tribromophenol product c besides debromination process was also in progress to produce product f which was original source of br to in situ formed hobr the bromophenols may be further oxidized to generate small molecular organic compounds and bromide the detection of 2 4 6 tribromophenol product c was observed in hocl oxidation but not in the mn vii and laccase catalyzed oxidation cases where 2 6 dibromophenol was formed by r4 radical abstracted h from h2o instead pang et al 2014 feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 the formation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol may be due to the existence of hobr which can rapidly transfer r4 radical into 2 4 6 tribromophenol acero et al 2005 to further confirm the role of in situ formed hobr the products of tbbpa degradation by hobr alone was conducted the results indicated that the degradation pathway of tbbpa by hobr also included β scission through electron transfer the major products of tbbpa degraded by hobr were 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol product a and 2 4 6 tribromophenol product c and a new product 4 isopropylene 2 6 dibromophenol m z 288 290 292 was also observed fig s19 as shown in fig s20 the formation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol was highly dependent on the dosage of hobr the results supported that the generation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol through electrophilic aromatic substitution in pms oxidation was attributed to the in situ formed hobr 4 conclusions this study has found that pms had ph dependent oxidation activity with tbbpa with peak degradation rate constants at ph 8 0 9 0 pms oxidation of tbbpa proceeded mainly via non radical oxidation pathways and the intermediate oxidative specie hobr was found to accelerate the degradation rates of tbbpa especially in acidic conditions based on the identification of products and the mass balance of br the degradation pathways of tbbpa were proposed which mainly involved β scission and debromination to generate brominated organic products bromide and hobr this study presents a distinct reaction pathway for pms oxidation of bromophenols from other phenols and chlorophenols declaration of competing interest

18318,the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa one of the most widely used brominated flame retardant was evaluated during peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation tbbpa degradation was ph dependent with peak degradation rate constants occurring at ph 8 0 9 0 which was distinct from some other phenolic compounds singlet oxygen and radicals were found to play negligible roles in tbbpa degradation tbbpa oxidation by pms mainly proceeded via a direct oxidation pathway and the in situ formed hobr was found to greatly accelerate its degradation rates the values of species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of pms with the tbbpa khso5 tbbpa khso5 tbbpa and khso 5 tbbpa2 were determined to be 1 11 0 84 10 2 8 05 2 31 10 2 and 1 34 0 25 10 1 m 1 s 1 respectively while the reaction rate constants for hobr obr with tbbpa khobr tbbpa khobr tbbpa khobr tbbpa2 and kobr tbbpa2 were determined to be 9 38 2 10 103 1 59 0 56 105 8 22 0 41 106 and 1 81 0 12 106 m 1 s 1 respectively the bromine mass balance analysis showed that bromide ion and hobr obr occupied 19 5 of total br and brominated organic compounds accounted for the remaining percentages at ph 7 0 no formation of bromate was observed based on the identified products a reaction pathway was proposed which included oxidation β scission hydroxylation and dimerization reaction pathways the results indicate that unactivated pms is useful for the remediation of tbbpa contaminated water graphical abstract image 1 keywords tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa peroxymonosulfate pms hobr oxidation water treatment 1 introduction tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is one of the most widely used brominated flame retardants bfr around the world and has been extensively detected in various environmental matrices such as soil water and sediments wong et al 2007 tbbpa has been recognized as an emerging contaminant and a potentially toxic endocrine disruptor alaee et al 2003 considering the persistence and toxicity aforementioned it is necessary to develop effective techniques for removal of tbbpa various methods have been developed to remove tbbpa from water including adsorption fasfous et al 2010 photocatalytic degradation xu et al 2011 microbial degradation lin et al 2009 shen et al 2018 and chemical oxidation feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 han et al 2008 lin et al 2009 pang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 zhong et al 2014 such as permanganate mn vii ferrate fe vi and free chlorine hocl recently peroxymonosulfate pms has been increasingly considered as an alternative method for pollutant removal duan et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 pms activation by heat light or transition metals generates so4 and ho radicals which are very known to be effective to eliminate a variety group of pollutants ding et al 2013 guan et al 2011 liu et al 2015 pms was also found to be selective to degrade electron rich substances via non radical reactions zhou et al 2018a 2018b for instance pms could directly oxidize sulfonamide antibiotics β lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolone antibiotics through attacking at the aniline moiety or thioether sulfur groups chen et al 2018 ji et al 2018 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a due to the lower oxidation capacity of so5 2 than hso5 the reaction rates of pms and antibiotics were generally reduced above ph 10 0 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a the oxidation of phenols by pms however showed increasing degradation rates with increasing ph autocatalysis of phenols were found in pms oxidation in alkaline conditions due to the contribution of singlet oxygen 1o2 which was produced from self decomposition of pms in alkaline ph the minor pathway and from activation of pms by quinone intermediates the major pathway zhou et al 2017 the increasing reaction rates with increasing ph were due to the enhanced generation of singlet oxygen under alkaline conditions chlorophenols e g chlorophenol dichlorophenol and trichlorophenol were found to be persistent at acidic ph but were greatly degraded at alkaline ph too li et al 2019 1o2 was also found to be the predominant reactive species in chlorophenols degradation and the trace amount of so4 and ho from direct activation of pms also contributed to their degradation li et al 2019 meanwhile chlorophenols degradation depended on the numbers of chlorine in phenol and the removal rates followed the order of trichlorophenol dichlorophenol chlorophenol tetrachlorophenol at alkaline ph li et al 2019 regarding to bromophenols there were some studies on their degradation in pms activated processes by carbon nanotube co ii and cufeo4 ding et al 2013 guan et al 2017 2018 ji et al 2016 information on brominated phenols including tbbpa by pms oxidation was rather limited bromide has been found to be one product from tbbpa degradation led by ferrate han et al 2018 and free chlorine oxidation gao et al 2016 pms oxidation of tbbpa may also release bromide ions guan et al 2018 bromide can be oxidized by pms to form free bromine hobr obr heeb et al 2014 zhou et al 2018b which is very reactive towards phenolic structures range 104 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 the reactions of free bromine with phenols are mainly via an electrophilic substitution and the depronated species generally have higher reaction rate constants than the undepronated ones acero et al 2005 criquet et al 2015 among those reactions bromide often acts as a catalyst heeb et al 2014 but few researches have reported the existence of such a catalytic reaction for the oxidation of bromophenols without introducing exogenous bromide ions in tbbpa degradation by hocl bromide released from tbbpa during chlorination was proposed to the main reason why the experimental observed rate constant was 2 orders of magnitude higher than the predicted one without considering hobr formation gao et al 2016 therefore in tbbpa degradation by pms oxidation multiple reaction species such as pms radicals so4 and ho 1o2 and hobr may get involved in to date little is known about the reactive species ph effects and mechanisms in tbbpa degradation by pms in this work the reactive species involved and the reaction mechanisms during pms oxidation of tbbpa were explored and the effects of ph were also investigated the results demonstrated that unactivated pms was capable of oxidizing tbbpa without explicit activation and identified that the in situ formed hobr played an important role in tbbpa degradation a reaction scheme was proposed to illustrate the reaction pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1

pms oxidation and the role of oxidative species fig 1 a shows the time course profiles of tbbpa degradation by pms over ph range of 4 0 10 0 the degradation of tbbpa showed a strong ph dependence tbbpa was completely degraded after 3 h at ph 7 0 9 0 but was barely degraded at ph 4 0 5 0 and 10 0 this was different from phenols and chlorophenols which showed accelerated degradation with ph increasing zhou et al 2017 li et al 2019 for comparison bpa as an unbrominated analogue of tbbpa was also evaluated for pms oxidation fig 1b bpa showed fastest degradation rates at ph 9 0 10 0 but was barely degraded at ph 5 0 8 0 which followed the featured degradation kinetics as phenols and chlorophenols the results suggested that the degradation pathways of tbbpa can be different from those previously reported phenols and chlorophenols to explore whether 1o2 was produced and contributed to tbbpa degradation epr experiments were performed by reacting pms with tbbpa using tmp as the trapping reagent tmp can readily react with 1o2 to form a stable radical tmpo which shows a typical three line epr spectrum with equal intensities an 16 9 g g 2 0054 li et al 2000 moan and wold 1979 song et al 2006 as shown in fig s1a the characteristic signal of 1o2 was observed both in pms solution alone and in the mixing solutions of pms and tbbpa the signal of 1o2 detected in pms solution is due to the self decomposition of pms zhou et al 2015 moreover the signals of 1o2 became bigger in the presence of tbbpa the results indicated that the catalytic degradation of tbbpa by pms was accompanied by the generation of 1o2 signals of 1o2 were also detected at different ph and different reaction times fig s1b c after 30 min reaction the concentration of 1o2 reached maximum the intensity of 1o2 signals suggested that 1o2 concentration was highest under ph 7 0 which was different from other phenols that produced more 1o2 with ph increasing the second order rate constant for the reaction of tbbpa with 1o2 was determined to be 2 317 107 m 1 s 1 using rose bengal as the photosensitizer and ffa as the competitor details provided in text s1 and fig s2 yang et al 2013 to probe the contribution of 1o2 in tbbpa oxidation ffa was added ffa reacted with pms and 1o2 k 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 yang et al 2018 when attributing the decay of ffa to 1o2 alone fig s3 the calculated steady state concentration of 1o2 was 2 05 10 13 m which only contributed to 5 of tbbpa degradation in 3 h at ph 7 0 when 1o2 alone was considered its contribution to tbbpa was less than 5 thus the results indicated that 1o2 could not be the main active specie for tbbpa degradation to testify the role of ho and so4 in tbbpa degradation by pms quenching experiments were performed by adding excessive ethanol 100 mm and tba 100 mm as scavengers the second order rate constant for the reaction of ethanol with so4 and ho were 1 6 7 7 107 and 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively li et al 2018 and the reaction of tba with so4 and ho were 3 8 7 6 107 and 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 respectively anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 fig 2 a suggested that both ethanol and tba exhibited negligible effects on tbbpa degradation demonstrating that neither so4 nor ho was responsible for tbbpa degradation further epr experiments showed that the characteristic signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts do not appear in the epr spectrum fig s4 suggesting that so4 and ho did not participate in this process or their concentrations were too low to be detected to confirm the role of superoxide radicals o2 nbt was used as a qualitative indicator as it could be reduced by o2 k 5 88 104 m 1 s 1 to form monoformazan which exhibit a maximum absorption at 530 nm bielski et al 1980 however no significant change was observed in the uv vis adsorption spectra of nbt in pms tbbpa process fig s5 suggesting that negligible formation of o2 in this system as such the degradation of tbbpa was mainly contributed by pms direct oxidation but it should be noted that the oxidation kinetics of tbbpa by pms cannot be fitted by pseudo first order or pseudo second order kinetics as shown in fig s6 tbbpa degradation rate was accelerated with reaction proceeding the consumption of pms at the tested ph range was less than 5 9 fig s7 it was suspected that the formation of new active substances accelerates the reaction we proposed that the c br bond in tbbpa may be cleavaged and the resulting br may be oxidized by pms to form hobr which further involves in tbbpa degradation guan et al 2018 ji et al 2016 zhou et al 2018b by using 2 6 dimethylphenol as a derivatization reagent which can react with hobr to form 4 bromo 2 6 dimethylphenol the formation of hobr was confirmed during pms oxidation of tbbpa fig 2b the trend of hobr production was consistent with that of tbbpa degradation at different phs fig 1a the scavenging experiments were also performed by adding excessive nh4 1 0 mm as the quenching agent for hobr 2 2 105 m 1 s 1 inman and johnson 1984 as the generated bromamines reacted much slower than hobr heeb et al 2017 as showed in fig 2a the degradation of tbbpa in the later 2 h was greatly suppressed in the presence of nh4 at ph 7 0 it proved that hobr played a role in accelerating the tbbpa degradation fig 2c shows tbbpa degradation percentages after 2 h pms oxidation with and without adding nh4 quencher over ph range of 5 0 10 0 the promotion of hobr to accelerate tbbpa degradation under acidic condition was more obvious than that under alkaline condition hobr was not in steady state concentration but gradually increased with the reaction fig 2b therefore with time prolonging the rate of tbbpa decay was higher than in the beginning stage as such the degradation of tbbpa was attributed to oxidation by both pms and hobr formed in situ fig 2d it should be noted that the degradation of bpa was found to be accelerated in the co presence of tbbpa during pms oxidation fig s8 this could be due to the reaction of bpa with the in situ generated hobr k 4 0 105 m 1s 1 criquet et al 2015 the results further confirmed the importance role of the in situ generated hobr 3 2 ph dependent reaction rates of pms and hobr with tbbpa tbbpa oxidation by pms showed a ph dependent trend with peak decay rates at ph 8 0 9 0 fig 1a the changes of ph would induce the dissociation of both tbbpa and pms sun et al 2008 yang et al 2018 thus the ph dependence of degradation was attributed to a combined effect of pms speciation hso5 and so5 2 and tbbpa speciation tbbpa tbbpa and tbbpa2 the pka1 and pka2 values of tbbpa are 7 5 and 8 5 respectively sun et al 2008 and pms also possesses two pka values pka1 0 and pka2 9 4 yang et al 2018 the main reactions between pms and tbbpa to describe the ph dependency of tbbpa degradation were proposed as eq 1 4 since dissociated pms so5 2 has a lower oxidizing reactivity than hso5 the reactions of so5 2 with undissociated tbbpa were not considered and only tbbpa2 was included to simplify the kinetic model chen et al 2018 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a the apparent second order rate constant could be expressed as follows 1 hso 5 tbbpa k 1 products 2 hso 5 tbbpa k 2 products 3 hso 5 tbbpa 2 k 3 products 4 so 5 2 tbbpa 2 k 4 products the second order rate constants for the reaction of tbbpa with pms were determined with the presence of nh4 and ffa over ph range of 5 0 10 0 the observed decay kinetics of tbbpa followed the puesdo first order kinetics fig s9 the determined second order rate constants for the reactions of pms and tbbpa are plotted as a function of the ph in fig 3 a the values of species specific second order rate constants k1 k2 and k3 for the reaction of pms with the tbbpa were 1 11 0 84 10 2 8 05 2 31 10 2 and 1 34 0 25 10 1 m 1 s 1 respectively the values of k4 was below 10 4 m 1 s 1 which further confirmed that the dissociated so5 2 can hardly oxidize tbbpa at ph 5 0 tbbpa was present in neutral molecul and molecular tbbpa was very difficult to be oxidized by hso5 similar results for tbbpa degradation were observed in other oxidant mediated systems e g kmno4 mno2 hocl 1o2 at acidic conditions gao et al 2016 han et al 2008 lin et al 2009 pang et al 2014 at ph 10 0 pms predominantly exists in ionic form since the so5 2 e so 5 2 so 4 2 0 1 22 v has a lower oxidizing reactivity than hso5 e hso 5 so 4 2 0 1 75 v spiro 1979 tbbpa was negligiblely degraded by pms in alkaline condition the reaction of hobr with phenols was also ph dependent criquet et al 2015 to determine the reaction rate constants for hobr oxidation of tbbpa a kinetic model considering the speciation of the oxidant and the target compound was applied criquet et al 2015 gallard et al 2003 because pka value of hobr was 9 3 heeb et al 2014 the kinetics of the reactions between the bromine species and tbbpa species hobr tbbpa and obr tbbpa hobr tbbpa2 and obr tbbpa cannot be distinguished kinetically since they have the same ph dependence it is usually assumed that only one of the two pathways is important criquet et al 2012 2015 in consideration of the higher electrophility of hobr than obr reactions of hobr with tbbpa and tbbpa2 are considered here eq 6 7 the second order rate constants were thus determined following eq 5 8 and phenol was used as a competitor over the ph range of 6 0 10 0 text s2 and fig s10 5 hobr tbbpa k 5 products 6 hobr tbbpa k 6 products 7 hobr tbbpa 2 k 7 products 8 obr tbbpa 2 k 8 products the determined apparent second order rate constants for the reactions between bromine and tbbpa are plotted as a function of ph as shown in fig 3b the values of k5 k6 k7 and k8 were 9 38 2 10 103 1 59 0 56 105 8 22 0 41 106 and 1 81 0 12 106 m 1 s 1 respectively the main reactions occurred between hobr and the deprotonated tbbpa the dissociated forms of tbbpa were more susceptible to be oxidized being consistent with other phenolic compounds table s1 the reaction rate constants of hobr with disscoiated forms of tbbpa close to dihalogenated phenols and lower than monohalogenated phenols a hammett σ based qsar approach with log khobr pho 7 8 3 5 σ was applied to calculate the reaction rate constant of hobr with the deprotonated tbbpa k7 gallard et al 2003 heeb et al 2014 and the σ value of tbbpa was estimated to be 0 37 gao et al 2016 the estimated value of k7 was about 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 close to the experimental data in this study at ph 7 0 the apparent second order reaction rate constant of bromine with tbbpa was 7 23 104 m 1 s 1 which was about 400 times higher than that of pms and tbbpa k 178 4 m 1 s 1 during pms oxidation of tbbpa hobr was increasingly produced at 0 05 0 5 μm with time prolonging thus tbbpa degradation was greatly enhanced with the formation of hobr hobr levels seemed to increase with increasing ph from 5 0 to 9 0 but they greatly decreased at ph 10 0 this could be related with the reaction rate of pms with br which was higher when reacting with hso5 than so5 2 eq 9 10 lente et al 2009 zhou et al 2018b 9 hso 5 br 0 7 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 h o b r 10 so 5 2 br 0 17 m 1 s 1 so 4 2 h o b r thus the overall degradation of tbbpa followed two stages the direct oxidation by pms and the oxidation by the in situ formed hobr to further illustrate the reaction pathways the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h for tbbpa degradation at ph 4 0 as shown in fig 1a and fig s11 tbbpa degradation in the beginning 4 h was quite low 13 1 which was due to the very low reaction rate between hso5 and undissociated tbbpa but after 4 h reaction tbbpa started to degrade fast and was fully eliminated after 24 h which can be attributed to the generation of hobr in the system 3 3 influence of ha and real water matrix to testify the influence of humic acid ha in tbbpa degradation by pms experiments were conducted at ph 7 0 with varying concentrations of ha as shown in fig 4 the degradation of tbbpa was greatly suppressed in the presence of ha and the suppression was enhanced with elevated ha concentrations with the concentrations of ha increasing from 0 2 to 2 mg c l 1 tbbpa degradation greatly decreased from 95 to 7 6 after 2 h it has been reported that ha can activate pms to generate 1o2 zhou et al 2015 in this process the addition of ha 1 0 mg c l 1 slightly increased the generation of 1o2 fig s12 however such low promotion of 1o2 concentration was not enough to accelerate tbbpa degradation the observed tbbpa degradation rate was much lower than the calculated one by using the measured pms concentrations in the presence of 1 mg c l 1 ha together with the secondary reaction rate constants of pms with tbbpa fig s13a the possible reason was that the direct oxidation of tbbpa by pms may proceed through single electron transfer reactions to generate tbbpa phenoxy radicals eq 11 ha not only served as antioxidants to compete for pms but also acted as quenchers to reduce tbbpa radicals back to tbbpa eq 12 canonica and laubscher 2008 feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 11 tbbpa pms tbbpa 12 tbbpa ha tbbpa the generation of phenoxy radical via one electron transfer was also proposed in previous studies on tbbpa oxidation by chlorine and laccase feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 a good linear correlation of 1 kapp with ha concentration can corroborate the role of ha as the quenching agent of the radical intermediates text s3 canonica and laubscher 2008 gao et al 2016 lu et al 2015 as shown in fig s13b it suggested that ha played a similar role in pms degradation of tbbpa by reducing the oxidation intermediate to parent tbbpa the tbbpa degradation by pms oxidation was also conducted in the surface water sample fig s14 a slower degradation rate of tbbpa was observed in the surface water than in deionized water di water but with the presence of 1 74 mg doc l 1 in the surface water the complete removal of tbbpa was still achieved after 3 h reaction it seemed that the properties of natural organic matter had great impacts on the inhibition of tbbpa degradation which deserved further investigation 3 4 oxidation products and pathways the mass balance of br was achieved by summation the concentrations of br ion hobr obr and total organic bromine tobr fig 5 about 19 5 of br was in the form of hobr obr and br ion after 3 h reaction while most br still existed in the form of organic bromine which indicated the mineralization degree of tbbpa degraded by pms was not very high due to the relatively weak oxidation capacity of pms no formation of bromate was observed during the reaction fang and shang 2012 li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the chemical structures of brominated oxidation products were further identified by lc ms ms using the bromine precursor ion scans of m z 79 and 81 fig s15 displayed the chromatograms of tbbpa degradation by pms at different reaction time at ph 7 0 the observed intermediates are presented in table s2 in the precursor ion scan of m z 79 and 81 tbbpa rt 19 36 min was observed at ion clusters of m z 539 541 543 545 547 with an isotopic ratio of 1 4 6 4 1 product a rt 12 75 min was observed at the m z cluster of 307 309 311 at an isotopic ratio of 1 2 1 indicating the formation of a dibromo compound it was proposed as 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol which was identified by the major fragments of 17 oh 59 ch3 2 c oh and 80 82 h79br h81br observed in the product ion scan spectra fig s16 this product has also been detected in other oxidation systems e g mn vii fe vi mno2 hocl and laccase catalyzed oxidation feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 lin et al 2009 pang et al 2014 product b rt 18 09 min contained 4 br as its ion clusters at m z 555 557 559 561 563 had an isotopic ratio of 1 4 6 4 1 fig s16 it might be a dimeric product which was also detected in other mild oxidation cases pang et al 2014 product c eluted at 17 71 min had ion clusters at m z 326 328 330 332 with an isotopic ratio of 1 3 3 1 indicating the formation of a tribromo compound which was assigned as 2 4 6 tribromophenol fig s16 product c was detected in hocl oxidation but not detected in mn vii oxidation in which 2 6 dibromophenol was the scission product it might be scission product 2 6 dibromophenol reacted with hobr forming 2 4 6 tribromophenol both hocl and pms can transfer bromide to hobr lei et al 2004 zhou et al 2018b product d eluted at 16 21 min had ion clusters at m z 322 324 326 with an isotopic ratio of 1 2 1 indicating the formation of a tribromo compound which was assigned as 2 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyacetic acid fig s16 product e and product f were detected just at 1 h at the chromatograms product e had ion clusters at m z 294 296 298 with an isotopic ratio of 1 2 1 which was assigned as 2 6 dibromo 4 1 hydroxyethyl phenol and product f was a debromination product the ion clusters at m z 460 462 464 466 with an isotopic ratio of 1 3 3 1 which was assigned as tribromobisphenol a according to the time dependent trend of products in fig s17 product a was first generated upon pms addition the intensity of product a increased with increasing time in the first hour and decreased afterwards product b c and d started to form after 0 5 h reaction and product b and c had peak concentrations after 2 h reaction whereas the concentration of product d kept level during the reaction course product e and f was only found in the sample after 1 h and then quickly disappeared the formation of small molecular organic acids was also observed formic acid and acetic acid were generated in tbbpa degradation process but no oxalic acid was observed as shown in fig s18 the maximum yields of 2 28 μm formic acid and 0 19 μm acetic acid were achieved at 1 h reaction time meanwhile the formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas were also tracked bromoform at 6 51 1 17 μg l was observed after 24 h reaction and the formation of haas was not observed 0 1 μg l the transformation pathway of tbbpa by pms oxidation was thus proposed as shown in fig 6 tbbpa was initially oxidized by pms via single electron transfer step to form a phenoxy radical r1 due to the charge distribution and spin densities the radical r1 was resonated to r2 then the r2 radical underwent β scission in para position bonds of the phenol moiety tbbpa to generate a 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol cationic r3 and a 2 6 dibromophenol radical r4 subsequently r3 is subjected to a series reactions for instance r3 may form product a via hydroxylation and then combine with r4 to form a dimer product b or further oxidation to form carboxylation product d and demethylation product e in addition r4 would be further oxidized to 2 4 6 tribromophenol product c besides debromination process was also in progress to produce product f which was original source of br to in situ formed hobr the bromophenols may be further oxidized to generate small molecular organic compounds and bromide the detection of 2 4 6 tribromophenol product c was observed in hocl oxidation but not in the mn vii and laccase catalyzed oxidation cases where 2 6 dibromophenol was formed by r4 radical abstracted h from h2o instead pang et al 2014 feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 the formation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol may be due to the existence of hobr which can rapidly transfer r4 radical into 2 4 6 tribromophenol acero et al 2005 to further confirm the role of in situ formed hobr the products of tbbpa degradation by hobr alone was conducted the results indicated that the degradation pathway of tbbpa by hobr also included β scission through electron transfer the major products of tbbpa degraded by hobr were 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol product a and 2 4 6 tribromophenol product c and a new product 4 isopropylene 2 6 dibromophenol m z 288 290 292 was also observed fig s19 as shown in fig s20 the formation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol was highly dependent on the dosage of hobr the results supported that the generation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol through electrophilic aromatic substitution in pms oxidation was attributed to the in situ formed hobr 4 conclusions this study has found that pms had ph dependent oxidation activity with tbbpa with peak degradation rate constants at ph 8 0 9 0 pms oxidation of tbbpa proceeded mainly via non radical oxidation pathways and the intermediate oxidative specie hobr was found to accelerate the degradation rates of tbbpa especially in acidic conditions based on the identification of products and the mass balance of br the degradation pathways of tbbpa were proposed which mainly involved β scission and debromination to generate brominated organic products bromide and hobr this study presents a distinct reaction pathway for pms oxidation of bromophenols from other phenols and chlorophenols declaration of competing interest

18319,the positive roles of n acyl homoserine lactone ahl mediated quorum sensing qs in aerobic granular sludge ags have been widely acknowledged however it is not feasible to manipulate granulation via direct addition of ahl chemicals or ahl producing strains here several strains with high ahl producing capacity were successfully isolated from ags these qs strains were cultivated mixed as a consortium and then divided into two groups ahls supernatant and bacterial cells encapsulated in sodium alginate cebs the potential of qs regulation via doses of ahls supernatant and cebs in accelerating granulation was evaluated results clearly indicated that short term days 21 70 addition of ahls supernatant led to a rapid specific growth rate 0 08 d 1 compact structure without filamentous bacteria overgrowth excellent settlement performance svi10 37 2 ml g and a high integrity coefficient 4 4 of the granules sustainable release of ahls mainly c6 and c8 hsl was induced by exogenous ahls possibly attributed to the enrichment of the genera aeromonas and pseudomonas further tryptophan and aromatic protein substances were produced to maintain structural stability suggesting that short term qs regulation had long term positive effects on the characteristics of ags by comparison the addition of cebs posed negligible or negative impact on the granulation as evidenced by the rupture of smaller aggregates and poor characteristics of ags overall augmentation of the signaling content via addition of ahls supernatant from qs strains is an economical and feasible regulation strategy to accelerate granulation and sustain long term structural stability graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge ags quorum sensing qs regulation n acyl

distinct advantages such as higher biomass concentrations denser structure and faster settling ability adav et al 2008 these characteristics tend to facilitate sludge separation which allows a clarifier to be combined with the bioreactor and reduces footprint and energy consumption by approximately 75 and 25 respectively van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however long start up periods and the unstable granular structure during prolonged operations are key challenges that impede full scale applications of the ags technology guo et al 2019 therefore an effective and sustainable strategy for enhancing aerobic granulation is highly desirable comprehensive studies on the granulation mechanisms led to several theories for expediting granulation verawaty et al 2012 li et al 2017a pishgar et al 2019 with respect to granule development cell to cell interaction is the first and foremost step followed by bacterial attachment aggregation with self immobilization cohesion by extracellular polymeric substances eps and hydrodynamic shear forces to attain the dense structure zhou et al 2015 this ecological key role of cell to cell interaction in granule development suggests that strengthening bacterial communication may provide a new insight for accelerating sludge granulation bacteria have a communication system known as quorum sensing qs wherein bacteria secrete signal sensing molecules to regulate interactions between themselves and achieve their gene expression to orchestrate collective behavior when signal concentrations reach a threshold value feng et al 2014 n acyl homoserine lactone ahl is one of the main intra species auto inducers amongst gram negative bacteria which generally contains an acyl homoserine lactonic ring and can be classified by different acylation branched chains li et al 2015 ahls have been extensively studied in the field of environmental biotechnology i e in biofilm development as they can control the secretion of eps and aggregation of bacteria hu et al 2016 recently accumulating evidence shows that ahl mediated qs is positively and strongly related with the aerobic granulation process concentrations of specific ahl compounds obviously increased by 100 fold during the initiation of granulation in the add back study exogenous addition of four ahls with different molecular structures c6 3oc6 3oc8 and 3oc12 hsl was shown to promote the eps synthesis significantly tan et al 2014 inactivation of ahls by porcine kidney acylase resulted in the reduction of the bacterial attachment potential damage to the eps matrix and deterioration of the granular structure li et al 2014 further c8 3oc8 and 3oc12 hsl concentrations significantly reduced when the granules were disintegrated zhang et al 2019c owing to the positive effect of qs regulation of aerobic granulation via ahl manipulation was investigated for instance exogenous dose of chemical ahl molecules 3oc6 and c6 hsl in the bioreactors during the early start up stage could enhance the microbial activity biomass growth rate and nitrifying sludge granulation li et al 2015 but for full scale applications adding synthetic signal molecules may be restricted by their high costs and chemical and bacterial degradation ding et al 2015 alternatively bio augmentation of ahl producing bacteria appears to be economically feasible in facilitating the rapid granulation however direct dosage of ahl producing strains might lead to bacterial washouts together with excess sludge in addition the competition for nutrient between exogenous and endogenous bacteria should not be ignored li et al 2017b showed that continuous augmentation of ahl producing bacteria shinella yambaruensis ag384 had a negligible or slightly adverse impact on aerobic granulation as indicated by the smaller granular size and the lower nutrient removal efficiency compared to the control to our current knowledge comprehensive understanding on the expansions of rapid initiation of granulation by cultivating qs related strains is still lacking here we propose two qs regulation strategies for accelerated aerobic granulation based on cultivating ahl producing strains 1 use of bacterial supernatant that can be administered as ahls source and 2 taking advantage of the bacterial cells that were encapsulated in sodium alginate administered as cebs to overcome the survival limitations therefore the objectives of this work were to i investigate the effect of qs regulation via addition of ahls supernatant and cebs on the physiochemical characteristics nutrient removal micromorphology eps components of the granules and the response of the microbial community to different regulation strategies ii obtain an economically viable approach to accelerate granulation via qs regulation iii evaluate whether the short term qs regulation has long term effects on the system stability and iv explore the underlying enhancement mechanisms of qs regulation our results provide a potentially practical and sustainable strategy to tackle the long initiation period and system instability in ags technology 2 methods and materials 2 1 isolation of indigenous ahl producing bacteria from mature ags ahl producing strains were initially isolated from an ags system that was stably operating for over five months in our laboratory mature granular sludge was collected and washed three times with phosphate buffer saline pbs ph 7 2 and ground vigorously the sludge samples were re suspended in deionized water serially diluted spread on r2a agar bd biosciences san jose ca usa and incubated at 28 c for 7 days individual bacterial colonies were picked daily and transferred to the identification agar plate which contained 10 ml agrobacterium tumefaciens kyc55 10 ml 1 5 sterilized agar solution 90 μl of 20 mg ml 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d galactopyranoside x gal and 10 ml at buffer and incubated at 28 c for 3 days a tumefaciens kyc55 was unable to produce ahls but could produce a blue pigment in the presence of x gal in response to ahls due to β galactosidase catalyzed hydrolysis of x gal therefore appearance of blue color was a signal to identify the ahl producing bacteria to obtain a pure qs strain colonies on the r2a agar were separated and screened repeatedly gram stained and identified by 16s rdna sequences totally 43 strains were identified as ahl producing strains among these qs bacteria seven strains z1 k5 k33 z20 k46 k55 and k58 that exhibited a high ahl producing capacity were chosen they were confirmed as microbacterium azadirachtae 100 caulobacter sp 100 novosphingobium sp 99 sphingomonas sp 99 caulobacter sp 100 caulobacter vibrioides strain 99 and sphingomonas sp 98 with genbank accession numbers mk602660 mk602661 mk602698 mk602699 mk602700 mk602701 and mk602702 respectively 2 2 encapsulation of qs bacterial cells in alginate sodium beads cebs the qs strains were inoculated at the log growth period in r2a broth bd biosciences san jose ca usa individually and incubated at 28 c for 24 h 150 rpm equal volumes of bacterial suspensions were mixed to form a multi genera species consortium the suspension of the bacterial consortium od600 0 8 mlss 0 65 g l was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was collected as a source of ahls administered as ahls supernatant bacterial cells were harvested and encapsulated in sodium alginate to maintain the bacteria in the reactor according to the protocol reported by kim et al 2013 first the cells were suspended in 3 ml deionized water and added into 97 ml sodium alginate solution to prepare the ahl producing bacteria alginate suspension subsequently the suspension was slowly added into 3 w v cacl2 solution to form cebs totally 200 cebs with an average size of 3 mm were obtained to enhance their mechanical strength cebs were kept in a cacl2 bath for 4 h followed by 6 h in 2 5 w v glutaraldehyde solution cebs were rinsed with deionized water three times before being treated in the bioreactor 2 3 experimental setup and operation a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 1 4 l with height diameter

7 5 8 6 mg l during the aeration phase effluent was discharged from the intermediate height of the sbr giving a volume exchange ratio of 50 for each cycle the sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt were approximately 25 days and 8 h respectively all experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 3 c the ags was cultivated using the synthetic media consisting of 600 mg l

k2hpo4 was set to maintain a constant concentration of po4 3 p in the influent and ph was maintained in the range of 7 0 7 5 flocculent activated sludge from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant was used as inoculum sludge for sbr after inoculation the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and settling volume index at 10 min svi10 were approximately 3 29 g l and 134 ml g respectively in each reactor when the inoculum was accommodated to the synthetic media the experiment on qs regulation was conducted from day 21 to assess the potential of cebs and ahls supernatant in accelerating granulation four tests were conducted using the above mentioned sbrs fig s1 r1 control reactor as a control for r4 20 ml r2a broth was dosed at the beginning of each cycle r2 cebs reactor 200 cebs were added to the reactor only on day 21 r3 vacant cebs reactor comparison for r2 200 vacant beads without bacterial cells were dosed on day 21 and r4 ahls supernatant reactor for testing 20 ml ahls supernatant was added at the beginning of each cycle when the beads in r2 and r3 decomposed at around day 70 ahl manipulation on r1 and r4 was suspended to evaluate whether short term ahl regulation has long term effects on granular stability the reactors were operated for an extended period of 80 days without regulation 2 4 solid phase extraction spe and quantitative analysis of ahls to analyze the ahl concentrations produced by qs strains after encapsulation 200 cebs were inoculated in 300 ml r2a broth for 24 h 28 c 150 rpm the supernatant was collected as cebs supernatant and

accumulating organism pao populations in the ags the detailed procedures for sem clsm and fish can be found in the supporting information 2 6 analysis of eps contents and components eps was extracted from the sludge using an ultrasound and water bath procedure dai et al 2018 in which the eps was subdivided into loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents were quantified with bradford s method and phenol h2so4 method respectively f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi chiyoda tokyo japan was used to analyze the excitation emission

the high throughput sequencing analysis is presented in the supporting information additionally canonical correspondence analysis cca was carried out to evaluate the correlation between microbial community and ahl concentrations by using canoco 4 5 2 8 other analytical methods to measure the qs activity and mechanical strength of cebs 50 cebs were removed from the reactors every 10 days for testing the ahl contents and mechanical strength and returned to the reactor after measurements the cebs were cultivated in r2a broth for 24 h 28 c 150 rpm and cebs supernatant was concentrated for ahl analysis as indicated in section 2 4 the mechanical strength of cebs was evaluated by a texture analyzer hounsfield h1kf uk by recording the force imposed on the beads and the displacement during compression the stability of the granules was expressed as the integrity coefficient which was calculated by the variations of suspended solids of granules after shaking at 200 rpm for 5 min the relative hydrophobicity of the granules was measured according to corsino et al 2017 the cellular atp content was determined by a glomax multi detection system promega corporation madison wisconsin usa with the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation madison wisconsin usa the specific oxygen uptake rate for heterotrophs sour aob saur and nob snur was determined following a published protocol wang et al 2018 briefly a certain amount of stable ags was drawn from the four reactors on day 120 and was gently washed with pbs ph 7 2 the sludge sample was transferred into a bod bottle which was completely filled with the substrate solutions 400 ml of synthetic media 20 ml nh4cl and 20 ml nano2 were used as substrates for determination of sour saur and snur respectively an oxygen sensing probe was immediately inserted into the bod bottle and the do concentration was monitored every 15 s until do values reached 0 5 mg l sour was calculated from the do time curve and

significant difference and was determined by duncan s multiple range test for group comparisons 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation for qs regulation 3 1 1 qs strains and ahls supernatant the isolation and identification of qs strains are shown in fig 1 a total of 135 colonies were picked and screened for qs activity 43 strains that were able to produce ahls were processed to further identification here seven strains micro morphology of these strains is shown in fig s2 with higher ahl producing capacity which were mainly classified in the phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria were chosen for qs manipulation previous studies revealed that over 10 of proteobacteria isolated from diverse ecological niches possess the ahl mediated qs system tan et al 2015 besides ahls regulate the biofilm formation in some genera from the phylum actinobacteria kang and park 2010 as shown in table 1 ahls of acyl chain lengths ranging from 6 to 10 carbons were determined in the seven strains and each strain synthesized at least two types of ahls after enrichment and mixing the ahls supernatant of the multiple genera species consortium contained 9 66 12 64 9 87 and 3 40 pmol l of c6 c8 c10 and 3oc8 hsl respectively the diversity of ahls may provide a great advantage for enhancing granulation because different ahl may have their own effects for instance c6 hsl could improve the activity of the granules c8 hsl enhanced the attached growth of microorganisms and settling ability of granules while c10 hsl might participate in the regulation of eps production zhang et al 2019b ma et al 2018 3 1 2 biological activity and mechanical stability of cebs the cebs had a smooth and spherical surface and uniform size of approximately 3 0 mm fig 2 a and b no conspicuous differences in morphologies between cebs and vacant beads could be found some rod and cocci shaped cells attached onto the cross section of cebs fig 2c reflecting that cebs were successfully constructed by combining the ca alginate and qs bacteria as expected no bacteria were observed in the vacant beads fig 2d in terms of the qs activity of cebs the concentrations of c6 c8 c10 and 3oc8 hsl were 7 37 8 63 5 59 and 1 45 pmol l respectively fig 3 a according to the statistical results the ahl content of cebs supernatant significantly decreased p 0 05 compared to the ahls supernatant implying that encapsulation might exert a negative influence on the cell viability and biological activity kim et al 2013 demonstrated that only 65 5 of the total cells were living after the entrapment possibly because of contact with cacl2 solution furthermore the relative qs activity of cebs gradually decreased from day 20 50 and significantly decreased p 0 05 from 0 55 to 0 06 during days 50 70 fig 3b limited availability of the substrates due to mass transfer in the encapsulation media might explain the reduced qs activity bae et al 2015 the mechanical strength of cebs was 423 g at the beginning of qs regulation day 21 it followed a similar decreasing trend as the relative qs activity on day 70 the average mechanical strength sharply declined to 51 g implying that most cebs lost their rigidity and became brittle fig 3b moreno garrido 2008 suggested that alginate gels prepared using cacl2 as the crosslinking agent lacked long term stability in the presence of phosphate ions po4 3 phosphate ions chelate ca2 to form phosphate salt thereby dissolving ca alginate gels 3 2 effect of qs regulation on ahls released in the reactors fig 4 reveals that a short term dose of ahls supernatant increases ahl release during the entire operation during the qs regulation period days 21 70 total ahl concentrations increased from 24 62 to 69 82 pmol l r1 and 103 78 pmol l r4 respectively with c8 hsl being the dominant signal fig 4 the higher ahl content in r4 could be caused by the exogenous ahls supernatant with relatively high concentrations of ahls ahl contents increased with time in r1 and r4 and the maximum concentrations of c6 38 62 pmol l c8 87 64 pmol l and 3oc8 hsl 20 84 pmol l were observed in r4 on day 140 which was 1 23 1 81 and 1 27 fold higher than that in r1 respectively the significantly higher p 0 05 content of ahls in r4 without external supplement implied that exogenous ahls supernatant stimulated the sustainable release of the corresponding ahls this should attribute to the augmentation of the ahl content reaching the threshold value of the qs system and activating the expression of ahl synthase encoding genes such as luxi luxr thus more ahls were released in the surroundings zhang et al 2019b demonstrated that dosing with 30 mg l c8 hsl during the initial stage 1 40 d had a long term beneficial effect on the settling ability of anammox granules and sustainable production of the signals was the likely direct cause compared to r1 and r4 all types of ahls remained less concentrated in r2 and r3 over the entire operation the contents of c10 and 3oc8 hsl in r2 were slightly greater than that in r3 whereas the c6 and c8 hsl content were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in r3 as ahls were released from the cebs fig 3a nevertheless no obvious increase in the total ahls was found in r2 during the period without qs regulation suggesting that this regulation had no long term effects on the endogenous ahls secretion possibly due to the gradually reducing mechanical strength and biological activity of cebs fig 3b therefore the critical qs threshold value of the ahls level was not reached to activate expression of ahl related genes and induce excessive ahls production 3 3 effect of qs regulation on granulation and performance of the reactor 3 3 1 characteristics of aerobic granular sludge fig 5 a reveals that the average particle diameter increased slightly in r1 and r4 after 20 days the particle size evidently increased when ahls supernatant was added to r4 from day 21 reaching 1 96 mm on day 80 which was relatively larger than that of r1 1 34 mm after day 80 without ahl regulation the particle diameter of r4 was maintained at approximately 2 02 mm whereas that for r1 granules continued to rise to the maximum value of 1 68 mm on day 120 but was still lower than that of r4 the simulation model eq 1 was performed to simulate the diameter data of r1 and r4 both the granulation process in r1 and r4 could be well fitted by this model as evidenced by the high correlation coefficients of 0 98 and 0 99 respectively the lag times t 0 and specific growth rate k were estimated to be 46 59 days and 0 06 day 1 in r1 and 40 47 days and 0 08 day 1 in r4 respectively obviously growth of granules was accelerated in r4 contributing to a larger particle diameter although the actual signals in the biomass played an important role in intra species communication augmentation with ahls supernatant allowed more bacteria to participate in bacterial aggregation the average granular diameter showed a declining trend when the beads were dosed in the reactors encapsulated with r2 or without r3 qs bacteria this phenomenon might be attributed to collisions between the beads with high mechanical strength and granule surface strengthened frictional forces which resulted in excessive shear and rupture of smaller granules into sludge flocs kim et al 2013 interestingly the granule size gradually increased when the beads were decomposed around day 70 the soluble alginic acid produced by hydrolysis of alginate ca2 gels was a sticky material that could serve as the precursor of ags yang et al 2014 the reduction in the frictional and corresponding shear forces further enhanced granulation although at the end of the experiment the particle diameter in r2 0 48 mm was larger than in r3 0 36 mm both were much smaller than in r1 and r4 indicating that the damage on the smaller aggregates was irreversible the variation in the mlss concentration and svi10 followed a parallel pattern in all reactors fig 5b and c except for an apparent decline of mlss from 4 14 to 3 83 g l and an increase of svi10 from 53 2 to 72 4 ml g in r1 during days 120 150 implying that r1 granules might lose their stability during long term operations comparatively more biomass ranging from 3 38 to 4 46 g l accumulated in r4 granules in aggregated structures with denser biomass were demonstrated to promote signal accumulation chen et al 2018 our study is consistent with this observation fig 4 at the end of the experiment r4 granules showed an enhanced settling ability svi10 of 37 2 ml g and granular stability integrity coefficient of 4 4 0 3 fig 5c and table s2 furthermore the relative hydrophobicity of sludge increased in r4 to 78 4 3 5 table s2 3 3 2 ags morphology light microscopy showed that distinguishable granules with clear boundaries appeared in r1 and r4 fig 6 a and d while slimy and nebulous biomass appeared in r2 and r3 on day 60 fig 6b and c by day 120 large sized granules co existed with small aggregates in r1 whereas r4 granules were consistently bigger sized in r2 and r3 small aggregates appeared but without defined shapes thus it was not necessary to compare their micro morphology with r1 and r4 granules r1 granules were irregularly shaped whereas smooth and dense granules were observed in r4 after qs regulation fig 6i p examining the surface of r1 granules a progressive outgrowth of filamentous bacteria was found from day 60 till the end of the experiment which could cause deterioration of settling properties fig 5c granule instability table s2 and result in biomass washout fig 5b excessive proliferation of filamentous organisms is not related to a single factor but to a combination of multiple factors including long srt do deficiency low substrate availability gradient of substrate concentration nutrient deficiency and temperature shift figueroa et al 2015 here the increased granular diameter in r1 fig 5a may hinder do transfer from the bulk liquid to the inner layer of the granules thus favoring the growth of filamentous bacteria franca et al 2018 moreover the influent organic substances and nutrient concentrations are constant throughout the experiment section 2 3 during aerobic granulation the biomass concentration typically increased from 3 29 g l to 4 14 g l fig 5b which possibly results in nutrient deficiency to microorganisms at low nutrient levels filamentous bacteria show a higher rate of substrate uptake than the floc forming bacteria and thus rapidly grow out from the granules hamza et al 2018 notably r4 granules mainly consist of cocci and bacilli with no filaments or a few filaments covering the granular surface the primary reason for preventing filament outgrowth was supposed to be the high ahl concentrations that led to the formation of a dense and compact granular structure which minimized the growth of filamentous bacteria fang et al 2009 fish analysis of the cryosections of mature granules characterized the abundance and spatial locations of functional genera aob nob and paos were homogeneously scattered in r1 granules while aob and nob were primarily clustered in the core of r4 granules fig 7 moreover compared to r1 granules the fluorescence signals were stronger in r4 granules revealing a higher dominance of aob nob and paos which was beneficial in nitrogen and phosphorus removal the nucleic acids stained in red were majorly on the exterior part of the granules proteins stained in green and α polysaccharides stained in blue occupied the central region of the granules fig 8 this eps backbone matrix provided mechanical strength to resist shear stress and sustain a stable structure lee et al 2010 the nucleic acids and proteins were distributed in dispersed form in r1 granules but they formed a continuous layer in r4 granules furthermore weaker fluorescence intensities from proteins and α polysaccharides as well as more voids and channels in r1 led to a looser granular structure whereas the compact and stable interior in r4 granules was supported by a denser eps matrix 3 3 3 performance of the reactors the cod removal efficiency experienced a similar tendency in r1 and r4 fig 9 gradually improving during the initial 30 days and then being maintained over 96 till the end of the operation except for the days 120 150 when the removal efficiency dropped from 98 2 to 95 1 in r1 high mlss concentrations were maintained in the two reactors allowing high organics degradation rates while the decrease of the removal efficiency in r1 was attributed to the presence of filaments and subsequent biomass washout a sharp decline in cod removal efficiency was found in r2 and r3 when the beads were added probably owing to the collisions between beads and granules leading to the disintegration of smaller granules although the cod removal efficiency slowly increased afterwards they could not reach the high levels of r1 and r4 r4 exhibited a better performance in removing tp as the efficiency averaged about 62 4 which was 10 5 21 5 and 27 6 higher than that in r1 r2 and r3 respectively for nitrogen removal different effluent no3 n concentrations were obtained in the four reactors after rapid accumulation to a maximum value it gradually decreased to 6 9 r1 9 2 r2 11 9 r3 and 4 9 mg l r4 on day 150 though the amount of effluent no2 n was negligible 0 5 mg l in all reactors the satisfactory nh4 n nearly 100 and tn 84 7 removal efficiency achieved in r4 suggested that ags possessed higher nitrification and denitrification ability these results imply that the dose of ahls supernatant had an outstanding potential for cod and nutrient removal possibly owing to the enhanced microbial activity in organic matter and nutrient degradation atp has been considered to reflect bioactivity as it served as a primary bioenergy currency of organisms to participate in biochemical transformations jiang and liu 2012 table 2 lists the atp contents of sludge sampled from the four reactors on day 120 as shown the highest atp content 2 06 10 6 mol g mlss was attained in r4 which was significantly higher p 0 05 than that in r1 r2 and r3 in addition sour saur and snur of sludge were monitored the maximum sour 71 6 mg o2 g vss h was found in r4 on day 120 much greater than that in other reactors the observed better cod removal might be owing to the enhanced atp and sour similarly saur and snur of r4 were maintained at high levels of 1 02 and 1 14 1 16 and 1 42 and 1 21 and 1 70 fold higher than those in r1 r2 and r3 respectively indicating that dosing with ahls supernatant improved aob and nob activity this finding was in accordance with previous studies hu et al 2016 verified the strengthened aob activity of the biofilms by addition of 5 nm ahl mixtures c6 c8 3oc12 and c14 hsl sun et al 2018 reported that c6 hsl and c8 hsl stimulated nob activity by promoting efficient communication 3 4 effect of qs regulation on eps production 3 4 1 quantitative analysis of eps eps has a great influence on the physico chemical properties of microbial biomass and facilitates the formation of ags via binding bacterial cells tightly iorhemen et al 2019 to evaluate the effect of different qs regulation strategies on eps production eps concentrations during the granulation were analyzed considering the primary constituents pn and ps fig 10 a and b the pn content distributed in lb eps gradually increased from an average 18 35 mg g vss to the final amount of 44 25 32 73 22 47 and 48 32 mg g vss in r1 r4 respectively the tb pn concentration sharply increased in r4 when ahls supernatant was exogenously administered ranging from 44 78 to 107 45 mg g vss days 20 150 much more than r1 41 63 84 51 mg g vss the maximum value of tb pn in r4 was 2 02 and 2 96 fold higher than that in r2 and r3 respectively nevertheless the ps content remained relatively steady in both the lb and tb fractions during the 150 days of operation these results implied that augmentation of the ahl content effectively promoted the pn production particularly in the tb fraction as reported by lv et al 2014 and mcswain et al 2005 that ps maintained stability whether in ahl mediated environment or not whereas pn was more sensitive to ahl regulation compared to ps the over production of pn and the excellent characteristics of r4 granules together suggest that pn might act as a main contributor to enhance granulation and reinforcing structural stability actually pn is highly hydrophobic and the higher pn content in r4 is thus potentially correlated with the higher level of relative hydrophobicity table s2 which can lead to a reduction of the excess gibbs energy therefore pn is responsible for facilitating cell to cell interactions holding the aggregated bacteria together and improving the maturity and stability of ags miao et al 2018 3 4 2 fluorescent components identified by parafac to investigate the role of pn in enhancing granulation and the underlying qs regulation mechanisms with respect to eps secretion the 3d eem spectra of the eps components fig s3 were separated into independent fluorescent groups two fluorescent components were identified using parafac namely component 1 and component 2 table 3 component 1 c1 with two peaks at ex em 220 230 325 375 and 250 300 325 375 representing protein derived amino acid tryptophan and aromatic protein substances component 2 c2 with ex em at 255 295 425 500 and 330 400 330 400 was categorized as fulvic like and humic like substances wei et al 2016 fig 10c and d display the fluorescence intensities fi of the two parafac derived components in the eps samples in the lb eps fraction the fi amount of c1 in r1 and r4 were higher than those in r2 and r3 with no significant differences between r1 515 3 and r4 558 2 for tb eps the fi values of c1 were substantially elevated in all reactors but c1 intensity was notably strengthened in r4 885 8 fi scores of c2 remained at low levels in the four eps samples whether in the fraction of lb or tb apparently tryptophan and aromatic protein substances c1 in tb eps were more preferentially induced by qs regulation via the addition of ahls supernatant 3 5 effect of qs regulation on microbial community structure 3 5 1 bacterial community structure analysis the analysis of the genus level bacterial diversity after 60 and 140 days of operation indicated that qs manipulation greatly influenced the microbial populations during the granulation process fig 11 the relative abundance of the genus hydrogenophaga belonging to the phylum proteobacteria accounted for 1 65 in the inoculum sludge it significantly increased in r1 17 96 and r4 26 82 and became the most dominant bacteria on day 60 this genus comprised autotrophic denitrifying microorganisms with the capability to remove no3 n by utilizing h2 as an electron donor instead of external organic carbon park et al 2005 this genus frequently accumulated along with increased nh4 n removal wan et al 2014 here the removal of nh4 n increased from 91 6 after inoculation to 98 2 and nearly 100 in r1 and r4 on day 60 data not shown respectively which could partly explain the abundance of this genus moreover good growth of hydrogenophaga likely occurred in the media enriched in protein willems and gillis 2015 the observed increase in eps excretion particularly pn in r1 and r4 fig 10a and b along with the aerobic granulation process might create a favorable environment for the growth of the genus hydrogenophaga in comparison the higher removal efficiency of nh4 n and eps contents in r4 led to a higher relative abundance of this genus the genera dechloromonas and thauera were predominant in r1 and r4 on day 60 enhanced removal of organic matter could be achieved when dechloromonas was present in the reactor to sufficient level meanwhile it functioned as a denitrifying pao that was important for the layer structured granular sludge formation by creating an anaerobic core covered by an aerobic exterior shell świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 augmentation of the signal content enlarged the granule diameter in r4 and thus increased the anoxic zones where the denitrifiers could grow and subsequently improve the tn removal efficiency the genus thauera was associated with binding the cells together by secreting eps particularly protein like substances and tryptophan zhang et al 2019c however the genus paracoccus was the most abundant bacteria in r2 21 29 and r3 34 96 this species was capable of utilizing both oxygen and nitrogenous oxides and was more inclined to predominate in the looser granules sarma et al 2017 a significant increment of the genus thiothrix was found with time in r1 from 5 48 on day 60 to 35 49 on day 140 while it occupied 2 13 in r4 members of the genus thiothrix have the ability of cod and p removal however more importantly they were identified as filamentous bacteria and the over growth of this genus adversely impacted the granular settling ability figueroa et al 2015 the instability of r1 granules during long term operation could thus be attributed to the excessive proliferation of thiothrix the genus pseudomonas was the largest genus in r4 on day 140 with a relative abundance of 25 74 this genus functions in polyphosphate accumulation and denitrification and participates in the stability of ags as eps producers lin et al 2010 other prevalent genera like chryseobacterium and aeromonas increased with the prolonged operation time in r4 at 17 07 and 15 07 respectively both of which were responsible for strengthening bacterial aggregation by secreting eps fan et al 2018 the noticeable granule strength table s2 and interior compact structure fig 8 of r4 granules was likely owing to the metabolites of these microbes 3 5 2 correlation between bacterial community and ahls cca analysis was carried out to gain further insights into the underlying relationship between the predominant microbial community and ahl expression two types of ahls c8 and 3oc8 hsl had a close correlation with some genera including aeromonas pseudomonas and gemmobacter fig 11b pseudomonas could regulate the production of several types of ahls such as c6 3oc6 and c8 hsl kumar et al 2011 the genus aeromonas from the class flavobacteria which is known to possess an ahl dependent qs system based on the ahyri locus readily formed a biofilm by sensing and releasing c4 c6 and c8 hsl lynch et al 2002 besides ahl producing genus acidovorax is generally found in the ags chen et al 2018 here a strong positive relationship was observed between the genus acidovorax and c6 and c10 hsl moreover some genera were positively associated with ahls such as the genera dechloromonas hydrogenophaga and zoogloea while some microbes paracoccus brevundimonas janthinobacterium and sphaerotilus were negatively correlated with the identified ahl which functioned as ahls quenchers qs producers and quenchers are two antagonistic groups of microorganisms that often coexisted with each other in diverse bacterial communities to control the balance of the ahl content in the bioreactors song et al 2014 3 6 enhancement mechanisms of qs regulation and implications of this study here the effect of qs regulation on granulation via dosage with ahls supernatant from excreting strains or bacterial cells encapsulated in sodium alginate was evaluated addition of ahls supernatant favored a high ahl content environment to reinforce efficient cell to cell communication and increase biomass density the accumulated biomass could supply more bioenergy to synthesize ahls and the bioenergy was synchronously elevated to overcome the electrostatic repulsive forces among the cells and thereby induce bacterial aggregation compact granules were rapidly formed which suppressed the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria with the increase in bacterial aggregation and eps secretion the particle size further enlarged and provided appropriate ecological niches for phosphorus removal and denitrification the enrichment of microorganisms that secrete ahls such as aeromonas and pseudomonas was induced by augmentation of the ahl content leading to a sustainable endogenous release of ahls mainly c6 and c8 hsl these ahls regulated the production of tryptophan and aromatic protein substances which contributed to the increase in relative hydrophobicity and to maintain system stability this study indicated that augmentation of ahls supernatant could efficiently regulate aerobic granulation which is economically feasible and sustainable compared to the traditional add back signaling chemicals however several questions remain to be addressed in future research dosage of ahls supernatant could efficiently accelerate granulation however the adequate amount of ahls supernatant is still unknown moreover suitable time to start dosing with ahls supernatant and the best dosage duration need to be determined further whether the regulation strategy based on ahls supernatant can be applied in the ags system for treating different types of wastewater and the effects of different operation conditions on the ahl regulation efficiency need to be assessed furthermore a novel medium to immobilize qs bacterial cells by which the collisions on the granules can be alleviated but ahls can still be continuously released from the excreting bacteria will promote future application of qs bio augmentation using carrier materials 4 conclusions several qs bacteria with high ahl producing capacity have been isolated from mature ags and used for understanding qs regulation qs regulation via addition of ahl rich supernatant enabled the formation of ags with excellent settling ability efficient nutrient removal higher integrity coefficient bioactivity ahl content and eps production comparatively a gradual decrease in the biological activity of cebs was detected exogenous dose of cebs exhibited negligible or negative effects on the physicochemical properties of ags primarily due to its high mechanical strength and the damage was not easy to recover irreversible suggesting that this mode of ahl augmentation might be inappropriate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18319,the positive roles of n acyl homoserine lactone ahl mediated quorum sensing qs in aerobic granular sludge ags have been widely acknowledged however it is not feasible to manipulate granulation via direct addition of ahl chemicals or ahl producing strains here several strains with high ahl producing capacity were successfully isolated from ags these qs strains were cultivated mixed as a consortium and then divided into two groups ahls supernatant and bacterial cells encapsulated in sodium alginate cebs the potential of qs regulation via doses of ahls supernatant and cebs in accelerating granulation was evaluated results clearly indicated that short term days 21 70 addition of ahls supernatant led to a rapid specific growth rate 0 08 d 1 compact structure without filamentous bacteria overgrowth excellent settlement performance svi10 37 2 ml g and a high integrity coefficient 4 4 of the granules sustainable release of ahls mainly c6 and c8 hsl was induced by exogenous ahls possibly attributed to the enrichment of the genera aeromonas and pseudomonas further tryptophan and aromatic protein substances were produced to maintain structural stability suggesting that short term qs regulation had long term positive effects on the characteristics of ags by comparison the addition of cebs posed negligible or negative impact on the granulation as evidenced by the rupture of smaller aggregates and poor characteristics of ags overall augmentation of the signaling content via addition of ahls supernatant from qs strains is an economical and feasible regulation strategy to accelerate granulation and sustain long term structural stability graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge ags quorum sensing qs regulation n acyl homoserine lactone ahl producing strains encapsulation protein 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags has been preferred over conventional activated sludge for treating wastewater because of its distinct advantages such as higher biomass concentrations denser structure and faster settling ability adav et al 2008 these characteristics tend to facilitate sludge separation which allows a clarifier to be combined with the bioreactor and reduces footprint and energy consumption by approximately 75 and 25 respectively van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however long start up periods and the unstable granular structure during prolonged operations are key challenges that impede full scale applications of the ags technology guo et al 2019 therefore an effective and sustainable strategy for enhancing aerobic granulation is highly desirable comprehensive studies on the granulation mechanisms led to several theories for expediting granulation verawaty et al 2012 li et al 2017a pishgar et al 2019 with respect to granule development cell to cell interaction is the first and foremost step followed by bacterial attachment aggregation with self immobilization cohesion by extracellular polymeric substances eps and hydrodynamic shear forces to attain the dense structure zhou et al 2015 this ecological key role of cell to cell interaction in granule development suggests that strengthening bacterial communication may provide a new insight for accelerating sludge granulation bacteria have a communication system known as quorum sensing qs wherein bacteria secrete signal sensing molecules to regulate interactions between themselves and achieve their gene expression to orchestrate collective behavior when signal concentrations reach a threshold value feng et al 2014 n acyl homoserine lactone ahl is one of the main intra species auto inducers amongst gram negative bacteria which generally contains an acyl homoserine lactonic ring and can be classified by different acylation branched chains li et al 2015 ahls have been extensively studied in the field of environmental biotechnology i e in biofilm development as they can control the secretion of eps and aggregation of bacteria hu et al 2016 recently accumulating evidence shows that ahl mediated qs is positively and strongly related with the aerobic granulation process concentrations of specific ahl compounds obviously increased by 100 fold during the initiation of granulation in the add back study exogenous addition of four ahls with different molecular structures c6 3oc6 3oc8 and 3oc12 hsl was shown to promote the eps synthesis significantly tan et al 2014 inactivation of ahls by porcine kidney acylase resulted in the reduction of the bacterial attachment potential damage to the eps matrix and deterioration of the granular structure li et al 2014 further c8 3oc8 and 3oc12 hsl concentrations significantly reduced when the granules were disintegrated zhang et al 2019c owing to the positive effect of qs regulation of aerobic granulation via ahl manipulation was investigated for instance exogenous dose of chemical ahl molecules 3oc6 and c6 hsl in the bioreactors during the early start up stage could enhance the microbial activity biomass growth rate and nitrifying sludge granulation li et al 2015 but for full scale applications adding synthetic signal molecules may be restricted by their high costs and chemical and bacterial degradation ding et al 2015 alternatively bio augmentation of ahl producing bacteria appears to be economically feasible in facilitating the rapid granulation however direct dosage of ahl producing strains might lead to bacterial washouts together with excess sludge in addition the competition for nutrient between exogenous and endogenous bacteria should not be ignored li et al 2017b showed that continuous augmentation of ahl producing bacteria shinella yambaruensis ag384 had a negligible or slightly adverse impact on aerobic granulation as indicated by the smaller granular size and the lower nutrient removal efficiency compared to the control to our current knowledge comprehensive understanding on the expansions of rapid initiation of granulation by cultivating qs related strains is still lacking here we propose two qs regulation strategies for accelerated aerobic granulation based on cultivating ahl producing strains 1 use of bacterial supernatant that can be administered as ahls source and 2 taking advantage of the bacterial cells that were encapsulated in sodium alginate administered as cebs to overcome the survival limitations therefore the objectives of this work were to i investigate the effect of qs regulation via addition of ahls supernatant and cebs on the physiochemical characteristics nutrient removal micromorphology eps components of the granules and the response of the microbial community to different regulation strategies ii obtain an economically viable approach to accelerate granulation via qs regulation iii evaluate whether the short term qs regulation has long term effects on the system stability and iv explore the underlying enhancement mechanisms of qs regulation our results provide a potentially practical and sustainable strategy to tackle the long initiation period and system instability in ags technology 2 methods and materials 2 1 isolation of indigenous ahl producing bacteria from mature ags ahl producing strains were initially isolated from an ags system that was stably operating for over five months in our laboratory mature granular sludge was collected and washed three times with phosphate buffer saline pbs ph 7 2 and ground vigorously the sludge samples were re suspended in deionized water serially diluted spread on r2a agar bd biosciences san jose ca usa and incubated at 28 c for 7 days individual bacterial colonies were picked daily and transferred to the identification agar plate which contained 10 ml agrobacterium tumefaciens kyc55 10 ml 1 5 sterilized agar solution 90 μl of 20 mg ml 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d galactopyranoside x gal and 10 ml at buffer and incubated at 28 c for 3 days a tumefaciens kyc55 was unable to produce ahls but could produce a blue pigment in the presence of x gal in response to ahls due to β galactosidase catalyzed hydrolysis of x gal therefore appearance of blue color was a signal to identify the ahl producing bacteria to obtain a pure qs strain colonies on the r2a agar were separated and screened repeatedly gram stained and identified by 16s rdna sequences totally 43 strains were identified as ahl producing strains among these qs bacteria seven strains z1 k5 k33 z20 k46 k55 and k58 that exhibited a high ahl producing capacity were chosen they were confirmed as microbacterium azadirachtae 100 caulobacter sp 100 novosphingobium sp 99 sphingomonas sp 99 caulobacter sp 100 caulobacter vibrioides strain 99 and sphingomonas sp 98 with genbank accession numbers mk602660 mk602661 mk602698 mk602699 mk602700 mk602701 and mk602702 respectively 2 2 encapsulation of qs bacterial cells in alginate sodium beads cebs the qs strains were inoculated at the log growth period in r2a broth bd biosciences san jose ca usa individually and incubated at 28 c for 24 h 150 rpm equal volumes of bacterial suspensions were mixed to form a multi genera species consortium the suspension of the bacterial consortium od600 0 8 mlss 0 65 g l was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was collected as a source of ahls administered as ahls supernatant bacterial cells were harvested and encapsulated in sodium alginate to maintain the bacteria in the reactor according to the protocol reported by kim et al 2013 first the cells were suspended in 3 ml deionized water and added into 97 ml sodium alginate solution to prepare the ahl producing bacteria alginate suspension subsequently the suspension was slowly added into 3 w v cacl2 solution to form cebs totally 200 cebs with an average size of 3 mm were obtained to enhance their mechanical strength cebs were kept in a cacl2 bath for 4 h followed by 6 h in 2 5 w v glutaraldehyde solution cebs were rinsed with deionized water three times before being treated in the bioreactor 2 3 experimental setup and operation a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 1 4 l with height diameter ratio of 10 was adopted in this study fig s1 it was operated on a 4 h cycle comprising 5 min influent filling 60 min non aeration 155 165 min aeration 5 15 min settlement and 5 min effluent withdrawal aeration was continuously introduced through a bubble diffuser and the superficial up flow air velocity was maintained at 2 4 cm s the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained in the range of 7 5 8 6 mg l during the aeration phase effluent was discharged from the intermediate height of the sbr giving a volume exchange ratio of 50 for each cycle the sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt were approximately 25 days and 8 h respectively all experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 3 c the ags was cultivated using the synthetic media consisting of 600 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod 60 mg l nh4 n nh4cl 10 mg l po4 3 p k2hpo4 kh2po4 25 mg l mg2 mgso4 7h2o 30 mg l ca2 cacl2 and 1 0 ml l trace element solution zhang et al 2019a the ratio of kh2po4 and k2hpo4 was set to maintain a constant concentration of po4 3 p in the influent and ph was maintained in the range of 7 0 7 5 flocculent activated sludge from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant was used as inoculum sludge for sbr after inoculation the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and settling volume index at 10 min svi10 were approximately 3 29 g l and 134 ml g respectively in each reactor when the inoculum was accommodated to the synthetic media the experiment on qs regulation was conducted from day 21 to assess the potential of cebs and ahls supernatant in accelerating granulation four tests were conducted using the above mentioned sbrs fig s1 r1 control reactor as a control for r4 20 ml r2a broth was dosed at the beginning of each cycle r2 cebs reactor 200 cebs were added to the reactor only on day 21 r3 vacant cebs reactor comparison for r2 200 vacant beads without bacterial cells were dosed on day 21 and r4 ahls supernatant reactor for testing 20 ml ahls supernatant was added at the beginning of each cycle when the beads in r2 and r3 decomposed at around day 70 ahl manipulation on r1 and r4 was suspended to evaluate whether short term ahl regulation has long term effects on granular stability the reactors were operated for an extended period of 80 days without regulation 2 4 solid phase extraction spe and quantitative analysis of ahls to analyze the ahl concentrations produced by qs strains after encapsulation 200 cebs were inoculated in 300 ml r2a broth for 24 h 28 c 150 rpm the supernatant was collected as cebs supernatant and

accumulating organism pao populations in the ags the detailed procedures for sem clsm and fish can be found in the supporting information 2 6 analysis of eps contents and components eps was extracted from the sludge using an ultrasound and water bath procedure dai et al 2018 in which the eps was subdivided into loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents were quantified with bradford s method and phenol h2so4 method respectively f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi chiyoda tokyo japan was used to analyze the excitation emission matrix eem of eps following iorhemen et al 2019 parallel factor parafac modeling was employed to handle the eem data and obtain the variations in the eps components using matlab r2012a with the n way

bacterial 16s rrna was amplified with the universal primers set 338f 806r using polymerase chain reaction pcr pcr products were sequences with pe 300 illumina miseq platform illumina san diego ca usa the high throughput sequencing analysis is presented in the supporting information additionally canonical correspondence analysis cca was carried out to evaluate the correlation between microbial community and ahl concentrations by using canoco 4 5 2 8 other analytical methods to measure the qs activity and mechanical strength of cebs 50 cebs were removed from the reactors every 10 days for testing the ahl contents and mechanical strength and returned to the reactor after measurements the cebs were cultivated in r2a broth for 24 h 28 c 150 rpm and cebs supernatant was concentrated for ahl analysis as indicated in section 2 4 the mechanical strength of cebs was evaluated by a texture analyzer hounsfield h1kf uk by recording the force imposed on the beads and the displacement during compression the stability of the granules was expressed as the integrity coefficient which was calculated by the variations of suspended solids of granules after shaking at 200 rpm for 5 min the relative hydrophobicity of the granules was measured according to corsino et al 2017 the cellular atp content was determined by a glomax multi detection system promega corporation madison wisconsin usa with the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation madison wisconsin usa the specific oxygen uptake rate for heterotrophs sour aob saur and nob snur was determined following a published protocol wang et al 2018 briefly a certain amount of stable ags was drawn from the four reactors on day 120 and was gently washed with pbs ph 7 2 the sludge sample was transferred into a bod bottle which was completely filled with the substrate solutions 400 ml of synthetic media 20 ml nh4cl and 20 ml nano2 were used as substrates for determination of sour saur and snur respectively

performed in triplicate all statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss statistics version 19 0 data were validated by analysis of variance anova p value 0 05 was defined a statistically significant difference and was determined by duncan s multiple range test for group comparisons 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation for qs regulation 3 1 1 qs strains and ahls supernatant the isolation and identification of qs strains are shown in fig 1 a total of 135 colonies were picked and screened for qs activity 43 strains that were able to produce ahls were processed to further identification here seven strains micro morphology of these strains is shown in fig s2 with higher ahl producing capacity which were mainly classified in the phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria were chosen for qs manipulation previous studies revealed that over 10 of proteobacteria isolated from diverse ecological niches possess the ahl mediated qs system tan et al 2015 besides ahls regulate the biofilm formation in some genera from the phylum actinobacteria kang and park 2010 as shown in table 1 ahls of acyl chain lengths ranging from 6 to 10 carbons were determined in the seven strains and each strain synthesized at least two types of ahls after enrichment and mixing the ahls supernatant of the multiple genera species consortium contained 9 66 12 64 9 87 and 3 40 pmol l of c6 c8 c10 and 3oc8 hsl respectively the diversity of ahls may provide a great advantage for enhancing granulation because different ahl may have their own effects for instance c6 hsl could improve the activity of the granules c8 hsl enhanced the attached growth of microorganisms and settling ability of granules while c10 hsl might participate in the regulation of eps production zhang et al 2019b ma et al 2018 3 1 2 biological activity and mechanical stability of cebs the cebs had a smooth and spherical surface and uniform size of approximately 3 0 mm fig 2 a and b no conspicuous differences in morphologies between cebs and vacant beads could be found some rod and cocci shaped cells attached onto the cross section of cebs fig 2c reflecting that cebs were successfully constructed by combining the ca alginate and qs bacteria as expected no bacteria were observed in the vacant beads fig 2d in terms of the qs activity of cebs the concentrations of c6 c8 c10 and 3oc8 hsl were 7 37 8 63 5 59 and 1 45 pmol l respectively fig 3 a according to the statistical results the ahl content of cebs supernatant significantly decreased p 0 05 compared to the ahls supernatant implying that encapsulation might exert a negative influence on the cell viability and biological activity kim et al 2013 demonstrated that only 65 5 of the total cells were living after the entrapment possibly because of contact with cacl2 solution furthermore the relative qs activity of cebs gradually decreased from day 20 50 and significantly decreased p 0 05 from 0 55 to 0 06 during days 50 70 fig 3b limited availability of the substrates due to mass transfer in the encapsulation media might explain the reduced qs activity bae et al 2015 the mechanical strength of cebs was 423 g at the beginning of qs regulation day 21 it followed a similar decreasing trend as the relative qs activity on day 70 the average mechanical strength sharply declined to 51 g implying that most cebs lost their rigidity and became brittle fig 3b moreno garrido 2008 suggested that alginate gels prepared using cacl2 as the crosslinking agent lacked long term stability in the presence of phosphate ions po4 3 phosphate ions chelate ca2 to form phosphate salt thereby dissolving ca alginate gels 3 2 effect of qs regulation on ahls released in the reactors fig 4 reveals that a short term dose of ahls supernatant increases ahl release during the entire operation during the qs regulation period days 21 70 total ahl concentrations increased from 24 62 to 69 82 pmol l r1 and 103 78 pmol l r4 respectively with c8 hsl being the dominant signal fig 4 the higher ahl content in r4 could be caused by the exogenous ahls supernatant with relatively high concentrations of ahls ahl contents increased with time in r1 and r4 and the maximum concentrations of c6 38 62 pmol l c8 87 64 pmol l and 3oc8 hsl 20 84 pmol l were observed in r4 on day 140 which was 1 23 1 81 and 1 27 fold higher than that in r1 respectively the significantly higher p 0 05 content of ahls in r4 without external supplement implied that exogenous ahls supernatant stimulated the sustainable release of the corresponding ahls this should attribute to the augmentation of the ahl content reaching the threshold value of the qs system and activating the expression of ahl synthase encoding genes such as luxi luxr thus more ahls were released in the surroundings zhang et al 2019b demonstrated that dosing with 30 mg l c8 hsl during the initial stage 1 40 d had a long term beneficial effect on the settling ability of anammox granules and sustainable production of the signals was the likely direct cause compared to r1 and r4 all types of ahls remained less concentrated in r2 and r3 over the entire operation the contents of c10 and 3oc8 hsl in r2 were slightly greater than that in r3 whereas the c6 and c8 hsl content were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in r3 as ahls were released from the cebs fig 3a nevertheless no obvious increase in the total ahls was found in r2 during the period without qs regulation suggesting that this regulation had no long term effects on the endogenous ahls secretion possibly due to the gradually reducing mechanical strength and biological activity of cebs fig 3b therefore the critical qs threshold value of the ahls level was not reached to activate expression of ahl related genes and induce excessive ahls production 3 3 effect of qs regulation on granulation and performance of the reactor 3 3 1 characteristics of aerobic granular sludge fig 5 a reveals that the average particle diameter increased slightly in r1 and r4 after 20 days the particle size evidently increased when ahls supernatant was added to r4 from day 21 reaching 1 96 mm on day 80 which was relatively larger than that of r1 1 34 mm after day 80 without ahl regulation the particle diameter of r4 was maintained at approximately 2 02 mm whereas that for r1 granules continued to rise to the maximum value of 1 68 mm on day 120 but was still lower than that of r4 the simulation model eq 1 was performed to simulate the diameter data of r1 and r4 both the granulation process in r1 and r4 could be well fitted by this model as evidenced by the high correlation coefficients of 0 98 and 0 99 respectively the lag times t 0 and specific growth rate k were estimated to be 46 59 days and 0 06 day 1 in r1 and 40 47 days and 0 08 day 1 in r4 respectively obviously growth of granules was accelerated in r4 contributing to a larger particle diameter although the actual signals in the biomass played an important role in intra species communication augmentation with ahls supernatant allowed more bacteria to participate in bacterial aggregation the average granular diameter showed a declining trend when the beads were dosed in the reactors encapsulated with r2 or without r3 qs bacteria this phenomenon might be attributed to collisions between the beads with high mechanical strength and granule surface strengthened frictional forces which resulted in excessive shear and rupture of smaller granules into sludge flocs kim et al 2013 interestingly the granule size gradually increased when the beads were decomposed around day 70 the soluble alginic acid produced by hydrolysis of alginate ca2 gels was a sticky material that could serve as the precursor of ags yang et al 2014 the reduction in the frictional and corresponding shear forces further enhanced granulation although at the end of the experiment the particle diameter in r2 0 48 mm was larger than in r3 0 36 mm both were much smaller than in r1 and r4 indicating that the damage on the smaller aggregates was irreversible the variation in the mlss concentration and svi10 followed a parallel pattern in all reactors fig 5b and c except for an apparent decline of mlss from 4 14 to 3 83 g l and an increase of svi10 from 53 2 to 72 4 ml g in r1 during days 120 150 implying that r1 granules might lose their stability during long term operations comparatively more biomass ranging from 3 38 to 4 46 g l accumulated in r4 granules in aggregated structures with denser biomass were demonstrated to promote signal accumulation chen et al 2018 our study is consistent with this observation fig 4 at the end of the experiment r4 granules showed an enhanced settling ability svi10 of 37 2 ml g and granular stability integrity coefficient of 4 4 0 3 fig 5c and table s2 furthermore the relative hydrophobicity of sludge increased in r4 to 78 4 3 5 table s2 3 3 2 ags morphology light microscopy showed that distinguishable granules with clear boundaries appeared in r1 and r4 fig 6 a and d while slimy and nebulous biomass appeared in r2 and r3 on day 60 fig 6b and c by day 120 large sized granules co existed with small aggregates in r1 whereas r4 granules were consistently bigger sized in r2 and r3 small aggregates appeared but without defined shapes thus it was not necessary to compare their micro morphology with r1 and r4 granules r1 granules were irregularly shaped whereas smooth and dense granules were observed in r4 after qs regulation fig 6i p examining the surface of r1 granules a progressive outgrowth of filamentous bacteria was found from day 60 till the end of the experiment which could cause deterioration of settling properties fig 5c granule instability table s2 and result in biomass washout fig 5b excessive proliferation of filamentous organisms is not related to a single factor but to a combination of multiple factors including long srt do deficiency low substrate availability gradient of substrate concentration nutrient deficiency and temperature shift figueroa et al 2015 here the increased granular diameter in r1 fig 5a may hinder do transfer from the bulk liquid to the inner layer of the granules thus favoring the growth of filamentous bacteria franca et al 2018 moreover the influent organic substances and nutrient concentrations are constant throughout the experiment section 2 3 during aerobic granulation the biomass concentration typically increased from 3 29 g l to 4 14 g l fig 5b which possibly results in nutrient deficiency to microorganisms at low nutrient levels filamentous bacteria show a higher rate of substrate uptake than the floc forming bacteria and thus rapidly grow out from the granules hamza et al 2018 notably r4 granules mainly consist of cocci and bacilli with no filaments or a few filaments covering the granular surface the primary reason for preventing filament outgrowth was supposed to be the high ahl concentrations that led to the formation of a dense and compact granular structure which minimized the growth of filamentous bacteria fang et al 2009 fish analysis of the cryosections of mature granules characterized the abundance and spatial locations of functional genera aob nob and paos were homogeneously scattered in r1 granules while aob and nob were primarily clustered in the core of r4 granules fig 7 moreover compared to r1 granules the fluorescence signals were stronger in r4 granules revealing a higher dominance of aob nob and paos which was beneficial in nitrogen and phosphorus removal the nucleic acids stained in red were majorly on the exterior part of the granules proteins stained in green and α polysaccharides stained in blue occupied the central region of the granules fig 8 this eps backbone matrix provided mechanical strength to resist shear stress and sustain a stable structure lee et al 2010 the nucleic acids and proteins were distributed in dispersed form in r1 granules but they formed a continuous layer in r4 granules furthermore weaker fluorescence intensities from proteins and α polysaccharides as well as more voids and channels in r1 led to a looser granular structure whereas the compact and stable interior in r4 granules was supported by a denser eps matrix 3 3 3 performance of the reactors the cod removal efficiency experienced a similar tendency in r1 and r4 fig 9 gradually improving during the initial 30 days and then being maintained over 96 till the end of the operation except for the days 120 150 when the removal efficiency dropped from 98 2 to 95 1 in r1 high mlss concentrations were maintained in the two reactors allowing high organics degradation rates while the decrease of the removal efficiency in r1 was attributed to the presence of filaments and subsequent biomass washout a sharp decline in cod removal efficiency was found in r2 and r3 when the beads were added probably owing to the collisions between beads and granules leading to the disintegration of smaller granules although the cod removal efficiency slowly increased afterwards they could not reach the high levels of r1 and r4 r4 exhibited a better performance in removing tp as the efficiency averaged about 62 4 which was 10 5 21 5 and 27 6 higher than that in r1 r2 and r3 respectively for nitrogen removal different effluent no3 n concentrations were obtained in the four reactors after rapid accumulation to a maximum value it gradually decreased to 6 9 r1 9 2 r2 11 9 r3 and 4 9 mg l r4 on day 150 though the amount of effluent no2 n was negligible 0 5 mg l in all reactors the satisfactory nh4 n nearly 100 and tn 84 7 removal efficiency achieved in r4 suggested that ags possessed higher nitrification and denitrification ability these results imply that the dose of ahls supernatant had an outstanding potential for cod and nutrient removal possibly owing to the enhanced microbial activity in organic matter and nutrient degradation atp has been considered to reflect bioactivity as it served as a primary bioenergy currency of organisms to participate in biochemical transformations jiang and liu 2012 table 2 lists the atp contents of sludge sampled from the four reactors on day 120 as shown the highest atp content 2 06 10 6 mol g mlss was attained in r4 which was significantly higher p 0 05 than that in r1 r2 and r3 in addition sour saur and snur of sludge were monitored the maximum sour 71 6 mg o2 g vss h was found in r4 on day 120 much greater than that in other reactors the observed better cod removal might be owing to the enhanced atp and sour similarly saur and snur of r4 were maintained at high levels of 1 02 and 1 14 1 16 and 1 42 and 1 21 and 1 70 fold higher than those in r1 r2 and r3 respectively indicating that dosing with ahls supernatant improved aob and nob activity this finding was in accordance with previous studies hu et al 2016 verified the strengthened aob activity of the biofilms by addition of 5 nm ahl mixtures c6 c8 3oc12 and c14 hsl sun et al 2018 reported that c6 hsl and c8 hsl stimulated nob activity by promoting efficient communication 3 4 effect of qs regulation on eps production 3 4 1 quantitative analysis of eps eps has a great influence on the physico chemical properties of microbial biomass and facilitates the formation of ags via binding bacterial cells tightly iorhemen et al 2019 to evaluate the effect of different qs regulation strategies on eps production eps concentrations during the granulation were analyzed considering the primary constituents pn and ps fig 10 a and b the pn content distributed in lb eps gradually increased from an average 18 35 mg g vss to the final amount of 44 25 32 73 22 47 and 48 32 mg g vss in r1 r4 respectively the tb pn concentration sharply increased in r4 when ahls supernatant was exogenously administered ranging from 44 78 to 107 45 mg g vss days 20 150 much more than r1 41 63 84 51 mg g vss the maximum value of tb pn in r4 was 2 02 and 2 96 fold higher than that in r2 and r3 respectively nevertheless the ps content remained relatively steady in both the lb and tb fractions during the 150 days of operation these results implied that augmentation of the ahl content effectively promoted the pn production particularly in the tb fraction as reported by lv et al 2014 and mcswain et al 2005 that ps maintained stability whether in ahl mediated environment or not whereas pn was more sensitive to ahl regulation compared to ps the over production of pn and the excellent characteristics of r4 granules together suggest that pn might act as a main contributor to enhance granulation and reinforcing structural stability actually pn is highly hydrophobic and the higher pn content in r4 is thus potentially correlated with the higher level of relative hydrophobicity table s2 which can lead to a reduction of the excess gibbs energy therefore pn is responsible for facilitating cell to cell interactions holding the aggregated bacteria together and improving the maturity and stability of ags miao et al 2018 3 4 2 fluorescent components identified by parafac to investigate the role of pn in enhancing granulation and the underlying qs regulation mechanisms with respect to eps secretion the 3d eem spectra of the eps components fig s3 were separated into independent fluorescent groups two fluorescent components were identified using parafac namely component 1 and component 2 table 3 component 1 c1 with two peaks at ex em 220 230 325 375 and 250 300 325 375 representing protein derived amino acid tryptophan and aromatic protein substances component 2 c2 with ex em at 255 295 425 500 and 330 400 330 400 was categorized as fulvic like and humic like substances wei et al 2016 fig 10c and d display the fluorescence intensities fi of the two parafac derived components in the eps samples in the lb eps fraction the fi amount of c1 in r1 and r4 were higher than those in r2 and r3 with no significant differences between r1 515 3 and r4 558 2 for tb eps the fi values of c1 were substantially elevated in all reactors but c1 intensity was notably strengthened in r4 885 8 fi scores of c2 remained at low levels in the four eps samples whether in the fraction of lb or tb apparently tryptophan and aromatic protein substances c1 in tb eps were more preferentially induced by qs regulation via the addition of ahls supernatant 3 5 effect of qs regulation on microbial community structure 3 5 1 bacterial community structure analysis the analysis of the genus level bacterial diversity after 60 and 140 days of operation indicated that qs manipulation greatly influenced the microbial populations during the granulation process fig 11 the relative abundance of the genus hydrogenophaga belonging to the phylum proteobacteria accounted for 1 65 in the inoculum sludge it significantly increased in r1 17 96 and r4 26 82 and became the most dominant bacteria on day 60 this genus comprised autotrophic denitrifying microorganisms with the capability to remove no3 n by utilizing h2 as an electron donor instead of external organic carbon park et al 2005 this genus frequently accumulated along with increased nh4 n removal wan et al 2014 here the removal of nh4 n increased from 91 6 after inoculation to 98 2 and nearly 100 in r1 and r4 on day 60 data not shown respectively which could partly explain the abundance of this genus moreover good growth of hydrogenophaga likely occurred in the media enriched in protein willems and gillis 2015 the observed increase in eps excretion particularly pn in r1 and r4 fig 10a and b along with the aerobic granulation process might create a favorable environment for the growth of the genus hydrogenophaga in comparison the higher removal efficiency of nh4 n and eps contents in r4 led to a higher relative abundance of this genus the genera dechloromonas and thauera were predominant in r1 and r4 on day 60 enhanced removal of organic matter could be achieved when dechloromonas was present in the reactor to sufficient level meanwhile it functioned as a denitrifying pao that was important for the layer structured granular sludge formation by creating an anaerobic core covered by an aerobic exterior shell świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 augmentation of the signal content enlarged the granule diameter in r4 and thus increased the anoxic zones where the denitrifiers could grow and subsequently improve the tn removal efficiency the genus thauera was associated with binding the cells together by secreting eps particularly protein like substances and tryptophan zhang et al 2019c however the genus paracoccus was the most abundant bacteria in r2 21 29 and r3 34 96 this species was capable of utilizing both oxygen and nitrogenous oxides and was more inclined to predominate in the looser granules sarma et al 2017 a significant increment of the genus thiothrix was found with time in r1 from 5 48 on day 60 to 35 49 on day 140 while it occupied 2 13 in r4 members of the genus thiothrix have the ability of cod and p removal however more importantly they were identified as filamentous bacteria and the over growth of this genus adversely impacted the granular settling ability figueroa et al 2015 the instability of r1 granules during long term operation could thus be attributed to the excessive proliferation of thiothrix the genus pseudomonas was the largest genus in r4 on day 140 with a relative abundance of 25 74 this genus functions in polyphosphate accumulation and denitrification and participates in the stability of ags as eps producers lin et al 2010 other prevalent genera like chryseobacterium and aeromonas increased with the prolonged operation time in r4 at 17 07 and 15 07 respectively both of which were responsible for strengthening bacterial aggregation by secreting eps fan et al 2018 the noticeable granule strength table s2 and interior compact structure fig 8 of r4 granules was likely owing to the metabolites of these microbes 3 5 2 correlation between bacterial community and ahls cca analysis was carried out to gain further insights into the underlying relationship between the predominant microbial community and ahl expression two types of ahls c8 and 3oc8 hsl had a close correlation with some genera including aeromonas pseudomonas and gemmobacter fig 11b pseudomonas could regulate the production of several types of ahls such as c6 3oc6 and c8 hsl kumar et al 2011 the genus aeromonas from the class flavobacteria which is known to possess an ahl dependent qs system based on the ahyri locus readily formed a biofilm by sensing and releasing c4 c6 and c8 hsl lynch et al 2002 besides ahl producing genus acidovorax is generally found in the ags chen et al 2018 here a strong positive relationship was observed between the genus acidovorax and c6 and c10 hsl moreover some genera were positively associated with ahls such as the genera dechloromonas hydrogenophaga and zoogloea while some microbes paracoccus brevundimonas janthinobacterium and sphaerotilus were negatively correlated with the identified ahl which functioned as ahls quenchers qs producers and quenchers are two antagonistic groups of microorganisms that often coexisted with each other in diverse bacterial communities to control the balance of the ahl content in the bioreactors song et al 2014 3 6 enhancement mechanisms of qs regulation and implications of this study here the effect of qs regulation on granulation via dosage with ahls supernatant from excreting strains or bacterial cells encapsulated in sodium alginate was evaluated addition of ahls supernatant favored a high ahl content environment to reinforce efficient cell to cell communication and increase biomass density the accumulated biomass could supply more bioenergy to synthesize ahls and the bioenergy was synchronously elevated to overcome the electrostatic repulsive forces among the cells and thereby induce bacterial aggregation compact granules were rapidly formed which suppressed the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria with the increase in bacterial aggregation and eps secretion the particle size further enlarged and provided appropriate ecological niches for phosphorus removal and denitrification the enrichment of microorganisms that secrete ahls such as aeromonas and pseudomonas was induced by augmentation of the ahl content leading to a sustainable endogenous release of ahls mainly c6 and c8 hsl these ahls regulated the production of tryptophan and aromatic protein substances which contributed to the increase in relative hydrophobicity and to maintain system stability this study indicated that augmentation of ahls supernatant could efficiently regulate aerobic granulation which is economically feasible and sustainable compared to the traditional add back signaling chemicals however several questions remain to be addressed in future research dosage of ahls supernatant could efficiently accelerate granulation however the adequate amount of ahls supernatant is still unknown moreover suitable time to start dosing with ahls supernatant and the best dosage duration need to be determined further whether the regulation strategy based on ahls supernatant can be applied in the ags system for treating different types of wastewater and the effects of different operation conditions on the ahl regulation efficiency need to be assessed furthermore a novel medium to immobilize qs bacterial cells by which the collisions on the granules can be alleviated but ahls can still be continuously released from the excreting bacteria will promote future application of qs bio augmentation using carrier materials 4 conclusions several qs bacteria with high ahl producing capacity have been isolated from mature ags and used for understanding qs regulation qs regulation via addition of ahl rich supernatant enabled the formation of ags with excellent settling ability efficient nutrient removal higher integrity coefficient bioactivity ahl content and eps production comparatively a gradual decrease in the biological activity of cebs was detected exogenous dose of cebs exhibited negligible or negative effects on the physicochemical properties of ags primarily due to its high mechanical strength and the damage was not easy to recover irreversible suggesting that this mode of ahl augmentation might be inappropriate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
