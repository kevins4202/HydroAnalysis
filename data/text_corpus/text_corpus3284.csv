16420,antibiotic resistance genes args in municipal drinking water may not be effectively removed during centralized treatment to reduce potential health risks water disinfection at the point of use scale is warranted this study investigated the performance of boiling a prevalent household water disinfection means in response to args contamination we found that boiling was more efficient in inactivating both escherichia coli and environmental bacteria compared to chlorination and pasteurization boiling of environmental bacteria suspension removed a much broader spectrum of args and mobile genetic elements up to 141 genes than chlorination up to 13 genes such better performance was largely attributed to a stronger inactivation of chlorine tolerant bacteria including acinetobacter and bacillus accumulation of extracellular args was found during low temperature heating 80 c and in the initial stage of chlorination first 3 min when initial chlorine was 5 mg l and first 12 min when initial chlorine was 1 mg l these extracellular args as well as the intracellular args got removed as the heating temperature increased or the chlorination time prolonged under the same treatment time 30 min high temperature heating 90 1 c damaged the dna structure more thoroughly than chlorination 5 mg l taking into account the low transferability of args after dna melting boiling may provide an effective point of use approach to attenuating bacterial args in drinking water and is still worth promoting in the future keywords antibiotic resistance genes water boiling pasteurization chlorination dna damage bacterial inactivation 1 introduction bacterial antibiotic resistance bar is an urgent threat to human healthcare armstrong et al 1999 spellberg et al 2004 bar problem in drinking water is worthy of attention due to the close linkage with people s daily lives growing studies have detected antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in municipal drinking water jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 su et al 2018 remarkable events such as the detection of the ndm 1 gene in tap water in new delhi india 2010 and of escherichia coli carrying the extended spectrum β lactamase gene in tap water in france 2016 call for solutions to this problem walsh et al 2011 madec et al 2016 drinking water bar problem is closely related to bacterial biofilms these biofilms attached to structures surface filter media and pipeline inwall persist throughout water treatment and distribution processes wingender and flemming 2011 simoes and simões 2013 and have been reported to harbor args with high diversity and absolute abundance schwartz et al 2003 xu et al 2020 wan et al 2021 given the fact of biofilm aging and shedding it is inevitable to introduce additional arg contamination during water treatment and distribution and in this case make it difficult to remove arg completely through large scale centralized water treatment wan et al 2020 under such a background point of use pou disinfection at the household level may be warranted to reduce potential health risks caused by bar boiling is perhaps the oldest means of disinfecting water at the household level sobsey et al 2002 in the absence of the concept of microorganisms the ancient chinese summed up the experience of drinking boiled water is not easy to get sick boiling water is also rooted in the ancient chinese tea culture and has been handed down to this day although water boiling consumes relatively high energy compared with certain alternatives which limits its application potential in large scale centralized water treatment it is still the most prevalent means of treating water currently practiced at the household level attribute to the good disinfect performance and easily available hardware who 2009 who 2015 governments non governmental organizations and others have promoted boiling both in developing countries where water is routinely of uncertain microbial quality and in developed countries when conventional water treatment fails or water supplies are interrupted gilman and skillicorn 1985 however it is not yet known how such an ancient eastern wisdom performs in dealing with emerging contaminant args to assess the arg removal performance of boiling this study uses chlorination as a control chlorine has the advantage of good disinfection performance and low cost which makes chlorination widely used in drinking water treatment plants dwtps as uncharged oxidants chlorine and its hydrolysis product hypochlorous acid have the ability to deconstruct cell wall penetrate cell membrane and react with intracellular substances including args hu et al 2019 choi et al 2021 previous studies have shown that chlorination is effective to remove args in full scale dwtps lin et al 2016 xu et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 but this removal is not complete the residual args are still significant in number and are often carried by chlorine tolerant bacteria that has the potential to survive and proliferate during water distribution chapman 2003 chao et al 2013 khan et al 2016 garner et al 2018 in addition to comparing boiling with chlorination the effect of temperature changes during heating on args is also of interest and based on this the performance of pasteurization on arg removal is also studied in this study boiling pasteurization and chlorination were investigated for their performance on 1 bacterial inactivation by using e coli and environmental flora as test bacteria 2 args removal potential during bacterial inactivation 3 arg removal spectrum by comparing arg diversity and antibiotic resistome structure before and after environmental flora inactivating 4 args release potential by monitoring the concentration of intracellular and extracellular args during e coli inactivating and 5 dna damage potential by measuring dna degradation after disinfecting based on these experimental results it can be comprehensively answered whether water boiling is safe enough to deal with drinking water bar problem 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of bacteria suspension and amplicon solution 2 1 1 e coli suspension e coli

statistical difference using graphpad prism 8 http www graphpad com pearson correlation analysis was conducted using graphpad prism 8 as well all figures were generated using graphpad prism 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial inactivation disinfection performance on e coli suspension 108 cells ml and environmental bacteria suspension 107 cells ml were conducted as shown in fig 1 chlorination for 30 min inactivated 3 14 to 7 13 logs of e coli and 1 6 to 1 9 logs of environmental bacteria chlorination showed significant dose response relationship for e coli inactivation but not for environmental bacteria inactivation compared to chlorination pasteurization showed a better performance in inactivating both e coli and environmental bacteria cultivable e coli decreased by 6 95 to 7 25 logs after low temperature pasteurization 60 c for 30 min and was almost undetectable after high temperature pasteurization 75 c and 90 c for 10 min while environmental bacteria decreased by 2 1 to 2 6 logs after pasteurization at different temperatures boiling showed the best performance compared to pasteurization and chlorination all e coli was inactivated once water was boiled and environmental bacteria decreased by 7 4 logs after boiling for 3 min prolonging the boiling time significantly improved the performance of disinfection while changing the heating intensity did not contribute much bacterial community structure of the environmental bacteria suspension was further analyzed before and after disinfection a total of 1051 otus were detected before disinfection the otu number decreased to 259 29 247 20 and 225 20 after pasteurization boiling and chlorination respectively at the genus level sixteen dominant genera relative abundance 1 were detected in undisinfected bacterial suspension with their average relative abundance of 2 8 fig 2 after pasteurization boiling and chlorination the number of dominant genera decreased to 13 11 12 and 4 6 with their average relative abundance increased to 6 5 7 0 7 1 8 4 and 15 6 23 4 respectively these results indicated that all disinfection methods could inactivate most of the environmental bacteria but some chlorine or heat tolerant bacteria can also be screened out all disinfections were less efficient in inactivating environmental bacteria compared to e coli even though the initial cell concentration of environmental bacteria suspension was nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of e coli suspension fig 1 this inefficiency is mainly attributed to the heat or chlorine tolerant bacteria as shown in fig 2 the relative abundance of acinetobacter and bacillus together accounted for 59 5 after 10 min boiling and accounted for 74 6 after chlorination for 30 min with the initial chlorine at 5 mg l these abundances were significantly higher than that of control group 8 7 and it should be noted that both acinetobacter and bacillus were previously reported to be tolerant to the commonly used disinfectants including chlorine and survive very broad range of temperatures setlow 2006 doughari et al 2009 christie and setlow 2020 and previous study noted that bacillus species has the tolerance with adverse circumstances due to their endospore forms rather than their vegetative forms margosch et al 2006 in addition to the tolerant bacteria extracellular polymer substances eps which helps bacterial cells to form capsules or multicellular conglomerates may also protect bacteria from chlorination a typical example was the detection of zoogloea which accounted for 0 08 of relative abundance in the control group was capable to produce zoogloeal flocs a kind of eps that plays a central role to form multicellular conglomerates matrix of activated sludge an et al 2016 it should be noted that pasteurization and chlorination are comparable in their ability to inactivate culturable bacteria fig 1b but that pasteurization results in a more diverse and even community structure while chlorination is more selective for bacterial inactivation 3 2 removing environmental args mges environmental bacteria suspension was analyzed for bacterial antibiotic resistome before and after disinfections fig 3 and fig s2 a total of 137 args and 7 mobile genetic elements mges were detected in the control group these genes ranged from 5 76 9 89 log copies ml after 1 15 s boiling args mges were removed up to 1 95 logs after 3 min boiling 33 35 args were completely removed and the residual genes were removed by 2 09 4 22 logs only 3 12 args were detectable after 10 min boiling with their copies removed by 4 69 6 75 logs chlorination for 30 min with the initial chlorine at 1 mg l removed args mges up to 1 33 logs after chlorination for 30 min with initial chlorine at 3 mg l 13 args were completely removed and the residual genes were removed by 0 65 4 05 logs such value increased to 0 62 6 72 logs after the chlorine concentration increased to 5 mg l compared with boiling and chlorination pasteurization has little effect on args mges removal the gene removal was up to the highest 1 27 logs in all pasteurization groups we selected out args mges that had been detected in full scale drinking water treatment plants in our previous work wan et al 2021 and investigated their removal efficiency by boiling and chlorination in this study fig s3 after comparison a total of 109 args and 5 mges were selected with their absolute abundance ranged from 5 76 to 9 89 log copies ml in environmental bacteria suspension args mges removal by chlorination exhibited high selectivity args including tetpb tetl tetx tetr vanc and vanyd were totally removed 7 56 8 38 log copies ml while args including aacc aada9 acra cmx a mexe and oprj were unchanged in their absolute abundance unlike chlorination boiling removed almost all genes completely leaving only genes aada2 03 acrr 01 and vanyd 01 each of which was also removed in amounts larger than 5 log copies ml we found that chlorination was more selective than boiling in removing args mges such selectivity on args removal has been widely reported in both sewage and drinking water chlorination and is generally thought to be caused by the selective inactivation of environmental bacteria berry et al 2006 huang et al 2011 shi et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 lin et al 2016 in this study genera acinetobacter and bacillus were significantly enriched after chlorination both the genera contain a variety of pathogenic species e g acinetobacter baumannii bacillus anthracis bacillus cereus and most of the species were noted to have multiple antibiotic resistance ihde and armstrong 1973 kramer and gilbert 1989 peleg et al 2008 for example a baumannii is attracting attention due to the increase in antibiotic resistance and possesses resistance against virtually all available antibiotics perez et al 2007 this organism is generally intrinsically resistant to a number of commonly used antibiotics including aminopenicillins first and second generation cephalosporins and chloramphenicol seifert et al 1993 vila et al 1993 and also has a remarkable capacity to acquire resistance to broad spectrum β lactams aminoglycosides fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines bergogne bérézin and towner 1996 such bar development characteristic attributes to the special genomic structure that facilitates the horizontal acquisition of args fournier et al 2006 smith et al 2007 poirel et al 2011 as well as a baumannii bacillus spp was also noted to resistant against multiple antibiotics e g β lactam antibiotics rifampin etc and to carry different types of args e g β lactamase genes ermd aph aadk cat etc ihde and armstrong 1973 kramer and gilbert 1989 peleg et al 2008 from the above results it is clear that boiling is less risky than chlorination both in terms of selectivity for args removal and for bacterial inactivation 3 3 args release during bacterial inactivation antibiotic resistance can spread between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer hgt even if cells carrying args get killed args released to the environment has the potential to persist and to be acquired by other cells through bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell to cell contact or by a bridge like connection transformation blum et al 1997 hill and top 1998 crecchio et al 2005 here we assessed args release risk by monitoring changes in intracellular and extracellular args concentration during disinfection of e coli fig 4 3 3 1 heating and boiling the untreated e coli suspension contained 7 22 7 49 and 9 45 log copies ml of intracellular blatem tetc 16s rdna and 2 92 3 58 and 5 26 log copies ml of extracellular blatem tetc 16s rdna from 22 c to 80 c heating intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna remained relatively stable within 6 28 7 26 7 02 7 52 and 8 7 9 49 log copies ml while extracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna increased by 0 98 0 74 and 0 49 log copies ml such increase in extracellular genes concentration indicated that heating in this temperature range results in the release of intracellular genes from 80 c heating to 0 5 min boiling both intracellular and extracellular genes decreased significantly in which intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna decreased by 3 39 3 1 and 3 97 log copies ml while extracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna decreased by 0 69 0 69 and 0 48 log copies ml after boiling for more than 1 5 min both intracellular and extracellular genes remained stable with concentration around 2 45 3 41 2 86 3 87 and 4 39 5 08 copies ml for blatem tetc and 16s rdna respectively 3 3 2 chlorination the concentration of intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna decreased continuously with the chlorination time chlorination for 30 min with the initial chlorine concentration at 5 mg l decreased intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna by 5 15 4 61 and 4 68 log copies ml respectively while chlorination with initial chlorine concentration at 1 mg l decreased these genes by 2 56 2 44 and 2 58 log copies ml respectively when chlorination initial chlorine concentration at 5mg l for more than 30 min intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna remained relatively stable concentration around 2 12 2 82 2 5 3 32 and 4 6 5 02 log copies ml respectively meanwhile chlorination with low initial chlorine concentration 1 mg l led to continuous decrease in concentration of intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna and to low levels at 2 91 3 21 and 4 52 copies l at 120 min residual chlorine concentration monitoring indicated that 1 mg l chlorine would not completely consume in 120 minutes of disinfection fig s4 when initial chlorine concentration was low 1 mg l extracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna increased in concentration by 1 46 1 49 and 1 04 log copies ml at the first 12 min and decreased continuously in the following time suggesting the release of args occurs during the initial stage of chlorination after increasing the initial chlorine concentration to 5 mg l the amount and duration of args release decreased significantly we found that args release occurred during both the heating below 80 c and the initial stage of chlorination it was reported that both heat stress and chlorine could disintegrate membrane integrity and lead to the release of intracellular substances such as dna using flow cytometry one study noted that heating at 60 c for 20 min led the proportion of permeabilized e coli cells increased from 0 13 0 02 to 79 67 0 68 and heating at 80 c for 10 min increased the proportion to 96 84 0 38 similar trends were also been observed in gram positive bacteria listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus kennedy et al 2011 another study noted that chlorine exposure dosage determined its ability to rupture bacterial membrane 0 4 mg l chlorine exposure for 10 min resulted in the membrane disintegrating of about 10 e coli cells and such proportion raising to 100 after chlorine concentration increased to 1 mg l wang et al 2010 we found that the genes released outside the cells during heating and chlorination had no significant effect on the intracellular gene concentration mainly due to the large difference between intracellular and extracellular gene concentration although the extracellular genes increased by an order of magnitude but the proportion of released genes in the intracellular genes was still small we found the concentration of extracellular genes increased at the temperature range of 50 c to 80 c it was reported that plasmid dna could retain its ability to transform and express even after thermo treatment at this temperature range li et al 2009 taher et al 2020 in this case low temperature pasteurization 60 80 c may instead increase the risk of the spread of bar 3 4 dna damage during heating and chlorination we used pcr to amplify gene blatem carried by plasmid pbr322 to obtain an amplicon 531 bp and study dna degradation during heating and chlorination the amplicon was diluted to different concentrations 7 4 3 29 and 1 38 ng μl dna for heating and chlorination the treated amplicons were then stained using agilent dna 12000 kit and measured their fluorescence intensity fu using bioanalyzer since the dye in the kit only binds to double stranded dna dsdna and emits fluorescence fu detected in the experiment represents the content of dsdna as shown in fig 5 fig s5 and fig s6 the amplicon showed obvious peaks at 531 bp and the peak height fu was highly correlated with the dna concentrations of the amplicon the peak height fu at 531 bp remained unchanged after low temperature heating 81 3 c but decreased slightly after chlorination suggesting that low temperature heating cannot affect the integrity of dna while chlorination can damage dna integrity to a certain extent we found high temperature heating 90 1 c resulted in significant decreases of peak height fu at 531 bp and the higher the heating temperature the more obvious the trend of peak height decline such results indicated that heating over 90 c can significantly damage the double stranded structure of dna it is known that dna denatures above its critical melting temperature changing from the double stranded helical structure into two independent strands in this experiment the peak height characterizes the content of dsdna so it is reasonable that the fluorescence intensity of the amplicon significantly decreased due to high temperature heating a previous study reported that chlorination could cause slow denaturation of the dna such denaturation could be inhibited and partially reversible by treatment of chlorinated dna with reducing agents such as glutathione prütz 1996 it is likely that the addition of thiosulfate in this study inhibited the denaturation process or restored the double stranded structure of dna after chlorine was quenched chlorine attacks dna primarily through selective reaction to nucleotide bases rather than damage its phosphate diester backbone suquet et al 2010 previous studies noted that chlorine has the highest reactivity toward guanine base k 2 1 104 m 1 s 1 followed by thymine base k 4 3 103 m 1 s 1 cytosine base k 66 m 1 s 1 and adenine base k 6 4 m 1 s 1 prütz 1996 yoon et al 2017 which supported by other studies noted that guanine base has the lowest ionization potential in dna davis et al 2012 jena 2012 it was reported that the oxidation on guanine bases would not raise direct strand breaks in dna but give rise to modified sites that sequence specific cleavage cullis et al 1996 in addition to the dose effect relationship during the process chlorine damage the dna structure these may together lead to the low degree of dna degradation after 30 min of chlorination we found chlorination was efficient in removing args fig 4 while the dna maintained high integrity during this process chlorination probably modified the bases and affected the base pairing in the pcr reaction thus making args undetectable while the dna molecule may maintain a high degree of integrity it is known that dissociated dna is biologically inactive and difficult to be taken up by bacterial cells lerman and tolmach 1957 lerman and tolmach 1959 barnhart and herriott 1963 boiling treated args are theoretically low risk or risk free to replicate and transfer horizontally the base modification of dna caused by chlorination on the other hand has the potential to be repaired which is driven by various enzymes within the cell and have been extensively noted in previous studies de laat et al 1999 friedberg et al 2005 jena and bansal 2011 these repair pathways would increase the hgt risk of args after chlorination especially when cells are not completely killed as supported by a previous study low dosage chlorination 40 mg min l even resulted in a 2 to 5 folds increase in the frequency of args conjugation guo et al 2015 in addition chlorine as an oxidant also reacts with other substances such as organic matters in waters or in cells which would inevitably lead to uneven chlorine concentration inside and outside the cell and in different parts of the cell while the heat conduction when heating and boiling is relatively uniform from these perspectives args removal by boiling has lower risks compared to chlorination 4 conclusions to reduce potential health risks caused by drinking water bar problem pou disinfection at the household level is warranted water boiling as the most prevalent means of treating water at home was investigated for its performance to remove args when dealing with the complex environmental flora boiling shows broad spectrum and high efficiency in inactivating bacteria and removing args which is significantly better than chlorination and pasteurization heating below 80 c will cause the release of args from bacterial cells but when the water temperature is higher than 90 c both intracellular and extracellular args get removed such finding also highlights the risk that low temperature pasteurization 80 c may promote the spread of bar in principle args removal by high temperature is achieved by denaturing dna which can effectively reduce the biological activity of dna and reduce the risk of hgt although water boiling is uneconomical in energy it is more thorough in removing and inactivating arb and args it is believed that with the progress of energy technology boiling this oriental drinking water disinfection tradition is still worth promoting in the future declaration of competing interest the authors

16420,antibiotic resistance genes args in municipal drinking water may not be effectively removed during centralized treatment to reduce potential health risks water disinfection at the point of use scale is warranted this study investigated the performance of boiling a prevalent household water disinfection means in response to args contamination we found that boiling was more efficient in inactivating both escherichia coli and environmental bacteria compared to chlorination and pasteurization boiling of environmental bacteria suspension removed a much broader spectrum of args and mobile genetic elements up to 141 genes than chlorination up to 13 genes such better performance was largely attributed to a stronger inactivation of chlorine tolerant bacteria including acinetobacter and bacillus accumulation of extracellular args was found during low temperature heating 80 c and in the initial stage of chlorination first 3 min when initial chlorine was 5 mg l and first 12 min when initial chlorine was 1 mg l these extracellular args as well as the intracellular args got removed as the heating temperature increased or the chlorination time prolonged under the same treatment time 30 min high temperature heating 90 1 c damaged the dna structure more thoroughly than chlorination 5 mg l taking into account the low transferability of args after dna melting boiling may provide an effective point of use approach to attenuating bacterial args in drinking water and is still worth promoting in the future keywords antibiotic resistance genes water boiling pasteurization chlorination dna damage bacterial inactivation 1 introduction bacterial antibiotic resistance bar is an urgent threat to human healthcare armstrong et al 1999 spellberg et al 2004 bar problem in drinking water is worthy of attention due to the close linkage with people s daily lives growing studies have detected antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in municipal drinking water jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 su et al 2018 remarkable events such as the detection of the ndm 1 gene in tap water in new delhi india 2010 and of escherichia coli carrying the extended spectrum β lactamase gene in tap water in france 2016 call for solutions to this problem walsh et al 2011 madec et al 2016 drinking water bar problem is closely related to bacterial biofilms these biofilms attached to structures surface filter media and pipeline inwall persist throughout water treatment and distribution processes wingender and flemming 2011 simoes and simões 2013 and have been reported to harbor args with high diversity and absolute abundance schwartz et al 2003 xu et al 2020 wan et al 2021 given the fact of biofilm aging and shedding it is inevitable to introduce additional arg contamination during water treatment and distribution and in this case make it difficult to remove arg completely through large scale centralized water treatment wan et al 2020 under such a background point of use pou disinfection at the household level may be warranted to reduce potential health risks caused by bar boiling is perhaps the oldest means of disinfecting water at the household level sobsey et al 2002 in the absence of the concept of microorganisms the ancient chinese summed up the experience of drinking boiled water is not easy to get sick boiling water is also rooted in the ancient chinese tea culture and has been handed down to this day although water boiling consumes relatively high energy compared with certain alternatives which limits its application potential in large scale centralized water treatment it is still the most prevalent means of treating water currently practiced at the household level attribute to the good disinfect performance and easily available hardware who 2009 who 2015 governments non governmental organizations and others have promoted boiling both in developing countries where water is routinely of uncertain microbial quality and in developed countries when conventional water treatment fails or water supplies are interrupted gilman and skillicorn 1985 however it is not yet known how such an ancient eastern wisdom performs in dealing with emerging contaminant args to assess the arg removal performance of boiling this study uses chlorination as a control chlorine has the advantage of good disinfection performance and low cost which makes chlorination widely used in drinking water treatment plants dwtps as uncharged oxidants chlorine and its hydrolysis product hypochlorous acid have the ability to deconstruct cell wall penetrate cell membrane and react with intracellular substances including args hu et al 2019 choi et al 2021 previous studies have shown that chlorination is effective to remove args in full scale dwtps lin et al 2016 xu et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 but this removal is not complete the residual args are still significant in number and are often carried by chlorine tolerant bacteria that has the potential to survive and proliferate during water distribution chapman 2003 chao et al 2013 khan et al 2016 garner et al 2018 in addition to comparing boiling with chlorination the effect of temperature changes during heating on args is also of interest and based on this the performance of pasteurization on arg removal is also studied in this study boiling pasteurization and chlorination were investigated for their performance on 1 bacterial inactivation by using e coli and environmental flora as test bacteria 2 args removal potential during bacterial inactivation 3 arg removal spectrum by comparing arg diversity and antibiotic resistome structure before and after environmental flora inactivating 4 args release potential by monitoring the concentration of intracellular and extracellular args during e coli inactivating and 5 dna damage potential by measuring dna degradation after disinfecting based on these experimental results it can be comprehensively answered whether water boiling is safe enough to deal with drinking water bar problem 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of bacteria suspension and amplicon solution 2 1 1 e coli suspension e coli

results and discussion 3 1 bacterial inactivation disinfection performance on e coli suspension 108 cells ml and environmental bacteria suspension 107 cells ml were conducted as shown in fig 1 chlorination for 30 min inactivated 3 14 to 7 13 logs of e coli and 1 6 to 1 9 logs of environmental bacteria chlorination showed significant dose response relationship for e coli inactivation but not for environmental bacteria inactivation compared to chlorination pasteurization showed a better performance in inactivating both e coli and environmental bacteria cultivable e coli decreased by 6 95 to 7 25 logs after low temperature pasteurization 60 c for 30 min and was almost undetectable after high temperature pasteurization 75 c and 90 c for 10 min while environmental bacteria decreased by 2 1 to 2 6 logs after pasteurization at different temperatures boiling showed the best performance compared to pasteurization and chlorination all e coli was inactivated once water was boiled and environmental bacteria decreased by 7 4 logs after boiling for 3 min prolonging the boiling time significantly improved the performance of disinfection while changing the heating intensity did not contribute much bacterial community structure of the environmental bacteria suspension was further analyzed before and after disinfection a total of 1051 otus were detected before disinfection the otu number decreased to 259 29 247 20 and 225 20 after pasteurization boiling and chlorination respectively at the genus level sixteen dominant genera relative abundance 1 were detected in undisinfected bacterial suspension with their average relative abundance of 2 8 fig 2 after pasteurization boiling and chlorination the number of dominant genera decreased to 13 11 12 and 4 6 with their average relative abundance increased to 6 5 7 0 7 1 8 4 and 15 6 23 4 respectively these results indicated that all disinfection methods could inactivate most of the environmental bacteria but some chlorine or heat tolerant bacteria can also be screened out all disinfections were less efficient in inactivating environmental bacteria compared to e coli even though the initial cell concentration of environmental bacteria suspension was nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of e coli suspension fig 1 this inefficiency is mainly attributed to the heat or chlorine tolerant bacteria as shown in fig 2 the relative abundance of acinetobacter and bacillus together accounted for 59 5 after 10 min boiling and accounted for 74 6 after chlorination for 30 min with the initial chlorine at 5 mg l these abundances were significantly higher than that of control group 8 7 and it should be noted that both acinetobacter and bacillus were previously reported to be tolerant to the commonly used disinfectants including chlorine and survive very broad range of temperatures setlow 2006 doughari et al 2009 christie and setlow 2020 and previous study noted that bacillus species has the tolerance with adverse circumstances due to their endospore forms rather than their vegetative forms margosch et al 2006 in addition to the tolerant bacteria extracellular polymer substances eps which helps bacterial cells to form capsules or multicellular conglomerates may also protect bacteria from chlorination a typical example was the detection of zoogloea which accounted for 0 08 of relative abundance in the control group was capable to produce zoogloeal flocs a kind of eps that plays a central role to form multicellular conglomerates matrix of activated sludge an et al 2016 it should be noted that pasteurization and chlorination are comparable in their ability to inactivate culturable bacteria fig 1b but that pasteurization results in a more diverse and even community structure while chlorination is more selective for bacterial inactivation 3 2 removing environmental args mges environmental bacteria suspension was analyzed for bacterial antibiotic resistome before and after disinfections fig 3 and fig s2 a total of 137 args and 7 mobile genetic elements mges were detected in the control group these genes ranged from 5 76 9 89 log copies ml after 1 15 s boiling args mges were removed up to 1 95 logs after 3 min boiling 33 35 args were completely removed and the residual genes were removed by 2 09 4 22 logs only 3 12 args were detectable after 10 min boiling with their copies removed by 4 69 6 75 logs chlorination for 30 min with the initial chlorine at 1 mg l removed args mges up to 1 33 logs after chlorination for 30 min with initial chlorine at 3 mg l 13 args were completely removed and the residual genes were removed by 0 65 4 05 logs such value increased to 0 62 6 72 logs after the chlorine concentration increased to 5 mg l compared with boiling and chlorination pasteurization has little effect on args mges removal the gene removal was up to the highest 1 27 logs in all pasteurization groups we selected out args mges that had been detected in full scale drinking water treatment plants in our previous work wan et al 2021 and investigated their removal efficiency by boiling and chlorination in this study fig s3 after comparison a total of 109 args and 5 mges were selected with their absolute abundance ranged from 5 76 to 9 89 log copies ml in environmental bacteria suspension args mges removal by chlorination exhibited high selectivity args including tetpb tetl tetx tetr vanc and vanyd were totally removed 7 56 8 38 log copies ml while args including aacc aada9 acra cmx a mexe and oprj were unchanged in their absolute abundance unlike chlorination boiling removed almost all genes completely leaving only genes aada2 03 acrr 01 and vanyd 01 each of which was also removed in amounts larger than 5 log copies ml we found that chlorination was more selective than boiling in removing args mges such selectivity on args removal has been widely reported in both sewage and drinking water chlorination and is generally thought to be caused by the selective inactivation of environmental bacteria berry et al 2006 huang et al 2011 shi et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 lin et al 2016 in this study genera acinetobacter and bacillus were significantly enriched after chlorination both the genera contain a variety of pathogenic species e g acinetobacter baumannii bacillus anthracis bacillus cereus and most of the species were noted to have multiple antibiotic resistance ihde and armstrong 1973 kramer and gilbert 1989 peleg et al 2008 for example a baumannii is attracting attention due to the increase in antibiotic resistance and possesses resistance against virtually all available antibiotics perez et al 2007 this organism is generally intrinsically resistant to a number of commonly used antibiotics including aminopenicillins first and second generation cephalosporins and chloramphenicol seifert et al 1993 vila et al 1993 and also has a remarkable capacity to acquire resistance to broad spectrum β lactams aminoglycosides fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines bergogne bérézin and towner 1996 such bar development characteristic attributes to the special genomic structure that facilitates the horizontal acquisition of args fournier et al 2006 smith et al 2007 poirel et al 2011 as well as a baumannii bacillus spp was also noted to resistant against multiple antibiotics e g β lactam antibiotics rifampin etc and to carry different types of args e g β lactamase genes ermd aph aadk cat etc ihde and armstrong 1973 kramer and gilbert 1989 peleg et al 2008 from the above results it is clear that boiling is less risky than chlorination both in terms of selectivity for args removal and for bacterial inactivation 3 3 args release during bacterial inactivation antibiotic resistance can spread between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer hgt even if cells carrying args get killed args released to the environment has the potential to persist and to be acquired by other cells through bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell to cell contact or by a bridge like connection transformation blum et al 1997 hill and top 1998 crecchio et al 2005 here we assessed args release risk by monitoring changes in intracellular and extracellular args concentration during disinfection of e coli fig 4 3 3 1 heating and boiling the untreated e coli suspension contained 7 22 7 49 and 9 45 log copies ml of intracellular blatem tetc 16s rdna and 2 92 3 58 and 5 26 log copies ml of extracellular blatem tetc 16s rdna from 22 c to 80 c heating intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna remained relatively stable within 6 28 7 26 7 02 7 52 and 8 7 9 49 log copies ml while extracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna increased by 0 98 0 74 and 0 49 log copies ml such increase in extracellular genes concentration indicated that heating in this temperature range results in the release of intracellular genes from 80 c heating to 0 5 min boiling both intracellular and extracellular genes decreased significantly in which intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna decreased by 3 39 3 1 and 3 97 log copies ml while extracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna decreased by 0 69 0 69 and 0 48 log copies ml after boiling for more than 1 5 min both intracellular and extracellular genes remained stable with concentration around 2 45 3 41 2 86 3 87 and 4 39 5 08 copies ml for blatem tetc and 16s rdna respectively 3 3 2 chlorination the concentration of intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna decreased continuously with the chlorination time chlorination for 30 min with the initial chlorine concentration at 5 mg l decreased intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna by 5 15 4 61 and 4 68 log copies ml respectively while chlorination with initial chlorine concentration at 1 mg l decreased these genes by 2 56 2 44 and 2 58 log copies ml respectively when chlorination initial chlorine concentration at 5mg l for more than 30 min intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna remained relatively stable concentration around 2 12 2 82 2 5 3 32 and 4 6 5 02 log copies ml respectively meanwhile chlorination with low initial chlorine concentration 1 mg l led to continuous decrease in concentration of intracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna and to low levels at 2 91 3 21 and 4 52 copies l at 120 min residual chlorine concentration monitoring indicated that 1 mg l chlorine would not completely consume in 120 minutes of disinfection fig s4 when initial chlorine concentration was low 1 mg l extracellular blatem tetc and 16s rdna increased in concentration by 1 46 1 49 and 1 04 log copies ml at the first 12 min and decreased continuously in the following time suggesting the release of args occurs during the initial stage of chlorination after increasing the initial chlorine concentration to 5 mg l the amount and duration of args release decreased significantly we found that args release occurred during both the heating below 80 c and the initial stage of chlorination it was reported that both heat stress and chlorine could disintegrate membrane integrity and lead to the release of intracellular substances such as dna using flow cytometry one study noted that heating at 60 c for 20 min led the proportion of permeabilized e coli cells increased from 0 13 0 02 to 79 67 0 68 and heating at 80 c for 10 min increased the proportion to 96 84 0 38 similar trends were also been observed in gram positive bacteria listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus kennedy et al 2011 another study noted that chlorine exposure dosage determined its ability to rupture bacterial membrane 0 4 mg l chlorine exposure for 10 min resulted in the membrane disintegrating of about 10 e coli cells and such proportion raising to 100 after chlorine concentration increased to 1 mg l wang et al 2010 we found that the genes released outside the cells during heating and chlorination had no significant effect on the intracellular gene concentration mainly due to the large difference between intracellular and extracellular gene concentration although the extracellular genes increased by an order of magnitude but the proportion of released genes in the intracellular genes was still small we found the concentration of extracellular genes increased at the temperature range of 50 c to 80 c it was reported that plasmid dna could retain its ability to transform and express even after thermo treatment at this temperature range li et al 2009 taher et al 2020 in this case low temperature pasteurization 60 80 c may instead increase the risk of the spread of bar 3 4 dna damage during heating and chlorination we used pcr to amplify gene blatem carried by plasmid pbr322 to obtain an amplicon 531 bp and study dna degradation during heating and chlorination the amplicon was diluted to different concentrations 7 4 3 29 and 1 38 ng μl dna for heating and chlorination the treated amplicons were then stained using agilent dna 12000 kit and measured their fluorescence intensity fu using bioanalyzer since the dye in the kit only binds to double stranded dna dsdna and emits fluorescence fu detected in the experiment represents the content of dsdna as shown in fig 5 fig s5 and fig s6 the amplicon showed obvious peaks at 531 bp and the peak height fu was highly correlated with the dna concentrations of the amplicon the peak height fu at 531 bp remained unchanged after low temperature heating 81 3 c but decreased slightly after chlorination suggesting that low temperature heating cannot affect the integrity of dna while chlorination can damage dna integrity to a certain extent we found high temperature heating 90 1 c resulted in significant decreases of peak height fu at 531 bp and the higher the heating temperature the more obvious the trend of peak height decline such results indicated that heating over 90 c can significantly damage the double stranded structure of dna it is known that dna denatures above its critical melting temperature changing from the double stranded helical structure into two independent strands in this experiment the peak height characterizes the content of dsdna so it is reasonable that the fluorescence intensity of the amplicon significantly decreased due to high temperature heating a previous study reported that chlorination could cause slow denaturation of the dna such denaturation could be inhibited and partially reversible by treatment of chlorinated dna with reducing agents such as glutathione prütz 1996 it is likely that the addition of thiosulfate in this study inhibited the denaturation process or restored the double stranded structure of dna after chlorine was quenched chlorine attacks dna primarily through selective reaction to nucleotide bases rather than damage its phosphate diester backbone suquet et al 2010 previous studies noted that chlorine has the highest reactivity toward guanine base k 2 1 104 m 1 s 1 followed by thymine base k 4 3 103 m 1 s 1 cytosine base k 66 m 1 s 1 and adenine base k 6 4 m 1 s 1 prütz 1996 yoon et al 2017 which supported by other studies noted that guanine base has the lowest ionization potential in dna davis et al 2012 jena 2012 it was reported that the oxidation on guanine bases would not raise direct strand breaks in dna but give rise to modified sites that sequence specific cleavage cullis et al 1996 in addition to the dose effect relationship during the process chlorine damage the dna structure these may together lead to the low degree of dna degradation after 30 min of chlorination we found chlorination was efficient in removing args fig 4 while the dna maintained high integrity during this process chlorination probably modified the bases and affected the base pairing in the pcr reaction thus making args undetectable while the dna molecule may maintain a high degree of integrity it is known that dissociated dna is biologically inactive and difficult to be taken up by bacterial cells lerman and tolmach 1957 lerman and tolmach 1959 barnhart and herriott 1963 boiling treated args are theoretically low risk or risk free to replicate and transfer horizontally the base modification of dna caused by chlorination on the other hand has the potential to be repaired which is driven by various enzymes within the cell and have been extensively noted in previous studies de laat et al 1999 friedberg et al 2005 jena and bansal 2011 these repair pathways would increase the hgt risk of args after chlorination especially when cells are not completely killed as supported by a previous study low dosage chlorination 40 mg min l even resulted in a 2 to 5 folds increase in the frequency of args conjugation guo et al 2015 in addition chlorine as an oxidant also reacts with other substances such as organic matters in waters or in cells which would inevitably lead to uneven chlorine concentration inside and outside the cell and in different parts of the cell while the heat conduction when heating and boiling is relatively uniform from these perspectives args removal by boiling has lower risks compared to chlorination 4 conclusions to reduce potential health risks caused by drinking water bar problem pou disinfection at the household level is warranted water boiling as the most prevalent means of treating water at home was investigated for its performance to remove args when dealing with the complex environmental flora boiling shows broad spectrum and high efficiency in inactivating bacteria and removing args which is significantly better than chlorination and pasteurization heating below 80 c will cause the release of args from bacterial cells but when the water temperature is higher than 90 c both intracellular and extracellular args get removed such finding also highlights the risk that low temperature pasteurization 80 c may promote the spread of bar in principle args removal by high temperature is achieved by denaturing dna which can effectively reduce the biological activity of dna and reduce the risk of hgt although water boiling is uneconomical in energy it is more thorough in removing and inactivating arb and args it is believed that with the progress of energy technology boiling this oriental drinking water disinfection tradition is still worth promoting in the future declaration of competing interest the authors

16421,microbial biofilms are ubiquitous within porous media and the dynamics of their growth influence surface and subsurface flow patterns which impacts the physical properties of porous media and large scale transport of solutes a two dimensional pore scale numerical model was used to evaluate the impact of biofilm induced flow heterogeneities on conservative transport our study integrates experimental biofilm images of paenibacillus 300a strain in a microfluidic device packed with cylindrical grains in a hexagonal distribution with mathematical modeling biofilm is represented as a synthetic porous structure with locally varying physical properties that honors the impact of biofilm on the porous medium we find that biofilm plays a major role in shaping the observed conservative transport dynamics by enhancing anomalous characteristics more specifically when biofilm is present the pore structure in our geometry becomes more spatially correlated we observe intermittent behavior in the lagrangian velocities that switches between fast transport periods and long trapping events our results suggest that intermittency enhances solute spreading in breakthrough curves which exhibit extreme anomalous slope at intermediate times and very marked late solute arrival due to solute retention the efficiency of solute retention by the biofilm is controlled by a transport regime which can extend the tailing in the concentration breakthrough curves these results indicate that solute retention by the biofilm exerts a strong control on conservative solute transport at pore scale a role that to date has not received enough attention keywords pore scale modeling anomalous transport biofilm solute retention 1 introduction microbial communities inhabit natural porous media attaching and growing within pores changing hydrodynamic flows that influence local nutrient transport and chemical gradients a sound understanding of the ecology of microorganisms in general and their impact on the porous media hydrodynamics in particular is key for the modeling and upscaling of environmental and industrial applications such as bioremediation of contaminated groundwater edwards and kjellerup 2013 singh et al 2006 supercritical co2 storage cunningham et al 2009 mitchell et al 2009 and petroleum production sen 2008 some bacterial communities produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to form biofilms in the presence of nutrients and moisture the eps matrix plays a major role in the biofilm growth while protecting the cells from their environment ginn et al 2002 the presence and growth of biofilms contribute to change in the physical and chemical properties of porous media for instance the growth of biofilms at the pore space can modify flow paths and velocities by inducing preferential channeling in the porous medium carrel et al 2018a orgogozo et al 2013 on the other hand biofilm decay and detachment have been identified as the cause of intermittent shifting in preferential flow paths bottero et al 2013 classical biofilm models in heterogeneous porous media are based on simplifying assumptions e g biofilm matrix impermeability constant biofilm density and solute transport inside biofilm occurring only via diffusion benioug et al 2017 bottero et al 2013 peszynska et al 2016 picioreanu et al 2000 pintelon et al 2012 such modeling assumptions are based on the consideration of biofilm as a separate homogeneous phase whose permeability and porosity can be neglected billings et al 2015 which disregards most of the complex features of biofilm growth and spatial organization a series of experimental works have found that biofilm structure is heterogeneous with pore and channels present bishop 1997 liu et al 2008 rosenthal et al 2018 moreover biofilm structure evolves in time changing hydrodynamic properties and thus modifying solute transport behavior in porous media ghanbari et al 2016 scheidweiler et al 2019 current understanding of biofilm behavior in porous environments is generally derived from microfluidic experiments as they can provide a unique platform to control flow and reduce the physicochemical complexity of natural porous media pousti et al 2019 many researchers have used homogeneous packing designs of equally or variable sized circular grains markov et al 2010 scheidweiler et al 2019 valiei et al 2012 the representation of granular obstacles in porous media using circular grains provides several advantages compared to real rock samples it is possible for example to test simple geometries that make it easier to generalize results to multiple porous media while the use of experimentally acquired real images provides representations with a high degree of arbitrariness perez et al 2020 puyguiraud et al 2020 most applications of microfluidic designs have focused on qualitative observations of the spatiotemporal properties of biofilms in porous media and only few works have attempted to mathematically simulate biofilm effects on flow dynamics and solute transport aufrecht et al 2019 landa marbán et al 2019 tian and wang 2019 the resulting mathematical models involve constant porosity karimifard et al 2020 and biofilm geometry simplification as a uniformly coated layer abbasi et al 2018 in this work we study the impact of biofilm induced heterogeneities on pore scale solute transport in porous media by numerical simulations in particular we focus on the signatures of anomalous transport caused by biofilm in the modification of local hydrodynamics solute retention and breakthrough curves btc our pore scale simulations are based on experimental observations of biofilms formed by paenibacillus strain 300a in a 2 dimensional porous medium characterized by equal grain obstacle size in a regular packing the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the research methodology detailing the microfluidic geometry bacteria cultivation image analysis of the biofilm and defines the transport problem under consideration and details the numerical simulations section 3 presents the simulation results and discusses solute retention induced by biofilm and their impact on btcs 2 methodology 2 1 microfluidic device the microfluidic device designed to serve as porous medium consists of 1350 cylindrical grains of equal diameter d 0 08 mm embedded between two parallel plates with size l x 12 mm in the longitudinal dimension main flow l y 2 mm in the transverse and vertical separation distance height h 0 02 mm the grains are distributed following a hexagonal packing to simulate a pore network environment with simple parabolic flow profiles the porous medium is characterized by a porosity ϕ 0 497 and pore length l p 0 02 mm the device was fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane pdms this material has several advantages for easy design adaptation and visualization kim et al 2008 raj m and chakraborty 2020 the geometry studied here is complementary to that presented by yang et al 2019 which allowed to study the motility of metal reducing bacteria in open porous media 2 2 biofilm cultivation paenibacillus strain 300a was cultured aerobically in liquid culture using tryptic soy broth medium without dextrose tsb dextrose cultures were grown overnight at 30 c with vigorous shaking and then diluted in tsb dextrose to a cell density that gave an optical density at 600 nm od600 of 0 15 after the removal of air bubbles in the porous medium the bacterial solution was inoculated into the packed device at a constant flow rate via tygon tubing with traps to prevent gas bubbles from entering the porous medium 2 3 image analysis biofilm geometry all biofilm images were collected with a confocal imaging technique on a nikon eclipse ti2 u inverted microscope equipped with a digital cmos camera hamamatsu orca flash 4 0 controlled by nis elements imaging software we scanned the central area of the entire microfluidic device at 20x magnification with 0 325 μ m pixel recording every hour a large image composed of 60 pictures as 4x1 tiles this region of the device was selected to accommodate the specifics of the microscopy method avoid interference from the inlet outlet of the device and ensure a balanced biofilm distribution hua et al 2015 to extract architectural information from biofilm areal coverage as a proxy of biomass we subtract the first image t 0 min from each successive images for background correction after image binarization we identify biofilm as the fraction of biomass in the voids over the total area note that our biofilm definition does not distinguish from base biofilm biofilm around a grain such that at least 35 of the area is covered and streamers drescher et al 2013 hassanpourfard et al 2015 scheidweiler et al 2019 we observe that streamers occurred as individual small clusters connected by eps filament thus in our analysis biofilm includes both the base biofilm and the streamers in this work the analysis of the impact of biofilm induced heterogeneities on solute transport is carried out by direct comparison of pore scale hydrodynamics in a section of dimensions l x 0 605 mm of length and l y 0 34 mm of width at t 0 minutes when no biofilm is developed and t 400 minutes when biofilm is in an stationary phase of growth phase iii in fig 3 inset plot by comparing the structural changes induced by biofilm growth in the microfluidic device at two different times we are able to provide direct access to pore scale velocity distributions and transport processes in a progressively bioclogged porous medium we calculate biofilm local porosity by converting the experimental image to a biomass local density map ρ b x averaged over the pixel size via the calibration procedure described in detail in de anna et al 2014 the methodology originally described to observe incomplete mixing in conservative and reactive transport experiments perez et al 2020 can be extended to obtain biofilm density from the measured light intensity of the images of the bacterial cells in short we first set up the background noise in the light intensity measurement without biofilm to 0 33 of the maximum pixel intensity value to smooth the biofilm density field then we subsequently normalize biofilm density in each pixel as the ratio of the light intensity detected with biofilm to the light intensity without biofilm this technique helps to reduce the error propagation in the biomass accumulation computation that stems from experimental observations of biofilms with blurry pixels latecki et al 1998 the porosity of biofilms ϕ by physical definition is defined as the fraction of a biofilm occupied by water outside the microbial cells zhang and bishop 1994 1 ϕ 1 v b v ω where v ω is the total pore volume that includes the volume of biofilm with water inside pores and volume of water outside the cells and v b is the biofilm volume including water inside the cells but excluding water outside the cells or in the main channels we provide a spatially resolved quantification of v b as 2 v b x ρ b x v ω 1 w b ρ w where ρ w is the water density and w b is an assumed water content inside the cells 80 internal cell water content was used in this study tchobanoglous and burton 1991 zhang and bishop 1994 generally microbial cells are 70 90 water by weight hu et al 2013 thus our 80 water content assumption is based on the fact that biofilm consists of a single homogeneous population although paenibacillus cells can have different ratios of phospholipid content to water content their populations are gram positive silhavy et al 2010 and usually can safely be considered to have ratios that follow normal distribution grady et al 2016 thus our assumption implies that the phospholipid measured is the mean of the population inside the biofilm accounting for differences in paenibacillus configuration moreover a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to other values of w b ranging from 70 to 90 and the resulting biofilm porosity were robust to variations as large as 8 the local dynamics of biofilm ϕ are controlled by the configuration of the cells when cells are adhered to each other biofilm porosity equals 0 and impermeable conditions are applied otherwise fluid flows through the biofilm in this work biofilm is considered a porous medium with porosity varying locally to capture the spatial variations in biofilm s ϕ x we create and insert a synthetic porous media of given pixel size with an overall ϕ equal to the porosity value of the corresponding pixel where biofilm is present the synthetic porous media is characterized by a random distribution of the size and position of circular grains we generate the grains by selecting their size and location from a uniform distribution we avoid superposition or overlapping of grains by setting 2 d min as the minimum distance between the placement of a new grain and any previously placed grain where d min is the diameter of the smallest grain the algorithm stops when the target porosity configuration is achieved if ϕ x 0 we insert a solid block in the corresponding pixel otherwise we insert the generated synthetic porous medium created with the targeted pixel porosity the purpose of the synthetic porous media to represent biofilm is to characterize the local geometric properties of the biofilm the biofilm heterogeneous geometry generated from the digitization of the laboratory image of the microfluidic device is shown in fig 1 the digitized images granular geometry and synthetic representation of biofilm are composed of 11180 19700 regular pixels that represent either void or solid and a regular hexaedron mesh compatible with openfoam is employed the mesh cells have a size of 3 05 10 8 m in all directions δ x δ y our synthetic representation closely resembles real biofilm structures and circumvents the assumption of simplified biofilm geometries in numerical models karimifard et al 2020 peszynska et al 2016 pintelon et al 2012 2 4 pore scale flow and transport we calculate the flow field by solving the stokes equations 3a v x 0 3b 2 v x 1 μ p x where v is the velocity vector m s p kg m s 2 is the fluid pressure and the viscosity μ 10 3 pa s the flow field is solved using the steady state solver for incompressible flow simplefoam that belongs to the open source code openfoam weller et al 1998 which uses a semi implicit method for pressure linked equations icardi et al 2014 we impose a constant flow rate q 5 5 10 10 m 3 s and constant pressure p 0 kg m s 2 at the inlet and outlet of the domain respectively no slip conditions were considered at the fluid solid grain interface in the porous geometry biofilm is considered a porous medium through which water can flow and no slip conditions are also considered at the fluid solid phase in the interior of the synthetic representation of the biofilm this assumption allows us to simulate fluid flow simultaneously in the biofilm domain and the pore space after convergence that is once the residual of the pressure and flow fields between two consecutive numerical iterations are smaller than a user defined criterion ϵ 10 9 we extract the complete velocity field the reynolds number used in all simulations defined as 4 r e ρ v l μ where v is the mean flow velocity and l is a characteristic length is less than 1 solute transport in the pore space of the porous medium is governed by the advection diffusion equation for a passive scalar c x t 5 c x t δ t v x t c x t d 2 c x t 0 solved numerically with the open source finite volume code scalartransportfoam where d m 2 s is the molecular diffusion coefficient the solute transport eq 5 is solved in fully eulerian way that provided an accurate discretization is robust dentz et al 2018 a sensitivity analysis of grid size and time step show 0 5 variations in the results when solving 5 the conservative solute transport scenario is characterized by the péclet number p e v l p 2 d v is the average flow velocity which measures the relative importance of diffusive and advective transport mechanisms over a length scale chosen here to be equal to the average pore length l p 20 μ m two microscopic péclet numbers p e 20 and 200 are imposed by tuning appropriately the molecular diffusion coefficient d in the simulations note that changing d in the p e chosen for the transport problem under consideration allow us to analyze the transport features under constant hydrodynamics the p e addressed in our analysis are relevant to biofilm coated porous media where biofilms modulate the local hydrodynamics and related mass transfer processes seymour et al 2004 we simulate the migration of a pulse line injection of a passive solute perpendicular to the mean flow direction at x 0 with a concentration c 0 that invades the porous medium which is initially solute free c x 0 0 the impact of biofilm induced heterogeneities on solute transport is characterized in terms of the solute concentration breakthrough curve computed from the solute flux passing through a line y axis perpendicular to the main flow direction at the outlet x l x as 6 f t x l x d y c x l x y t v x l x y d y v x l x y for simplicity we denote f t f t x l x in the following we analyze the solute transport dynamics and their origins in terms of spatial fluctuations of the pore scale flow velocity experienced by solute particles in the presence and absence of biofilm 2 5 particle tracking we discuss the contributions to anomalous transport of the biofilm presence and its origins by analyzing the velocity statistics experienced by solute particles our aim here is to gain understanding of the impact of biofilm on the pore scale transport mechanisms and understand pore scale solute motion from conservative particle tracking simulations the numerical solution of equation 5 for the random walk particle trajectories follows the discretized langevin equation perez et al 2021a 7 x t δ t x t v x t δ t 2 d δ t ξ t where x t is the position of the particles at time t the advective step during a time interval δ t 0 05 s requires the interpolation of the flow velocities that are defined at the faces of the finite voxels linear interpolation has been used for particle tracking in darcy scale heterogeneous flow fields on a routine basis pollock 1988 however the linear interpolation do not respect the no slip boundary condition at the void solid interface mostaghimi et al 2012 thus we replaced the linear by a quadratic velocity interpolation in the void voxels in contact with the solid voxels perez et al 2021b puyguiraud et al 2020 the ξ t is independent identically distributed gaussian random variables characterized by 0 mean and unit variance particle trajectories are simulated until they exit the medium the analysis of particle velocities along the flow streamlines is performed following two sampling methods isochronous and equidistant first the velocity time series v t i δ t i 0 where δ t is a constant time increment is obtained by isochronous sampling along a particle trajectory the v t inspection provides information on the temporal dynamics of the solute particles being retained in the biofilm phase and released to the pore space for instance isochronous velocity series in steady flow fields from heterogeneous porous media have been shown to display intermittency de anna et al 2014 puyguiraud et al 2019 the origin of this intermittent behavior lies in the spatial organization of the flow second the spatial velocity series v s i δ s where δ s is a constant space increment is obtained by equidistant sampling along particle trajectories the v s analysis independent of the magnitude since this velocity value does not impact the sampling distance provides information of the particles velocity correlation in the past analysis of the spatial lagrangian velocities in heterogeneous porous media showed that classical descriptions of particle velocities using markov processes in time fail because the low velocities are much more strongly correlated in time than the high velocities le borgne et al 2008a 2008b 3 results in this section we first discuss the contributions and influence of the biofilm presence on the statistical properties of the eulerian velocities and tortuosity of the flow field before we analyze the effect of biofilm induced heterogeneities on dynamical controls of anomalous transport and the shape of the concentration breakthrough curves f t 3 1 structural controls 3 1 1 velocity statistics and flow heterogeneity fig 2 shows the logarithm with base 10 of the flow velocity field normalized by the mean velocity v at t 0 no biofilm fig 2a and t 400 developed biofilm fig 2a minutes the comparison of the two hydrodynamic conditions at the two times shows that bacteria cause obstruction of the flow paths leading to creation of preferential flow paths and diversion of flow around the clogs this diversion of flow or reconfiguration of the porous network is quantified via the variance σ ν 2 of the logarithm ν l o g 10 v x of the flow speed the variance of the log speed for the geometry with no biofilm is σ ν 2 0 67 while with biofilm equals σ ν 2 1 21 the significant increase of the variance of the flow speed in the presence of biofilm reflects the formation of preferential flow paths of high velocities and also give insight into the increased probabilities associated with low velocities this observation is supported by directly inspecting the magnitude of the velocities inside the biofilm region which has an average value that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the one in the high mobility region thus in our simulation the presence of biofilm increases the pore scale spatial variability of the velocity field which amplifies the flow heterogeneities demonstrating the sensitivity of transport processes to small amounts of biofilm growth kone et al 2014 liu et al 2019 seymour et al 2004 we show the eulerian velocity probability density function pdf in fig 3 which we analyze in terms of the presence and absence of biofilm to understand the mechanisms of pore scale transport the eulerian velocity pdf is computed as volume weighted histogram over the entire pore space ω 8 p v 1 v ω ω d x δ v v x where v ω is the pore volume and v x is the velocity magnitude v x i u i x 2 where u i x is the velocity components of the flow field the presence of biofilm and the subsequent effective porosity reduction caused by its growth alters the average velocity in the system from v 1 1 10 4 m s at 0 minutes to v 1 8 10 4 m s at 400 minutes the structural change in the flow induced by the biofilm coverage combined with mass conservation of a system at constant flux explains the 65 increase in average pore velocity given that v q ϕ where q is the fixed darcy flux and ϕ is the effective porosity this finding is in agreement with other studies at the pore and darcy scale carrel et al 2018b karimifard et al 2020 seifert and engesgaard 2007 stoodley et al 1997 furthermore in the presence of biofilms fig 3 zones of near stagnant flows are formed within the biofilm occupied region causing an increase of probabilities associated with finding low velocities which would have environmental implications for conservative and reactive transport in natural porous media the time and spatial series of lagrangian velocities v t and v s along a trajectory of a particle injected in the same location in absence and in presence of biofilm are plotted as function of time fig 4 a and space fig 4b the temporal behavior of the time lagrangian velocity series fig 4a for a particle in the geometry without biofilm shows fluctuations around the mean velocity suggesting higher level stability of the flow field the observed behavior indicate that the mean velocity v is a good representation over the range of velocity values that the particle samples along the streamline followed on the other hand the time lagrangian velocity series in presence of biofilm shows an intermittent behavior that switches between an initial fast period to a trapping period by the biofilm structure until the particle finds a fast channel to reach the outlet here the intermittent behavior in the presence of biofilm notably prolongs the time that a particle needs to reach the outlet compared to its absence which is similar to the process governing increase in solute residence times that have been observed in dynamical gravel bed streams aubeneau et al 2016 the spatial lagrangian velocity series in the absence of biofilm fig 4b shows a similar behavior as the time lagrangian series fig 4a with fluctuations around the mean velocity with higher variability short episodes of low velocities v v 10 3 corresponds to low velocities near solid grains while in the presence of biofilm we are able to identify the same intermittent pattern observed in the time lagrangian series which shows that the initial fast period experienced by the particle in the time lagrangian series allowed the particle to travel almost half of the domain whereas the trapping event which lasts 80 of the time in the trajectory fig 4a corresponds to a biofilm trap in the second half of the domain before the particle exits the domain via a fast channel our analysis shows that in the absence of biofilm relatively uniform lagrangian velocities are observed which further leads to faster breakthrough due to the expected fast breakthrough arrival times are associated with lesser spreads aquino et al 2015 hakoun et al 2019 in the presence of biofilm intermittency patterns of fast behavior and trapping events result in substantial changes in velocity values that a particle can experience leading to late breakthroughs these observation have strong implications for the study of biogeochemical reactions and poses interesting questions to inform the development of upscaling methods in presence of biofilm structures where the velocity profile is highly heterogeneous 3 1 2 velocity correlation we determine the velocity autocorrelation function c s c v s c v 0 where c v is the velocity covariance function dentz et al 2016 to study spatial correlation an increase in spatial correlation is thought to be indicative of persistent fast velocities along trajectories and suggests the development of preferential flow channels de anna et al 2013 morales et al 2017 the autocorrelation function decreases rapidly in the presence and absence of biofilm and can be well represented by an exponential the oscilations observed in c s in fig 5 for the case of biofilm are attributed to alternation of pore throats and biofilm structures along particle trajectories these results imply that in the presence of biofilm the pore structure of the porous medium becomes more spatially correlated 3 2 transport controls we illustrate biofilm contribution to solute retention and anomalous transport features by discussing two numerical simulations carried out at p e 20 and p e 200 in the porous medium with biofilm as a reference scenario that is compared to the results obtained in the domain without the biofilm the impact of biofilm induced heterogeneities on the shape of the concentration btc f t is shown in fig 6 recall that the transport dynamics are evaluated here for an instantaneous injection of a line perpendicular to the direction of the flow for transport simulations in presence of the biofilm we also report two snapshots of the migrating solute for both p e captured after the instantaneous release at t 2 and 10 seconds in fig 7 the effect of biofilm presence on the transport dynamics is discussed first while the importance of the peclet number is addresed later 3 2 1 biofilm presence the analysis of the btcs fig 6 reveals the presence of a heavy tail indicative of solute retention by the biofilm and anomalous non fickian transport the results in fig 6 show increased spreading of the btcs in the presence of biofilm also while the btcs in the absence of biofilm are nearly symmetrical biofilm produces far more asymmetry and tailing this observation is in agreement with the above discussion of the lagrangian velocities the uniformity observed in the lagrangian velocities for the no biofilm case seem responsible for a more symmetrical and less spread out f t meanwhile intermittency patterns between fast behavior and trapping events in the biofilm case induces spreading and tailing in f t also one of the consequences of the porosity reduction caused by the biofilm and hence relatively immobile fluid is an enhancement in the extent of preferential flow as exhibited by early breakthrough concentration peak and late time tailing that cannot be adequately characterized by the classical advection diffusion equation in natural heterogeneous porous media berkowitz et al 2000 for all p e we observe two distinct tailing behaviours in f t under the presence of biofilm and after the concentration peak arrival an intermediate tail decays slower than in the absence of biofilm for p e 20 while for p e 200 the anomalous transport features are enhanced in the presence of the biofilm as shown in the extended decay of the intermediate tail note that the intermediate regime can described by a power law which is the result of the non uniform velocity profile in the pore space as discussed in more detail berkowitz et al 2006 the late time tail decay observed for both p e is attributed to solute release from the biofilm due to diffusion these findings are consistent with previous studies done on solute retention by biofilms in different substrates aubeneau et al 2016 bottacin busolin et al 2009 where it has been showed that biofilm growth causes solute retention and thus more tailing of the observed concentration btcs 3 2 2 influence of peclet number the influence of diffusion on the numerical simulations is studied by comparing the results from the different peclet fig 7 shows snapshots at t 2 s for p e 20 fig 7a and p e 200 fig 7c and t 10 s for p e 20 fig 7b and p e 200 fig 7d during the initial stage of the solute injection we observe solute storage features by the biofilm for both p e fig 7a and 7 c these may include solute storage in biofilm pores and behind biofilm streamers and in low velocity zones in this sense the overall statistics of the residence times in the storage zones mentioned can be enhanced by the establishment of biofilms once the storage zones are filled the efficiency of the solute retention is tied to p e and thus to diffusion we observe that the retention of solute in the biofilm region at t 10 s becomes almost negligible for p e 20 because the diffusive mechanisms attenuates the velocity fluctuations experienced by the solute which implies that the solute that was retained by the biofilm are then released back towards the main channels in the porous medium fig 7b diffusion allows solutes to sample the velocity profile within a pore dentz and carrera 2007 perez et al 2019 and consequently reduces the skewness of the btc fig 8 solute retention becomes important at t 10 s for the higher p e 200 as shown in fig 7d which displays solute concentrations within the biofilm near the inlet which are later released into the preferential channels this late stage solute release is limited by the diffusive transport in the low velocity regions within the biofilm and is responsible for the heavy tail observed in the btc curve characteristic of increased anomalous transport fig 8 aquino et al 2015 edery et al 2014 note that the extent of long term retention in slower immobile parts of the flow domain is also impacted by biofilm presence or colonization our simulations indicate that biofilm growth induces structural changes in the pore geometry that affect the medium s physical properties ı e porosity and the nature of transport in porous media leading to an increase of anomalous transport caused by solute retention within the biofilm region these findings highlight the importance of our approach to model biofilm phases which traditionally have been treated as an impermeable media 4 conclusions we study the impact of biofilm induced flow heterogeneities on pore scale conservative transport our numerical experiments show that biofilm presence modifies the porous medium properties in particular we demonstrate that the presence of biofilm increases solute spreading and also long term solute retention the enhancement to the degree of heterogeneity of the velocity field suggests that the presence of biofilm in natural environments would reduce solute mobility compared with transport in porous medium in the absence of biofilm to our knowledge a systematic study of the influence biofilms on solute transport via the integration of laboratory experimental images of biofilm and mathematical modeling is novel and has not been explored previously while previous studies have addressed biofilm induced dispersion and modifications of the hydrodynamics properties the modeling assumptions are based on impermeable characterization of biofilms peszynska et al 2016 our biofilm synthetic geometry is a representation of experimentally obtained images and our approach considers the biofilm as a porous medium where fluid flows within allowing for a detailed study of the impact of biofilms on flow pathways biofilms add a layer of biological microstructures on the physical medium aubeneau et al 2016 and the fluid that travels through these microstructures experiences local velocities that are orders of magnitude slower than those in the main channels thus biofilms create conditions for enhanced anomalous transport by modifying the structural controls of porous media the anomalous transport features observed are attributed to the biofilm modification of the porous medium which renders the geometry more complex and enhances the heterogeneity of the velocity field these heterogeneities are then directly responsible for the complex transport properties that arise by promoting intermittency patterns between fast transport and long trapping events in addition we find that in the presence of biofilm the pore structure of the porous medium becomes more spatially correlated the biofilm represents an additional solute storage zone that induces broader btcs in comparison to geometries without biofilm breakthrough curves exhibit extreme anomalous slope at intermediate times and very marked late solute arrivals due to solute retention in low velocity and stagnation zones moreover the influence of different transport regimes play a major role in the efficiency of solute retention by the biofilm we observe that at early times solute is stored in the biofilm due to diffusion of the flowing solute into the biofilm pores consequently the diffusive mechanisms control the extent of the btc heavy tails we stress the importance of the modeling assumption of the biofilm phases and its careful analysis for upscaled transport models e g dual permeability system and multi rate mass transfer limitations of traditional models are often hidden in the mathematics this work presents an alternative to traditional methods of inferring biofilm in porous media and highlights its impact on enhancing anomalous transport features the applicability of our approach is independent of the physical and experimental setup however careful analysis followed by experiments is necessary to verify and validate our modeling strategy declaration of competing interest i want to state that my co

experimental biofilm images of paenibacillus 300a strain in a microfluidic device packed with cylindrical grains in a hexagonal distribution with mathematical modeling biofilm is represented as a synthetic porous structure with locally varying physical properties that honors the impact of biofilm on the porous medium we find that biofilm plays a major role in shaping the observed conservative transport dynamics by enhancing anomalous characteristics more specifically when biofilm is present the pore structure in our geometry becomes more spatially correlated we observe intermittent behavior in the lagrangian velocities that switches between fast transport periods and long trapping events our results suggest that intermittency enhances solute spreading in breakthrough curves which exhibit extreme anomalous slope at intermediate times and very marked late solute arrival due to solute retention the efficiency of solute retention by the biofilm is controlled by a transport regime which can extend the tailing in the concentration breakthrough curves these results indicate that solute retention by the biofilm exerts a strong control on conservative solute transport at pore scale a role that to date has not received enough attention keywords pore scale modeling anomalous transport biofilm solute retention 1 introduction microbial communities inhabit natural porous media attaching and growing within pores changing hydrodynamic flows that influence local nutrient transport and chemical gradients a sound understanding of the ecology of microorganisms in general and their impact on the porous media hydrodynamics in particular is key for the modeling and upscaling of environmental and industrial applications such as bioremediation of contaminated groundwater edwards and kjellerup 2013 singh et al 2006 supercritical co2 storage cunningham et al 2009 mitchell et al 2009 and petroleum production sen 2008 some bacterial communities produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to form biofilms in the presence of nutrients and moisture the eps matrix plays a major role in the biofilm growth while protecting the cells from their environment ginn et al 2002 the presence and growth of biofilms contribute to change in the physical and chemical properties of porous media for instance the growth of biofilms at the pore space can modify flow paths and velocities by inducing preferential channeling in the porous medium carrel et al 2018a orgogozo et al 2013 on the other hand biofilm decay and detachment have been identified as the cause of intermittent shifting in preferential flow paths bottero et al 2013 classical biofilm models in heterogeneous porous media are based on simplifying assumptions e g biofilm matrix impermeability constant biofilm density and solute transport inside biofilm occurring only via diffusion benioug et al 2017 bottero et al 2013 peszynska et al 2016 picioreanu et al 2000 pintelon et al 2012 such modeling assumptions are based on the consideration of biofilm as a separate homogeneous phase whose permeability and porosity can be neglected billings et al 2015 which disregards most of the complex features of biofilm growth and spatial organization a series of experimental works have found that biofilm structure is heterogeneous with pore and channels present bishop 1997 liu et al 2008 rosenthal et al 2018 moreover biofilm structure evolves in time changing hydrodynamic properties and thus modifying solute transport behavior in porous media ghanbari et al 2016 scheidweiler et al 2019 current understanding of biofilm behavior in porous environments is generally derived from microfluidic experiments as they can provide a unique platform to control flow and reduce the physicochemical complexity of natural porous media pousti et al 2019 many researchers have used homogeneous packing designs of equally or variable sized circular grains markov et al 2010 scheidweiler et al 2019 valiei et al 2012 the representation of granular obstacles in porous media using circular grains provides several advantages compared to real rock samples it is possible for example to test simple geometries that make it easier to generalize results to multiple porous media while the use of experimentally acquired real images provides representations with a high degree of arbitrariness perez et al 2020 puyguiraud et al 2020 most applications of microfluidic designs have focused on qualitative observations of the spatiotemporal properties of biofilms in porous media and only few works have attempted to mathematically simulate biofilm effects on flow dynamics and solute transport aufrecht et al 2019 landa marbán et al 2019 tian and wang 2019 the resulting mathematical models involve constant porosity karimifard et al 2020 and biofilm geometry simplification as a uniformly coated layer abbasi et al 2018 in this work we study the impact of biofilm induced heterogeneities on pore scale solute transport in porous media by numerical simulations in particular we focus on the signatures of anomalous transport caused by biofilm in the modification of local hydrodynamics solute retention and breakthrough curves btc our pore scale simulations are based on experimental observations of biofilms formed by paenibacillus strain 300a in a 2 dimensional porous medium characterized by equal grain obstacle size in a regular packing the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the research methodology detailing the microfluidic geometry bacteria cultivation image analysis of the biofilm and defines the transport problem under consideration and details the numerical simulations section 3 presents the simulation results and discusses solute retention induced by biofilm and their impact on btcs 2 methodology 2 1 microfluidic device the microfluidic device designed to serve as porous medium consists of 1350 cylindrical grains of equal diameter d 0 08 mm embedded between two parallel plates with size l x 12 mm in the longitudinal dimension main flow l y 2 mm in the transverse and vertical separation distance height h 0 02 mm the grains are distributed following a hexagonal packing to simulate a pore network environment with simple parabolic flow profiles the porous medium is characterized by a porosity ϕ 0 497 and pore length l p 0 02 mm the device was fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane pdms this material has several advantages for easy design adaptation and visualization kim et al 2008 raj m and chakraborty 2020 the geometry studied here is complementary to that presented by yang et al 2019 which allowed to study the motility of metal reducing bacteria in open porous media 2 2 biofilm cultivation paenibacillus strain 300a was cultured aerobically in liquid culture using tryptic soy broth medium without dextrose tsb dextrose cultures were grown overnight at 30 c with vigorous shaking and then diluted in tsb dextrose to a cell density that gave an optical density at 600 nm od600 of 0 15 after the removal of air bubbles in the porous medium the bacterial solution was inoculated into the packed device at a constant flow rate via tygon tubing with traps to prevent gas bubbles from entering the porous medium 2 3 image analysis biofilm geometry all biofilm images were collected with a confocal imaging technique on a nikon eclipse ti2 u inverted microscope equipped with a digital cmos camera hamamatsu orca flash 4 0 controlled by nis elements imaging software we scanned the central area of the entire microfluidic device at 20x magnification with 0 325 μ m pixel recording every hour a large image composed of 60 pictures as 4x1 tiles this region of the device was selected to accommodate the specifics of the microscopy method avoid interference from the inlet outlet of the device and ensure a balanced biofilm distribution hua et al 2015 to extract architectural information from biofilm areal coverage as a proxy of biomass we subtract the first image t 0 min from each successive images for background correction after image binarization we identify biofilm as the fraction of biomass in the voids over the total area note that our biofilm definition does not distinguish from base biofilm biofilm around a grain such that at least 35 of the area is covered and streamers drescher et al 2013 hassanpourfard et al 2015 scheidweiler et al 2019 we observe that streamers occurred as individual small clusters connected by eps filament thus in our analysis biofilm includes both the base biofilm and the streamers in this work the analysis of the impact of biofilm induced heterogeneities on solute transport is carried out by direct comparison of pore scale hydrodynamics in a section of dimensions l x 0 605 mm of length and l y 0 34 mm of width at t 0 minutes when no biofilm is developed and t 400 minutes when biofilm is in an stationary phase of growth phase iii in fig 3 inset plot by comparing the structural changes induced by biofilm growth in the microfluidic device at two different times we are able to provide direct access to pore scale velocity distributions and transport processes in a progressively bioclogged porous medium we calculate biofilm local porosity by converting the experimental image to a biomass local density map ρ b x averaged over the pixel size via the calibration procedure described in detail in de anna et al 2014 the methodology originally described to observe incomplete mixing in conservative and reactive transport experiments perez et al 2020 can be extended to obtain biofilm density from the measured light intensity of the images of the bacterial cells in short we first set up the background noise in the light intensity measurement without biofilm to 0 33 of the maximum pixel intensity value to smooth the biofilm density field then we subsequently normalize biofilm density in each pixel as the ratio of the light intensity detected with biofilm to the light intensity without biofilm this technique helps to reduce the error propagation in the biomass accumulation computation that stems from experimental observations of biofilms with blurry pixels latecki et al 1998 the porosity of biofilms ϕ by physical definition is defined as the fraction of a biofilm occupied by water outside the microbial cells zhang and bishop 1994 1 ϕ 1 v b v ω where v ω is the total pore volume that includes the volume of biofilm with water inside pores and volume of water outside the cells and v b is the biofilm volume including water inside the cells but excluding water outside the cells or in the main channels we provide a spatially resolved quantification of v b as 2 v b x ρ b x v ω 1 w b ρ w where ρ w is the water density and w b is an assumed water content inside the cells 80 internal cell water content was used in this study tchobanoglous and burton 1991 zhang and bishop 1994 generally microbial cells are 70 90 water by weight hu et al 2013 thus our 80 water content assumption is based on the fact that biofilm consists of a single homogeneous population although paenibacillus cells can have different ratios of phospholipid content to water content their populations are gram positive silhavy et al 2010 and usually can safely be considered to have ratios that follow normal distribution grady et al 2016 thus our assumption implies that the phospholipid measured is the mean of the population inside the biofilm accounting for differences in paenibacillus configuration moreover a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to other values of w b ranging from 70 to 90 and the resulting biofilm porosity were robust to variations as large as 8 the local dynamics of biofilm ϕ are controlled by the configuration of the cells when cells are adhered to each other biofilm porosity equals 0 and impermeable conditions are applied otherwise fluid flows through the biofilm in this work biofilm is considered a porous medium with porosity varying locally to capture the spatial variations in biofilm s ϕ x we create and insert a synthetic porous media of given pixel size with an overall ϕ equal to the porosity value of the corresponding pixel where biofilm is present the synthetic porous media is characterized by a random distribution of the size and position of circular grains we generate the grains by selecting their size and location from a uniform distribution we avoid superposition or overlapping of grains by setting 2 d min as the minimum distance between the placement of a new grain and any previously placed grain where d min is the diameter of the smallest grain the algorithm stops when the target porosity configuration is achieved if ϕ x 0 we insert a solid block in the corresponding pixel otherwise we insert the generated synthetic porous medium created with the targeted pixel porosity the purpose of the synthetic porous media to represent biofilm is to characterize the local geometric properties of the biofilm the biofilm heterogeneous geometry generated from the digitization of the laboratory image of the microfluidic device is shown in fig 1 the digitized images granular geometry and synthetic representation of biofilm are composed of 11180 19700 regular pixels that represent either void or solid and a regular hexaedron mesh compatible with openfoam is employed the mesh cells have a size of 3 05 10 8 m in all directions δ x δ y our synthetic representation closely resembles real biofilm structures and circumvents the assumption of simplified biofilm geometries in numerical models karimifard et al 2020 peszynska et al 2016 pintelon et al 2012 2 4 pore scale flow and transport we calculate the flow field by solving the stokes equations 3a v x 0 3b 2 v x 1 μ p x where v is the velocity vector m s p kg m s 2 is the fluid pressure and the viscosity μ 10 3 pa s the flow field is solved using the steady state solver for incompressible flow simplefoam that belongs to the open source code openfoam weller et al 1998 which uses a semi implicit method for pressure linked equations icardi et al 2014 we impose a constant flow rate q 5 5 10 10 m 3 s and constant pressure p 0 kg m s 2 at the inlet and outlet of the domain respectively no slip conditions were considered at the fluid solid grain interface in the porous geometry biofilm is considered a porous medium through which water can flow and no slip conditions are also considered at the fluid solid phase in the interior of the synthetic representation of the biofilm this assumption allows us to simulate fluid flow simultaneously in the biofilm domain and the pore space after convergence that is once the residual of the pressure and flow fields between two consecutive numerical iterations are smaller than a user defined criterion ϵ 10 9 we extract the complete velocity field the reynolds number used in all simulations defined as 4 r e ρ v l μ where v is the mean flow velocity and l is a characteristic length is less than 1 solute transport in the pore space of the porous medium is governed by the advection diffusion equation for a passive scalar c x t 5 c x t δ t v x t c x t d 2 c x t 0 solved numerically with the open source finite volume code scalartransportfoam where d m 2 s is the molecular diffusion coefficient the solute transport eq 5 is solved in fully eulerian way that provided an accurate discretization is robust dentz et al 2018 a sensitivity analysis of grid size and time step show 0 5 variations in the results when solving 5 the conservative solute transport scenario is characterized by the péclet number p e v l p 2 d v is the average flow velocity which measures the relative importance of diffusive and advective transport mechanisms over a length scale chosen here to be equal to the average pore length l p 20 μ m two microscopic péclet numbers p e 20 and 200 are imposed by tuning appropriately the molecular diffusion coefficient d in the simulations note that changing d in the p e chosen for the transport problem under consideration allow us to analyze the transport features under constant hydrodynamics the p e addressed in our analysis are relevant to biofilm coated porous media where biofilms modulate the local hydrodynamics and related mass transfer processes seymour et al 2004 we simulate the migration of a pulse line injection of a passive solute perpendicular to the mean flow direction at x 0 with a concentration c 0 that invades the porous medium which is initially solute free c x 0 0 the impact of biofilm induced heterogeneities on solute transport is characterized in terms of the solute concentration breakthrough curve computed from the solute flux passing through a line y axis perpendicular to the main flow direction at the outlet x l x as 6 f t x l x d y c x l x y t v x l x y d y v x l x y for simplicity we denote f t f t x l x in the following we analyze the solute transport dynamics and their origins in terms of spatial fluctuations of the pore scale flow velocity experienced by solute particles in the presence and absence of biofilm 2 5 particle tracking we discuss the contributions to anomalous transport of the biofilm presence and its origins by analyzing the velocity statistics experienced by solute particles our aim here is to gain understanding of the impact of biofilm on the pore scale transport mechanisms and understand pore scale solute motion from conservative particle tracking simulations the numerical solution of equation 5 for the random walk particle trajectories follows the discretized langevin equation perez et al 2021a 7 x t δ t x t v x t δ t 2 d δ t ξ t where x t is the position of the particles at time t the advective step during a time interval δ t 0 05 s requires the interpolation of the flow velocities that are defined at the faces of the finite voxels linear interpolation has been used for particle tracking in darcy scale heterogeneous flow fields on a routine basis pollock 1988 however the linear interpolation do not respect the no slip boundary condition at the void solid interface mostaghimi et al 2012 thus we replaced the linear by a quadratic velocity interpolation in the void voxels in contact with the solid voxels perez et al 2021b puyguiraud et al 2020 the ξ t is independent identically distributed gaussian random variables characterized by 0 mean and unit variance particle trajectories are simulated until they exit the medium the analysis of particle velocities along the flow streamlines is performed following two sampling methods isochronous and equidistant first the velocity time series v t i δ t i 0 where δ t is a constant time increment is obtained by isochronous sampling along a particle trajectory the v t inspection provides information on the temporal dynamics of the solute particles being retained in the biofilm phase and released to the pore space for instance isochronous velocity series in steady flow fields from heterogeneous porous media have been shown to display intermittency de anna et al 2014 puyguiraud et al 2019 the origin of this intermittent behavior lies in the spatial organization of the flow second the spatial velocity series v s i δ s where δ s is a constant space increment is obtained by equidistant sampling along particle trajectories the v s analysis independent of the magnitude since this velocity value does not impact the sampling distance provides information of the particles velocity correlation in the past analysis of the spatial lagrangian velocities in heterogeneous porous media showed that classical descriptions of particle velocities using markov processes in time fail because the low velocities are much more strongly correlated in time than the high velocities le borgne et al 2008a 2008b 3 results in this section we first discuss the contributions and influence of the biofilm presence on the statistical properties of the eulerian velocities and tortuosity of the flow field before we analyze the effect of biofilm induced heterogeneities on dynamical controls of anomalous transport and the shape of the concentration breakthrough curves f t 3 1 structural controls 3 1 1 velocity statistics and flow heterogeneity fig 2 shows the logarithm with base 10 of the flow velocity field normalized by the mean velocity v at t 0 no biofilm fig 2a and t 400 developed biofilm fig 2a minutes the comparison of the two hydrodynamic conditions at the two times shows that bacteria cause obstruction of the flow paths leading to creation of preferential flow paths and diversion of flow around the clogs this diversion of flow or reconfiguration of the porous network is quantified via the variance σ ν 2 of the logarithm ν l o g 10 v x of the flow speed the variance of the log speed for the geometry with no biofilm is σ ν 2 0 67 while with biofilm equals σ ν 2 1 21 the significant increase of the variance of the flow speed in the presence of biofilm reflects the formation of preferential flow paths of high velocities and also give insight into the increased probabilities associated with low velocities this observation is supported by directly inspecting the magnitude of the velocities inside the biofilm region which has an average value that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the one in the high mobility region thus in our simulation the presence of biofilm increases the pore scale spatial variability of the velocity field which amplifies the flow heterogeneities demonstrating the sensitivity of transport processes to small amounts of biofilm growth kone et al 2014 liu et al 2019 seymour et al 2004 we show the eulerian velocity probability density function pdf in fig 3 which we analyze in terms of the presence and absence of biofilm to understand the mechanisms of pore scale transport the eulerian velocity pdf is computed as volume weighted histogram over the entire pore space ω 8 p v 1 v ω ω d x δ v v x where v ω is the pore volume and v x is the velocity magnitude v x i u i x 2 where u i x is the velocity components of the flow field the presence of biofilm and the subsequent effective porosity reduction caused by its growth alters the average velocity in the system from v 1 1 10 4 m s at 0 minutes to v 1 8 10 4 m s at 400 minutes the structural change in the flow induced by the biofilm coverage combined with mass conservation of a system at constant flux explains the 65 increase in average pore velocity given that v q ϕ where q is the fixed darcy flux and ϕ is the effective porosity this finding is in agreement with other studies at the pore and darcy scale carrel et al 2018b karimifard et al 2020 seifert and engesgaard 2007 stoodley et al 1997 furthermore in the presence of biofilms fig 3 zones of near stagnant flows are formed within the biofilm occupied region causing an increase of probabilities associated with finding low velocities which would have environmental implications for conservative and reactive transport in natural porous media the time and spatial series of lagrangian velocities v t and v s along a trajectory of a particle injected in the same location in absence and in presence of biofilm are plotted as function of time fig 4 a and space fig 4b the temporal behavior of the time lagrangian velocity series fig 4a for a particle in the geometry without biofilm shows fluctuations around the mean velocity suggesting higher level stability of the flow field the observed behavior indicate that the mean velocity v is a good representation over the range of velocity values that the particle samples along the streamline followed on the other hand the time lagrangian velocity series in presence of biofilm shows an intermittent behavior that switches between an initial fast period to a trapping period by the biofilm structure until the particle finds a fast channel to reach the outlet here the intermittent behavior in the presence of biofilm notably prolongs the time that a particle needs to reach the outlet compared to its absence which is similar to the process governing increase in solute residence times that have been observed in dynamical gravel bed streams aubeneau et al 2016 the spatial lagrangian velocity series in the absence of biofilm fig 4b shows a similar behavior as the time lagrangian series fig 4a with fluctuations around the mean velocity with higher variability short episodes of low velocities v v 10 3 corresponds to low velocities near solid grains while in the presence of biofilm we are able to identify the same intermittent pattern observed in the time lagrangian series which shows that the initial fast period experienced by the particle in the time lagrangian series allowed the particle to travel almost half of the domain whereas the trapping event which lasts 80 of the time in the trajectory fig 4a corresponds to a biofilm trap in the second half of the domain before the particle exits the domain via a fast channel our analysis shows that in the absence of biofilm relatively uniform lagrangian velocities are observed which further leads to faster breakthrough due to the expected fast breakthrough arrival times are associated with lesser spreads aquino et al 2015 hakoun et al 2019 in the presence of biofilm intermittency patterns of fast behavior and trapping events result in substantial changes in velocity values that a particle can experience leading to late breakthroughs these observation have strong implications for the study of biogeochemical reactions and poses interesting questions to inform the development of upscaling methods in presence of biofilm structures where the velocity profile is highly heterogeneous 3 1 2 velocity correlation we determine the velocity autocorrelation function c s c v s c v 0 where c v is the velocity covariance function dentz et al 2016 to study spatial correlation an increase in spatial correlation is thought to be indicative of persistent fast velocities along trajectories and suggests the development of preferential flow channels de anna et al 2013 morales et al 2017 the autocorrelation function decreases rapidly in the presence and absence of biofilm and can be well represented by an exponential the oscilations observed in c s in fig 5 for the case of biofilm are attributed to alternation of pore throats and biofilm structures along particle trajectories these results imply that in the presence of biofilm the pore structure of the porous medium becomes more spatially correlated 3 2 transport controls we illustrate biofilm contribution to solute retention and anomalous transport features by discussing two numerical simulations carried out at p e 20 and p e 200 in the porous medium with biofilm as a reference scenario that is compared to the results obtained in the domain without the biofilm the impact of biofilm induced heterogeneities on the shape of the concentration btc f t is shown in fig 6 recall that the transport dynamics are evaluated here for an instantaneous injection of a line perpendicular to the direction of the flow for transport simulations in presence of the biofilm we also report two snapshots of the migrating solute for both p e captured after the instantaneous release at t 2 and 10 seconds in fig 7 the effect of biofilm presence on the transport dynamics is discussed first while the importance of the peclet number is addresed later 3 2 1 biofilm presence the analysis of the btcs fig 6 reveals the presence of a heavy tail indicative of solute retention by the biofilm and anomalous non fickian transport the results in fig 6 show increased spreading of the btcs in the presence of biofilm also while the btcs in the absence of biofilm are nearly symmetrical biofilm produces far more asymmetry and tailing this observation is in agreement with the above discussion of the lagrangian velocities the uniformity observed in the lagrangian velocities for the no biofilm case seem responsible for a more symmetrical and less spread out f t meanwhile intermittency patterns between fast behavior and trapping events in the biofilm case induces spreading and tailing in f t also one of the consequences of the porosity reduction caused by the biofilm and hence relatively immobile fluid is an enhancement in the extent of preferential flow as exhibited by early breakthrough concentration peak and late time tailing that cannot be adequately characterized by the classical advection diffusion equation in natural heterogeneous porous media berkowitz et al 2000 for all p e we observe two distinct tailing behaviours in f t under the presence of biofilm and after the concentration peak arrival an intermediate tail decays slower than in the absence of biofilm for p e 20 while for p e 200 the anomalous transport features are enhanced in the presence of the biofilm as shown in the extended decay of the intermediate tail note that the intermediate regime can described by a power law which is the result of the non uniform velocity profile in the pore space as discussed in more detail berkowitz et al 2006 the late time tail decay observed for both p e is attributed to solute release from the biofilm due to diffusion these findings are consistent with previous studies done on solute retention by biofilms in different substrates aubeneau et al 2016 bottacin busolin et al 2009 where it has been showed that biofilm growth causes solute retention and thus more tailing of the observed concentration btcs 3 2 2 influence of peclet number the influence of diffusion on the numerical simulations is studied by comparing the results from the different peclet fig 7 shows snapshots at t 2 s for p e 20 fig 7a and p e 200 fig 7c and t 10 s for p e 20 fig 7b and p e 200 fig 7d during the initial stage of the solute injection we observe solute storage features by the biofilm for both p e fig 7a and 7 c these may include solute storage in biofilm pores and behind biofilm streamers and in low velocity zones in this sense the overall statistics of the residence times in the storage zones mentioned can be enhanced by the establishment of biofilms once the storage zones are filled the efficiency of the solute retention is tied to p e and thus to diffusion we observe that the retention of solute in the biofilm region at t 10 s becomes almost negligible for p e 20 because the diffusive mechanisms attenuates the velocity fluctuations experienced by the solute which implies that the solute that was retained by the biofilm are then released back towards the main channels in the porous medium fig 7b diffusion allows solutes to sample the velocity profile within a pore dentz and carrera 2007 perez et al 2019 and consequently reduces the skewness of the btc fig 8 solute retention becomes important at t 10 s for the higher p e 200 as shown in fig 7d which displays solute concentrations within the biofilm near the inlet which are later released into the preferential channels this late stage solute release is limited by the diffusive transport in the low velocity regions within the biofilm and is responsible for the heavy tail observed in the btc curve characteristic of increased anomalous transport fig 8 aquino et al 2015 edery et al 2014 note that the extent of long term retention in slower immobile parts of the flow domain is also impacted by biofilm presence or colonization our simulations indicate that biofilm growth induces structural changes in the pore geometry that affect the medium s physical properties ı e porosity and the nature of transport in porous media leading to an increase of anomalous transport caused by solute retention within the biofilm region these findings highlight the importance of our approach to model biofilm phases which traditionally have been treated as an impermeable media 4 conclusions we study the impact of biofilm induced flow heterogeneities on pore scale conservative transport our numerical experiments show that biofilm presence modifies the porous medium properties in particular we demonstrate that the presence of biofilm increases solute spreading and also long term solute retention the enhancement to the degree of heterogeneity of the velocity field suggests that the presence of biofilm in natural environments would reduce solute mobility compared with transport in porous medium in the absence of biofilm to our knowledge a systematic study of the influence biofilms on solute transport via the integration of laboratory experimental images of biofilm and mathematical modeling is novel and has not been explored previously while previous studies have addressed biofilm induced dispersion and modifications of the hydrodynamics properties the modeling assumptions are based on impermeable characterization of biofilms peszynska et al 2016 our biofilm synthetic geometry is a representation of experimentally obtained images and our approach considers the biofilm as a porous medium where fluid flows within allowing for a detailed study of the impact of biofilms on flow pathways biofilms add a layer of biological microstructures on the physical medium aubeneau et al 2016 and the fluid that travels through these microstructures experiences local velocities that are orders of magnitude slower than those in the main channels thus biofilms create conditions for enhanced anomalous transport by modifying the structural controls of porous media the anomalous transport features observed are attributed to the biofilm modification of the porous medium which renders the geometry more complex and enhances the heterogeneity of the velocity field these heterogeneities are then directly responsible for the complex transport properties that arise by promoting intermittency patterns between fast transport and long trapping events in addition we find that in the presence of biofilm the pore structure of the porous medium becomes more spatially correlated the biofilm represents an additional solute storage zone that induces broader btcs in comparison to geometries without biofilm breakthrough curves exhibit extreme anomalous slope at intermediate times and very marked late solute arrivals due to solute retention in low velocity and stagnation zones moreover the influence of different transport regimes play a major role in the efficiency of solute retention by the biofilm we observe that at early times solute is stored in the biofilm due to diffusion of the flowing solute into the biofilm pores consequently the diffusive mechanisms control the extent of the btc heavy tails we stress the importance of the modeling assumption of the biofilm phases and its careful analysis for upscaled transport models e g dual permeability system and multi rate mass transfer limitations of traditional models are often hidden in the mathematics this work presents an alternative to traditional methods of inferring biofilm in porous media and highlights its impact on enhancing anomalous transport features the applicability of our approach is independent of the physical and experimental setup however careful analysis followed by experiments is necessary to verify and validate our modeling strategy declaration of competing interest i want to state that my co

indicators covering the three dimensions of environment economics and society to examine grassland degradation in imar for the environmental dimension water footprint and food footprint were used for the economic dimension gdp household income built up area and energy consumption were selected for the social dimension the gini coefficient and human development index hdi were chosen shang et al 2019 in shang s paper these indicators were plotted as line graphs from 1987 to 2015 and descriptively analyzed to find how they changed by years between 1987 and 2015 the findings revealed that water resource use in imar increased fourfold energy consumption increased approximately seven fold and large areas of natural grasslands were converted to agricultural industrial and urban land use the third group consists of a collection of newly developed modeling paradigms and machine learning techniques in watershed studies a coupled wavelet random forest algorithm is developed to improve evapotranspiration estimation accuracy shiri 2018 an increasing number of artificial intelligence ai based models have been reported for forecasting stream water flow yaseen et al 2015 various machine learning methods such as adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems support vector machines and the least absolute shrinkage selector operator have been applied to traditional numerical models to simulate soil water content data karandish šimůnek 2016 sarigai et al 2021 multi agent based models have also been integrated to study water scarcity and related issues a well known multi agent modeling framework is envision which simulates landscape change dynamics by incorporating decision maker s values and behaviors concerning the landscape mills et al 2018 in addition the integration of gis geographic information systems and statistical analysis is widespread in current literature for instance the impacts of land use topography and socioeconomic factors on river water quality is examined through gis geographic information systems chen and lu 2014 applied several statistical methods such as analysis of variance principal component analysis pearson correlations multiple regression analysis and redundancy analysis to explore the temporal and spatial variations of the influences of these factors on water quality chen and lu 2014 analyzed temporal variations of 36 water quality samples collected at 20 sampling sites along one local river from july 2003 to june 2006 however there was no discussion on why the five statistical analyses were adopted and what unique insight was obtained from each analysis the fourth group emphasizes qualitative causal analysis of water stresses under different policy interferences and management scenarios public policies collective decisions and individual preferences interact with environmental conditions and socioeconomic backgrounds affecting watershed environments their interactions and feedbacks can be described through synthetic indicators singh et al 2009 the causal framework called dpsir driving forces pressures states impacts and responses smeets and weterings 1999 was adapted to analyze the causalities between these indicators for the oasis sustainability management in tunisia mekki et al 2013 the tunisia case study used line charts and scatter plots to examine the relationship between groundwater degradation and other causal factors such as illicit pumped wells illicit oases water salinity total dissolved solids etc the causal analysis was descriptive and the data analysis was direct visualization of the observed data this dpsir framework was later quantified to examine socioeconomic influences on biodiversity ecosystem services and human well being in china s jiangsu province hou et al 2014 this quantified dpsir model established a set of socioeconomic indicators matching the dpsir conceptual framework concerning biodiversity ecosystem services and human well being it applied statistical factor analysis to compute factor scores for the dpsir sectors in the study it then used the variance contribution rates of the extracted principal components of the factor analysis to compute standardized scores of each dpsir sector finally it calculated spearman correlation coefficients between the standardized scores of every pair of dpsir sectors to describe the quantitative linkage between the dpsir sectors these qualitative analyses are most comprehensive in considering various ecological environmental socioeconomic policy and management factors in brief current studies on the impacts of climate change lulc socioeconomic development and policy influence on watershed environments have the following features 1 focusing on the impacts of climate change and lulc 2 confining to traditional disciplinary boundaries when analyzing the coupled effects of climate change and lulc 3 giving a heavy emphasis on hydrological processes 4 paying little attention to regional socioeconomic disparities and 5 lacking an integrated analysis framework to examine comprehensive and complex interactions between water environment climate change lulc socioeconomic development and policy influence this paper s primary goal is to develop an integrated analytical framework capable of quantitatively examining complex interactions between seasonal surface water change and its driving forces this framework can differentiate the impacts of different driving factors on seasonal water changes by applying it in the hulun buir watershed in china s inner mongolia the paper explores a standardized statistical procedure to quantify this framework by treating the water environmental driving factors as data blocks the study area data and method will be presented in section 2 the data analysis will be carried out in section 3 and the conclusions will be discussed in the final sections 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area hulun lake also called dalai lake is the largest freshwater lake in the steppe region of central asia and the fifth largest freshwater lake in china wang et al 2012 buir lake lies across the border between inner mongolia china and mongolia hulun lake and buir lake the part inside china are located in the same administrative prefecture city hulun buir and are popularly called the hulun buir steppe hbs hbs includes12 banners which is the mongolian word for counties in inner mongolia china orogen qi is the largest banner 60 378 sq km morindawa qi is the smallest 10 400 sq km the average area of a banner in the study area is 20 999 sq km hbs is surrounded by large stretches of wetlands containing rich water resources and lush aquatic plants playing essential roles in water conservation climate mitigation and ecological diversity for instance there are 345 species of plants 31 species of fishes two species of amphibians and reptiles 329 species of birds and 34 species of mammals of which 55 are endangered species zhao et al 2008 however hbs is located in the continental arid and semi arid zones with fragile ecological systems thus the wetlands and their surrounding grasslands are sensitive to climate change bai et al 2008 due to sustained drought from 2007 to 2011 both lakes decreased because they were shallow lakes and the surface water areas fluctuated dramatically causing the succession of wetland ecosystems to grassland ecosystems liu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 for instance the hulun lake had a water area of 2 370 square kilometers in april 2000 and had shrunk to 1 850 square kilometers by june 2010 a loss of 520 square kilometers in 10 years huo 2011 on the other hand the hulun buir city witnessed dramatic economic growth from 2000 to 2014 although the total population decreased by almost 1 5 from 1 99 million to 1 96 million the gdp increased 1014 6 from 10 4 trillion chinese yuan in 2000 to 115 9 trillion chinese yuan in 2014 imar statistical bureau 2001 2015 the agricultural cultivation area increased 62 1 from 894 046 hectares in 2000 to 1149 343 hectares in 2014 while the grain production increased 285 9 from 1 30 million tons to 5 03 million tons during the same period in addition the livestock increased 120 0 from 5 33 million sheep units in 2000 to 11 70 million sheep units in 2014 the excessive socioeconomic activities have threatened the lake and wetland ecological security therefore hbs is an excellent case study site to illustrate the integrated socio environmental and spatiotemporal modeling framework for assessing the regional water environment 2 2 data collection seasonal surface water dynamics are the hydrological cycle s most important water component pekel et al 2016 seasonal surface water circulation directly reflects climate change variability and affects other environmental issues and socioeconomic activities macias et al 2019 viswanathan et al 2016 wu lu 2021 the dataset of seasonal water areas was extracted from the jrc monthly water history v1 2 pekel et al 2016 this entire history collection includes 430 monthly water detection images between march 1984 and december 2019 since the historical data were used to construct this dataset we were not able to collect field measurements to verify the data accuracy or the sensitivity of the dataset in the study area the accuracy of this historical dataset was rigorously tested in the process of compiling it pekel et al 2016 in recent years the jrc data have been used as basic data sets to map hydrologically related phenomena yamazaki et al 2019 venter et al 2020 the jrc surface water data sets have been used to estimate global lake and reservoir volumes and achieved good accuracy busker et al 2019 the other environmental datasets include the precipitation and temperature dataset and the land use and land cover lulc dataset see appendix section 1 for details the resolution of the seasonal surface water grids was at 30m the precipitation and temperature grids were at 250m and the cells of lulc were at 500m since the spatial analysis was conducted over the banners in the study area these datasets of various spatial resolutions were resampled over the banner boundaries for instance the seasonal surface water cells were resampled over a banner as the total area of seasonal water surface in that banner the precipitation grids were resampled over a banner as the annual total precipitation of that banner the temperature grids were resampled over a banner as the yearly average temperature of that banner the cells of various lulc were resampled over a banner as the total land areas of different lulc types the socioeconomic variables were entered from the statistic yearbooks of the imar from 2000 to 2014 inner mongolia statistical bureau 2001 2015 see appendix section 1 for details to illustrate the policy and management influence we included one binary variable ecp to indicate the implementation status of the ecological compensation policy in 2010 chen et al 2017 ecp had a value 0 from 2000 to 2009 but a value 1 since 2010 the list and description of the variables were included in table a1 table 1 in appendix 2 3 the research methods we designed an integrated socioenvironmental and spatiotemporal modeling framework to examine regional water scarcity we adapted the qualitative models developed by the two research groups led by r singh singh et al 2009 and i mekki mekki et al 2013 as our framework s conceptual foundation this framework integrates four interconnected perspectives fig 2 1 the stress of water scarcity 2 the global climate change which often exacerbates water scarcity 3 the ecological environmental response and 4 the societal adaptation population explosion agricultural and industrial revolution economic growth and quality of life improvement dramatically increase water consumption in daily human life and all economic sectors ecological systems and natural environments correspond to water scarcity de paul obade moore 2018 while human living standards economic activities and policy governances have to adapt to water shortage schönhart et al 2018 this framework has two important innovations 1 quantitative examination of the complex interaction between direct causes of water scarcity and other ecological environmental and social factors that respond and affect water scarcity and 2 specific considerations of both spatial disparities and temporal changes spatial variations and temporal dynamics are two essential characteristics that need to be considered when examining water scarcity and its driving causes spatial variations appear in three forms a imbalanced distribution of water resources by eco environmental boundaries such as climate zones and vegetation regions seipel et al 2012 b regional disparity of socioeconomic conditions and management practices by administrative boundaries li et al 2017 and c hierarchical or multiple scales stiles scheiner 2010 the most challenging task for implementing this conceptual framework is to enable quantitative examination of the complex causal relationships embedded in this regional water scarcity framework a systematic or integrated socioenvironmental system approach is needed xie et al 2021 the most viable solution for an area based dataset is the econometric panel data analysis pda pda handles the interactions of socioeconomic and environmental factors across regions as panels and over times as temporal slots gorus and aslan 2019 xie et al 2019 pda deals with the data with more sample variability and with more degrees of freedom which thus improves the applicability of pda and the efficiency of model coefficient estimates hsiao et al 2005 besides the interconnected components of the regional water scarcity framework can be analyzed as blocks in pda block based regression is a common technique to identify the unique contribution of a specific group of independent variables to the explanation of the dependent variable s variance allison 1999 we integrate this approach with the pda model to differentiate how each of the six interconnected sets of factors affects water scarcity the integrated spatiotemporal and socioenvironmental modeling framework can be expressed as the following equation 1 y i t α b 1 j 1 b j x i t b j β i t b j δ i γ t ε i t where yit is the dependent variable percentage of seasonal water area over grassland area where i is the index of banners and t is the index of years xitbj is the j th independent variable in the b th block over banner i at year t 1 b m 1 j n m n m is the number of blocks in the model and equals 6 in this case study block 1 includes the group of variables reflecting the climate change block 2 contains the set of socioeconomic variables block 3 comprises land use and land change variables according to the current literature these three blocks have the most important driving factors of water quality change they are also continuous numerical variables statistically they are predictors in panel regression analysis and will be entered first by this indexing order block 4 is a binary variable ecp reflecting the implementation status of ecological compensation policy block 5 is an ordinal variable of years block 6 is a nominal variable of banners blocks 4 5 and 6 are categorical variables that are included for comparative analysis purposes thus they will be entered later according to their indexing order the purpose of entering the independent variables by blocks is to differentiate how a specific set of variables affects the dependent variable the water scarcity in this case n is the total number of variables in the pda model βitbj is the slope coefficient for the j th independent variable in the b th block for section i at time t it reflects the magnitude of the influence of an independent variable on water scarcity α is the intercept and the overall constant of the model δi indicates the cross sectional effect γt is the temporal specific effect ɛit represents the errors that vary across sections throughout the studied period and determines whether the model is a fixed effect or a random effect one the fixed effect model assumes that the effect upon all cross sections varies over time but is consistent for all cross sections at any given time the random effect model assumes the effect varies cross sections and over time as well hsiao 2014 see appendix section 2 for details it is worth pointing out that variables reflecting policy management geography and time are often not numerical but could be organized as categorical or factor variables xie et al 2005 the inclusion of the categorical indicators of policy space and time in the pda is vital to examine the policy space and time influences more significantly the inclusion of categorical variables in a pda model supports examining joint impacts of interaction terms which consist of at least one categorical variable and one continuous variable for instance this case study included a binary ecological compensation variable ecp later in the analysis ecp was used to construct several interaction terms to explore how the policy factor interacted with other socioeconomic variables influencing regional water scarcity 3 the results equation 1 is the total model of regional water scarcity containing six blocks specified in the hulun buir regional water scarcity analytical framework the six blocks could be examined simultaneously or by a selected set of blocks for specific purposes we presented four different ways of exploring equation 1 1 examining equation 1 as a total model including six blocks to differentiate how each block of driving factors impacted seasonal water changes 2 investigating four blocks of climate change socioeconomics lulc and compensation policy to see how these driving factors interacted with regional water scarcity 3 the time included five block model including the previous four blocks plus the block of years to evaluate temporal dynamics of regional water scarcity and 4 the banner included five block model including the previous four blocks in addition to the block of banners to examine spatial variations of regional water scarcity 3 1 the six block model differentiating contributions of various groups of variables to variation of seasonal water resource it is compulsory to carry out two tests before running a pda model the first one is the unit root test to confirm if the selected variable is time series stationary pda is a time series regression analysis requiring that the primary variable of interest exhibits a linear trend called stationary liu and xie 2013 the levin lin and chu llc unit root test is commonly used for this test see appendix section 2 for technical details the second test is the hausmann test that assesses which type of estimation a pda model should apply a fixed effect model or a random effect model see appendix section 2 in this case study the llc unit root test confirmed that the dependent variable seas w percentage of seasonal water area over grassland area met the pda stationary assumption the hausmann test determined that the pda model was a random effect panel model see appendix section 2 for details due to the data s availability the total hulun buir pda model contained six blocks of variables in the panel analysis climate socioeconomics lulc ecological compensation policy space and time to assess the pda model performance three tests wald chi sq its significance test prob chi sq and overall r sq were examined wald chi sq revealed whether the predictors were significantly explaining the dependent variable the higher the wald chi sq value the more significant the predictors were explaining the dependent variable prob chi sq confirmed if wald chi sq was statistically confident at a 0 05 or 0 01 level overall r sq indicated what percentage of the variance of the dependent variable was explained by the pda model the wald chi sq test of the climate block was nonsignificant prob chi sq 0 417 and its overall r sq value was very low table a3 the explanation was that the study area was small and the climate did not show much variation wald chi sq jumped from 1 75 to 408 42 and its significance test prob chi sq became lower than 0 001 when the block of socioeconomic variables was added furthermore the overall r sq increased from 0 002 to 0 710 both wald chi sq and overall r sq tests confirmed that the socioeconomic activities were the primary driving forces affecting the seasonal water area changes the addition of the lulc block increased the wald chi sq and overall r sq values however the addition of the policy block did not increase the wald chi sq and overall r sq values much revealing that the policy variable ecp was not significantly influencing the seasonal water change one possible explanation was that no policy variation was noticed in this small administrative unit of china robinson et al 2017 however the policy factor exhibited strong impacts on seasonal water resources when it interacted with several other driving factors in addition the blocks of years and banners especially the latter caused dramatic increases of both wald chi sq and overall r sq values indicating that these two blocks significantly impacted seasonal water resources see the next section for details 3 2 the four blocks model examination of the impacts of main driving factors on seasonal water resource we examined how each driving factor in the four blocks of climate socioeconomics lulc and the compensation policy affected regional water scarcity table a4 the coefficients and significance statistics of the four blocks pda model many driving factors within the four blocks strongly impacted the response variable seas w the seasonal water area over the grassland area the variable daa the percentage of arable and grazable land area over the total land area displayed the strongest correlation with seas w because it had the highest positive z value 10 58 it was understandable that cultivation and grazing concentrated in areas with good seasonal water resources consequently sfinc net income of farmers and pastoralists as a share of gdp was the second factor strongly related to seas w it was natural that concentrated activities of cultivation and grazing would increase the net income of farmers and pastoralists pugrass of urban land use area over grassland area was the third factor showing positive relationship with seas w this finding indicated that urban development in large grassland stretches with abundant seasonal water resources would not cause significant damage to the surface water environment however five factors showed significant contradicting roles to the seasonal water resources puwater of urban land use area over total surface water area had the lowest z value 6 23 among all variables and thus displayed the most substantial negative impact on seas w this finding indicated that an increase of urban development near surface water areas would lead to the sharpest deterioration of seasonal water resources dls the number of livestock per square kilometers was the next deteriorator of seas w it was easily perceptible that intensive grazing would lead to severe water depletion dgrain grain production slgov local government revenue as share of gdp and temp annual average temperature were the next three driving factors in decreasing order for accelerating seasonal water resource depletion grain production consumed a lot of water local governments in this region had to increase their revenues through either intensive grazing or increased grain production which would lead to water resource deterioration temperature increased evaporation and depleted water resources another interesting finding was that the interactions between the compensation policy ecp and three driving factors significantly impacted regional water resources for example ecp interaction with puwater ecp puwater had a z value 2 10 and a p z 0 036 these statistics indicated that the ecological compensation policy showed a significantly positive correlation with seas w in areas with a high percentage of urban development near water areas this finding meant that the compensation policy was successfully implemented in these areas on the other hand ecp pugrass and ecp dgrain had p z values 0 05 and 0 10 which meant these interaction terms were significant statistically at the 10 confidence level their z values were 1 730 and 1 680 respectively these two interactions showed contradicting roles to seas w this finding indicated that the compensation policy in the areas with extensive grasslands or high grain production was less incentive and thus ineffective chen et al 2017 3 3 the time included five blocks model temporal examination of interactions between seasonal water resource and its comprehensive driving factors conducting a temporal examination of interactions between seasonal water areas climate changes socioeconomics and land use developments is a vital task for regional watershed studies in the pda model the block of years time only counted for a 1 0 increase of the overall r sq value or explained about 1 0 of the overall variance of seas w however it was interesting to note that the associated confidence statistic 0 014 was smaller than 0 05 the common confidence threshold this meant that the impact of years on seasonal water resources was significant when combined with the climate socioeconomic and land use and land cover change indicators the overall r sq was 0 8304 the combined model explained a very high portion of the overall variance this time included pda model and the previous four blocks model identified that a similar set of independent variables had significant impacts on seasonal water resources except srural the percentage of rural population to total population however there were several apparent differences between the time included and the four block models table a5 parameter estimates of the pda with years the most noticeable difference was that the absolute values of z in the time included model were higher than the corresponding z values in the four block model this finding indicated that the magnitudes of the impacts of these driving factors became stronger in addition the p z values in the time included model were smaller than the corresponding values in the four block model this finding revealed that the confidence levels of these coefficients increased in other words the impacts of these driving forces on seasonal water resources became stronger and more significantly along the time dimension furthermore from the perspective of yearly changes less rainfall and higher temperature in 2007 led to the shrinking seasonal water areas fig 4 similar situations happened in 2002 2004 2005 and 2008 based on the confidence statistic p z table a5 and fig 4 it is worth pointing out that the coefficient of the year 2012 was negative and different from those of the other years from the relationship between seas w and the predictors that showed statistically significant impacts in the previous section daa sfinc and pugrass positively corresponded to seas w in comparison five predictors puwater dls dgrain slgov and temp negatively affected seas w as fig 4 revealed seas w observed a big dip while pugrass saw a jump in 2012 thus the impact of pugrass on seas w reversed its direction in 2012 from the other years furthermore puwater and slgov increased noticeably in 2012 their negative influences on seas w were intensified as a result the regression coefficient of the year 2012 was negative the impact of temp on seas w was less strong than those of puwater dls dgrain and slgov the predictors daa dfinc dls and dgrain were regular in 2012 and thus were not reported the nonsignificant p z was attributed to the short series of years in analysis 3 4 the banner included five blocks model spatial examination of interactions between seasonal water resource and its driving factors the outcomes of the banner included model were different from the results of the time include model at first many driving factors of seasonal water changes were dropped out from the temporal pda model results table a6 parameter estimates of the pda with banners only two socioeconomic variables daa density of arable and grazable land resource and sfinc gdp share of farming and pasturing net income remained positive impacts while a third socioeconomic factor dgrain grain production negatively affected seasonal water for example precipitation and temperature were no longer significantly impacting the variance of seasonal water changes no land use change indicators showed significant influences on the seasonal water environment it was clear that the climate changes in a small region were less noteworthy and their impact on seasonal water was no longer significant the banners in a small study area shared many commonalities in socioeconomic development and land use change as a result these variables were no longer significantly affecting the seasonal water environment furthermore spatial disparity among banners in the study area was very apparent the banner included pda model explained 100 00 of the between region variance induced among these banners and 92 24 of the overall variance table a3 the details of the regional disparities in the study area were explained in appendix section 4 4 discussion the integrated socioeconomic and spatiotemporal analytical framework was tested by examining the seasonal water environment changes in the hulun buir basin inner mongolia china the pda model successfully disclosed the interactions between seasonal water changes and their driving factors the block of socioeconomic variables explained almost 71 0 of the variance of seasonal water change the lulc and climatic factors about 9 the regional disparities around 13 and the yearly differences about 4 clearly the impact of human economic activities on seasonable water resources was more substantial than other blocks of variables the finding that the socioeconomic factors were primary causes of water resource deterioration is consistent with the conclusion that the socioeconomic variables were leading causes of grassland desertification in imar li and xie 2013 furthermore different socioeconomic factors showed varied impacts the factors such as high percentages of arable and grazable land areas and high percentage of gdp from farming and grazing sectors corresponded to abundant seasonal water resources on the other hand excessive grazing high grain production and increased local government revenue deteriorated seasonal water resources in addition urban development in surface water stressed areas exhibited a substantial negative impact on seasonal water resources urban development led to fast grassland reclamation and rapid population growth urban growth also consumed an ample amount of water and triggered irreversible water soil deterioration becken mclennan 2017 pluchinotta et al 2018 additionally the impacts of these driving factors on seasonal water resources showed evident spatial disparities and temporal changes considering regional disparities between the twelve banners the variables of the arable and grazable lands rural population and rural income became more crucial than the other factors such as climate urban growth and policy indicators local natural resources and rural socioeconomic developments were much more important than regional policies and global climate changes when the study area was small and primarily pastoral and agricultural on the other hand the time series analysis of the pda model obtained a unique finding all driving factors significantly impacted the seasonal water resources when the pda model included the time dimension in other words their impact magnitudes and significance levels were increasing along with time another interesting finding was that the ecological compensation policy ecp positively influenced seasonal water resources in places with concentrated urban development near water areas this finding indicated that the ecological compensation policy was more receptive in those areas with severely deteriorated water resources this newly developed pda based water scarcity analysis successfully transformed the original dpsir water quality analysis framework mekki et al 2013 into econometrics based statistical modeling the block entered pda analysis converted the dpsir descriptive causal relationship into a panel regression model conspiring various blocks of independent variables the numerical climate ecological and socioeconomic variables were grouped as primary blocks of predictors the categorical variables such as policy time and space were organized as controlling factors for comparative analysis therefore the block entered pda model could bring policy concerns spatial patterns and temporal changes into an econometric statistical analysis comparing with other studies of quantifying the dpsir framework to examine socioeconomic influences on biodiversity ecosystem services and human well being hou et al 2014 the block entered pda model examined space as cross sections and time as time series explicitly as well as simultaneously the pda model also probed the effects of the interactions between the policy and several climate lulc and socioeconomic predictors on regional water scarcity furthermore in contrast with other statistical analyses of water resource deterioration in imar shang et al 2019 the block entered pda model was inspired by the conceptual framework of dpsir and empowered by the econometric statistical analysis therefore this pda based analysis framework provided a coherent and proven methodological approach to study water scarcity challenges this pda model was also extensible for incorporating many possible causal structures or groups of variables that researchers could have data to assess however there are several places where precautions or future improvement are needed first the seasonal surface water data was extracted from the jrc monthly water history dataset the accuracy or sensitivity of the data set was not validated in the study area due to the unavailability of historical ground measurements although the jrc data has excellent reliability it is commonly recommended to conduct a local validation if feasible second the case study area hulun buir was a relatively small region and only contained 12 banners this spatiotemporal socioenvironmental analytical framework should be further assessed with a more comprehensive socioenvironmental dataset in a more complex area third the surface water precipitation temperature and lulc grids were resampled over the boundaries of the banner the banner was a large geographical area and hence the spatial scale was coarse resampling high resolution point based or grid based environmental data into rough administrative boundaries reflects a severe data limitation in integrated environmental and socioeconomic studies a promising solution is to survey socioeconomic data in conjunction with environmental field sampling or remote sensing data however most of these survey datasets at present vary widely across time and space constituting severe limitations to integrated time series environmental and socioeconomic studies bretschger pittel 2020 this limitation calls for an urgent need to develop new methods to integrate various data sources and types and fill critical data gaps to advance our understanding of how coupled environmental and socioeconomic systems work bai et al 2016 fourth the time series analysis was conducted by using the beginning year as the comparison base applying some criteria to select a particular year as the base year for comparative analysis should be more logical 5 conclusions the integrated water quality modeling framework based on the block entered pda regression effectively transforms the dpsir driving forces pressures states impacts and responses conceptual framework into an econometric modeling framework the block entered pda modeling framework can concurrently analyze seasonal water change and its driving forces across space and time and differentiate how different blocks of driving factors interact with water scarcity moreover this block entered pda framework is designed to examine various causal relationships that available data can support and include categorical variables of policy space and time in analysis therefore this analytical framework can analyze ecological deterioration or challenges involving complex integrated ecological environmental and socioeconomic systems this framework is suitable for adaptation in other geographic areas or for integrated studies of other socio environmental systems the current case study of this pda based modeling framework examines a regional water scarcity challenge issue in hulun buir inner mongolia of china future research could investigate water scarcity in other large geographical regions where the water scarcity crisis is more prevalent another meaningful experiment is to apply this framework for examining other environmental challenges such as grassland desertification water quality deterioration or sustainable urban areas development dataset xie yichun 2021 spatiotemporal examination of

16422,increased grazing and agricultural production industrialization population growth and consequent land use land cover lulc changes considerably increase water consumption global climate change exaggerates the uncertainty of water sources and supplies unfortunately most current examinations are either confined within disciplinary silos or not integrated for considering wide ranging socioenvironmental management and policy factors the paper develops an integrated regional water environment modeling framework examining how climate lulc socioenvironmental and policy factors interact with the water environment it also adopts a block based econometric panel data analysis to quantify this framework the paper extracts seasonal water area and lulc data through image processing from 2000 to 2014 in the hulun buir watershed inner mongolia of china the paper quantitatively analyzed the interactions between seasonal water changes and major driving factors such as climatic land use socioeconomic policy space and time many of these driving factors were interacting with the seasonal water environment and showing long term causal relationships the socioeconomic variables explained 71 of the variance of seasonal water change the environmental and climatic factors about 9 the regional disparities around 13 and the yearly differences about 4 the findings confirm that it is critical to carry out a time series examination of causal relationships between seasonal water change and its manifold driving factors at the scale of regional watershed studies

water crisis threatens food security fifty five percent of the world s population faces moderate to severe water shortage at least one month per year mekonnen arjen 2016 global climate change increases the uncertainty of water sources and supplies kumar et al 2017 and exacerbates global food security threat hanjra qureshi 2010 there is a growing volume of literature examining the complex causes of water scarcity and the related impacts on ecology environment and human society vörösmarty et al 2013 the studies of water scarcity over a region or watershed involve a wide array of factors land use and land cover lulc and global climate changes have been regarded as two primary causes of current and future water scarcity many forest lands and grasslands are converted into agricultural lands which leads to a dramatic increase in irrigation water and causes a considerable increase in discharge and sedimentation pijl et al 2018 urbanization is the most critical contributor to the surface runoff increase while the increased irrigated cultivated land is the leading cause of increased water consumption the study of the climate change impact on water scarcity focuses on climate change uncertainty kundzewicz et al 2018 however it has been a hot topic to differentiate the effects of climate change and lulc on watershed hydrology a typical way of separating their impacts is to run a hydrological model that includes climate and lulc factors at different times i e a baseline period vs a current time to see the differences currently there is rich and growing literature studying the causes driving factors and impacts of regional water environment change these methods roughly fall into four categories the first group includes the classic watershed based models such as swat the soil water assessment tool dwsm the dynamic watershed simulation model hspf the hydrological simulation program fortran and many others a good review can be found in the seminal paper by borah and bera 2004 the second group quantitatively examines the relationship between land degradation lulc and water stress a good example is a socio ecological integrated analysis that used several indicators covering the three dimensions of environment economics and society to examine grassland degradation in imar for the environmental dimension water footprint and food footprint were used for the economic dimension gdp household income built up area and energy consumption were selected for the social dimension the gini coefficient and human development index hdi were chosen shang et al 2019 in shang s paper these indicators were plotted as line graphs from 1987 to 2015 and descriptively analyzed to find how they changed by years between 1987 and 2015 the findings revealed that water resource use in imar increased fourfold energy consumption increased approximately seven fold and large areas of natural grasslands were converted to agricultural industrial and urban land use the third group consists of a collection of newly developed modeling paradigms and machine learning techniques in watershed studies a coupled wavelet random forest algorithm is developed to improve evapotranspiration estimation accuracy shiri 2018 an increasing number of artificial intelligence ai based models have been reported for forecasting stream water flow yaseen et al 2015 various machine learning methods such as adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems support vector machines and the least absolute shrinkage selector operator have been applied to traditional numerical models to simulate soil water content data karandish šimůnek 2016 sarigai et al 2021 multi agent based models have also been integrated to study water scarcity and related issues a well known multi agent modeling framework is envision which simulates landscape change dynamics by incorporating decision maker s values and behaviors concerning the landscape mills et al 2018 in addition the integration of gis geographic information systems and statistical analysis is widespread in current literature for instance the impacts of land use topography and socioeconomic factors on river water quality is examined through gis geographic information systems chen and lu 2014 applied several statistical methods such as analysis of variance principal component analysis pearson correlations multiple regression analysis and redundancy analysis to explore the temporal and spatial variations of the influences of these factors on water quality chen and lu 2014 analyzed temporal variations of 36 water quality samples collected at 20 sampling sites along one local river from july 2003 to june 2006 however there was no discussion on why the five statistical analyses were adopted and what unique insight was obtained from each analysis the fourth group emphasizes qualitative causal analysis of water stresses under different policy interferences and management scenarios public policies collective decisions and individual preferences interact with environmental conditions and socioeconomic backgrounds affecting watershed environments their interactions and feedbacks can be described through synthetic indicators singh et al 2009 the causal framework called dpsir driving forces pressures states impacts and responses smeets and weterings 1999 was adapted to analyze the causalities between these indicators for the oasis sustainability management in tunisia mekki et al 2013 the tunisia case study used line charts and scatter plots to examine the relationship between groundwater degradation and other causal factors such as illicit pumped wells illicit oases water salinity total dissolved solids etc the causal analysis was descriptive and the data analysis was direct visualization of the observed data this dpsir framework was later quantified to examine socioeconomic influences on biodiversity ecosystem services and human well being in china s jiangsu province hou et al 2014 this quantified dpsir model established a set of socioeconomic indicators matching the dpsir conceptual framework concerning biodiversity ecosystem services and human well being it applied statistical factor analysis to compute factor scores for the dpsir sectors in the study it then used the variance contribution rates of the extracted principal components of the factor analysis to compute standardized scores of each dpsir sector finally it calculated spearman correlation coefficients between the standardized scores of every pair of dpsir sectors to describe the quantitative linkage between the dpsir sectors these qualitative analyses are most comprehensive in considering various ecological environmental socioeconomic policy and management factors in brief current studies on the impacts of climate change lulc socioeconomic development and policy influence on watershed environments have the following features 1 focusing on the impacts of climate change and lulc 2 confining to traditional disciplinary boundaries when analyzing the coupled effects of climate change and lulc 3 giving a heavy emphasis on hydrological processes 4 paying little attention to regional socioeconomic disparities and 5 lacking an integrated analysis framework to examine comprehensive and complex interactions between water environment climate change lulc socioeconomic development and policy influence this paper s primary goal is to develop an integrated analytical framework capable of quantitatively examining complex interactions between seasonal surface water change and its driving forces this framework can differentiate the impacts of different driving factors on seasonal water changes by applying it in the hulun buir watershed in china s inner mongolia the paper explores a standardized statistical procedure to quantify this framework by treating the water environmental driving factors as data blocks the study area data and method will be presented in section 2 the data analysis will be carried out in section 3 and the conclusions will be discussed in the final sections 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area hulun lake also called dalai lake is the largest freshwater lake in the steppe region of central asia and the fifth largest freshwater lake in china wang et al 2012 buir lake lies across the border between inner mongolia china and mongolia hulun lake and buir lake the part inside china are located in the same administrative prefecture city hulun buir and are popularly called the hulun buir steppe hbs hbs includes12 banners which is the mongolian word for counties in inner mongolia china orogen qi is the largest banner 60 378 sq km morindawa qi is the smallest 10 400 sq km the average area of a banner in the study area is 20 999 sq km hbs is surrounded by large stretches of wetlands containing rich water resources and lush aquatic plants playing essential roles in water conservation climate mitigation and ecological diversity for instance there are 345 species of plants 31 species of fishes two species of amphibians and reptiles 329 species of birds and 34 species of mammals of which 55 are endangered species zhao et al 2008 however hbs is located in the continental arid and semi arid zones with fragile ecological systems thus the wetlands and their surrounding grasslands are sensitive to climate change bai et al 2008 due to sustained drought from 2007 to 2011 both lakes decreased because they were shallow lakes and the surface water areas fluctuated dramatically causing the succession of wetland ecosystems to grassland ecosystems liu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 for instance the hulun lake had a water area of 2 370 square kilometers in april 2000 and had shrunk to 1 850 square kilometers by june 2010 a loss of 520 square kilometers in 10 years huo 2011 on the other hand the hulun buir city witnessed dramatic economic growth from 2000 to 2014 although the total population decreased by almost 1 5 from 1 99 million to 1 96 million the gdp increased 1014 6 from 10 4 trillion chinese yuan in 2000 to 115 9 trillion chinese yuan in 2014 imar statistical bureau 2001 2015 the agricultural cultivation area increased 62 1 from 894 046 hectares in 2000 to 1149 343 hectares in 2014 while the grain production increased 285 9 from 1 30 million tons to 5 03 million tons during the same period in addition the livestock increased 120 0 from 5 33 million sheep units in 2000 to 11 70 million sheep units in 2014 the excessive socioeconomic activities have threatened the lake and wetland ecological security therefore hbs is an excellent case study site to illustrate the integrated socio environmental and spatiotemporal modeling framework for assessing the regional water environment 2 2 data collection seasonal surface water dynamics are the hydrological cycle s most important water component pekel et al 2016 seasonal surface water circulation directly reflects climate change variability and affects other environmental issues and socioeconomic activities macias et al 2019 viswanathan et al 2016 wu lu 2021 the dataset of seasonal water areas was extracted from the jrc monthly water history v1 2 pekel et al 2016 this entire history collection includes 430 monthly water detection images between march 1984 and december 2019 since the historical data were used to construct this dataset we were not able to collect field measurements to verify the data accuracy or the sensitivity of the dataset in the study area the accuracy of this historical dataset was rigorously tested in the process of compiling it pekel et al 2016 in recent years the jrc data have been used as basic data sets to map hydrologically related phenomena yamazaki et al 2019 venter et al 2020 the jrc surface water data sets have been used to estimate global lake and reservoir volumes and achieved good accuracy busker et al 2019 the other environmental datasets include the precipitation and temperature dataset and the land use and land cover lulc dataset see appendix section 1 for details the resolution of the seasonal surface water grids was at 30m the precipitation and temperature grids were at 250m and the cells of lulc were at 500m since the spatial analysis was conducted over the banners in the study area these datasets of various spatial resolutions were resampled over the banner boundaries for instance the seasonal surface water cells were resampled over a banner as the total area of seasonal water surface in that banner the precipitation grids were resampled over a banner as the annual total precipitation of that banner the temperature grids were resampled over a banner as the yearly average temperature of that banner the cells of various lulc were resampled over a banner as the total land areas of different lulc types the socioeconomic variables were entered from the statistic yearbooks of the imar from 2000 to 2014 inner mongolia statistical bureau 2001 2015 see appendix section 1 for details to illustrate the policy and management influence we included one binary variable ecp to indicate the implementation status of the ecological compensation policy in 2010 chen et al 2017 ecp had a value 0 from 2000 to 2009 but a value 1 since 2010 the list and description of the variables were included in table a1 table 1 in appendix 2 3 the research methods we designed an integrated socioenvironmental and spatiotemporal modeling framework to examine regional water scarcity we adapted the qualitative models developed by the two research groups led by r singh singh et al 2009 and i mekki mekki et al 2013 as our framework s conceptual foundation this framework integrates four interconnected perspectives fig 2 1 the stress of water scarcity 2 the global climate change which often exacerbates water scarcity 3 the ecological environmental response and 4 the societal adaptation population explosion agricultural and industrial revolution economic growth and quality of life improvement dramatically increase water consumption in daily human life and all economic sectors ecological systems and natural environments correspond to water scarcity de paul obade moore 2018 while human living standards economic activities and policy governances have to adapt to water shortage schönhart et al 2018 this framework has two important innovations 1 quantitative examination of the complex interaction between direct causes of water scarcity and other ecological environmental and social factors that respond and affect water scarcity and 2 specific considerations of both spatial disparities and temporal changes spatial variations and temporal dynamics are two essential characteristics that need to be considered when examining water scarcity and its driving causes spatial variations appear in three forms a imbalanced distribution of water resources by eco environmental boundaries such as climate zones and vegetation regions seipel et al 2012 b regional disparity of socioeconomic conditions and management practices by administrative boundaries li et al 2017 and c hierarchical or multiple scales stiles scheiner 2010 the most challenging task for implementing this conceptual framework is to enable quantitative examination of the complex causal relationships embedded in this regional water scarcity framework a systematic or integrated socioenvironmental system approach is needed xie et al 2021 the most viable solution for an area based dataset is the econometric panel data analysis pda pda handles the interactions of socioeconomic and environmental factors across regions as panels and over times as temporal slots gorus and aslan 2019 xie et al 2019 pda deals with the data with more sample variability and with more degrees of freedom which thus improves the applicability of pda and the efficiency of model coefficient estimates hsiao et al 2005 besides the interconnected components of the regional water scarcity framework can be analyzed as blocks in pda block based regression is a common technique to identify the unique contribution of a specific group of independent variables to the explanation of the dependent variable s variance allison 1999 we integrate this approach with the pda model to differentiate how each of the six interconnected sets of factors affects water scarcity the integrated spatiotemporal and socioenvironmental modeling framework can be expressed as the following equation 1 y i t α b 1 j 1 b j x i t b j β i t b j δ i γ t ε i t where yit is the dependent variable percentage of seasonal water area over grassland area where i is the index of banners and t is the index of years xitbj is the j th independent variable in the b th block over banner i at year t 1 b m 1 j n m n m is the number of blocks in the model and equals 6 in this case study block 1 includes the group of variables reflecting the climate change block 2 contains the set of socioeconomic variables block 3 comprises land use and land change variables according to the current literature these three blocks have the most important driving factors of water quality change they are also continuous numerical variables statistically they are predictors in panel regression analysis and will be entered first by this indexing order block 4 is a binary variable ecp reflecting the implementation status of ecological compensation policy block 5 is an ordinal variable of years block 6 is a nominal variable of banners blocks 4 5 and 6 are categorical variables that are included for comparative analysis purposes thus they will be entered later according to their indexing order the purpose of entering the independent variables by blocks is to differentiate how a specific set of variables affects the dependent variable the water scarcity in this case n is the total number of variables in the pda model βitbj is the slope coefficient for the j th independent variable in the b th block for section i at time t it reflects the magnitude of the influence of an independent variable on water scarcity α is the intercept and the overall constant of the model δi indicates the cross sectional effect γt is the temporal specific effect ɛit represents the errors that vary across sections throughout the studied period and determines whether the model is a fixed effect or a random effect one the fixed effect model assumes that the effect upon all cross sections varies over time but is consistent for all cross sections at any given time the random effect model assumes the effect varies cross sections and over time as well hsiao 2014 see appendix section 2 for details it is worth pointing out that variables reflecting policy management geography and time are often not numerical but could be organized as categorical or factor variables xie et al 2005 the inclusion of the categorical indicators of policy space and time in the pda is vital to examine the policy space and time influences more significantly the inclusion of categorical variables in a pda model supports examining joint impacts of interaction terms which consist of at least one categorical variable and one continuous variable for instance this case study included a binary ecological compensation variable ecp later in the analysis ecp was used to construct several interaction terms to explore how the policy factor interacted with other socioeconomic variables influencing regional water scarcity 3 the results equation 1 is the total model of regional water scarcity containing six blocks specified in the hulun buir regional water scarcity analytical framework the six blocks could be examined simultaneously or by a selected set of blocks for specific purposes we presented four different ways of exploring equation 1 1 examining equation 1 as a total model including six blocks to differentiate how each block of driving factors impacted seasonal water changes 2 investigating four blocks of climate change socioeconomics lulc and compensation policy to see how these driving factors interacted with regional water scarcity 3 the time included five block model including the previous four blocks plus the block of years to evaluate temporal dynamics of regional water scarcity and 4 the banner included five block model including the previous four blocks in addition to the block of banners to examine spatial variations of regional water scarcity 3 1 the six block model differentiating contributions of various groups of variables to variation of seasonal water resource it is compulsory to carry out two tests before running a pda model the first one is the unit root test to confirm if the selected variable is time series stationary pda is a time series regression analysis requiring that the primary variable of interest exhibits a linear trend called stationary liu and xie 2013 the levin lin and chu llc unit root test is commonly used for this test see appendix section 2 for technical details the second test is the hausmann test that assesses which type of estimation a pda model should apply a fixed effect model or a random effect model see appendix section 2 in this case study the llc unit root test confirmed that the dependent variable seas w percentage of seasonal water area over grassland area met the pda stationary assumption the hausmann test determined that the pda model was a random effect panel model see appendix section 2 for details due to the data s availability the total hulun buir pda model contained six blocks of variables in the panel analysis climate socioeconomics lulc ecological compensation policy space and time to assess the pda model performance three tests wald chi sq its significance test prob chi sq and overall r sq were examined wald chi sq revealed whether the predictors were significantly explaining the dependent variable the higher the wald chi sq value the more significant the predictors were explaining the dependent variable prob chi sq confirmed if wald chi sq was statistically confident at a 0 05 or 0 01 level overall r sq indicated what percentage of the variance of the dependent variable was explained by the pda model the wald chi sq test of the climate block was nonsignificant prob chi sq 0 417 and its overall r sq value was very low table a3 the explanation was that the study area was small and the climate did not show much variation wald chi sq jumped from 1 75 to 408 42 and its significance test prob chi sq became lower than 0 001 when the block of socioeconomic variables was added furthermore the overall r sq increased from 0 002 to 0 710 both wald chi sq and overall r sq tests confirmed that the socioeconomic activities were the primary driving forces affecting the seasonal water area changes the addition of the lulc block increased the wald chi sq and overall r sq values however the addition of the policy block did not increase the wald chi sq and overall r sq values much revealing that the policy variable ecp was not significantly influencing the seasonal water change one possible explanation was that no policy variation was noticed in this small administrative unit of china robinson et al 2017 however the policy factor exhibited strong impacts on seasonal water resources when it interacted with several other driving factors in addition the blocks of years and banners especially the latter caused dramatic increases of both wald chi sq and overall r sq values indicating that these two blocks significantly impacted seasonal water resources see the next section for details 3 2 the four blocks model examination of the impacts of main driving factors on seasonal water resource we examined how each driving factor in the four blocks of climate socioeconomics lulc and the compensation policy affected regional water scarcity table a4 the coefficients and significance statistics of the four blocks pda model many driving factors within the four blocks strongly impacted the response variable seas w the seasonal water area over the grassland area the variable daa the percentage of arable and grazable land area over the total land area displayed the strongest correlation with seas w because it had the highest positive z value 10 58 it was understandable that cultivation and grazing concentrated in areas with good seasonal water resources consequently sfinc net income of farmers and pastoralists as a share of gdp was the second factor strongly related to seas w it was natural that concentrated activities of cultivation and grazing would increase the net income of farmers and pastoralists pugrass of urban land use area over grassland area was the third factor showing positive relationship with seas w this finding indicated that urban development in large grassland stretches with abundant seasonal water resources would not cause significant damage to the surface water environment however five factors showed significant contradicting roles to the seasonal water resources puwater of urban land use area over total surface water area had the lowest z value 6 23 among all variables and thus displayed the most substantial negative impact on seas w this finding indicated that an increase of urban development near surface water areas would lead to the sharpest deterioration of seasonal water resources dls the number of livestock per square kilometers was the next deteriorator of seas w it was easily perceptible that intensive grazing would lead to severe water depletion dgrain grain production slgov local government revenue as share of gdp and temp annual average temperature were the next three driving factors in decreasing order for accelerating seasonal water resource depletion grain production consumed a lot of water local governments in this region had to increase their revenues through either intensive grazing or increased grain production which would lead to water resource deterioration temperature increased evaporation and depleted water resources another interesting finding was that the interactions between the compensation policy ecp and three driving factors significantly impacted regional water resources for example ecp interaction with puwater ecp puwater had a z value 2 10 and a p z 0 036 these statistics indicated that the ecological compensation policy showed a significantly positive correlation with seas w in areas with a high percentage of urban development near water areas this finding meant that the compensation policy was successfully implemented in these areas on the other hand ecp pugrass and ecp dgrain had p z values 0 05 and 0 10 which meant these interaction terms were significant statistically at the 10 confidence level their z values were 1 730 and 1 680 respectively these two interactions showed contradicting roles to seas w this finding indicated that the compensation policy in the areas with extensive grasslands or high grain production was less incentive and thus ineffective chen et al 2017 3 3 the time included five blocks model temporal examination of interactions between seasonal water resource and its comprehensive driving factors conducting a temporal examination of interactions between seasonal water areas climate changes socioeconomics and land use developments is a vital task for regional watershed studies in the pda model the block of years time only counted for a 1 0 increase of the overall r sq value or explained about 1 0 of the overall variance of seas w however it was interesting to note that the associated confidence statistic 0 014 was smaller than 0 05 the common confidence threshold this meant that the impact of years on seasonal water resources was significant when combined with the climate socioeconomic and land use and land cover change indicators the overall r sq was 0 8304 the combined model explained a very high portion of the overall variance this time included pda model and the previous four blocks model identified that a similar set of independent variables had significant impacts on seasonal water resources except srural the percentage of rural population to total population however there were several apparent differences between the time included and the four block models table a5 parameter estimates of the pda with years the most noticeable difference was that the absolute values of z in the time included model were higher than the corresponding z values in the four block model this finding indicated that the magnitudes of the impacts of these driving factors became stronger in addition the p z values in the time included model were smaller than the corresponding values in the four block model this finding revealed that the confidence levels of these coefficients increased in other words the impacts of these driving forces on seasonal water resources became stronger and more significantly along the time dimension furthermore from the perspective of yearly changes less rainfall and higher temperature in 2007 led to the shrinking seasonal water areas fig 4 similar situations happened in 2002 2004 2005 and 2008 based on the confidence statistic p z table a5 and fig 4 it is worth pointing out that the coefficient of the year 2012 was negative and different from those of the other years from the relationship between seas w and the predictors that showed statistically significant impacts in the previous section daa sfinc and pugrass positively corresponded to seas w in comparison five predictors puwater dls dgrain slgov and temp negatively affected seas w as fig 4 revealed seas w observed a big dip while pugrass saw a jump in 2012 thus the impact of pugrass on seas w reversed its direction in 2012 from the other years furthermore puwater and slgov increased noticeably in 2012 their negative influences on seas w were intensified as a result the regression coefficient of the year 2012 was negative the impact of temp on seas w was less strong than those of puwater dls dgrain and slgov the predictors daa dfinc dls and dgrain were regular in 2012 and thus were not reported the nonsignificant p z was attributed to the short series of years in analysis 3 4 the banner included five blocks model spatial examination of interactions between seasonal water resource and its driving factors the outcomes of the banner included model were different from the results of the time include model at first many driving factors of seasonal water changes were dropped out from the temporal pda model results table a6 parameter estimates of the pda with banners only two socioeconomic variables daa density of arable and grazable land resource and sfinc gdp share of farming and pasturing net income remained positive impacts while a third socioeconomic factor dgrain grain production negatively affected seasonal water for example precipitation and temperature were no longer significantly impacting the variance of seasonal water changes no land use change indicators showed significant influences on the seasonal water environment it was clear that the climate changes in a small region were less noteworthy and their impact on seasonal water was no longer significant the banners in a small study area shared many commonalities in socioeconomic development and land use change as a result these variables were no longer significantly affecting the seasonal water environment furthermore spatial disparity among banners in the study area was very apparent the banner included pda model explained 100 00 of the between region variance induced among these banners and 92 24 of the overall variance table a3 the details of the regional disparities in the study area were explained in appendix section 4 4 discussion the integrated socioeconomic and spatiotemporal analytical framework was tested by examining the seasonal water environment changes in the hulun buir basin inner mongolia china the pda model successfully disclosed the interactions between seasonal water changes and their driving factors the block of socioeconomic variables explained almost 71 0 of the variance of seasonal water change the lulc and climatic factors about 9 the regional disparities around 13 and the yearly differences about 4 clearly the impact of human economic activities on seasonable water resources was more substantial than other blocks of variables the finding that the socioeconomic factors were primary causes of water resource deterioration is consistent with the conclusion that the socioeconomic variables were leading causes of grassland desertification in imar li and xie 2013 furthermore different socioeconomic factors showed varied impacts the factors such as high percentages of arable and grazable land areas and high percentage of gdp from farming and grazing sectors corresponded to abundant seasonal water resources on the other hand excessive grazing high grain production and increased local government revenue deteriorated seasonal water resources in addition urban development in surface water stressed areas exhibited a substantial negative impact on seasonal water resources urban development led to fast grassland reclamation and rapid population growth urban growth also consumed an ample amount of water and triggered irreversible water soil deterioration becken mclennan 2017 pluchinotta et al 2018 additionally the impacts of these driving factors on seasonal water resources showed evident spatial disparities and temporal changes considering regional disparities between the twelve banners the variables of the arable and grazable lands rural population and rural income became more crucial than the other factors such as climate urban growth and policy indicators local natural resources and rural socioeconomic developments were much more important than regional policies and global climate changes when the study area was small and primarily pastoral and agricultural on the other hand the time series analysis of the pda model obtained a unique finding all driving factors significantly impacted the seasonal water resources when the pda model included the time dimension in other words their impact magnitudes and significance levels were increasing along with time another interesting finding was that the ecological compensation policy ecp positively influenced seasonal water resources in places with concentrated urban development near water areas this finding indicated that the ecological compensation policy was more receptive in those areas with severely deteriorated water resources this newly developed pda based water scarcity analysis successfully transformed the original dpsir water quality analysis framework mekki et al 2013 into econometrics based statistical modeling the block entered pda analysis converted the dpsir descriptive causal relationship into a panel regression model conspiring various blocks of independent variables the numerical climate ecological and socioeconomic variables were grouped as primary blocks of predictors the categorical variables such as policy time and space were organized as controlling factors for comparative analysis therefore the block entered pda model could bring policy concerns spatial patterns and temporal changes into an econometric statistical analysis comparing with other studies of quantifying the dpsir framework to examine socioeconomic influences on biodiversity ecosystem services and human well being hou et al 2014 the block entered pda model examined space as cross sections and time as time series explicitly as well as simultaneously the pda model also probed the effects of the interactions between the policy and several climate lulc and socioeconomic predictors on regional water scarcity furthermore in contrast with other statistical analyses of water resource deterioration in imar shang et al 2019 the block entered pda model was inspired by the conceptual framework of dpsir and empowered by the econometric statistical analysis therefore this pda based analysis framework provided a coherent and proven methodological approach to study water scarcity challenges this pda model was also extensible for incorporating many possible causal structures or groups of variables that researchers could have data to assess however there are several places where precautions or future improvement are needed first the seasonal surface water data was extracted from the jrc monthly water history dataset the accuracy or sensitivity of the data set was not validated in the study area due to the unavailability of historical ground measurements although the jrc data has excellent reliability it is commonly recommended to conduct a local validation if feasible second the case study area hulun buir was a relatively small region and only contained 12 banners this spatiotemporal socioenvironmental analytical framework should be further assessed with a more comprehensive socioenvironmental dataset in a more complex area third the surface water precipitation temperature and lulc grids were resampled over the boundaries of the banner the banner was a large geographical area and hence the spatial scale was coarse resampling high resolution point based or grid based environmental data into rough administrative boundaries reflects a severe data limitation in integrated environmental and socioeconomic studies a promising solution is to survey socioeconomic data in conjunction with environmental field sampling or remote sensing data however most of these survey datasets at present vary widely across time and space constituting severe limitations to integrated time series environmental and socioeconomic studies bretschger pittel 2020 this limitation calls for an urgent need to develop new methods to integrate various data sources and types and fill critical data gaps to advance our understanding of how coupled environmental and socioeconomic systems work bai et al 2016 fourth the time series analysis was conducted by using the beginning year as the comparison base applying some criteria to select a particular year as the base year for comparative analysis should be more logical 5 conclusions the integrated water quality modeling framework based on the block entered pda regression effectively transforms the dpsir driving forces pressures states impacts and responses conceptual framework into an econometric modeling framework the block entered pda modeling framework can concurrently analyze seasonal water change and its driving forces across space and time and differentiate how different blocks of driving factors interact with water scarcity moreover this block entered pda framework is designed to examine various causal relationships that available data can support and include categorical variables of policy space and time in analysis therefore this analytical framework can analyze ecological deterioration or challenges involving complex integrated ecological environmental and socioeconomic systems this framework is suitable for adaptation in other geographic areas or for integrated studies of other socio environmental systems the current case study of this pda based modeling framework examines a regional water scarcity challenge issue in hulun buir inner mongolia of china future research could investigate water scarcity in other large geographical regions where the water scarcity crisis is more prevalent another meaningful experiment is to apply this framework for examining other environmental challenges such as grassland desertification water quality deterioration or sustainable urban areas development dataset xie yichun 2021 spatiotemporal examination of

16423,the growing use of trace elements in industrialized societies is driving an increase in the occurrence of trace elements in anthropogenic waste streams globally yet the large scale sources of many trace elements to wastewater and their elimination during treatment remain poorly understood and potential environmental impacts on freshwater systems therefore unclear we screened 42 wastewater treatment facilities in the north american great lakes basin and deployed a black box approach to calculate representative estimates for average per capita trace element loads and basin scale effluent discharge rates as well as trace element removal efficiencies across different treatment technologies our results show different removal of specific groups of trace elements during wastewater treatment average removal efficiencies were 25 for alkali metals 50 for alkaline earth metals 74 for transition metals and 85 for rare earth elements higher elimination of the majority of trace elements was generally achieved by more advanced tertiary treatment types elemental loads generally followed natural abundance patterns but anomalous loading rates were observed for various trace elements across the sampled facilities by examining geospatial attributes of the sampled sewersheds trends in select trace element loads were qualitatively tied to possible point sources and diffuse sources overall these results illustrate the potential of wastewater surveillance to inform environmental management of emerging trace element contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract

pharmaceuticals find their way into municipal or industrial wastewater petrie et al 2015 laguardia et al 2010 kim et al 2010 kiser et al 2009 as a result wastewater surveillance has become an established tool to assess human imprints on contaminant dynamics and environmental emissions recently wastewater surveillance is even providing a cost effective means to monitor covid 19 prevalence in populations in useful spatiotemporal resolution larsen and wigginton 2020 wastewater also constitutes an ideal screening target to examine the sources and potential environmental footprints of human trace element use vriens et al 2017 merschel et al 2015 lim et al 2017 yet systematic data on trace element concentrations in wastewater and other urban runoff is scarce as these elements are typically not part of governmental surveillance programs vriens et al 2017 westerhoff et al 2015 nickel et al 2021 östman et al 2017 government of ontario 2019 usepa cwns 2012 at least in part due to the cost and challenges involved with their quantification at ultra trace levels wastewater may be considered a trace element source to the environment through multiple pathways e g through direct release of effluent to surface waters gobeil et al 2005 dickenson et al 2011 or through agricultural application of processed sewage sludge singh and agrawal 2008 unfortunately the loading rates of many emerging trace elements from and into wastewater treatment plants wwtp are not well understood different wwtp types primary secondary or tertiary consist of a series of sequential unit operations aimed at removing solids biogeochemical oxygen demand nutrients and other remaining suspended colloidal and dissolved constituents of concern ccme 2009 municipal treatment systems are becoming increasingly effective towards abovementioned performance criteria but they do typically not target specific groups of trace elements even though previous studies have implied that wastewater loads of trace elements such as cu zn hg and as can be substantial and their removal by conventional treatment technologies not very effective agoro et al 2020 karvelas et al 2003 balogh and nollet 2008 because of the generally limited data available for less abundant trace elements e g ree and pge vriens et al 2017 verplanck et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2015 their behavior and elimination during wastewater treatment remains unclear and the imprint of wastewater loads on natural trace element cycles poorly quantified the laurentian great lakes hold 20 of the world s freshwater but also house 40 million people and 1000 wwtp government of ontario 2019 usepa cwns 2012 while there are significant differences in water quality across the great lakes basin many subregions are under stress from historic contamination as well as continued urbanization and industrialization baldwin et al 2016 holeton et al 2011 bentley et al 2022 wastewater effluent and stormwater runoff have been identified as a major environmental stress factors especially near urban areas marsalek and schroeter 1988 arvai et al 2014 previous work on the concentration ranges of pollutants in wastewater effluents and sewage sludges in the great lakes basin has focused mostly on nutrients heavy metals conservative elements e g chloride or organic pollutants poulton 1992 arvai et al 2014 baldwin et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 lu et al 2017 comparable information on the occurrence or loads of emerging trace elements in this region is comparatively scarce gagnon et al 2021 and studies often only consider one or a few selected wwtps or are geographically constrained to contaminated areas e g poulton 1992 in addition the international and state boundaries that divide up the great lakes basin and the different reporting requirements in these jurisdictions make it difficult to find consistent data on wastewater or biosolids quality for this region in the public domain in both canada and the us treated sewage sludge may be applied on agricultural land provided certain quality limits are adhered to yet few federal or provincial state regulations exist for trace elements government of ontario 2019 thus quantitative data on emerging trace element concentrations and loads sourced from wwtp in the great lakes region is critically needed to this end we analyzed trace element concentrations in wastewater effluents and digested sludges from 42 us and canadian wwtp across the entire great lakes basin the main objectives were i to quantitatively assess representative concentration ranges loading rates and removal efficiencies of trace elements during treatment in a representative selection of wwtp and ii to qualitatively explore potential sourcing of anthropogenic and geogenic trace element emissions through geospatial analysis of the connected sewersheds 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection samples of treated wastewater effluent and digested sludge were collected from 42 wwtp throughout the great lakes basin in august and september of 2019 and 2020 sludge samples were on average 1 month composites of the final digested sludge i e the aggregate of primary secondary and or tertiary treatment if present effluent samples were 24 h aggregates of the final effluent sent for discharge samples were taken once at a time chosen by the wwtp operators to allow for an unbiased sampling regime the strategy was to assess spatial rather than temporal trends the sampled facilities were selected such to provide reasonable representation of the 1000 wwtps in the great lakes basin based on geographic distribution wwtp from each of the five individual great lake watersheds were included number of connected population equivalents size and treatment type and catchment area sewershed characteristics table s1 a comparison between characteristics of the sampled wwtp versus those of other wwtp in the basin is provided in table s2 all sampled facilities are considered municipal wwtp and typically treat a combination of household wastewater industrial and commercial effluent and road runoff together the sampled wwtps service 3 0 million people roughly 8 of the total population in the great lakes basin government of ontario 2019 united states environmental protection agency 2012 united states geological survey 2021 select parameters of the sampled wwtp including average daily flow average daily sludge production connected population equivalents and treatment type can be found in table s1 but the sampled facilities requested to remain anonymous otherwise the wwtp were provided with prepackaged sampling kits that were shipped back by courier immediately upon sample collection digested sludge samples were collected in precleaned acid washed 250 ml hdpe wide mouth sample bottles nalgene and wastewater effluent samples were collected in precleaned acid washed 500 ml ptfe sample bottles kartell upon receipt effluent samples were immediately filtered through 0 2 μm ptfe membrane filters and analyzed for ph and conductivity mettler toledo sevenexcellence multimeter a 10 ml aliquot of the filtered wastewater was digested in bottle with 500 μl ultrapure 67 70 nitric acid hno3 anachemia before elemental analysis see section 2 2 2 because effluents were filtered prior to acidification reported concentrations for these samples reflect an operationally defined dissolved element concentration all sample bottles vials and processing materials were rinsed with ultrapure milliq deionized water 18 2 mω and 1 ultrapure hno3 before use and all samples were stored at 4 c in the dark between receipt processing and analysis 2 2 analytical methodology 2 2 1 acid digestion of sludge samples due to the variable water content between 1 and 34 of the sludge samples sludges were freeze dried and homogenized prior to acid digestion approximately 50 ml of sludge was frozen at 15 c for 72 h and subsequently freeze dried for 48 h to a constant dry weight using a 50 c freezone labconco benchtop freeze drier freeze dried samples were individually homogenized using an agate mortar and pestle total elemental fractions were recovered using two acid digestion techniques for which at least one method guaranteed acceptable recovery rates and element stability for long periods of time vriens et al 2017 i acid digestion using nitric acid hno3 hydrochloric acid hcl and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ii acid digestion with nitric acid hno3 hydrochloric acid hcl hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydrofluoric acid hf all acids and peroxides used were of ultra pure grade 47 51 hydrofluoric acid omnitrace 67 70 ultrapure nitric acid anachemia 30 32 ultrapure hydrogen peroxide vwr avantor and 36 5 38 0 high purity hydrochloric acid fisher chemical for acid digestion 50 mg freeze dried sludge was added to a 50 ml hvt50 teflon digestion vessel followed by the addition of 9 ml hno3 3 ml hcl and 2 ml h2o2 for method 1 or the addition of 9 ml hno3 3 ml hcl 2 ml h2o2 and 3 ml hf for method 2 the acids and peroxide were added slowly to prevent loss of material due to the release of co2 from organic matter oxidation in the samples the mixtures were subsequently digested for 40 min at 210 c using an anton paar multiwave5000 with in situ temperature sensor after digestion samples were cooled for 60 min and carefully transferred into precleaned falcon centrifuge tubes where they were diluted to 47 5 ml using ultrapure 18 mω milliq deionized water for quality assurance every batch of digestions included two blanks of each of the digestion acid mixtures up to four sample duplicates and two certified reference materials vhg sl1 metals in sewage sludge and vhg ssd1a metals in sewage amended soil in duplicate the average elemental recovery i e across all certified elements ranged from 83 to 98 for vhg sl1 and from 110 to 129 for vhg ssd1a table s3 elements with anomalous recoveries were not further investigated one digestion method was used for the quantification of each individual element in sludge which was selected based on the best recovery from above certified reference materials and attainable detection limits in the resulting matrix table s4 2 2 2 elemental analysis of sludge and water samples total concentrations of 63 major and trace elements in the digested sludge and filtered and acidified wastewater effluent samples were measured on an icap triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer tq icp ms thermo scientific the instrument was operated in three modes single quadrupole with no gas single

commercial certified aqueous reference materials aqua1 slrs6 and nist1643f were measured every n 10 samples a single isotope was used to quantify each element s total concentration typically the most abundant isotope and when needed a secondary isotope was used to confirm the absence of isobaric interference total p was additionally measured as phosphate in digested sludges and effluents on a thermo gallery discrete analyzer spectrophotometer details of the employed icp ms methodology including monitored isotopes and utilized analysis modes can be found in table s4 an overview of the methodological detection limits for the 63 elements analyzed in the sludge and effluent samples is provided in table s5 2 3 geospatial analyses 2 3 1 sewershed estimation trends and anomalies in the measured sludge and effluent concentrations and in calculated elemental loads were investigated by contrasting these to select characteristics of the wastewater catchment areas sewersheds of the sampled facilities for 18 out of 42 sampled wwtp a map of their connected sewersheds was publicly available and directly adopted for the remaining 24 facilities sewershed coverage was estimated as follows first delineations of known sewersheds were retrieved directly from municipal or wwtp technical staff these sewershed delineations are seemingly irregular and odd shaped but for increasing numbers of considered facilities can be assumed to approach a certain maximal radial extent fig s1 therefore estimates for the maximal sewershed boundaries were imposed at particular radial distances from each wwtp based on a relationship between the maximal sewershed extents and connected population equivalents for a subset of 32 wwtp 18 of which were included in the sample set 14 additional in the great lakes basin fig s2 subsequently the calculated maximal radial extents of estimated sewersheds were projected over the corresponding wwtp at their geometric center in arcgis pro after which developed land and road surface were clipped within the imposed circular sewersheds for this land cover data was retrieved from the ontario geohub and the national land cover database nlcd and road network data was retrieved from the esri database and ucla geoportal data sources detailed in table s6 to ensure consistency between data for the us and canada resolution for land cover data was unified at 3 m and intensity categories for developed land were aggregated into a single classifier across the basin basin wide road network data was adopted at a spatial resolution of 1 m and polylines were buffered at 25 m on each side to ensure inclusion of stormwater infrastructure and residential commercial and industrial properties along roads into the predicted sewershed to remove overlap of predicted sewersheds in agglomerated areas census subdivisions table s6 were used to separate service areas at the municipality level a comparison of the modeled versus known sewersheds in terms of size area population equivalents and land use can be found in fig s3 the final estimated sewersheds varied between 3 and 555 km2 in size which is well within the range for known sewershed areas and also service population equivalents in the predicted sewersheds ranging between 1100 and 1100 000 match well with those in the adopted known sewersheds and with population sizes in the catchment areas calculated from geospatial census data on population fig s3 land cover of both known and estimated sewersheds was dominated by developed land which covered roughly 75 of the sewershed surface areas the remaining 25 mostly consisted of a combination of barren land grassland agriculture or forest fig s3 the estimated and known sewershed delineations were subsequently used to assess various geospatial attributes of the connected wwtp service areas including locations of hospitals road density and predicted groundwater as levels table s6 as potential sources of trace elements to wastewater as discussed in the supporting information methods m1 2 3 2 source attribution potential sources of trace elements to wastewater were qualitatively investigated by examining correlations between calculated elemental loads and geospatial sewershed attributes using log linear regression in jmp 16 sas software elements for which 50 of sampled locations exhibited either sludge or effluent concentrations below detection limits table s5 were not further considered as loads could not be reliably calculated elements for which 50 of measurements were below their detection limit were further analyzed by treating values below these detection limits as objectively ranging between 0 and the respective limit in order to assess minimal and maximal possible concentrations at these locations all geochemical concentrations or loads and geospatial sewershed attributes were converted to continuous numeric values and log normalized to account for skew when applicable a detailed description of the performed data processing for three investigated correlations between trace element loads and sewershed attributes is provided in the supporting information methods m1 3 results and discussion 3 1 elemental concentrations in effluent and sludge samples the concentration ranges of elements measured in the digested sludge and effluent samples are summarized in fig 1 detailed statistics are provided in table s7 effluents and table s8 sludges measured ph and conductivity ranges in the effluents are provided in fig s4 in effluent samples the most abundant elements included major elements such as ca na k s as well as sr b li and mg with concentrations ranging between 100 μg l and 0 1 g l among the least abundant elements in the effluents were pge and ree including er pr lu pt tm and tb at concentrations 10 ng l on average from most to least abundant the concentrations in effluents differed by over 9 orders of magnitude in sludge samples the most abundant elements similarly consisted of ca na k s mg as well as p fe and al at concentrations between 100 mg kg to 100 g kg major elements with even higher expected abundances in sludge samples e g c n were not quantified the least abundant elements in sludge samples were generally the ree as well as trace elements such as re and pt with concentrations down to 0 01 mg kg overall the concentrations in the sludge samples varied by over 6 orders of magnitude so substantially less than the variability observed in effluent concentrations the distribution of measured effluent concentrations of select elements including mg s ca sn la yb and re was highly skewed i e at up to 100x the median concentration between sampled locations fig 1 the distributions for sludge concentrations were generally less skewed only re had a measured value 100x the median section 3 5 the lower variability and skew in sludge concentrations compared to the effluent samples is likely explained by the longer retention time represented by these samples 1 month versus 1 day aggregates for the sludge versus effluent samples respectively but further research e g using hydrodynamically resolved time series sampling at various treatment stages in wwtp is required to confirm this overall we observed highly variable distributions of elemental concentrations between sampled facilities even though average measured values were typically in line with their natural abundance patterns see comparison in fig s5 however various elements exhibited concentrations lod in either the sludge or effluent samples at 40 of sampled locations including na al k ti be and ta further work is required to accurately quantify these elements at trace levels as well as other trace elements not measured in this work e g ru ir os rh 3 2 comparison with previous studies and legal guidelines despite substantial variability in sludge and effluent concentrations concentration ranges in this study generally agree well i e within an order of magnitude with those reported previously in studies conducted in the united states westerhoff et al 2015 verplanck et al 2010 kiser et al 2009 switzerland vriens et al 2017 kaegi et al 2021 the united kingdom jackson et al 2010 sterritt and lester 1980 france buzier et al 2006 japan kawasaki et al 1998 germany nickel et al 2021 or italy carletti et al 2008 further comparison of previously reported values with the concentration ranges observed in this study is provided in tables s9 and s10 notably the average effluent concentrations of li and y as well as the average sludge concentrations of li zr tm and lu appear somewhat higher in this work than in previous studies although the general scarcity of data prevents further interpretation of these discrepancies measured sludge and effluent concentrations are compared with select applicable legal limits sludge for 9 elements and effluents for 20 elements in table s11 government of ontario 2019 united states environmental protection agency 2012 none of the sampled locations in the us or ontario appeared to exceed applicable guidelines for sludge concentrations although direct comparison was complicated by the fact that available concentration limits vary with the destination of the processed biosolids e g incinerated landfilled or used as fertilizer and other sludge properties e g nutrient content for effluents guidelines outlined in the ontario provincial water quality objectives pwqo apply to surface water concentrations after dilution and mixing of effluent with the receiving surface water body the average dilution for the sampled canadian facilities was a factor 21 data not shown without dilution there would have been 8 elements for which at least one sampled wwtp exceeds guideline concentrations at the point of discharge however all dilution corrected concentrations were below half the respective pwqo surface water limits table s11 sampled us facilities also did not surpass effluent quality guidelines the effluent concentrations of cu and zn were closest to their applicable limits albeit being below threshold values which highlights the importance of their continued monitoring especially considering that effluent and sludge guidelines apply to temporal averages and calculated concentration ranges in this work only provide a snapshot view of trace element levels in the sampled wwtp while the observed adherence to available guidelines indicates that further reduction of at least the regulated trace elements in wwtp is not critical the lack of guidelines for most other trace elements warrants that the possible impacts of the observed concentration ranges are further investigated 3 3 calculation of per person influent loads and basin wide effluent discharge for a mass balance assessment of elemental loads into and out of the sampled wwtps each facility was considered a black box trace elements enter the facility via the raw wastewater influent and leave through either the sludge or effluent fraction volatilization can be reasonably assumed negligible for most trace elements previous mass balance assessments suggest some 5 mass loss may occur for volatile elements such as hg but loss during the wastewater treatment process is negligible for trace metals such as cu cr ni pb mn cd and zn balogh and nollet 2008 karvelas et al 2003 therefore the sum of the sludge and effluent loads at each wwtp represents the total influent load in out the average per person influent load at a facility was subsequently calculated by dividing the total elemental load with the connected population equivalent and these were averaged for all sampled facilities across the great lakes basin as follows eq 1 l x i 1 n f s l u d g e x s l u d g e f e f f l e u n t x e f f l e u n t i connected population equivalent i where lx is the average per person load of element x x sludge and x effluent are the concentrations of element x in the sludge or effluent sample of each facility respectively and fsludge and feffluent are the average sludge production and effluent discharge rates of each facility respectively table s1 the basin wide average per capita loads were only calculated for n 35 out of 42 sampled wwtp 7 facilities exhibited effluent or sludge concentrations lod and for 59 out of 63 analyzed elements 50 of measured al ti be and ta concentrations were lod the resulting average influent loads varied from 1 g person day for major elements and nutrients such as na ca k si or p to 10 μg person day for trace elements such as ho re tm or lu fig 2 table s12 the reported average per person influent loads reflect averages from a service population of 3 09 million people roughly 7 7 of the population in the great lakes basin across a wide variety of treatment types facility sizes and sewershed characteristics providing an argument that these estimated loads are representative for the region the fact that the calculated per person loads are comparable i e within the same order of magnitude to per capita calculated in previous work vriens et al 2017 table s13 further suggests that trace element loads may be comparable across widely different geographic regions building on the same black box approach used above we further assessed basin wide elemental loads discharged to surface waters by extrapolating the average effluent loads of the sampled wwtp onto the total of 335 canadian and 1112 us facilities that discharge effluent into the great lakes watershed government of ontario 2019 united states environmental protection agency 2012 for this we considered all wwtp for which effluent concentrations could be measured n 40 and the same 59 elements considered in the influent load calculations discussed above the extrapolations indicate that the average basin wide wwtp derived effluent discharge loads vary between 10 000 tonnes yr tpy for major elements to 100 kg yr for ultratrace elements fig 2 for the great lakes basin a few estimates exist for the large scale loading rates of major elements cl na and heavy metals cu zn ni pb via atmospheric deposition or riverine input total runoff nriagu et al 1995 chapra et al 2009 bentley et al 2022 a back of the envelope comparison with these studies suggests that on a basin wide scale the estimated wwtp derived inputs of heavy metals e g 43 tpy cu 39 tpy ni or 6 tpy pb are well below natural riverine loading rates e g 2000 tpy cu 1800 tpy ni or 300 tpy pb bentley et al 2022 even in the more densely populated subbasins e g lake erie lake ontario however this does not preclude impact of wwtp effluents on water quality on tributary specific or localized scales bentley et al 2022 in addition the natural background fluxes in the great lakes basin or its specific tributary systems are unknown for most other trace elements investigated in this work finally the estimated basin wide elemental effluent discharge loads display patterns between trace elements that are different than those observed between the average per person influent loads compare plots in fig 2 this difference is reflective of the varying removal efficiencies of the investigated trace elements in the studied wwtps as is discussed next 3 4 removal efficiencies of trace elements across treatment types again deploying the black box approach discussed above the elimination rate or removal efficiency of a given element in a wwtp was assessed from the preferential enrichment of element influx into the sludge fraction and therefore not effluent the elimination rate or removal efficiency e x for any element x in each of the wwtp was calculated as eq 2 e x f s l u d g e x s l u d g e f s l u d g e x s l u d g e f e f f l e u n t x e f f l e u n t 100 where x sludge and x effluent are the concentrations of element x in the sludge or effluent sample of each facility respectively and fsludge and feffluent are the average sludge production and effluent discharge rates of each facility respectively table s1 the sampled wwtp for which elimination rates could be calculated were subdivided into three treatment designations according to the classification used by the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 2009 12 were considered tertiary 17 as secondary and 6 as less than secondary including primary preliminary and lagoon systems table s1 elemental elimination rates or removal efficiencies were subsequently compared across different treatment types as well as between different trace element groups figs 3 s7 tables s14 s15 the uncertainty in the calculated elimination rates or removal efficiencies i e error propagated from temporal variability in sludge production effluent discharge as well as concentrations is therefore somewhat offset by aggregating these elimination rates across wwtp and element groups a major performance criterion for wastewater treatment is p removal across the sampled facilities the average p removal efficiency between influent and effluent varied between 76 and 99 9 table s14 and the extent of p elimination consistently increased with treatment designation i e highest p removal efficiencies were obtained with advanced tertiary treatment facilities fig 3 the behaviors of p and fe during wastewater treatment are highly coupled and p precipitation by addition of fe is a commonly deployed p removal technique wilfert et al 2016 including in the facilities investigated in this work table s1 therefore expected a comparison of the total effluent loads of p and fe across the sampled facilities reveals a strong correlation that spans across treatment types fig 3 the removal efficiency of fe and that of most other investigated elements table s14 followed the trend of p when comparing average removal efficiencies across all studied elements tertiary wwtp achieved an average element removal efficiency of 74 secondary wwtp had an average removal efficiency of 71 and wwtp with a designation of less than secondary showed an average removal efficiency of 65 table s15 a comparison of removal efficiencies of specific groups of elements reveals that the generally less reactive and more soluble elements e g alkali and alkaline earth metals including na k ca and mg are not as efficiently removed as more reactive and insoluble elements e g transition metals and ree figs 3 s7 the average removal efficiency across 35 wwtp was 25 for alkali metals with li and rb being particularly low at 15 and 16 respectively 50 for alkaline earth metals 74 for transition metals and 85 for ree this ranking of element groups is observed at all treatment designation levels but increasing levels of treatment secondary secondary tertiary do not coincide with improved elimination of all elements for instance elements such as pb and w are consistently eliminated with 97 in all treatment designations however most transition metals and ree are on average not only more efficiently removed than alkali and alkaline earth metals but also exhibit improved elimination when the treatment designation increases from secondary to secondary to tertiary fig 3 interestingly removal efficiencies for ree at all three treatment designations are poorer for heavier ree such as lu yb and tm when compared to lighter ree such as ce pr and nd fig s7 although gd presents a clear outlier as discussed in section 3 5 2 the removal of trace elements from wastewater may be controlled by various mechanisms ranging from purely chemical precipitation to active biological absorption costley and wallis 2001 chen et al 2009 yet their elimination in the sampled tertiary facilities appears comparatively high irrespective of the deployed tertiary treatment technology e g uv ozonation membrane filtration all of which are typically not tailored to eliminate particular trace elements of concern although the adopted black box approach and lack of information on the aqueous speciation of the investigated trace elements preclude any speculation about the mechanisms underlying their elimination the higher average elimination of many trace elements observed in tertiary treatment facilities reflects an overall increased performance of tertiary wastewater treatment over secondary and primary treatment steps alone 3 5 trends and anomalies in concentrations and loading rates after evaluation of the distributions and skew of the measured concentration ranges fig 1 anomalies in measured concentrations and calculated loading rates were identified after arbitrarily defining anomalous as having a concentration or load that is at least 5x higher or lower than the median for a particular element extreme anomalies are considered those with concentrations or loads that are 10x higher or lower than the median value for a particular element overall such operationally defined outliers were scarce among the dataset effluent and sludge concentrations in the studied facilities were reasonably normally distributed for most elements tables s7 s8 anomalies were more abundant in the effluents than in the sludges but outliers in effluent concentrations generally do not correlate to outliers seen in sludge samples numerous facilities n 17 exhibited effluent samples simultaneously enriched in mg s and ca at 10x above average concentrations fig s8 suggesting a bimodal distribution in their influent load or elimination efficiency most other facilities with anomalous effluent or sludge concentrations only exhibited anomalies for one particular element suggesting that the majority of individual outliers originated from unique sources specific to the wwtp sewershed as will be further discussed below effluent samples from two wwtp showed anomalously high ree levels at 10x the median concentration of 10 ree and effluent samples from two other wwtp were depleted in ree having 5 different ree concentrations at more than 5x below the median concentration the consistent enrichment or depletion of ree concentrations at specific facilities is expected from the reasonably similar geochemical properties of these ree provided they are of geogenic origin kaegi et al 2021 while there were 100 positive outliers in the sludge and effluent concentration data in this dataset overall there were only 7 positive outliers in the calculated loads most of which presented an outlier in the effluent concentration data at the corresponding facilities this reduction in the number of outliers and variance in the dataset illustrates how consideration of loading rates over concentrations may render the interpretation of patterns across facilities less sensitive to wwtp specific factors such as differences in treatment capacity and therefore potential dilution of effluent or sludge concentrations we further examined trends in selected trace elements and their potential anthropogenic versus geogenic sourcing point versus diffuse through qualitative geospatial analyses the following sections aim to provide examples of the types of exploratory analyses of trace element behavior in wastewater systems that may be expanded to other trace element contaminants in future research 3 5 1 point sourced anomalies the element rhenium re was the only element with an outlier present at 100x the mean in both the sludge and effluent sample for a single wwtp although re is mostly used as a catalyst in the chemical industry as an alloy for jet engines or as an electrical contact carlen and bryskin 1994 lunk et al 2021 none of these applications were apparent in the connected sewershed instead the sewershed houses a recycling plant for re and other transition metal alloys with 5 metric ton yr capacity which likely acts as a point source for re to the municipal wastewater system anther anomaly at 10x median loads was observed for ni effluent and sludge loads at a facility near sudbury ontario colloquially referred to as nickel city sudbury hosts extensive ni cu deposits that have been mined since the late 1800 s the high ni concentrations observed in this location could stem from anthropogenic enrichment in the surface environment e g seepage or runoff from mining operations as well as from naturally high ni levels in ground and drinking water from the ni rich formations in the region crawford 1995 but further investigation is required to quantitatively apportion the contributions of these natural versus anthropogenic factors 3 5 2 diffuse anthropogenic sources gadolinium is a ree that is used as a contrast agent in medical imaging e g mri scanners unlike geogenic natural gd this anthropogenic gd is in the form of stable organo gd complexes that are poorly soluble and highly recalcitrant during wastewater treatment verplanck et al 2010 hissler et al 2014 bau et al 2006 in this work gd exhibited an average elimination of only 55 across all investigated wwtp investigated table s14 but gd concentrations were otherwise reasonably normally distributed with an overall skew 0 2 in the effluent and sludge samples table s7 to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic and potentially hospital sourced gd to the observed gd loads in the sampled wwtps gd concentrations were normalized to ree natural abundance patterns and the anthropogenic anomaly quantified by analyzing ree ratios supporting information methods m1 the resulting best fit correlation with the number of hospital beds in each of the corresponding sewersheds shows a relatively strong positive log linear regression fig 4 corroborating a likely sourcing of anthropogenic hospital derived gd throughout the basin lerat hardy et al 2019 the platinum group elements pt rh and pd are used in catalytic converters in automobiles and may be emitted during use mobilized as road dust and eventually find their way into municipal wastewater lesniewska et al 2004 rauch et al 2005 to qualitatively assess this potential pathway of pt to wastewater sampled in the present study the relationship between total wwtp influent pt loads and average road density in each of the connected sewersheds was explored supporting information methods m1 as can be seen in fig 4 the obtained best fit log linear regression is positive but weaker than the example of gd potential factors complicating a more direct correlation between pt loads and road density include the fact that pt may be equally emitted from other applications and industrial processes and that road length or density statistics alone do not account for road usage or intensity particularly across rural versus urban areas further work is therefore required to quantitatively substantiate this potential pathway of pt sourced to wastewater across geospatially heterogeneous study areas 3 5 3 diffuse natural sources in contrast to the examples discussed above as has limited applications in society or industry that would serve as a major point source of as to municipal wastewater systems mainly because of its well established toxicity while as rich industrial wastewater generated by mining and metal smelting activities is typically treated on site as may be introduced to municipal wastewater from background levels of as in drinking water the great lakes region is one with generally low groundwater as levels welch et al 2001 mcguigan et al 2010 but subtle variations in as levels in local drinking water supplies may be hypothesized to be reflected in wwtp loads we therefore contrasted the total as influent loads of wwtp serving sewersheds that are predominantly reliant on ground water to the probability of groundwater as levels exceeding 10 μg l determined by a global groundwater prediction model podgorski and berg 2020 supporting information methods m1 despite a lack of direct mechanistic support for the type of regression explored in this descriptive statistical assessment the resulting positive relationship fig 4 suggests that at least some of the as sourced to municipal wastewater may be of geogenic origin particularly in the considered rural areas that do not draw drinking water from one of the great lakes directly because diffusion of localized high as concentrations on the sewershed scale may obscure the influence of industrial wastewater discharges or non point source human waste streams additional data would be required to conclude that as dynamics at a particular wwtp outside the median are predominantly caused by geogenic sources parallel screening of as loads in drinking water versus influent wastewater may help quantify the potential contributions of these pathways to as loads observed in wwtp 3 5 4 residual uncertainty in source attribution overall the presented examples illustrate that both anthropogenic versus geogenic sources may possibly and differently contribute to trace element loads into wwtps in the great lakes basin while correlation does not equal causality future work on trace element sourcing to wastewater is required to resolve these various potential contributing factors firstly additional data collection might help alleviate some of the uncertainty associated with the presented estimates of concentration ranges and loading rates as well as with the subsequent geospatial analyses this includes time resolved sampling at different treatment stages and assessment of hydraulic retention rates or contact times in the sampled facilities as well as potential information from isotope or aqueous speciation analyses secondly improved delineation of sewershed coverage and characterization of its attributes across the entire wastewater infrastructure network is needed to refine source attribution across large spatial scales and ultimately help better predict trace element loading rates and mitigate wastewater derived environmental emissions 4 conclusions this study provides new insights into the concentration ranges loadings rates and removal efficiencies of trace elements in a representative selection of wastewater treatment facilities in the north american great lakes basin from our sampling trace element analyses black box mass balance calculations and geospatial analyses we conclude that 1 the concentration ranges of trace elements in effluents and biosolids as well as the therefrom calculated average per person trace element loads mostly follow natural abundance patterns and are similar across the various great lakes subbasins and similar to concentrations and loads reported in previous studies in other geographic regions 2 in contrast to conservative major elements and many transition metals pge and ree are effectively eliminated 90 during wastewater treatment whereby facilities with tertiary treatment technologies outperform those with primary or secondary treatment across all groups of trace elements 3 analysis of the geospatial attributes of the sampled sewersheds including demographics land use road surface or particular industrial activities may allow one to contextualize specific trends in trace element loads and explore plausible natural or anthropogenic source pathways our results illustrate that wastewater surveillance may be effectively used to quantify wastewater fluxes and emissions and contribute to an improved understanding of the sourcing of emerging trace element contaminants and their behavior during wastewater treatment additional data on emerging trace elements and their loads

16423,the growing use of trace elements in industrialized societies is driving an increase in the occurrence of trace elements in anthropogenic waste streams globally yet the large scale sources of many trace elements to wastewater and their elimination during treatment remain poorly understood and potential environmental impacts on freshwater systems therefore unclear we screened 42 wastewater treatment facilities in the north american great lakes basin and deployed a black box approach to calculate representative estimates for average per capita trace element loads and basin scale effluent discharge rates as well as trace element removal efficiencies across different treatment technologies our results show different removal of specific groups of trace elements during wastewater treatment average removal efficiencies were 25 for alkali metals 50 for alkaline earth metals 74 for transition metals and 85 for rare earth elements higher elimination of the majority of trace elements was generally achieved by more advanced tertiary treatment types elemental loads generally followed natural abundance patterns but anomalous loading rates were observed for various trace elements across the sampled facilities by examining geospatial attributes of the sampled sewersheds trends in select trace element loads were qualitatively tied to possible point sources and diffuse sources overall these results illustrate the potential of wastewater surveillance to inform environmental management of emerging trace element contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater trace elements great lakes emerging contaminants geospatial analysis 1 introduction in recent decades many trace elements have become critically important for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries the renewable energy sector as well as for defense and communications technologies eggert 2011 examples of such trace elements include rare earth elements ree platinum group elements pge precious metals such as au and ag as well as other transition metals and metalloids e g te tl ga in or ge consequently the mining processing and industrial and societal uses of these trace elements have grown exponentially around the world du and graedel 2011 nriagu and pacyna 1988 leading to increased environmental emissions along their life cycle i e from mining of ore itself li et al 2013 to consumer use and product degradation robinson 2009 zimmermann et al 2013 industrial and societal anthropogenic waste streams and corresponding environmental emissions of some trace elements are now large enough to alter their biogeochemical distribution patterns and cause detrimental effects to local environments lottermoser 1994 holeton et al 2011 rauch et al 2010 however except for selected heavy metals e g hg and pb and at specific contaminated sites e g downstream of industrial discharge richman and dreier 2001 there is comparatively little information on the large scale anthropogenic sourcing and environmental fate of most other trace elements the paucity of long term monitoring data for trace elements in waste streams and receiving environmental reservoirs e g the atmosphere soil and surface and groundwater on regional national as well as global scales complicates comprehensive ecotoxicological impact assessment government of ontario 2020 usgs national water information system gonzalez et al 2015 to mitigate or prevent potential deleterious effects of anthropogenic trace element emissions on the environment their occurrence and sourcing from human waste streams must thus be more quantitatively understood wastewater mirrors our society in the sense that many anthropogenic pollutants including microplastics engineered nanoparticles and pharmaceuticals find their way into municipal or industrial wastewater petrie et al 2015 laguardia et al 2010 kim et al 2010 kiser et al 2009 as a result wastewater surveillance has become an established tool to assess human imprints on contaminant dynamics and environmental emissions recently wastewater surveillance is even providing a cost effective means to monitor covid 19 prevalence in populations in useful spatiotemporal resolution larsen and wigginton 2020 wastewater also constitutes an ideal screening target to examine the sources and potential environmental footprints of human trace element use vriens et al 2017 merschel et al 2015 lim et al 2017 yet systematic data on trace element concentrations in wastewater and other urban runoff is scarce as these elements are typically not part of governmental surveillance programs vriens et al 2017 westerhoff et al 2015 nickel et al 2021 östman et al 2017 government of ontario 2019 usepa cwns 2012 at least in part due to the cost and challenges involved with their quantification at ultra trace levels wastewater may be considered a trace element source to the environment through multiple pathways e g through direct release of effluent to surface waters gobeil et al 2005 dickenson et al 2011 or through agricultural application of processed sewage sludge singh and agrawal 2008 unfortunately the loading rates of many emerging trace elements from and into wastewater treatment plants wwtp are not well understood different wwtp types primary secondary or tertiary consist of a series of sequential unit operations aimed at removing solids biogeochemical oxygen demand nutrients and other remaining suspended colloidal and dissolved constituents of concern ccme 2009 municipal treatment systems are becoming increasingly effective towards abovementioned performance criteria but they do typically not target specific groups of trace elements even though previous studies have implied that wastewater loads of trace elements such as cu zn hg and as can be substantial and their removal by conventional treatment technologies not very effective agoro et al 2020 karvelas et al 2003 balogh and nollet 2008 because of the generally limited data available for less abundant trace elements e g ree and pge vriens et al 2017 verplanck et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2015 their behavior and elimination during wastewater treatment remains unclear and the imprint of wastewater loads on natural trace element cycles poorly quantified the laurentian great lakes hold 20 of the world s freshwater but also house 40 million people and 1000 wwtp government of ontario 2019 usepa cwns 2012 while there are significant differences in water quality across the great lakes basin many subregions are under stress from historic contamination as well as continued urbanization and industrialization baldwin et al 2016 holeton et al 2011 bentley et al 2022 wastewater effluent and stormwater runoff have been identified as a major environmental stress factors especially near urban areas marsalek and schroeter 1988 arvai et al 2014 previous work on the concentration ranges of pollutants in wastewater effluents and sewage sludges in the great lakes basin has focused mostly on nutrients heavy metals conservative elements e g chloride or organic pollutants poulton 1992 arvai et al 2014 baldwin et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 lu et al 2017 comparable information on the occurrence or loads of emerging trace elements in this region is comparatively scarce gagnon et al 2021 and studies often only consider one or a few selected wwtps or are geographically constrained to contaminated areas e g poulton 1992 in addition the international and state boundaries that divide up the great lakes basin and the different reporting requirements in these jurisdictions make it difficult to find consistent data on wastewater or biosolids quality for this region in the public domain in both canada and the us treated sewage sludge may be applied on agricultural land provided certain quality limits are adhered to yet few federal or provincial state regulations exist for trace elements government of ontario 2019 thus quantitative data on emerging trace element concentrations and loads sourced from wwtp in the great lakes region is critically needed to this end we analyzed trace element concentrations in wastewater effluents and digested sludges from 42 us and canadian wwtp across the entire great lakes basin the main objectives were i to quantitatively assess representative concentration ranges loading rates and removal efficiencies of trace elements during treatment in a representative selection of wwtp and ii to qualitatively explore potential sourcing of anthropogenic and geogenic trace element emissions through geospatial analysis of the connected sewersheds 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection samples of treated wastewater effluent and digested sludge were collected from 42 wwtp throughout the great lakes basin in august and september of 2019 and 2020 sludge samples were on average 1 month composites of the final digested sludge i e the aggregate of primary secondary and or tertiary treatment if present effluent samples were 24 h aggregates of the final effluent sent for discharge samples were taken once at a time chosen by the wwtp operators to allow for an unbiased sampling regime the strategy was to assess spatial rather than temporal trends the sampled facilities were selected such to provide reasonable representation of the 1000 wwtps in the great lakes basin based on geographic distribution wwtp from each of the five individual great lake watersheds were included number of connected population equivalents size and treatment type and catchment area sewershed characteristics table s1 a comparison between characteristics of the sampled wwtp versus those of other wwtp in the basin is provided in table s2 all sampled facilities are considered municipal wwtp and typically treat a combination of household wastewater industrial and commercial effluent and road runoff together the sampled wwtps service 3 0 million people roughly 8 of the total population in the great lakes basin government of ontario 2019 united states environmental protection agency 2012 united states geological survey 2021 select parameters of the sampled wwtp including average daily flow average daily sludge production connected population equivalents and treatment type can be found in table s1 but the sampled facilities requested to remain anonymous otherwise the wwtp were provided with prepackaged sampling kits that were shipped back by courier immediately upon sample collection digested sludge samples were collected in precleaned acid washed 250 ml hdpe wide mouth sample bottles nalgene and wastewater effluent samples were collected in precleaned acid washed 500 ml ptfe sample bottles kartell upon receipt effluent samples were immediately filtered through 0 2 μm ptfe membrane filters and analyzed for ph and conductivity mettler toledo sevenexcellence multimeter a 10 ml aliquot of the filtered wastewater was digested in bottle with 500 μl ultrapure 67 70 nitric acid hno3 anachemia before elemental analysis see section 2 2 2 because effluents were filtered prior to acidification reported concentrations for these samples reflect an operationally defined dissolved element concentration all sample bottles vials and processing materials were rinsed with ultrapure milliq deionized water 18 2 mω and 1 ultrapure hno3 before use and all samples were stored at 4 c in the dark between receipt processing and analysis 2 2 analytical methodology 2 2 1 acid digestion of sludge samples due to the variable water content between 1 and 34 of the sludge samples sludges were freeze dried and homogenized prior to acid digestion approximately 50 ml of sludge was frozen at 15 c for 72 h and subsequently freeze dried for 48 h to a constant dry weight using a 50 c freezone labconco benchtop freeze drier freeze dried samples were individually homogenized using an agate mortar and pestle total elemental fractions were recovered using two acid digestion techniques for which at least one method guaranteed acceptable recovery rates and element stability for long periods of time vriens et al 2017 i acid digestion using nitric acid hno3 hydrochloric acid hcl and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ii acid digestion with nitric acid hno3 hydrochloric acid hcl hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydrofluoric acid hf all acids and peroxides used were of ultra pure grade 47 51 hydrofluoric acid omnitrace 67 70 ultrapure nitric acid anachemia 30 32 ultrapure hydrogen peroxide vwr avantor and 36 5 38 0 high purity hydrochloric acid fisher chemical for acid digestion 50 mg freeze dried sludge was added to a 50 ml hvt50 teflon digestion vessel followed by the addition of 9 ml hno3 3 ml hcl and 2 ml h2o2 for method 1 or the addition of 9 ml hno3 3 ml hcl 2 ml h2o2 and 3 ml hf for method 2 the acids and peroxide were added slowly to prevent loss of material due to the release of co2 from organic matter oxidation in the samples the mixtures were subsequently digested for 40 min at 210 c using an anton paar multiwave5000 with in situ temperature sensor after digestion samples were cooled for 60 min and carefully transferred into precleaned falcon centrifuge tubes where they were diluted to 47 5 ml using ultrapure 18 mω milliq deionized water for quality assurance every batch of digestions included two blanks of each of the digestion acid mixtures up to four sample duplicates and two certified reference materials vhg sl1 metals in sewage sludge and vhg ssd1a metals in sewage amended soil in duplicate the average elemental recovery i e across all certified elements ranged from 83 to 98 for vhg sl1 and from 110 to 129 for vhg ssd1a table s3 elements with anomalous recoveries were not further investigated one digestion method was used for the quantification of each individual element in sludge which was selected based on the best recovery from above certified reference materials and attainable detection limits in the resulting matrix table s4 2 2 2 elemental analysis of sludge and water samples total concentrations of 63 major and trace elements in the digested sludge and filtered and acidified wastewater effluent samples were measured on an icap triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer tq icp ms thermo scientific the instrument was operated in three modes single quadrupole with no gas single quadrupole in ked mode he collision gas and triple quadrupole o2 reaction gas utilizing mass shifting for sc v cr as sr y zr nb mo ba ce pr nd sm gd tb ho er tm lu hf ta blanks and in house and commercial certified aqueous reference materials aqua1 slrs6 and nist1643f were measured every n 10 samples a single isotope was used to quantify each element s total concentration typically the most abundant isotope and when needed a secondary isotope was used to confirm the absence of isobaric interference total p was additionally measured as phosphate in digested sludges and effluents on a thermo gallery discrete analyzer spectrophotometer details of the employed icp ms methodology including monitored isotopes and utilized analysis modes can be found in table s4 an overview of the methodological detection limits for the 63 elements analyzed in the sludge and effluent samples is provided in table s5 2 3 geospatial analyses 2 3 1 sewershed estimation trends and anomalies in the measured sludge and effluent concentrations and in calculated elemental loads were investigated by contrasting these to select characteristics of the wastewater catchment areas sewersheds of the sampled facilities for 18 out of 42 sampled wwtp a map of their connected sewersheds was publicly available and directly adopted for the remaining 24 facilities sewershed coverage was estimated as follows first delineations of known sewersheds were retrieved directly from municipal or wwtp technical staff these sewershed delineations are seemingly irregular and odd shaped but for increasing numbers of considered facilities can be assumed to approach a certain maximal radial extent fig s1 therefore estimates for the maximal sewershed boundaries were imposed at particular radial distances from each wwtp based on a relationship between the maximal sewershed extents and connected population equivalents for a subset of 32 wwtp 18 of which were included in the sample set 14 additional in the great lakes basin fig s2 subsequently the calculated maximal radial extents of estimated sewersheds were projected over the corresponding wwtp at their geometric center in arcgis pro after which developed land and road surface were clipped within the imposed circular sewersheds for this land cover data was retrieved from the ontario geohub and the national land cover database nlcd and road network data was retrieved from the esri database and ucla geoportal data sources detailed in table s6 to ensure consistency between data for the us and canada resolution for land cover data was unified at 3 m and intensity categories for developed land were aggregated into a single classifier across the basin basin wide road network data was adopted at a spatial resolution of 1 m and polylines were buffered at 25 m on each side to ensure inclusion of stormwater infrastructure and residential commercial and industrial properties along roads into the predicted sewershed to remove overlap of predicted sewersheds in agglomerated areas census subdivisions table s6 were used to separate service areas at the municipality level a comparison of the modeled versus known sewersheds in terms of size area population equivalents and land use can be found in fig s3 the final estimated sewersheds varied between 3 and 555 km2 in size which is well within the range for known sewershed areas and also service population equivalents in the predicted sewersheds ranging between 1100 and 1100 000 match well with those in the adopted known sewersheds and with population sizes in the catchment areas calculated from geospatial census data on population fig s3 land cover of both known and estimated sewersheds was dominated by developed land which covered roughly 75 of the sewershed surface areas the remaining 25 mostly consisted of a combination of barren land grassland agriculture or forest fig s3 the estimated and known sewershed delineations were subsequently used to assess various geospatial attributes of the connected wwtp service areas including locations of hospitals road density and predicted groundwater as levels table s6 as potential sources of trace elements to wastewater as discussed in the supporting information methods m1 2 3 2 source attribution potential sources of trace elements to wastewater were qualitatively investigated by examining correlations between calculated elemental loads and geospatial sewershed attributes using log linear regression in jmp 16 sas software elements for which 50 of sampled locations exhibited either sludge or effluent concentrations below detection limits table s5 were not further considered as loads could not be reliably calculated elements for which 50 of measurements were below their detection limit were further analyzed by treating values below these detection limits as objectively ranging between 0 and the respective limit in order to assess minimal and maximal possible concentrations at these locations all geochemical concentrations or loads and geospatial sewershed attributes were converted to continuous numeric values and log normalized to account for skew when applicable a detailed description of the performed data processing for three investigated correlations between trace element loads and sewershed attributes is provided in the supporting information methods m1 3 results and discussion 3 1 elemental concentrations in effluent and sludge samples the concentration ranges of elements measured in the digested sludge and effluent samples are summarized in fig 1 detailed statistics are provided in table s7 effluents and table s8 sludges measured ph and conductivity ranges in the effluents are provided in fig s4 in effluent samples the most abundant elements included major elements such as ca na k s as well as sr b li and mg with concentrations ranging between 100 μg l and 0 1 g l among the least abundant elements in the effluents were pge and ree including er pr lu pt tm and tb at concentrations 10 ng l on average from most to least abundant the concentrations in effluents differed by over 9 orders of magnitude in sludge samples the most abundant elements similarly consisted of ca na k s mg as well as p fe and al at concentrations between 100 mg kg to 100 g kg major elements with even higher expected abundances in sludge samples e g c n were not quantified the least abundant elements in sludge samples were generally the ree as well as trace elements such as re and pt with concentrations down to 0 01 mg kg overall the concentrations in the sludge samples varied by over 6 orders of magnitude so substantially less than the variability observed in effluent concentrations the distribution of measured effluent concentrations of select elements including mg s ca sn la yb and re was highly skewed i e at up to 100x the median concentration between sampled locations fig 1 the distributions for sludge concentrations were generally less skewed only re had a measured value 100x the median section 3 5 the lower variability and skew in sludge concentrations compared to the effluent samples is likely explained by the longer retention time represented by these samples 1 month versus 1 day aggregates for the sludge versus effluent samples respectively but further research e g using hydrodynamically resolved time series sampling at various treatment stages in wwtp is required to confirm this overall we observed highly variable distributions of elemental concentrations between sampled facilities even though average measured values were typically in line with their natural abundance patterns see comparison in fig s5 however various elements exhibited concentrations lod in either the sludge or effluent samples at 40 of sampled locations including na al k ti be and ta further work is required to accurately quantify these elements at trace levels as well as other trace elements not measured in this work e g ru ir os rh 3 2 comparison with previous studies and legal guidelines despite substantial variability in sludge and effluent concentrations concentration ranges in this study generally agree well i e within an order of magnitude with those reported previously in studies conducted in the united states westerhoff et al 2015 verplanck et al 2010 kiser et al 2009 switzerland vriens et al 2017 kaegi et al 2021 the united kingdom jackson et al 2010 sterritt and lester 1980 france buzier et al 2006 japan kawasaki et al 1998 germany nickel et al 2021 or italy carletti et al 2008 further comparison of previously reported values with the concentration ranges observed in this study is provided in tables s9 and s10 notably the average effluent concentrations of li and y as well as the average sludge concentrations of li zr tm and lu appear somewhat higher in this work than in previous studies although the general scarcity of data prevents further interpretation of these discrepancies measured sludge and effluent concentrations are compared with select applicable legal limits sludge for 9 elements and effluents for 20 elements in table s11 government of ontario 2019 united states environmental protection agency 2012 none of the sampled locations in the us or ontario appeared to exceed applicable guidelines for sludge concentrations although direct comparison was complicated by the fact that available concentration limits vary with the destination of the processed biosolids e g incinerated landfilled or used as fertilizer and other sludge properties e g nutrient content for effluents guidelines outlined in the ontario provincial water quality objectives pwqo apply to surface water concentrations after dilution and mixing of effluent with the receiving surface water body the average dilution for the sampled canadian facilities was a factor 21 data not shown without dilution there would have been 8 elements for which at least one sampled wwtp exceeds guideline concentrations at the point of discharge however all dilution corrected concentrations were below half the respective pwqo surface water limits table s11 sampled us facilities also did not surpass effluent quality guidelines the effluent concentrations of cu and zn were closest to their applicable limits albeit being below threshold values which highlights the importance of their continued monitoring especially considering that effluent and sludge guidelines apply to temporal averages and calculated concentration ranges in this work only provide a snapshot view of trace element levels in the sampled wwtp while the observed adherence to available guidelines indicates that further reduction of at least the regulated trace elements in wwtp is not critical the lack of guidelines for most other trace elements warrants that the possible impacts of the observed concentration ranges are further investigated 3 3 calculation of per person influent loads and basin wide effluent discharge for a mass balance assessment of elemental loads into and out of the sampled wwtps each facility was considered a black box trace elements enter the facility via the raw wastewater influent and leave through either the sludge or effluent fraction volatilization can be reasonably assumed negligible for most trace elements previous mass balance assessments suggest some 5 mass loss may occur for volatile elements such as hg but loss during the wastewater treatment process is negligible for trace metals such as cu cr ni pb mn cd and zn balogh and nollet 2008 karvelas et al 2003 therefore the sum of the sludge and effluent loads at each wwtp represents the total influent load in out the average per person influent load at a facility was subsequently calculated by dividing the total elemental load with the connected population equivalent and these were averaged for all sampled facilities across the great lakes basin as follows eq 1 l x i 1 n f s l u d g e x s l u d g e f e f f l e u n t x e f f l e u n t i connected population equivalent i where lx is the average per person load of element x x sludge and x effluent are the concentrations of element x in the sludge or effluent sample of each facility respectively and fsludge and feffluent are the average sludge production and effluent discharge rates of each facility respectively table s1 the basin wide average per capita loads were only calculated for n 35 out of 42 sampled wwtp 7 facilities exhibited effluent or sludge concentrations lod and for 59 out of 63 analyzed elements 50 of measured al ti be and ta concentrations were lod the resulting average influent loads varied from 1 g person day for major elements and nutrients such as na ca k si or p to 10 μg person day for trace elements such as ho re tm or lu fig 2 table s12 the reported average per person influent loads reflect averages from a service population of 3 09 million people roughly 7 7 of the population in the great lakes basin across a wide variety of treatment types facility sizes and sewershed characteristics providing an argument that these estimated loads are representative for the region the fact that the calculated per person loads are comparable i e within the same order of magnitude to per capita calculated in previous work vriens et al 2017 table s13 further suggests that trace element loads may be comparable across widely different geographic regions building on the same black box approach used above we further assessed basin wide elemental loads discharged to surface waters by extrapolating the average effluent loads of the sampled wwtp onto the total of 335 canadian and 1112 us facilities that discharge effluent into the great lakes watershed government of ontario 2019 united states environmental protection agency 2012 for this we considered all wwtp for which effluent concentrations could be measured n 40 and the same 59 elements considered in the influent load calculations discussed above the extrapolations indicate that the average basin wide wwtp derived effluent discharge loads vary between 10 000 tonnes yr tpy for major elements to 100 kg yr for ultratrace elements fig 2 for the great lakes basin a few estimates exist for the large scale loading rates of major elements cl na and heavy metals cu zn ni pb via atmospheric deposition or riverine input total runoff nriagu et al 1995 chapra et al 2009 bentley et al 2022 a back of the envelope comparison with these studies suggests that on a basin wide scale the estimated wwtp derived inputs of heavy metals e g 43 tpy cu 39 tpy ni or 6 tpy pb are well below natural riverine loading rates e g 2000 tpy cu 1800 tpy ni or 300 tpy pb bentley et al 2022 even in the more densely populated subbasins e g lake erie lake ontario however this does not preclude impact of wwtp effluents on water quality on tributary specific or localized scales bentley et al 2022 in addition the natural background fluxes in the great lakes basin or its specific tributary systems are unknown for most other trace elements investigated in this work finally the estimated basin wide elemental effluent discharge loads display patterns between trace elements that are different than those observed between the average per person influent loads compare plots in fig 2 this difference is reflective of the varying removal efficiencies of the investigated trace elements in the studied wwtps as is discussed next 3 4 removal efficiencies of trace elements across treatment types again deploying the black box approach discussed above the elimination rate or removal efficiency of a given element in a wwtp was assessed from the preferential enrichment of element influx into the sludge fraction and therefore not effluent the elimination rate or removal efficiency e x for any element x in each of the wwtp was calculated as eq 2 e x f s l u d g e x s l u d g e f s l u d g e x s l u d g e f e f f l e u n t x e f f l e u n t 100 where x sludge and x effluent are the concentrations of element x in the sludge or effluent sample of each facility respectively and fsludge and feffluent are the average sludge production and effluent discharge rates of each facility respectively table s1 the sampled wwtp for which elimination rates could be calculated were subdivided into three treatment designations according to the classification used by the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 2009 12 were considered tertiary 17 as secondary and 6 as less than secondary including primary preliminary and lagoon systems table s1 elemental elimination rates or removal efficiencies were subsequently compared across different treatment types as well as between different trace element groups figs 3 s7 tables s14 s15 the uncertainty in the calculated elimination rates or removal efficiencies i e error propagated from temporal variability in sludge production effluent discharge as well as concentrations is therefore somewhat offset by aggregating these elimination rates across wwtp and element groups a major performance criterion for wastewater treatment is p removal across the sampled facilities the average p removal efficiency between influent and effluent varied between 76 and 99 9 table s14 and the extent of p elimination consistently increased with treatment designation i e highest p removal efficiencies were obtained with advanced tertiary treatment facilities fig 3 the behaviors of p and fe during wastewater treatment are highly coupled and p precipitation by addition of fe is a commonly deployed p removal technique wilfert et al 2016 including in the facilities investigated in this work table s1 therefore expected a comparison of the total effluent loads of p and fe across the sampled facilities reveals a strong correlation that spans across treatment types fig 3 the removal efficiency of fe and that of most other investigated elements table s14 followed the trend of p when comparing average removal efficiencies across all studied elements tertiary wwtp achieved an average element removal efficiency of 74 secondary wwtp had an average removal efficiency of 71 and wwtp with a designation of less than secondary showed an average removal efficiency of 65 table s15 a comparison of removal efficiencies of specific groups of elements reveals that the generally less reactive and more soluble elements e g alkali and alkaline earth metals including na k ca and mg are not as efficiently removed as more reactive and insoluble elements e g transition metals and ree figs 3 s7 the average removal efficiency across 35 wwtp was 25 for alkali metals with li and rb being particularly low at 15 and 16 respectively 50 for alkaline earth metals 74 for transition metals and 85 for ree this ranking of element groups is observed at all treatment designation levels but increasing levels of treatment secondary secondary tertiary do not coincide with improved elimination of all elements for instance elements such as pb and w are consistently eliminated with 97 in all treatment designations however most transition metals and ree are on average not only more efficiently removed than alkali and alkaline earth metals but also exhibit improved elimination when the treatment designation increases from secondary to secondary to tertiary fig 3 interestingly removal efficiencies for ree at all three treatment designations are poorer for heavier ree such as lu yb and tm when compared to lighter ree such as ce pr and nd fig s7 although gd presents a clear outlier as discussed in section 3 5 2 the removal of trace elements from wastewater may be controlled by various mechanisms ranging from purely chemical precipitation to active biological absorption costley and wallis 2001 chen et al 2009 yet their elimination in the sampled tertiary facilities appears comparatively high irrespective of the deployed tertiary treatment technology e g uv ozonation membrane filtration all of which are typically not tailored to eliminate particular trace elements of concern although the adopted black box approach and lack of information on the aqueous speciation of the investigated trace elements preclude any speculation about the mechanisms underlying their elimination the higher average elimination of many trace elements observed in tertiary treatment facilities reflects an overall increased performance of tertiary wastewater treatment over secondary and primary treatment steps alone 3 5 trends and anomalies in concentrations and loading rates after evaluation of the distributions and skew of the measured concentration ranges fig 1 anomalies in measured concentrations and calculated loading rates were identified after arbitrarily defining anomalous as having a concentration or load that is at least 5x higher or lower than the median for a particular element extreme anomalies are considered those with concentrations or loads that are 10x higher or lower than the median value for a particular element overall such operationally defined outliers were scarce among the dataset effluent and sludge concentrations in the studied facilities were reasonably normally distributed for most elements tables s7 s8 anomalies were more abundant in the effluents than in the sludges but outliers in effluent concentrations generally do not correlate to outliers seen in sludge samples numerous facilities n 17 exhibited effluent samples simultaneously enriched in mg s and ca at 10x above average concentrations fig s8 suggesting a bimodal distribution in their influent load or elimination efficiency most other facilities with anomalous effluent or sludge concentrations only exhibited anomalies for one particular element suggesting that the majority of individual outliers originated from unique sources specific to the wwtp sewershed as will be further discussed below effluent samples from two wwtp showed anomalously high ree levels at 10x the median concentration of 10 ree and effluent samples from two other wwtp were depleted in ree having 5 different ree concentrations at more than 5x below the median concentration the consistent enrichment or depletion of ree concentrations at specific facilities is expected from the reasonably similar geochemical properties of these ree provided they are of geogenic origin kaegi et al 2021 while there were 100 positive outliers in the sludge and effluent concentration data in this dataset overall there were only 7 positive outliers in the calculated loads most of which presented an outlier in the effluent concentration data at the corresponding facilities this reduction in the number of outliers and variance in the dataset illustrates how consideration of loading rates over concentrations may render the interpretation of patterns across facilities less sensitive to wwtp specific factors such as differences in treatment capacity and therefore potential dilution of effluent or sludge concentrations we further examined trends in selected trace elements and their potential anthropogenic versus geogenic sourcing point versus diffuse through qualitative geospatial analyses the following sections aim to provide examples of the types of exploratory analyses of trace element behavior in wastewater systems that may be expanded to other trace element contaminants in future research 3 5 1 point sourced anomalies the element rhenium re was the only element with an outlier present at 100x the mean in both the sludge and effluent sample for a single wwtp although re is mostly used as a catalyst in the chemical industry as an alloy for jet engines or as an electrical contact carlen and bryskin 1994 lunk et al 2021 none of these applications were apparent in the connected sewershed instead the sewershed houses a recycling plant for re and other transition metal alloys with 5 metric ton yr capacity which likely acts as a point source for re to the municipal wastewater system anther anomaly at 10x median loads was observed for ni effluent and sludge loads at a facility near sudbury ontario colloquially referred to as nickel city sudbury hosts extensive ni cu deposits that have been mined since the late 1800 s the high ni concentrations observed in this location could stem from anthropogenic enrichment in the surface environment e g seepage or runoff from mining operations as well as from naturally high ni levels in ground and drinking water from the ni rich formations in the region crawford 1995 but further investigation is required to quantitatively apportion the contributions of these natural versus anthropogenic factors 3 5 2 diffuse anthropogenic sources gadolinium is a ree that is used as a contrast agent in medical imaging e g mri scanners unlike geogenic natural gd this anthropogenic gd is in the form of stable organo gd complexes that are poorly soluble and highly recalcitrant during wastewater treatment verplanck et al 2010 hissler et al 2014 bau et al 2006 in this work gd exhibited an average elimination of only 55 across all investigated wwtp investigated table s14 but gd concentrations were otherwise reasonably normally distributed with an overall skew 0 2 in the effluent and sludge samples table s7 to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic and potentially hospital sourced gd to the observed gd loads in the sampled wwtps gd concentrations were normalized to ree natural abundance patterns and the anthropogenic anomaly quantified by analyzing ree ratios supporting information methods m1 the resulting best fit correlation with the number of hospital beds in each of the corresponding sewersheds shows a relatively strong positive log linear regression fig 4 corroborating a likely sourcing of anthropogenic hospital derived gd throughout the basin lerat hardy et al 2019 the platinum group elements pt rh and pd are used in catalytic converters in automobiles and may be emitted during use mobilized as road dust and eventually find their way into municipal wastewater lesniewska et al 2004 rauch et al 2005 to qualitatively assess this potential pathway of pt to wastewater sampled in the present study the relationship between total wwtp influent pt loads and average road density in each of the connected sewersheds was explored supporting information methods m1 as can be seen in fig 4 the obtained best fit log linear regression is positive but weaker than the example of gd potential factors complicating a more direct correlation between pt loads and road density include the fact that pt may be equally emitted from other applications and industrial processes and that road length or density statistics alone do not account for road usage or intensity particularly across rural versus urban areas further work is therefore required to quantitatively substantiate this potential pathway of pt sourced to wastewater across geospatially heterogeneous study areas 3 5 3 diffuse natural sources in contrast to the examples discussed above as has limited applications in society or industry that would serve as a major point source of as to municipal wastewater systems mainly because of its well established toxicity while as rich industrial wastewater generated by mining and metal smelting activities is typically treated on site as may be introduced to municipal wastewater from background levels of as in drinking water the great lakes region is one with generally low groundwater as levels welch et al 2001 mcguigan et al 2010 but subtle variations in as levels in local drinking water supplies may be hypothesized to be reflected in wwtp loads we therefore contrasted the total as influent loads of wwtp serving sewersheds that are predominantly reliant on ground water to the probability of groundwater as levels exceeding 10 μg l determined by a global groundwater prediction model podgorski and berg 2020 supporting information methods m1 despite a lack of direct mechanistic support for the type of regression explored in this descriptive statistical assessment the resulting positive relationship fig 4 suggests that at least some of the as sourced to municipal wastewater may be of geogenic origin particularly in the considered rural areas that do not draw drinking water from one of the great lakes directly because diffusion of localized high as concentrations on the sewershed scale may obscure the influence of industrial wastewater discharges or non point source human waste streams additional data would be required to conclude that as dynamics at a particular wwtp outside the median are predominantly caused by geogenic sources parallel screening of as loads in drinking water versus influent wastewater may help quantify the potential contributions of these pathways to as loads observed in wwtp 3 5 4 residual uncertainty in source attribution overall the presented examples illustrate that both anthropogenic versus geogenic sources may possibly and differently contribute to trace element loads into wwtps in the great lakes basin while correlation does not equal causality future work on trace element sourcing to wastewater is required to resolve these various potential contributing factors firstly additional data collection might help alleviate some of the uncertainty associated with the presented estimates of concentration ranges and loading rates as well as with the subsequent geospatial analyses this includes time resolved sampling at different treatment stages and assessment of hydraulic retention rates or contact times in the sampled facilities as well as potential information from isotope or aqueous speciation analyses secondly improved delineation of sewershed coverage and characterization of its attributes across the entire wastewater infrastructure network is needed to refine source attribution across large spatial scales and ultimately help better predict trace element loading rates and mitigate wastewater derived environmental emissions 4 conclusions this study provides new insights into the concentration ranges loadings rates and removal efficiencies of trace elements in a representative selection of wastewater treatment facilities in the north american great lakes basin from our sampling trace element analyses black box mass balance calculations and geospatial analyses we conclude that 1 the concentration ranges of trace elements in effluents and biosolids as well as the therefrom calculated average per person trace element loads mostly follow natural abundance patterns and are similar across the various great lakes subbasins and similar to concentrations and loads reported in previous studies in other geographic regions 2 in contrast to conservative major elements and many transition metals pge and ree are effectively eliminated 90 during wastewater treatment whereby facilities with tertiary treatment technologies outperform those with primary or secondary treatment across all groups of trace elements 3 analysis of the geospatial attributes of the sampled sewersheds including demographics land use road surface or particular industrial activities may allow one to contextualize specific trends in trace element loads and explore plausible natural or anthropogenic source pathways our results illustrate that wastewater surveillance may be effectively used to quantify wastewater fluxes and emissions and contribute to an improved understanding of the sourcing of emerging trace element contaminants and their behavior during wastewater treatment additional data on emerging trace elements and their loads passing through wastewater treatment facilities in the great lakes region is critically needed to understand their potential environmental impacts more quantitatively and to optimize large scale

16424,it is a critical challenge for drinking water production when treating algae contaminated surface water in this study the impact of in situ coagulation c activated alumina filtration aa and their combination caa on the performance of gravity driven membrane gdm was systematically assessed during 105 day operation the results indicated that pretreatments in particular caa could effectively enhance gdm flux and the stable fluxes were increased to 3 1 4 9 and 8 3 l m2 h lmh for cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm respectively when compared to the control gdm 2 0 lmh coagulation was beneficial to formation of thick but loose biofouling layer while aa filtration was effective to retain foulants including extracellular polymeric substances eps organics total nitrogen and total phosphorus the caa gdm could mostly remove these foulants and facilitate the proliferation of bacterial genera that could consume eps further alleviating membrane fouling the difference in loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps of biofouling layer attributed to the difference of reversible fouling and irreversible fouling respectively morphological observations variation in functional groups or elements further confirmed the difference in biological layers in different gdm systems the occurrence of specific bacterial genera involving the potential to degrade protein chitin and other high molecular weight organics was responsible for contaminant removals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity driven membrane gdm flux stabilization in situ coagulation extracellular polymeric substances eps bacterial community biofouling layer 1 introduction the availability of safe drinking water is a key issue and surface water bodies suffer from algal bloom and eutrophication in particular the excessive total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp posed a great challenge to drinking water production zhou et al 2014 nowadays there are a considerable number of people throughout the world who have no access to clean water from waterworks ultrafiltration uf membranes have been increasingly used in large scale drinking water treatment plants chang et al 2017 yu et al 2020 and are often used coupling with pretreatment technologies e g air flotation coagulation and filtration to treat contaminated water by algae pramanik et al 2015 qi et al 2018 zhang and fu 2018 gravity driven membrane gdm filtration also known as biofilm controlled uf is particularly suitable for decentralized water treatment due to low maintenance or low energy characteristics peter varbanets et al 2012 pronk et al 2019 sima and elimelech 2013 gdm has been used for the treatment of surface water secondary effluent seawater and shale gas wastewater chang et al 2019b du et al 2021 shao et al 2017 wu et al 2017a the feature of low flux in gdm favors the formation of biofilm which possesses a function of biological decontamination on the filter cake layer thereby reducing membrane pore clogging ding et al 2021 shao et al 2017 usually the formation of biofilm in gdm system requires several weeks e g 20 30 days derlon et al 2014 pronk et al 2019 and both the bacteria and eukaryote species were conductive to the formation of a looser cake layer derlon et al 2012 2013 this can effectively reduce the frequency of hydraulic backwashing of uf membranes and improve the permeate water quality as operation elapsed gdm filtration may be not effective for the removal of dissolved pollutants e g micromolecular organic matter and ammonia nitrogen potentially deteriorating the effluent water quality akhondi et al 2015 du et al 2019 wu et al 2016 appropriate approaches are required to either improve the quality of feed water or enhance the structure and activity of the biofouling layer pronk et al 2019 it has been proved that pre coating of activated carbon ac filter on gdm surface could adsorb natural organic matter nom and serve them as nutrients which is favorable for enhancing microbial activity shao et al 2017 tang et al 2018b constructed an integrated ac gdm unit and segregated them by a plexiglass mesh resulting in a slight membrane fouling xu et al 2021 separated filter media and gdm as biofiltration gdm unit to extent the contact time of filter media and pollutants and demonstrated that this system exhibited a better nom removal and a lighter irreversible fouling than the integrated unit in addition the type of filter media exerts a significant influence on contaminant removals shao et al 2017 compared to ac filter activated alumina aa filter exhibits higher removals of nitrate nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus through hydrolysis increasing the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and is more suitable for the treatment of eutrophicated water mittal et al 2020 tan et al 2021 however neither biofiltration nor gdm could be adapted when feed water contains larger amounts of colloidal particles and algae cells particularly for algal bloom and eutrophication water bodies hindering the application of biofiltration gdm process as coagulation is mostly applied to remove algal cells nom and colloids jin et al 2017 it is potential to applied prior to a biofiltration gdm when there were high contents of algae cells colloids and nom in raw water besides the flocs formed during coagulation process can improve the cake layer characteristics ji et al 2010 thus reducing uf membrane fouling alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 however the effect of flocs on the biological activity of uf remains in dispute in published literature ding et al 2017b demonstrated that in situ coagulation were detrimental to the biological activity and caused an unstable membrane flux at the later stages of uf in contrast liu et al 2017 reported that aluminum salt flocs and nonionic polyacrylamide flocs were helpful to improve the biological decontamination performance and to reduce the irreversible membrane fouling resistance the superiority of dual coagulation on the performance of gdm during filtration of algae polluted water has been demonstrated du et al 2020 therefore the role of in situ coagulation combined with biofiltration could highly influence the properties of the biofouling layer and microbial community yu et al 2013 extending the applicability of gdm by improving flux and water quality lee et al 2019 wu et al 2017b up to now little is known about the performance of gdm in the simultaneous presence of coagulation and aa filtration thus an economic pretreatment of dual coagulation combined with aa biofiltration was applied to resolve sudden increasing of contaminants or algal laden water in gdm system and influence bio cake layer characteristics with light membrane fouling in this study four gdm systems were operated in parallel for treatment of algae rich river water including a gdm alone gdm gdm following in situ coagulation cgdm gdm following aa filtration aa gdm and gdm following in situ coagulation and aa filtration caa gdm the objectives of this study were a to elucidate the flux stabilization behaviors and the underlying mechanisms of the four processes b to investigate the removal performance for primary contaminants and c to evaluate the characteristics of the biofouling layer in different gdm systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water the test water was collected from rushan river 36 94 n 121 47 e shandong china the temperature of the raw water ranged from 15 to 28 c with seasonal variation and a digital thermostat was applied to keep the temperature of the feed water constant at

study for the detailed information about the preparation of coagulant and operation of in situ coagulation du et al 2020 the biofilter height 250 mm diameter 200 mm filled with 200 mm height of aa filter media with 4 00 mm particle size and the filter was operated under an empty bed contact time of 45 5 min and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 54 6 min in the velocities of 0 15 0 23 m h in the aa gdm and caa gdm systems the flow rate of aa filtration and gdm filtration were identical due to the interconnected installation 2 2 experimental setups and experimental procedures the schematic diagrams for gdm systems are shown in fig s1 si for the control gdm a raw water tank was connected with a uf membrane tank 7 6 l with an initial hrt of 49 8 min in cgdm and caa gdm coagulant was dosed into a static mixer by a dosing pump at a flux of 1 4 ml min before the uf membrane tank an aa filter was employed before the gdm in aa gdm and caa gdm system an air pump was placed at the bottom of the gdm to maintain a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 5 5 6 0 mg l the gravity driven pressure was maintained at 0 1 bar i e 1 0 m by keeping the liquid level constant using an overflow system there was no additional sludge inoculation in any of the four systems at the beginning of the experiment and no sludge was discharged during the whole operation an identical outside in hollow fiber uf membrane consisting of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf litree co hainan china with a nominal molecular weight cut off of 100 kda was employed in gdm systems aeration pipes which were connected with an air pump were installed in the bottom of membrane tank and only operated for 15 min when there was a sudden deterioration in raw water quality i e on day 10th 30th 60th and 90th and the details were described in si the external diameter of the membrane was 1 0 mm and the module in each gdm had a total effective filtration area of 0 366 m2 the uf membrane module was orientated vertically and operated in submerged filtration mode the description of the calculation of flux and resistance is summarized in si operation was interrupted for five days due to equipment maintenance days 61 65 at the end of experiment on day 105 the uf membranes were hydraulically backwashed to quantify the membrane fouling resistance as described in si 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chlorophyll a analysis extraction of chlorophyll a in test water was carried out overnight using 5 ml of 90 acetone chlorophyll a absorption was then determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv2600 shimadzu japan by measuring the absorbance at 665 and 750 nm after zeroing using acetone as described in si 2 3 2 morphology of biofouling layers the morphology of the biofouling layer and uf membrane was characterized using a scanning electron microscopy sem hithachi su8010 japan and atomic force microscope afm nanonavi e sweep japan the roughness of biofouling layer was analyzed by nanoscope analysis 5 0 using the rough of mean square rms method the fouling layer attached to the membrane surface was investigated using a dmi6000 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcs sp5 germany with staining for bacteria and polysaccharides the descriptions of clsm were detailly informed in si 2 3 3 ftir and xps spectra fouled membranes were measured by ftir spectrometer nicolet 380 thermo usa in the wavenumbers from 4000 to 625 cm 1 the xps spectra of the flocculants were conducted in an axis ultra dld x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps kratos uk and the results were analyzed by software of xps peak to investigate the element on the fouled membrane 2 3 4 eps and atp measurements as described in previous literature adav and lee 2008 ding et al 2017b samples were extracted with a 5 min sonication under the power of 120 w followed by formaldehyde and naoh and then the loosely bound eps lb eps and the tightly bound eps tb eps fractions were collected by centrifuging for 15 min at 4000 r min and 10 000 r min respectively the protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid and the content of polysaccharides by the anthrone sulphuric method the abbreviated terms lb epspr and lb epsps represent protein and polysaccharides of the lb eps respectively and tb epspr and tb epsps are short for those of the tb eps atp content of the biofouling layer attached to the membrane surface was measured using the bactiter glo promega corporation kit using the supplier protocol ding et al 2017a 2 3 5 bacterial community analysis at the end of experiment the membrane silks scissored from different positions of membrane module were completely mixed and then immersed into ultrapure water with a 20 min sonication under the power of 500 w and a 3 min centrifugation at 10 000 r min after removing supernatant the biofilm sample were collected to analyze bacterial community chang et al 2019b members of the bacterial community in the biofouling layer were identified by

turbidity was measured using a 2100 n turbidimeter hach usa both tn and tp concentrations were measured by a lh 3ba multi parameter analyzer lianhua technology co ltd china 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux development and filtration resistance distribution the variation of flux in gdm systems with elapsed time and the resistance distribution at the end of experiment are presented in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a three stages were recognized based on flux behaviors stage i days 1 10 stage ii days 11 60 and stage iii days 65 105 the membrane flux in four systems decreased quickly during stage i days 1 10 and continuously slowed down during stage ii days 11 60 the flux of aa gdm continued to reduce and reached values similar to that of caa gdm at the end of stage ii the stabilization time for four systems was longer than 20 30 days which was ascribed to the presence of algae in raw water leading to the blockage of uf membrane and reduction of microbial activity derlon et al 2014 zhang and fu 2018 after the interruption of operation for five days days 61 65 the fluxes in four systems were resumed with a little leap the leap of flux after restarting day 65th was related to the more relaxed and detached biofouling layer during non permeation a similar phenomenon has been found by tang et al 2018b and thus the leap of flux correlated to the degradation of nom by microorganisms at the interval period causing a looser cake layer in stage iii the flux again experienced a decreasing trend and then flattened out finally resulting in values of stable fluxes ordered as caa gdm 8 3 lmh aa gdm 4 9 lmh cgdm 3 1 lmh gdm 2 0 lmh fig 1a at the end of stage iii day 105th the uf membrane fouling resistance were analyzed as presented in fig 1b the intrinsic membrane resistance rm was similar in all four gdm systems 2 8 3 5 1012 m 1 the hydraulically reversible resistance rre and irreversible resistance rir accounted for 55 7 and 35 4 of the total resistance r t in the control gdm compared to the control gdm cgdm could effectively alleviate rir by 81 6 but was ineffective in controlling rre by 12 6 which indicated the accumulation of a looser but thicker cake layer in the latter in comparison the aa filtration decreased the rre and rir by 62 2 and 69 3 respectively in part due to milder rre ma et al 2018 the higher rir in aa gdm than that in cgdm was possibly because of saturation of filtration at stage iii with detailed explanation discussed in section 3 4 the caa gdm system combined both advantages of cgdm and aa gdm resulting in the alleviation of both rre and rir fig 1b generally for all four systems flux initially strongly decreased over time with the lowest values reached for the control gdm coagulation improved the stable flux by 155 decreasing rre and rir by 12 6 and 81 6 respectively aa filtration made the stable flux of aa gdm 2 45 times the control gdm and rre and rir were just 37 8 and 30 7 of those in the control one the combination of both pretreatment methods i e caa gdm resulted in the highest stable flux 8 3 lmh lowest rre 23 1 of control gdm and rir 7 2 of control gdm from the result in table s2 si although the water production cost of caa gdm was slightly higher than that of gdm and aa gdm during the 100 days of operation the stable flux and water production was the highest showing the superiority of caa gdm in long time operation 3 2 filtration permeate quality the concentrations of primary water quality parameters in raw and effluent of the four gdm systems are presented in fig 2 with corresponding removals shown in fig s2 si the contents of nom i e doc and uv254 significantly decreased as a result of treatment in all four systems fig 2a b the control gdm removed 49 2 and 11 5 of doc and uv254 respectively while more nom were removed by cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm p 0 05 there was not a significant difference in permeate organics between aa gdm and caa gdm the doc removals decreased with operation time for the control gdm and similar results were reported in previous study tang et al 2018b while the removals were almost unchanged when any pretreatment was employed during long term operation fig s2 si generally the nom removal in aa gdm was the highest at days 0 20 after which it gradually declined to levels comparable to cgdm and lower than caa gdm during days 40 105 fig s2 si compared with aa gdm the flocs formed on the filter of caa gdm could react with noms and prevent them from blocking membrane pores bu et al 2016 resulting in a lower rir in caa gdm than that in aa gdm fig 1b more than one quarter of chlorophyll a was removed by the control gdm and higher removals were observed for cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm p 0 05 fig 2c note that the removals of chlorophyll a decreased gradually for all the four gdm systems fig s2c si which were different from the performance of conventional uf system with a filtration length of 90 360 min each cycle chang et al 2021 yu et al 2020 campinas et al 2010 claimed that the polysaccharides existed in biofouling layer of conventional uf system could act as thickening agents or bio flocculants to adsorb chlorophyll a more easily resulting in a relatively stable removal the result of gdm systems can be explained that chlorophyll a was accumulated in membrane tank after long term operation 100 days resulting in a stronger concentration polarization and lower removal as shown in fig 2d the ammonia contents in the permeate of gdm systems were much lower than the raw water indicating a good nh4 n removal in gdm and excellent removals of nh4 n in gdm for treating feed water with low concentration nh4 n 0 2 0 5 mg l were reported in published literature du et al 2019 tang et al 2018a moreover the nh4 n removals increased with operation time fig s2d si in comparison the tn removals were relatively stable with the values of 19 6 22 6 33 6 and 37 0 for gdm cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm respectively the lower removals of tn than nh4 n were due to the formation of no2 and no3 33 2 and 51 7 of tp were removed in the control gdm and cgdm respectively while more removals 81 9 and 84 1 were obtained in aa gdm and caa gdm respectively for all water quality parameters assessed the water quality of permeate can satisfy the standards for chinses drinking water quality table s3 si and the difference between aa gdm and caa gdm performance was not significant p 0 05 fig 3 presents eem spectra of feed water and permeate of different gdm systems two primary peaks at regions ii ex em 225 335 nm aromatic protein ii and iv ex em 300 340 nm soluble microbial by product smp like substances chen et al 2003 were found in raw water and they decreased by 25 5 41 5 after pretreatments fig 3a d most of the fluorescence substances decreased in the permeate for gdm systems investigated fig 3e h demonstrating that protein like substances with large molecular weight mw and smp could be removed as shown in fig 3a and d there was an increase in the peak at region iii fulvic like substances with small mw chen et al 2003 probably due to the release of algae based organics by metabolism of algae the lowest fluorescence substances were found in permeate of caa gdm and peaks for aromatic protein ii and smp like substances were lower than those in aa gdm by 21 7 and 45 8 respectively this was because the flocs through aa filtration adhered on membrane surface improving the rejection of organics with small mw noms and inorganic components on gdm surface provided necessary conditions for the growth and accumulation of biofouling layers the difference in the properties of biofouling layers would be the major factor for the difference in flux and effluent quality this was because the biofouling layer changed the physical and chemical properties of the membrane pores and differently accumulating microorganisms varied in metabolic properties differently influencing the water quality tang et al 2018a the characteristics of biofouling layer will be discussed in detail in sections 3 3 3 4 3 3 structure of the biofouling layers as mentioned in si the cake layer resistance was resulted from the structure of cake layer and the pollutants removal while the permeate quality in fig 2 could revealed the relationship between resistance and removal efficiency in order to investigate the effect of cake layer structure the sem images including surface and cross section and afm images of membrane surface are presented in fig 4 a dense biofouling layer with low rms was observed for the control gdm fig 4a while the thicker biofouling layer was formed in cgdm with higher rms 18 98 nm fig 4b it has been proved that a thicker biofouling layer formed by flocs could reduce the possibility of nom entering the membrane pores bu et al 2016 reliving membrane fouling the biofouling layer formed in aa gdm was dense with rsm of 12 42 nm fig 4c while that formed in caa gdm obtained the similar rsm 12 89 nm but more porous surface fig 4d thus among four gdm systems the lowest rre for caa gdm was due to the porosity as discussed in section s5 si compared with cgdm the lower value of rre in caa gdm was attributed to the lower quality and density of foulants accumulated on membrane surface and the flocs with more branched porous structure were formed in caa unit the clsm observation was used to describe the biofouling layer morphology and to explore the distribution of microorganisms on the membranes pronk et al 2019 the clsm images at different depths i e 5 15 and 25 μm from the membrane surface are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a large amounts of polysaccharides and bacteria were found on the control gdm membrane with some bacteria aggregated in clusters the biofouling layer formed on the cgdm membrane showed that polysaccharides were wrapped in flocs with a restricted distribution range fig 5b in aa gdm fewer polysaccharides were stained but more bacteria were present on the membrane surface fig 5c for caa gdm the polysaccharides on the membrane surface were agglomerated into loose flocs fig 5d the clsm observation could explain why the flocs were more easily detached from the membrane surface by hydraulic backwashing resulting in relatively high proportion of reversible fouling 3 4 composition of the biofouling layers fig 6 shows the eem spectra eps and atp concentrations of biofouling layers in four gdm systems the fluorescence substances at regions i ex em 220 300 nm ii ex em 230 342 nm and iv ex em 305 340 nm were found in lb eps of biofouling layer for the control gdm in comparison the fluorescent intensities decreased in those of the cgdm and aa gdm and unconspicuous fluorescent peaks were found for the caa gdm fig 6a d for each gdm system the trend of fluorescent organics in lb eps was consistent with that in the permeate water quality fig 3a d similarly the biofouling layer in control gdm had the highest eem peaks in tb eps and obvious fluorescent intensities of tb eps were also found in cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm unlike fluorescent organics in lb eps the eem peaks in tb eps of biofouling layer in aa gdm were higher than those in cgdm fig 6f g the change in the fluorescent organics in lb eps of biofouling layers positively correlated with reversible fouling while the variation in tb eps linked with irreversible fouling as shown in fig 6i the control gdm accumulated the highest eps and eps fractions loosely and tightly bound protein and polysaccharides in comparison much less amounts of eps and each fraction were observed on the membranes following pretreatment with the order of aa gdm cgdm caa gdm there was significant difference in eps fractions i e protein polysaccharides of lb eps or tb eps in biological fouling layer in different gdm systems p 0 05 in all four cases the tightly bound polysaccharide fraction tb epsps was the main eps component the microorganisms present in the biofouling layers can both secrete or consume eps while their total numbers roughly correlate with eps concentration deng et al 2020 similarly compared with the control gdm the less atp contents were detected in the biofouling layer of the other three gdm systems fig 6j the major functional groups or compositions of accumulated foulants in the biofouling layers in gdm systems were investigated by ftir and xps fig s5 si it showed that the co c co carbohydrates bonds 1200 900 cm 1 gamage and chellam 2014 were dominant in the control gdm and the peaks decreased in the order of aa gdm cgmd and caa gdm this result indicated that coagulation reduced the stretching vibrations for co functional groups decreasing the deposition of polysaccharides in the biofouling layer chang et al 2019a roy et al 2017 the xps analysis showed that the peaks of f 1 s or al 2p in cgdm and caa gdm were stronger than those in gdm and aa gdm obviously resulting from the addition of coagulant figs s5 s6 si the results were caused by aluminum hydroxide al oh4 accumulation on these membranes adsorbing positively charged organics and reducing the ph thus preventing organics from damaging the membranes feng et al 2015 overall the biofouling layer on the control gdm was the most active while the addition of coagulant decreased the concentration of eps and the number of biologically active microorganisms the difference in eps fractions or fluorescent organics in lb eps and tb eps or atp of biofouling layer could explain the difference of reversible or irreversible membrane fouling respectively the functional groups or elements identified using ftir or xps further confirmed the difference in biological layers in different gdm systems 3 5 bacterial community in the biofouling layers the comparison of alpha diversity parameters of bacterial communities in the biofouling layers including observed otus shannon chao1 ace and good s coverage indices were summarized in table s4 si most of the microorganisms present in the biofouling layers had been captured according to the high coverage 99 26 as listed in table s4 the biofouling layers in aa gdm consisted of the most diverse bacterial species and the improvement in the bacterial diversity and abundance for filtration without coagulation was previously reported tang et al 2018a table s5 si showed that the aa filters gradually performed biological degradation in contrast pretreatments using coagulation or coagulation aa filtration decreased the diversity and abundance when compared to the control gdm suggesting that the formed flocs influenced the bacterial diversity on the biofouling layer as shown in fig s8 si the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria and similar relative abundances were found among the four systems 47 82 51 52 of the total phyla the phylum planctomycetes was enriched after pretreatment in particular in the biofouling layer of caa gdm and the relative abundances correlated well with the tn removals in the four gdm systems figs 2 and s2 in si it is speculated that the presence of planctomycetes played an important role in tn removal which also had been previously reported yue et al 2018 the relative abundance of acidobacteria was highest in the gdm layer 16 80 followed by cgdm 8 72 aa gdm 7 28 and caa gdm 4 81 the phylum acidobacteria was generally found in the deep layers of biofilm in an anaerobic environment influencing the properties of biofouling layer juntawang et al 2017 mizuno et al 2015 the relatively small fraction of acidobacteria in caa gdm was related to the structure of the formed layer that was loose porous and probably better aerated moreover the fraction of phyla not belonging to the top 13 was relatively high for aa gdm in corroboration with its high diversity indices to further investigate microbial community the dominant bacteria at the genus level are presented in fig 7 the venn diagram showed that 726 genera were detected in the four systems accounting for 33 61 50 49 of the total genera per system fig s9 si aa gdm had the largest number of genera 230 that was not detected in the other three gdm systems while cgdm had the fewest 48 of the commonly shared genera fig 7a acinetobacter ferribacterium and pseudomonas within proteobacteria and geothrix acidobacteria reached the highest relative abundances in the various samples although there was functional redundancy of bacteria acinetobacter and pseudomonas have been proved to secrete polysaccharides which was responsible for the productions of eps deng et al 2020 lei et al 2019 in fact the largest concentration of eps on gdm layer fig 6 was related to the highest abundances of acinetobacter and pseudomonas resulting in a severe membrane fouling in comparison the mild fouling in caa gdm system was consistent with minor fractions of both genera although the relative abundances of terrimonas bacteroidetes chlorobi phylum in the gdm and aa gdm systems were less than 2 this type of genus could secrete hydrophobic fraction of eps deng et al 2020 leading to the high r ir the addition of coagulant in cgdm and caa gdm had less abundance of terrimonas and attributed to the low r ir moreover the presence of coagulation could strongly increase the relative abundance of ferribacterium as described previously bao et al 2018 jroundi et al 2020 the relative abundances of the top genera unique for each of biofouling layers in the four gdm systems showed that some of these contained genera that comprised potentially pathogenic bacteria e g legionella were found in the control gdm fig 7b which could increase the risk of biological safety bao et al 2018 as presented in fig 7c the most abundant genus in cgdm was methyloversatilis phylum proteobacteria followed by aeromicrobium table s4 si genera containing pathogenic species e g faecalibacterium ruminococcus and gemmiger were also recognized in the biofilm of aa gdm and the relative abundance of sample unique genera was the highest fig 7d there were a few genera containing pathogenic species in the biofilm of caa gdm where the most abundant of unique genus was bdellovibrio bacteria eating bacteria fig 7e members of bacillus which were found in gdm only possesed relatively large sizes that could block membrane pores gu et al 2009 a number of bacterial genera that have the potential to degrade protein chitin and other high mw organics were recognized such as flavobacterium in cgdm roseburia in aa gdm and bdellovibrio in caa gdm their activities could potentially increase the water quality and membrane flux deng et al 2019 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 among four gdm systems the caa gdm system had the highest abundance of predict functions fig s8 si and the lowest content of protein like species of eps fig 6 these results demonstrated that the predominant bacteria were likely to contain maximum multiple bacterial secretion systems proteasomes and ubiquitin system which could efficiently degrade proteins of eps 3 6 mechanisms of flux stabilization and water quality as shown in fig 8 the maximum amounts of eps could be found on membrane surface and pores for the control gdm which was the main reason for the severest membrane fouling as discussed above the maximum amounts of eps were related to the content of nom and algae cell in feed water in addition the presence of acinetobacter pseudomonas and terrimonas species in biofouling layer that produced eps was partially responsible for the eps amounts the coagulant added in cgdm wrapped foulants and formed flocs aggravating the reversible fouling but protecting the membrane from being irreversibly fouled the presence of flavobacterium in biofouling layer decreased eps and thus alleviating membrane fouling in aa gdm the aa filter could retain foulants and reduce residual tn and tp in the water but it also allowed a higher diversity of potential pathogens the presence of some bacteria e g roseburia could reduce nom and thus alleviate membrane fouling compared to the pretreatment with coagulation foulants were irreversibly retained on the filter at the end of experiment resulting in a higher fraction of irreversible fouling in caa gdm the formation of flocs aggravated the reversible fouling at the beginning of the experiment but it could protect the filter from being fouled with the up flow mode of biofiltration compact flocs settled in the bottom of filtration tank while loose flocs entered into the membrane tank and finally generated a loose porous biofouling layer with a small value of rre the presence of bdellovibrio in biofouling layer was responsible for maximum removal of eps and low mw organics resulting in the lightest rir 4 conclusion an economic in situ coagulation combined with aa filtration without replacement or regeneration was applied as pretreatment of gdm for the surface algae laden water treatment the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in situ coagulation and aa filtration effectively enhanced the membrane fluxes with the sable values 1 55 and 2 45 times the control gdm flux respectively coagulation primarily decreased the irreversible fouling while aa filtration eliminated more than 60 of both reversible and irreversible fouling the combination of coagulation and filtration greatly improved membrane flux 8 3 lmh and eliminated membrane fouling 2 compared to the control gdm cgdm obviously improved the removals of noms doc uv254 and fluorescent organics chlorophyll a and tp but not for nh4 n and tn while all the contaminant removals were significantly improved in aa gdm and caa gdm except for nh4 n 3 in situ coagulation was beneficial to formation of a loose inhomogeneous biofouling layer facilitating the proliferation of actinobacteria aa gdm reduced the compactness of the layer as well as its eps content while caa gdm formed a porous detachable loosely bound biofouling layer with the lowest eps and atp the difference in lb eps and tb eps of biofouling layer resulted in the difference of reversible fouling and irreversible fouling respectively 4 the systems with pretreatment resulted in decreased relative abundance of acinetobacter pseudomonas and terrimonas potentially reducing the secretion of eps when compared to the control gdm the occurrence of specific bacterial genera involving the potential to degrade protein chitin and other high mw

16424,it is a critical challenge for drinking water production when treating algae contaminated surface water in this study the impact of in situ coagulation c activated alumina filtration aa and their combination caa on the performance of gravity driven membrane gdm was systematically assessed during 105 day operation the results indicated that pretreatments in particular caa could effectively enhance gdm flux and the stable fluxes were increased to 3 1 4 9 and 8 3 l m2 h lmh for cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm respectively when compared to the control gdm 2 0 lmh coagulation was beneficial to formation of thick but loose biofouling layer while aa filtration was effective to retain foulants including extracellular polymeric substances eps organics total nitrogen and total phosphorus the caa gdm could mostly remove these foulants and facilitate the proliferation of bacterial genera that could consume eps further alleviating membrane fouling the difference in loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps of biofouling layer attributed to the difference of reversible fouling and irreversible fouling respectively morphological observations variation in functional groups or elements further confirmed the difference in biological layers in different gdm systems the occurrence of specific bacterial genera involving the potential to degrade protein chitin and other high molecular weight organics was responsible for contaminant removals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity driven membrane gdm flux stabilization in situ coagulation extracellular polymeric substances eps bacterial community biofouling layer 1 introduction the availability of safe drinking water is a key issue and surface water bodies suffer from algal bloom and eutrophication in particular the excessive total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp posed a great challenge to drinking water production zhou et al 2014 nowadays there are a considerable number of people throughout the world who have no access to clean water from waterworks ultrafiltration uf membranes have been increasingly used in large scale drinking water treatment plants chang et al 2017 yu et al 2020 and are often used coupling with pretreatment technologies e g air flotation coagulation and filtration to treat contaminated water by algae pramanik et al 2015 qi et al 2018 zhang and fu 2018 gravity driven membrane gdm filtration also known as biofilm controlled uf is particularly suitable for decentralized water treatment due to low maintenance or low energy characteristics peter varbanets et al 2012 pronk et al 2019 sima and elimelech 2013 gdm has been used for the treatment of surface water secondary effluent seawater and shale gas wastewater chang et al 2019b du et al 2021 shao et al 2017 wu et al 2017a the feature of low flux in gdm favors the formation of biofilm which possesses a function of biological decontamination on the filter cake layer thereby reducing membrane pore clogging ding et al 2021 shao et al 2017 usually the formation of biofilm in gdm system requires several weeks e g 20 30 days derlon et al 2014 pronk et al 2019 and both the bacteria and eukaryote species were conductive to the formation of a looser cake layer derlon et al 2012 2013 this can effectively reduce the frequency of hydraulic backwashing of uf membranes and improve the permeate water quality as operation elapsed gdm filtration may be not effective for the removal of dissolved pollutants e g micromolecular organic matter and ammonia nitrogen potentially deteriorating the effluent water quality akhondi et al 2015 du et al 2019 wu et al 2016 appropriate approaches are required to either improve the quality of feed water or enhance the structure and activity of the biofouling layer pronk et al 2019 it has been proved that pre coating of activated carbon ac filter on gdm surface could adsorb natural organic matter nom and serve them as nutrients which is favorable for enhancing microbial activity shao et al 2017 tang et al 2018b constructed an integrated ac gdm unit and segregated them by a plexiglass mesh resulting in a slight membrane fouling xu et al 2021 separated filter media and gdm as biofiltration gdm unit to extent the contact time of filter media and pollutants and demonstrated that this system exhibited a better nom removal and a lighter irreversible fouling than the integrated unit in addition the type of filter media exerts a significant influence on contaminant removals shao et al 2017 compared to ac filter activated alumina aa filter exhibits higher removals of nitrate nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus through hydrolysis increasing the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and is more suitable for the treatment of eutrophicated water mittal et al 2020 tan et al 2021 however neither biofiltration nor gdm could be adapted when feed water contains larger amounts of colloidal particles and algae cells particularly for algal bloom and eutrophication water bodies hindering the application of biofiltration gdm process as coagulation is mostly applied to remove algal cells nom and colloids jin et al 2017 it is potential to applied prior to a biofiltration gdm when there were high contents of algae cells colloids and nom in raw water besides the flocs formed during coagulation process can improve the cake layer characteristics ji et al 2010 thus reducing uf membrane fouling alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 however the effect of flocs on the biological activity of uf remains in dispute in published literature ding et al 2017b demonstrated that in situ coagulation were detrimental to the biological activity and caused an unstable membrane flux at the later stages of uf in contrast liu et al 2017 reported that aluminum salt flocs and nonionic polyacrylamide flocs were helpful to improve the biological decontamination performance and to reduce the irreversible membrane fouling resistance the superiority of dual coagulation on the performance of gdm during filtration of algae polluted water has been demonstrated du et al 2020 therefore the role of in situ coagulation combined with biofiltration could highly influence the properties of the biofouling layer and microbial community yu et al 2013 extending the applicability of gdm by improving flux and water quality lee et al 2019 wu et al 2017b up to now little is known about the performance of gdm in the simultaneous presence of coagulation and aa filtration thus an economic pretreatment of dual coagulation combined with aa biofiltration was applied to resolve sudden increasing of contaminants or algal laden water in gdm system and influence bio cake layer characteristics with light membrane fouling in this study four gdm systems were operated in parallel for treatment of algae rich river water including a gdm alone gdm gdm following in situ coagulation cgdm gdm following aa filtration aa gdm and gdm following in situ coagulation and aa filtration caa gdm the objectives of this study were a to elucidate the flux stabilization behaviors and the underlying mechanisms of the four processes b to investigate the removal performance for primary contaminants and c to evaluate the characteristics of the biofouling layer in different gdm systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water the test water was collected from rushan river 36 94 n 121 47 e shandong china the temperature of the raw water ranged from 15 to 28 c with seasonal variation and a digital thermostat was applied to keep the temperature of the feed water constant at 20 c during experiments the characteristics of the primary water quality parameters in the raw water are summarized in table s1 supporting information si the in situ coagulation was carried out using

study for the detailed information about the preparation of coagulant and operation of in situ coagulation du et al 2020 the biofilter height 250 mm diameter 200 mm filled with 200 mm height of aa filter media with 4 00 mm particle size and the filter was operated under an empty bed contact time of 45 5 min and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 54 6 min in the velocities of 0 15 0 23 m h in the aa gdm and caa gdm systems the flow rate of aa filtration and gdm filtration were identical due to the interconnected installation 2 2 experimental setups and experimental procedures the schematic diagrams for gdm systems are shown in fig s1 si for the control gdm a raw water tank was connected with a uf membrane tank 7 6 l with an initial hrt of 49 8 min in cgdm and caa gdm coagulant was dosed into a static mixer by a dosing pump at a flux of 1 4 ml min before the uf membrane tank an aa filter was employed before the gdm in aa gdm and caa gdm system an air pump was placed at the bottom of the gdm to maintain a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 5 5 6 0 mg l the gravity driven pressure was maintained at 0 1 bar i e 1 0 m by keeping the liquid level constant using an overflow system there was no additional sludge inoculation in any of the four systems at the beginning of the experiment and no sludge was discharged during the whole operation an identical outside in hollow fiber uf membrane consisting of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf litree co hainan china with a nominal molecular weight cut off of 100 kda was employed in gdm systems aeration pipes which were connected with an air pump were installed in the bottom of membrane tank and only operated for 15 min when there was a sudden deterioration in raw water quality i e on day 10th 30th 60th and 90th and the details were described in si the external diameter of the membrane was 1 0 mm and the module in each gdm had a total effective filtration area of 0 366 m2 the uf membrane module was orientated vertically and operated in submerged filtration mode the description of the calculation of flux and resistance is summarized in si operation was interrupted for five days due to equipment maintenance days 61 65 at the end of experiment on day 105 the uf membranes were hydraulically backwashed to quantify the membrane fouling resistance as described in si 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chlorophyll a analysis extraction of chlorophyll a in test water was carried out overnight using 5 ml of 90 acetone chlorophyll a absorption was then determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv2600 shimadzu japan by measuring the absorbance at 665 and 750 nm after zeroing using acetone as described in si 2 3 2 morphology of biofouling layers the morphology of the biofouling layer and uf membrane was characterized using a scanning electron microscopy sem hithachi su8010 japan and atomic force microscope afm nanonavi e sweep japan the roughness of biofouling layer was analyzed by nanoscope analysis 5 0 using the rough of mean square rms method the fouling layer attached to the membrane surface was investigated using a dmi6000 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcs sp5 germany with staining for bacteria and polysaccharides the descriptions of clsm were detailly informed in si 2 3 3 ftir and xps spectra fouled membranes were measured by ftir spectrometer nicolet 380 thermo usa in the wavenumbers from 4000 to 625 cm 1 the xps spectra of the flocculants were conducted in an axis ultra dld x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps kratos uk and the results were analyzed by software of xps peak to investigate the element on the fouled membrane 2 3 4 eps and atp measurements as described in previous literature adav and lee 2008 ding et al 2017b samples were extracted with a 5 min sonication under the power of 120 w followed by formaldehyde and naoh and then the loosely bound eps lb eps and the tightly bound eps tb eps fractions were collected by centrifuging for 15 min at 4000 r min and 10 000 r min respectively the protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid and the content of polysaccharides by the anthrone sulphuric method the abbreviated terms lb epspr and lb epsps represent protein and polysaccharides of the lb eps respectively and tb epspr and tb epsps are short for those of the tb eps atp content of the biofouling layer attached to the membrane surface was measured using the bactiter glo promega corporation kit using the supplier protocol ding et al 2017a 2 3 5 bacterial community analysis at the end of experiment the membrane silks scissored from different positions of membrane module were completely mixed and then immersed into ultrapure water with a 20 min sonication under the power of 500 w and a 3 min centrifugation at 10 000 r min after removing supernatant the biofilm sample were collected to analyze bacterial community chang et al 2019b members of the bacterial community in the biofouling layer were identified by amplification and sequencing the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s ribosomal rna gene using the universal primer sets 338f 806r 3 acggggygcagcaggcgcga 5 3 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 5 chang et al 2019b the

shannon chao ace simpson and coverage the microbial community of the biofouling layer was depicted through the relative abundance of populations chang et al 2019b sequences were deposited in the ncbi short read archive under bioproject accession number prjna745325 with biosample numbers samn20162724 samn20162727 2 3 6 other analytical methods doc concentrations and uv254 were determined with a total carbon analyser vario toc cube elementar germany and uv vis spectrophotometer respectively and these two parameters were measured after filtration through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane turbidity was measured using a 2100 n turbidimeter hach usa both tn and tp concentrations were measured by a lh 3ba multi parameter analyzer lianhua technology co ltd china 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux development and filtration resistance distribution the variation of flux in gdm systems with elapsed time and the resistance distribution at the end of experiment are presented in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a three stages were recognized based on flux behaviors stage i days 1 10 stage ii days 11 60 and stage iii days 65 105 the membrane flux in four systems decreased quickly during stage i days 1 10 and continuously slowed down during stage ii days 11 60 the flux of aa gdm continued to reduce and reached values similar to that of caa gdm at the end of stage ii the stabilization time for four systems was longer than 20 30 days which was ascribed to the presence of algae in raw water leading to the blockage of uf membrane and reduction of microbial activity derlon et al 2014 zhang and fu 2018 after the interruption of operation for five days days 61 65 the fluxes in four systems were resumed with a little leap the leap of flux after restarting day 65th was related to the more relaxed and detached biofouling layer during non permeation a similar phenomenon has been found by tang et al 2018b and thus the leap of flux correlated to the degradation of nom by microorganisms at the interval period causing a looser cake layer in stage iii the flux again experienced a decreasing trend and then flattened out finally resulting in values of stable fluxes ordered as caa gdm 8 3 lmh aa gdm 4 9 lmh cgdm 3 1 lmh gdm 2 0 lmh fig 1a at the end of stage iii day 105th the uf membrane fouling resistance were analyzed as presented in fig 1b the intrinsic membrane resistance rm was similar in all four gdm systems 2 8 3 5 1012 m 1 the hydraulically reversible resistance rre and irreversible resistance rir accounted for 55 7 and 35 4 of the total resistance r t in the control gdm compared to the control gdm cgdm could effectively alleviate rir by 81 6 but was ineffective in controlling rre by 12 6 which indicated the accumulation of a looser but thicker cake layer in the latter in comparison the aa filtration decreased the rre and rir by 62 2 and 69 3 respectively in part due to milder rre ma et al 2018 the higher rir in aa gdm than that in cgdm was possibly because of saturation of filtration at stage iii with detailed explanation discussed in section 3 4 the caa gdm system combined both advantages of cgdm and aa gdm resulting in the alleviation of both rre and rir fig 1b generally for all four systems flux initially strongly decreased over time with the lowest values reached for the control gdm coagulation improved the stable flux by 155 decreasing rre and rir by 12 6 and 81 6 respectively aa filtration made the stable flux of aa gdm 2 45 times the control gdm and rre and rir were just 37 8 and 30 7 of those in the control one the combination of both pretreatment methods i e caa gdm resulted in the highest stable flux 8 3 lmh lowest rre 23 1 of control gdm and rir 7 2 of control gdm from the result in table s2 si although the water production cost of caa gdm was slightly higher than that of gdm and aa gdm during the 100 days of operation the stable flux and water production was the highest showing the superiority of caa gdm in long time operation 3 2 filtration permeate quality the concentrations of primary water quality parameters in raw and effluent of the four gdm systems are presented in fig 2 with corresponding removals shown in fig s2 si the contents of nom i e doc and uv254 significantly decreased as a result of treatment in all four systems fig 2a b the control gdm removed 49 2 and 11 5 of doc and uv254 respectively while more nom were removed by cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm p 0 05 there was not a significant difference in permeate organics between aa gdm and caa gdm the doc removals decreased with operation time for the control gdm and similar results were reported in previous study tang et al 2018b while the removals were almost unchanged when any pretreatment was employed during long term operation fig s2 si generally the nom removal in aa gdm was the highest at days 0 20 after which it gradually declined to levels comparable to cgdm and lower than caa gdm during days 40 105 fig s2 si compared with aa gdm the flocs formed on the filter of caa gdm could react with noms and prevent them from blocking membrane pores bu et al 2016 resulting in a lower rir in caa gdm than that in aa gdm fig 1b more than one quarter of chlorophyll a was removed by the control gdm and higher removals were observed for cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm p 0 05 fig 2c note that the removals of chlorophyll a decreased gradually for all the four gdm systems fig s2c si which were different from the performance of conventional uf system with a filtration length of 90 360 min each cycle chang et al 2021 yu et al 2020 campinas et al 2010 claimed that the polysaccharides existed in biofouling layer of conventional uf system could act as thickening agents or bio flocculants to adsorb chlorophyll a more easily resulting in a relatively stable removal the result of gdm systems can be explained that chlorophyll a was accumulated in membrane tank after long term operation 100 days resulting in a stronger concentration polarization and lower removal as shown in fig 2d the ammonia contents in the permeate of gdm systems were much lower than the raw water indicating a good nh4 n removal in gdm and excellent removals of nh4 n in gdm for treating feed water with low concentration nh4 n 0 2 0 5 mg l were reported in published literature du et al 2019 tang et al 2018a moreover the nh4 n removals increased with operation time fig s2d si in comparison the tn removals were relatively stable with the values of 19 6 22 6 33 6 and 37 0 for gdm cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm respectively the lower removals of tn than nh4 n were due to the formation of no2 and no3 33 2 and 51 7 of tp were removed in the control gdm and cgdm respectively while more removals 81 9 and 84 1 were obtained in aa gdm and caa gdm respectively for all water quality parameters assessed the water quality of permeate can satisfy the standards for chinses drinking water quality table s3 si and the difference between aa gdm and caa gdm performance was not significant p 0 05 fig 3 presents eem spectra of feed water and permeate of different gdm systems two primary peaks at regions ii ex em 225 335 nm aromatic protein ii and iv ex em 300 340 nm soluble microbial by product smp like substances chen et al 2003 were found in raw water and they decreased by 25 5 41 5 after pretreatments fig 3a d most of the fluorescence substances decreased in the permeate for gdm systems investigated fig 3e h demonstrating that protein like substances with large molecular weight mw and smp could be removed as shown in fig 3a and d there was an increase in the peak at region iii fulvic like substances with small mw chen et al 2003 probably due to the release of algae based organics by metabolism of algae the lowest fluorescence substances were found in permeate of caa gdm and peaks for aromatic protein ii and smp like substances were lower than those in aa gdm by 21 7 and 45 8 respectively this was because the flocs through aa filtration adhered on membrane surface improving the rejection of organics with small mw noms and inorganic components on gdm surface provided necessary conditions for the growth and accumulation of biofouling layers the difference in the properties of biofouling layers would be the major factor for the difference in flux and effluent quality this was because the biofouling layer changed the physical and chemical properties of the membrane pores and differently accumulating microorganisms varied in metabolic properties differently influencing the water quality tang et al 2018a the characteristics of biofouling layer will be discussed in detail in sections 3 3 3 4 3 3 structure of the biofouling layers as mentioned in si the cake layer resistance was resulted from the structure of cake layer and the pollutants removal while the permeate quality in fig 2 could revealed the relationship between resistance and removal efficiency in order to investigate the effect of cake layer structure the sem images including surface and cross section and afm images of membrane surface are presented in fig 4 a dense biofouling layer with low rms was observed for the control gdm fig 4a while the thicker biofouling layer was formed in cgdm with higher rms 18 98 nm fig 4b it has been proved that a thicker biofouling layer formed by flocs could reduce the possibility of nom entering the membrane pores bu et al 2016 reliving membrane fouling the biofouling layer formed in aa gdm was dense with rsm of 12 42 nm fig 4c while that formed in caa gdm obtained the similar rsm 12 89 nm but more porous surface fig 4d thus among four gdm systems the lowest rre for caa gdm was due to the porosity as discussed in section s5 si compared with cgdm the lower value of rre in caa gdm was attributed to the lower quality and density of foulants accumulated on membrane surface and the flocs with more branched porous structure were formed in caa unit the clsm observation was used to describe the biofouling layer morphology and to explore the distribution of microorganisms on the membranes pronk et al 2019 the clsm images at different depths i e 5 15 and 25 μm from the membrane surface are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a large amounts of polysaccharides and bacteria were found on the control gdm membrane with some bacteria aggregated in clusters the biofouling layer formed on the cgdm membrane showed that polysaccharides were wrapped in flocs with a restricted distribution range fig 5b in aa gdm fewer polysaccharides were stained but more bacteria were present on the membrane surface fig 5c for caa gdm the polysaccharides on the membrane surface were agglomerated into loose flocs fig 5d the clsm observation could explain why the flocs were more easily detached from the membrane surface by hydraulic backwashing resulting in relatively high proportion of reversible fouling 3 4 composition of the biofouling layers fig 6 shows the eem spectra eps and atp concentrations of biofouling layers in four gdm systems the fluorescence substances at regions i ex em 220 300 nm ii ex em 230 342 nm and iv ex em 305 340 nm were found in lb eps of biofouling layer for the control gdm in comparison the fluorescent intensities decreased in those of the cgdm and aa gdm and unconspicuous fluorescent peaks were found for the caa gdm fig 6a d for each gdm system the trend of fluorescent organics in lb eps was consistent with that in the permeate water quality fig 3a d similarly the biofouling layer in control gdm had the highest eem peaks in tb eps and obvious fluorescent intensities of tb eps were also found in cgdm aa gdm and caa gdm unlike fluorescent organics in lb eps the eem peaks in tb eps of biofouling layer in aa gdm were higher than those in cgdm fig 6f g the change in the fluorescent organics in lb eps of biofouling layers positively correlated with reversible fouling while the variation in tb eps linked with irreversible fouling as shown in fig 6i the control gdm accumulated the highest eps and eps fractions loosely and tightly bound protein and polysaccharides in comparison much less amounts of eps and each fraction were observed on the membranes following pretreatment with the order of aa gdm cgdm caa gdm there was significant difference in eps fractions i e protein polysaccharides of lb eps or tb eps in biological fouling layer in different gdm systems p 0 05 in all four cases the tightly bound polysaccharide fraction tb epsps was the main eps component the microorganisms present in the biofouling layers can both secrete or consume eps while their total numbers roughly correlate with eps concentration deng et al 2020 similarly compared with the control gdm the less atp contents were detected in the biofouling layer of the other three gdm systems fig 6j the major functional groups or compositions of accumulated foulants in the biofouling layers in gdm systems were investigated by ftir and xps fig s5 si it showed that the co c co carbohydrates bonds 1200 900 cm 1 gamage and chellam 2014 were dominant in the control gdm and the peaks decreased in the order of aa gdm cgmd and caa gdm this result indicated that coagulation reduced the stretching vibrations for co functional groups decreasing the deposition of polysaccharides in the biofouling layer chang et al 2019a roy et al 2017 the xps analysis showed that the peaks of f 1 s or al 2p in cgdm and caa gdm were stronger than those in gdm and aa gdm obviously resulting from the addition of coagulant figs s5 s6 si the results were caused by aluminum hydroxide al oh4 accumulation on these membranes adsorbing positively charged organics and reducing the ph thus preventing organics from damaging the membranes feng et al 2015 overall the biofouling layer on the control gdm was the most active while the addition of coagulant decreased the concentration of eps and the number of biologically active microorganisms the difference in eps fractions or fluorescent organics in lb eps and tb eps or atp of biofouling layer could explain the difference of reversible or irreversible membrane fouling respectively the functional groups or elements identified using ftir or xps further confirmed the difference in biological layers in different gdm systems 3 5 bacterial community in the biofouling layers the comparison of alpha diversity parameters of bacterial communities in the biofouling layers including observed otus shannon chao1 ace and good s coverage indices were summarized in table s4 si most of the microorganisms present in the biofouling layers had been captured according to the high coverage 99 26 as listed in table s4 the biofouling layers in aa gdm consisted of the most diverse bacterial species and the improvement in the bacterial diversity and abundance for filtration without coagulation was previously reported tang et al 2018a table s5 si showed that the aa filters gradually performed biological degradation in contrast pretreatments using coagulation or coagulation aa filtration decreased the diversity and abundance when compared to the control gdm suggesting that the formed flocs influenced the bacterial diversity on the biofouling layer as shown in fig s8 si the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria and similar relative abundances were found among the four systems 47 82 51 52 of the total phyla the phylum planctomycetes was enriched after pretreatment in particular in the biofouling layer of caa gdm and the relative abundances correlated well with the tn removals in the four gdm systems figs 2 and s2 in si it is speculated that the presence of planctomycetes played an important role in tn removal which also had been previously reported yue et al 2018 the relative abundance of acidobacteria was highest in the gdm layer 16 80 followed by cgdm 8 72 aa gdm 7 28 and caa gdm 4 81 the phylum acidobacteria was generally found in the deep layers of biofilm in an anaerobic environment influencing the properties of biofouling layer juntawang et al 2017 mizuno et al 2015 the relatively small fraction of acidobacteria in caa gdm was related to the structure of the formed layer that was loose porous and probably better aerated moreover the fraction of phyla not belonging to the top 13 was relatively high for aa gdm in corroboration with its high diversity indices to further investigate microbial community the dominant bacteria at the genus level are presented in fig 7 the venn diagram showed that 726 genera were detected in the four systems accounting for 33 61 50 49 of the total genera per system fig s9 si aa gdm had the largest number of genera 230 that was not detected in the other three gdm systems while cgdm had the fewest 48 of the commonly shared genera fig 7a acinetobacter ferribacterium and pseudomonas within proteobacteria and geothrix acidobacteria reached the highest relative abundances in the various samples although there was functional redundancy of bacteria acinetobacter and pseudomonas have been proved to secrete polysaccharides which was responsible for the productions of eps deng et al 2020 lei et al 2019 in fact the largest concentration of eps on gdm layer fig 6 was related to the highest abundances of acinetobacter and pseudomonas resulting in a severe membrane fouling in comparison the mild fouling in caa gdm system was consistent with minor fractions of both genera although the relative abundances of terrimonas bacteroidetes chlorobi phylum in the gdm and aa gdm systems were less than 2 this type of genus could secrete hydrophobic fraction of eps deng et al 2020 leading to the high r ir the addition of coagulant in cgdm and caa gdm had less abundance of terrimonas and attributed to the low r ir moreover the presence of coagulation could strongly increase the relative abundance of ferribacterium as described previously bao et al 2018 jroundi et al 2020 the relative abundances of the top genera unique for each of biofouling layers in the four gdm systems showed that some of these contained genera that comprised potentially pathogenic bacteria e g legionella were found in the control gdm fig 7b which could increase the risk of biological safety bao et al 2018 as presented in fig 7c the most abundant genus in cgdm was methyloversatilis phylum proteobacteria followed by aeromicrobium table s4 si genera containing pathogenic species e g faecalibacterium ruminococcus and gemmiger were also recognized in the biofilm of aa gdm and the relative abundance of sample unique genera was the highest fig 7d there were a few genera containing pathogenic species in the biofilm of caa gdm where the most abundant of unique genus was bdellovibrio bacteria eating bacteria fig 7e members of bacillus which were found in gdm only possesed relatively large sizes that could block membrane pores gu et al 2009 a number of bacterial genera that have the potential to degrade protein chitin and other high mw organics were recognized such as flavobacterium in cgdm roseburia in aa gdm and bdellovibrio in caa gdm their activities could potentially increase the water quality and membrane flux deng et al 2019 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 among four gdm systems the caa gdm system had the highest abundance of predict functions fig s8 si and the lowest content of protein like species of eps fig 6 these results demonstrated that the predominant bacteria were likely to contain maximum multiple bacterial secretion systems proteasomes and ubiquitin system which could efficiently degrade proteins of eps 3 6 mechanisms of flux stabilization and water quality as shown in fig 8 the maximum amounts of eps could be found on membrane surface and pores for the control gdm which was the main reason for the severest membrane fouling as discussed above the maximum amounts of eps were related to the content of nom and algae cell in feed water in addition the presence of acinetobacter pseudomonas and terrimonas species in biofouling layer that produced eps was partially responsible for the eps amounts the coagulant added in cgdm wrapped foulants and formed flocs aggravating the reversible fouling but protecting the membrane from being irreversibly fouled the presence of flavobacterium in biofouling layer decreased eps and thus alleviating membrane fouling in aa gdm the aa filter could retain foulants and reduce residual tn and tp in the water but it also allowed a higher diversity of potential pathogens the presence of some bacteria e g roseburia could reduce nom and thus alleviate membrane fouling compared to the pretreatment with coagulation foulants were irreversibly retained on the filter at the end of experiment resulting in a higher fraction of irreversible fouling in caa gdm the formation of flocs aggravated the reversible fouling at the beginning of the experiment but it could protect the filter from being fouled with the up flow mode of biofiltration compact flocs settled in the bottom of filtration tank while loose flocs entered into the membrane tank and finally generated a loose porous biofouling layer with a small value of rre the presence of bdellovibrio in biofouling layer was responsible for maximum removal of eps and low mw organics resulting in the lightest rir 4 conclusion an economic in situ coagulation combined with aa filtration without replacement or regeneration was applied as pretreatment of gdm for the surface algae laden water treatment the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in situ coagulation and aa filtration effectively enhanced the membrane fluxes with the sable values 1 55 and 2 45 times the control gdm flux respectively coagulation primarily decreased the irreversible fouling while aa filtration eliminated more than 60 of both reversible and irreversible fouling the combination of coagulation and filtration greatly improved membrane flux 8 3 lmh and eliminated membrane fouling 2 compared to the control gdm cgdm obviously improved the removals of noms doc uv254 and fluorescent organics chlorophyll a and tp but not for nh4 n and tn while all the contaminant removals were significantly improved in aa gdm and caa gdm except for nh4 n 3 in situ coagulation was beneficial to formation of a loose inhomogeneous biofouling layer facilitating the proliferation of actinobacteria aa gdm reduced the compactness of the layer as well as its eps content while caa gdm formed a porous detachable loosely bound biofouling layer with the lowest eps and atp the difference in lb eps and tb eps of biofouling layer resulted in the difference of reversible fouling and irreversible fouling respectively 4 the systems with pretreatment resulted in decreased relative abundance of acinetobacter pseudomonas and terrimonas potentially reducing the secretion of eps when compared to the control gdm the occurrence of specific bacterial genera involving the potential to degrade protein chitin and other high mw
