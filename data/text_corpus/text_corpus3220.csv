16100,reactive oxygen species ros generation is considered as an important photoaging mechanism of microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps to elucidate the ros induced mp np aging processes in water under uv365 irradiation we examined the effects of surface coatings polymer types and grain sizes on ros generation and photoaging intermediates bare polystyrene ps nps generated hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 while coated ps nps carboxyl modified ps ps cooh amino modified ps ps nh2 and ps mps generated fewer ros due to coating scavenging or size effects polypropylene polyethylene polyvinyl chloride polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate mps only generated oh for aromatic polymers oh addition preferentially occurred at benzene rings to form monohydroxy polymers excess oh resulted in h abstraction cc scission and phenyl ring opening to generate aliphatic ketones esters aldehydes and aromatic ketones for coated ps nps oh preferentially attacked the surface coatings to result in decarboxylation and deamination reactions for aliphatic polymers oh attack resulted in the formation of carbonyl groups from peracid aldehyde or ketone via h abstraction and cc scission moreover 1o2 might participate in phenyl ring opening for ps nps and coating degradation for coated ps nps this study facilitates understanding the ros induced weathering process of nps mps in water under uv irradiation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics nanoplastics photoaging reactive oxygen species surface coating 1 introduction the increasing applications of plastic materials result in the release and accumulation of plastic residuals fragments microplastics mps 100 nm 5 mm and nanoplastics nps 100 nm in aquatic systems such as rivers lakes and marine environments auta et al 2017 sun et al 2021 microbial degradation thermal degradation mechanical fragmentation and photochemical degradation are the major natural weathering processes of plastics liu et al 2020a song et al 2017 utetiwabo et al 2020 in particular photochemical aging processes were shown to alter the physicochemical properties e g crystallinity and surface morphology of nps mps and promote the release of toxic chemical additives or degradation byproducts liu et al 2020a tian et al 2019 these changes in physicochemical properties affect plastic decay transport bioavailability and the interactions between nps mps and surrounding organic or inorganic pollutants liu et al 2020b wang et al 2002 zhu et al 2020 during the photoaging process of nps mps the chromophores e g carbonyl or benzene rings of plastic materials may absorb uv energy converted to an excited triplet state by intersystem crossing and induces radical reactions generating reactive oxygen species ros or carbon centered radicals gewert et al 2018 liu et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 for example zhu et al 2020 detected hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 in an aqueous suspension of polystyrene ps mps 100 μm under uv vis irradiation our previous studies also reported the generation of oh by ps and polypropylene pp mps in artificial seawater and the formation of oh and 1o2 by ps carboxyl modified ps nps ps cooh nps and amino modified ps nps ps nh2 nps in nacl solution under uv irradiation at 365 nm uv365 chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020b despite extensive research the ros generation mechanisms and ros induced photo aging pathways are not yet determined the relationships of the plastic aging and the physiochemical properties of nps mps such as plastic compositions surface coatings and sizes under uv irradiation have not been well elucidated clearly such elucidation is critical for assessing the environmental fate and transformation of nps mps during the photoaging process of plastic materials ros or carbon centered radicals may cleave polymer chains and produce intermediates copolymers or monomers yousif and haddad 2013 light irradiation may also cause cc or ch scission and the formation of alkyl radicals r followed by oxidation hydrogen abstraction and decomposition into oh smith et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 oxidative intermediates formed through polymer oxidation and chain cleavage have also been demonstrated during the photoaging process gewert et al 2018 liu et al 2020b sørensen et al 2021 wong et al 2020 for example carbonyl hydroperoxide peroxides and unsaturated groups were detected on the surface of uv aged ps mps tian et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 uv degradation of poly ethylene terephthalate pet mps led to the formation of terephthalic acid phenacyl formate carboxylic acid and ester via breakage of the ester bonds sørensen et al 2021 in addition compounds with carboxylic acid end groups were identified as the main degradation products in ps pp pet and polyethylene pe suspensions under uv irradiation gewert et al 2018 recent studies demonstrated that the photoaging process of nps mps is largely attributed to ros induced chemical bond cleavage and subsequent formation of oxygen containing functional groups duan et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 however how ros attack and oxidize the structures of polymeric particles at molecular levels remains unknown which is critical to understand the ros mediated aging pathways and mechanisms of nps mps this work investigated the photochemical aging processes of different nps and mps with various particle sizes surface coatings and compositions under uv365 irradiation uv365 was selected as a light source because it is the main fraction of uv light reaching the earth surface li et al 2018 in addition the photoaging rate was faster than that under visible light e g xenon lamp irradiation and thus allowed us to efficiently observe the photoaging and weathering process of nps mps ps ps cooh and ps nh2 nps with100 nm in diameter were used to study the influence of the np surface coating on aging and ros generation accordingly the polymer composition influence was studied using aromatic polymers ps pet and polycarbonate pc and aliphatic polymers pp pe and polyvinylchloride pvc mps with mean diameters ranging from 42 to 107 μm these employed polymers are widely used in commercial products and represent most of the plastic pollution in the natural environment auta et al 2017 wu et al 2017 to interpret the aging mechanisms the ros generation of these nps mps was assessed to assess the aging degree we further characterized the physicochemical property changes by examining the surface functional groups and crystallinity of aged nps mps moreover the interfacial electrical properties were studied to verify polymer surface aging finally possible ros induced aging pathways or mechanisms of plastic particles were analyzed and proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of nps mps ps ps cooh and ps nh2 np suspensions were purchased from polyscience inc warrington usa pp pe and pet mps with diameters in the range of 71 8 106 7 μm were purchased from sigma aldrich reagent company shanghai china cospheric llc santa barbara usa and zhongcheng plastic inc dongguan china respectively pvc ps and pc mps with diameters in the range of 42 1 107 2 μm were obtained from guanbu electromechanical technology inc shanghai china these nps mps were of high analytical grade without addition of manufacturing additives to avoid the effect of residual substances in the synthesis process or storage medium e g surfactants and amine catalyst all mp powders were rinsed three times sequentially with ethanol and deionized di water and then dried at 30 for 24 h in a temperature humidity chamber before characterization and aging experiments other chemicals used in this study are provided in section s1 of the supporting information si the physicochemical properties of pristine and aged plastic particle were measured and the experimental details including the sample preparation procedures and instrument parameters are provided in section s2 the hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potential of plastic particles before and after aging treatment are compared in section s3 and fig s1 2 2 photochemical aging experiments under uv irradiation in the photoaging experiments 100 mg plastic particles were suspended in 100 ml di water and stirred on a magnetic stirring apparatus um 6t youcheng china to obtain effective exposure to uv irradiation a uv365 lamp uv tec philips china was placed vertically above the suspension at a distance of 1 cm from the reaction suspension surface the light intensity was set at 12 3 w m 2 which was selected because the uva light intensity of natural sunlight on the earth s surface is typically less than 17 2 w m 2 liu et al 2019c to control the temperature of suspensions and reduce the solution evaporation the lamp was turn off every 24 h to cool the solution for 1 h moreover the reaction temperature was kept at 22 2 by placing the reaction beaker in a constant temperature water bath the volume of the reaction suspension was checked constantly and di water was added to keep the volume at 100 ml di water was selected to eliminate the interferences from other water constituents e g salts heavy metal and natural organic matter on ros generation and clarify the photo aging pathways of nps mps liu and wang 2020 luo et al 2021 approximately 10 ml of the surface suspension was sampled at different uv exposure times 0 1000 and 2000 h for physiochemical property characterization 2 3 ros detection in aqueous suspensions of nps mps electron spin resonance spectrometry esr jes fa100 tokyo japan was used to measure ros in pristine or uv aged nps mps in a water suspension at ambient temperature the generation of oh and 1o2 was detected using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 50 mm and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp 10 mm as trapping agents respectively 5 tert butoxycarbonyl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide bmpo 30 mm was selected as the trapping agent of oh and o2 thirty u ml 1 superoxide dismutase sod was added to the mixture of nps mps and bmpo to scavenge o2 and distinguish the bmpo oh and bmpoo2 spin adducts he et al 2014 briefly 1 g l 1 pristine or aged sample solutions containing trapping agent were siphoned into quartz capillary tubes 0 5 100 mm 50 μl each tube was irradiated for 10 min by the same uv 365 lamp as used in the photoaging experiments and was then inserted into the esr cavity vitrex ltd denmark to monitor the spectrogram of ros adducts negative control experiments were performed in the aqueous trapping agent solution under uv365 irradiation or in the np mp suspension spiked with trapping agents without uv irradiation the esr measurements were conducted under a center field of 336 mt a sweep width of 5 mt frequency of 9441 mhz modulation width of 1 0 1 mt a time constant of 0 1 s amplitude of 5 100 power of 4 mw and sweep time of 1 min 2 4 the calculation of quantum yield for ros generation to quantify the photogenerated concentrations of oh and 1o2 by ps nps 5 μm of para chlorobenzoic acid pcba and 200 μm of furfuryl alcohol ffa were used as selective molecular indicators for oh and 1o2 respectively the concentrations of two indicators were measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 u s a following the published methods li et al 2014 the quantum yield qy was calculated by dividing the produced radical s number by the adsorbed photon s number according to the reported methods li et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 2 5 statistical analysis all photochemical testing particle size distribution zeta potential and xps characterization experiments were conducted at least three times to confirm their reproducibility the data points were expressed as the mean values standard deviation sd from three independent experiments or samples the significant difference of relative proportion of functional groups on c 1 s and o 1 s spectra o c ratio on pristine and aged nps mps and ros intensity on pristine and aged nps were conducted by paired samples t test using the statistical product and service solutions spss 26 0 differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of surface coatings on ros generation under uv irradiation fig 1 a compares the generated ros in the water suspensions of pristine and aged ps nps with or without surface coatings as indicated by the esr spectral intensities of different radical adducts the negative control experiments confirmed that no obvious ros signal peaks was observed in all pristine and aged plastic suspensions spiked with the trapping agent without uv irradiation data not shown or in pure water containing only the trapping agent under uv irradiation fig s2 fig 1a shows that the pristine ps nps without coating generated oh under uv irradiation as the esr spectrum shows four characteristic peaks of the dmpo oh spin adducts an ah 14 9 g in the ps np suspension as shown in fig s3a in contrast no obvious dmpo oh adduct signals are observed in pristine ps nh2 and ps cooh np suspensions probably due to the sequestration of oh by the surface coatings similarly only pristine ps nps yielded the four typical peaks of bmpo oh or bmpoo2 adducts with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 fig s3b the red line indicates that after the addition of sod to scavenge o2 the peak intensity changed slightly which means that o2 was not produced by ps nps under uv irradiation as shown in fig 1a 1 o2 was detected by esr in pristine ps and ps cooh np aqueous suspensions under uv irradiation which was confirmed by the three characteristic peaks of tempo with intensity ratios of 1 1 1 fig s3c no 1o2 was detected in pristine ps nh2 suspensions by esr in comparison with pristine nps fig 1a shows that the aged ps cooh and ps nh2 nps after 2000 h uv irradiation generated oh p 0 05 and the aged ps nh2 nps produced 1o2 p 0 05 this indicated that the degradation or removal of surface coatings of ps nh2 and ps cooh under uv irradiation promoted ros generation the uv irradiation did not have significant effects on the 1o2 generation for ps cooh nps p 0 05 probably because the loss of surfactant caused the formation of ps cooh np aggregates which accelerated the decay of excited triplet state ps cooh a precursor of 1o2 by quenching the surrounding ground state ps cooh and another triplet ps cooh thus the number of quenched 1o2 offset that of newly generated 1o2 furthermore dmpo carbon centered radical e g r adducts were observed in aged ps np aqueous suspensions fig s3d indicative of the generation of r in water the key radicals that promote oh generation zhu et al 2020 moreover the aged ps nps produced a lower oh signal than pristine ps nps p 0 05 because phenol could be generated in the photoaging process and thus could quench the oh radicals in ps np solution ceccarini et al 2018 similarly the aged ps nps appeared to generate a weaker signal of 1o2 than the pristine ps nps p 0 05 due to quenching effect to 1o2 by aggregated aged ps nps resulting from the loss of surfactant as like aged ps cooh nps again no o2 was detected in any of the ps suspensions as shown in fig s3e the possible radical generation mechanisms on ps nps are illustrated in fig 1b first the chromophore of ps such as the benzene ring absorbs uv photons to reach an excited singlet state and results in the formation of a triplet state by intersystem crossing zhu et al 2020 this triplet state could transfer energy to o2 to form 1o2 yousif and haddad 2013 zhu et al 2020 1o2 acts mainly as an electrophile preferring to be quenched by an electron rich amino coating at a rate with order of magnitude of 107 mol l 1 s 1 higher than that of a carboxyl coating 106 mol l 1 s 1 lundeen and mcneill 2013 pospíšil et al 2008 causing the faster consume rate of 1o2 by amino groups and resulted in a lower generation concentration of 1o2 in the ps nh2 suspension than in the ps cooh suspension on the other hand the triplet state energy is transferred to the ch or cc bonds to generate r that could readily react with molecular o2 in water to produce peroxyl radicals roo this reaction is followed by hydrogen abstraction from the nearest ch bond of the ps polymer to produce hydroperoxide rooh tian et al 2019 the rupture of the rooh bond results in the formation of oh smith et al 2018 yousif and haddad 2013 therefore the scission of rooh bond and transfer energy to o2 are considered as the key generation mechanisms of oh and 1o2 respectively finally these ros could have been involved in the photoaging process 3 2 effect of grain size and polymeric compositions on ros generation under uv irradiation no ros were detected in water suspensions of all pristine mps under uv irradiation fig s4a c because of the high hydrophobicity and chemical inertness of pristine mps the pristine ps nps were shown to produce more ros than ps mps probably due to the larger surface areas of nanosized particles that provided more reactive sites or surface defects for uv absorption and radical formation reactions ter halle et al 2016 fig s5 shows the concentration changes of pcba and ffa in the suspension of ps nps in 24 h under uv365 irradiation particularly pristine ps nps showed the highest qy of oh and 1o2 generation among all nps mps which were 0 0026 and 1 82 respectively the reported qy of ros generation on semiconductor photocatalysts such as tio2 varies on the order of 10 2 10 1 sun and bolton 1996 which are much greater than those qys obtained by the nps or mps interestingly oh was detected in aged mps whereas 1o2 and o2 were not observed fig s4d f the formation of degradation intermediates e g c o on aged mp surface may extend uv absorption and increase surface hydrophilicity and reactivity liu et al 2020b which may facilitate photochemical reactions at the surface and free radical generation these carbonyl functional groups absorb near uv radiation and subsequently generate oh following norrish type i and norrish type ii reactions atiqullah et al 2012 in particular norrish i cleavage would produce ch3 and induce initial ros reactions the oh intensities of the aromatic polymers ps pet and pc mps were lower than those of the aliphatic polymers pp pe and pvc mps fig s4d possibly due to their compositional differences for aromatic polymers phenyl moieties in the side groups of ps mps and the aromatic structure in the main chain of pet pc mps decrease their chain flexibility and increase the stiffness which might hinder the contact of free radical donor e g rooh and c o and acceptor sites e g ch lomonaco et al 2020 zhang and julian 2012 thus the rigid structures of aromatic polymers constrain radical e g r and alkoxyl radicals ro migration and thus result in a low concentration of oh for aliphatic polymers dmpo carbon centered radical adducts were only observed in aged pp pe and pvc mps under uv irradiation fig s4d suggesting that the aliphatic cc ch bond was broken and then promoted r and oh formation as similar with the mechanism described in fig 1b particularly pp produced the most evident signal of oh among all the aged mps primarily because its unstable tertiary ch bond was broken easily with concurrent r generation guo et al 2020 previous studies also demonstrated that the methyl group on pp chains enhanced the possibility of surface photochemical modification in comparison to pe under xenon lamp irradiation julienne et al 2019 3 3 crystallinity changes of nps mps the xrd diffraction patterns were also assessed to analyze the crystal phase structural changes of nps mps generally plastics with a high crystalline degree have sharp diffraction peaks liu et al 2019a an amorphous halo at a 2θ of 19 21 can be found on pristine ps ps cooh and ps nh2 nps fig s6 obvious sharp diffraction peaks were exhibited on pristine pp pe and pet mps indicating the high crystallinity of these polymers pc also had a semi crystalline structure and the crystallinity could be increased via production processes such as by annealing techniques kloos et al 2018 for pvc and ps mps the wide and gentle slopes of diffraction peaks with relatively low intensity suggested that the crystallinity of pvc and ps was lower than that of other mps after 2000 h of uv irradiation the xrd diffraction intensity of all nps mps increased which was consistent with a previous study wu et al 2020a this was probably because ros induced oxidative carbon chain cleavage and rearrangement in the amorphous phase of nps mps which resulted in post crystallization and crystallization increase after uv irradiation 3 4 functional group changes of nps mps fig 2 shows the fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir spectra for the surface functional groups of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 nps before and after uv irradiation ps nps exhibited new peaks at 1683 1716 1722 and 1731 cm 1 after 2000 h uv irradiation these spectral peaks were assigned to the c o stretching vibration of aromatic ketone benzaldehyde aliphatic ketone and aliphatic esters respectively arráez et al 2019 wong et al 2020 particularly ps nps exhibited obvious oh stretching of phenol or hydroperoxide in 3430 cm 1 because ps nps had a larger surface area and more reactive sites or surface defects for uv absorption and oh or 1o2 attack which led to the evident production of oxidation products for ps cooh nps the spectral peaks for oh at approximately 3450 cm 1 disappeared and c o at 1697 cm 1 decreased significantly after 1000 h of uv irradiation suggesting the ros induced degradation of the cooh surface coating for ps nh2 nps partial or complete removal of nh at 3436 cm 1 and o c at 1704 cm 1 were observed after 1000 h uv irradiation indicating the degradation of the amino surface coating by ros additionally new peaks such as a hydroxyl stretching at 3450 3436 cm 1 with shoulders from 3686 to 3274 cm 1 on ps cooh and ps nh2 were detected after 2000 h of uv irritation because the hydroxylation process or h abstraction by ro produced phenol alcohol or hydroperoxide moieties on the np surfaces arráez et al 2019 the newly added c o groups were also observed at 1715 cm 1 and 1777 cm 1 on aged ps cooh np surface which were attributed to benzaldehyde and peracid c oooh respectively meanwhile a weak c o absorption peak 1725 cm 1 was also detected on the aged ps nh2 surface the formation of new oxygen containing functional groups suggested that ros induced aging of nps resulted in bond breakage and oxidation of the surface coating or surface polymeric backbone under uv irradiation similarly obvious oxidation of the surface functional groups was shown in the ftir spectra for pp pe and pvc mps under uv irradiation and ros attack fig s7 for instance aged pp mps yielded new strong peaks at approximately 1771 1740 and 1715 cm 1 which were attributed to the absorption of c o in peracid aldehyde and ketone respectively rjeb et al 2000 moreover the ftir spectrum of aged pe mps had new peaks at 1720 and 1715 cm 1 which were ascribed to the absorption of the carbonyl groups in ketones and carboxylic acids respectively rjeb et al 2000 the aged pvc mps exhibited new peaks at 1725 and 1735 cm 1 which were assigned to ketones and aldehydes respectively zhou et al 2016 in addition the new peaks at 1617 and 1638 cm 1 may also be attributed to c c stretching vibrations wu et al 2020b probably due to the elimination of chlorine in the photoaging of pvc wang et al 2020a moreover the intensity of characteristic peaks at wavenumbers ranging from 3420 to 3430 cm 1 increased appreciably for the aged pp pe and pvc mps due to the oh attack in contrast there was no obvious generation of c o on ps pet and pc mps only hydroxyl functional groups had slight change for aged pet mps the peak around 3550 cm 1 became wider possibly due to oh formation from carboxylic acid with the scission of ester bond in addition aged pc and ps mps exhibited no obvious changes of spectral peaks in the hydroxyl region 3200 3800 cm 1 after 2000 h irradiation compared with ps nps ps mps had a negligible aging degree probably because ps mps with smaller surface areas may absorb less uv energy and generate less ros when the two particles were exposed to the same lamp with the same light intensity to quantitatively evaluate the polymer oxidation degree the carbonyl index ci and hydroxyl index hi were calculated in table s1 which are the ratios of the absorbance of the carbonyl peak at 1712 1765 cm 1 or hydroxyl peak at 3420 3550 cm 1 to those of the reference peaks at 1460 cm 1 for pp 1465 cm 1 for pe 1328 cm 1 for pvc 1452 cm 1 for ps ps cooh and ps nh2 and 1511 cm 1 for pet and pc mps balakit et al 2015 liu et al 2019b pires et al 2015 the ci value of aged ps nps 0 70 was 1 08 and 2 52 times as high as aged ps cooh and ps nh2 nps respectively for different types of the aged mps only ci of pp pe and pvc mps increased to 0 63 0 04 and 0 15 respectively these findings suggested that ps nps and pp mps are the most susceptible to uv irradiation and undergo the most severe ros induced photoaging process in the nps mps however the ci of aged pet mps declined due to the rupture of the ester bond after absorbing uv energy to form carboxylic acid group lin et al 2020 the ci of pc changed slightly suggesting pc was resistant to uv light without significant photoaging correspondingly the hi value for the aged ps nps increased by about 10 times of the pristine ps nps the hi values of some mps also increased after 2000 h irradiation except for pc mps indicating that the photoaging of mps resulted in oh formation which agreed with the changes of ci values for these aged particles 3 5 chemical binding state changes of nps mps the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps surveys different binding states of carbon and oxygen and the relative proportion of oxygen containing functional groups on nps mps before and after uv irradiation for 2000 h are shown in fig s8 s10 and tables s2 s4 a small amount of oxygen atoms and oxygen containing functional groups are inevitable to produce during polymer processing such as mechanical crushing or and storage zhu et al 2019 thus carbon and oxygen elements are identified for pristine plastic particles fig s8 in addition we observed nitrogen for ps nh2 nps and chlorine for pvc mps an obvious peak at 3442 cm 1 attributing to hydroxy functional groups was observed in pristine ps mps by ftir spectra however no obvious oxygen element content on pristine ps mp surface was observed by xps probably because the oxygen content was below the detection limitation of xps fig s10 shows that after ros attack during 2000 h of uv treatment all nps mps expect for pc mps produced coo hydroperoxide or alkyl peroxide in addition new oxygen containing functional groups were observed on the surface of aged ps nps fig s9a and s10a such as c o ketones or aldehydes and o co ester or carboxyl moreover other functional groups were detected by xps on aged plastics including o c o o peracid and c o on ps cooh nps o c o o c o and o co on pp mps c o and o co on pe mps and c o of pvc mps all the above functional groups were also observed in the ftir spectra in addition to the same functional groups detected by ftir c o emerged on ps mp surface as shown by o 1 s spectra fig s10g the formation of oxygen containing group is different among various mp compositions which were mainly attributed to the different polymeric structures and impurity chromophores that may affect the photo oxidation processes on different mps fig 3 shows the difference in the o c ratio relative proportion of aliphatic cc ch and π π shake up peaks of the pristine and aged nps mps as shown in fig 3a 3b the o c ratios increased and the relative content of cc ch bonds declined significantly for all nps and mps expect for pet mps after 2000 h of uv exposure p 0 05 suggesting that the broken of cc ch bonds by ros resulted in the formation of oxygen containing functional groups moreover the relative proportion of π π shake up significantly decreased on aged ps nps ps cooh nps and ps mps p 0 05 due to the possible opening of phenyl rings liu et al 2019b which provides evidence of the ros mediated aging process on the contrary uv irradiation did not have significant effects on the content of π π shake up of ps nh2 nps pet mps and pc mps p 0 05 due to the minor effects of ros attack which is relevant to the stronger scavenging effects of amino surface coating or rigid structures of aromatic polymers lomonaco et al 2020 lundeen and mcneill 2013 3 6 electrochemical impedance changes of nps mps the eis measurement devices electrolyte and electrode preparation process are shown in fig 4 a and fig s11 eis spectra for the uncoated ti plate the nafion coated plate and the ps mp coated ti plate are compared in fig 4b clearly after the surface coating the interfacial impedance of the ti plate electrodes dramatically increased primarily because of the low conductivity and slow electron transfer process of the coatings compared with the bare ti plate liu et al 2009 furthermore a comparison of the pristine and aged ps mps shows the change in the interfacial charge transfer resistance as indicated by the arc radius in the nyquist plots the nyquist plots of the pristine and aged ps mps in fig 4b shows that the diameter of the semicircle arc of aged ps mps is significantly smaller than that of pristine ps mps a smaller semicircle arc diameter corresponds to faster interfacial charge transport on the electrode surface thus the electrical conductivity of aged ps mps should be higher than that of pristine ps mps the eis data for the other eight kinds of nps or mps are presented in fig s12 which consistently indicates that ros induced functional group change resulted in impedance difference and possible interfacial property changes of aged plastic particles to explain this interfacial impedance change the eis spectra data were fitted using a hypothetical equivalent electric circuit model as shown in the inset of fig 4b where r s is the resistance of the solution ohm r c represents the charge transfer resistance of the coating layer ohm and a constant phase element cpe coating represents the electrode double layer capacitance f the value of r c was further converted to resistivity using the surface coverage and coating thickness of the plastic particle layer li et al 2016 the fitting data is summarized in table s5 the r s values had minor variations at different measurements which is reasonable because the electrolyte should change slightly in the different batches of eis measurements however the resistivity values increased after the surface deposition of some plastic particles on ti plates as the plastic particle coating layer reduced the electrical conductivity zhang et al 2015 after uv treatment some of the aged plastic particles such as ps nps ps nh2 nps and pvc mps resulted in an increased resistivity whereas other plastic particles had a decreased or unchanged resistivity the changes in resistivity could be attributed to the ros induced surface chemistry changes of these aged plastic particles coated on the electrode mirzaeian et al 2020 for instance the hydrophilic nitrogen and chlorine surface functional groups on the respective ps nh2 nps and pvc mps could be degraded table s2 and s3 the aged ps nps underwent ring opening reactions as shown in table s2 thus the number of delocalized π electrons decreased ramanavicius and ramanavicius 2021 these phenomena resulted in the increase in surface hydrophobicity mirzaeian et al 2020 which reduced the electrical conductivity of the plastic particles conversely the oxygen surface functional groups of ps cooh nps and pp pe ps and pet mps increased after ros attack table s2 s4 and thus the surface hydrophilicity and conductivity both increased the minor resistivity changes of pc mps indicated a low photoaging degree which was consistent with the ftir and xps data 3 7 ros mediated aging pathways and mechanisms clearly oh is the most important radical responsible for plastic photoaging due to its strong oxidation potential 2 8 v and large electrophilicity oh reacts almost instantaneously and nonselectively wang et al 2017 based on the above ftir xps and esr analyses we propose the photoaging pathways of various plastics under oh or 1o2 attack in fig 5 for aromatic polymers ps pet and pc mp suspensions generated low amounts of oh and they preferentially underwent oh addition at the benzene ring with a high electron density to generate phenols and other monohydroxy polymers xiao et al 2014 as confirmed by ftir xps and illustrated in pathways 1 2 and 3 although aliphatic ch cc scission or ring opening were observed on ps pet and pc mps table s4 the degradation products containing c o groups were only slightly detected probably because their concentrations were below the detection limits of ftir and xps for ps nps more oh radicals were detected as shown in fig s3a and they may have attacked ps polymers via addition to the benzene ring h abstraction and cc scission specifically oh addition first resulted in the formation of phenol fig 2a as described in pathway 6 moreover oh abstracted h from ps or phenol to generate tertiary polystyryl radicals which were further oxidized into ro these carbon centered radicals were confirmed by esr fig s3d subsequently these products underwent c2 c3 bond scission to form aliphatic ketones 1722 cm 1 and acyl radicals r co which combined with ro to form esters 1731 cm 1 in pathway 4 in pathway 5 oh may attack the c2 c4 bond of ro to form aromatic ketones 1683 cm 1 and then attack the c1 c2 bond to form benzaldehyde 1716 cm 1 excessive oh or 1o2 attack causes the opening of the phenyl ring as indicated by the decrease in the π π shake up signal in the xps spectra at 291 4 ev after uv treatment fig 3c previous work has demonstrated that the ring opening byproduct was aldehyde ps p1 formed after oh or 1o2 attack cyclohexa 2 4 dien 1 one or four membered ring intermediates ps im in pathways 6 and 7 respectively rånby 1993 yang and yang 2013 compared with bare ps nps carboxyl or amine coatings are more likely to be oxidized under uv irradiation for example the cooh coating can be oxidized by oh or 1o2 into unstable peracid and then undergo a decarboxylation process which was confirmed by the absence of c o of cooh after 2000 h irradiation in ftir fig 2e the deamination reaction took place on ps nh2 nps confirmed by a 35 7 nitrogen removal rate through relative element content calculation with xps table s2 fig 5 also illustrates the speculated photoaging pathways for aliphatic polymers for instance pp mps in pathway 8 undergo h abstraction and oxidation in the c2 h bond to form ro and then the breakage of the c2 c3 bond to form a ketone 1715 cm 1 then the oh attack on the c1 c2 bond generates aldehydes 1740 cm 1 and peracids 1771 cm 1 followed by the formation of acyloxy radicals and oh for pe mps the possible pathway 9 shows h abstraction from the c2 h bond with the formation of ro with subsequent oh attack to form ketones 1720 cm 1 and carboxylic acids 1715 cm 1 pvc mps are attacked by oh via h abstraction from c2 h bond and oxidation with the formation of ro ketone 1725 cm 1 and cl as confirmed by a dechlorination rate of 16 7 in xps analysis table s3 then oh attacks the c1 c2 bond of ketone to form an aldehyde 1735 cm 1 in pathway 10 in the meanwhile cl abstracts h from r to generate olefins 1617 cm 1 and 1638 cm 1 and hcl as shown in pathway 11 4 conclusion the grain size composition and surface coating of plastic particles were found to influence the generation of oh and 1o2 under uv365 irradiation in this work furthermore the physicochemical property changes of nps mps after uv irradiation were investigated to elucidate the ros induced photoaging pathways by oh addition at benzene rings h abstraction cc scission or aromatic ring opening for nps mps the findings successfully elucidated the structural changes and degradation of nps mps and streamlined the development of a theoretical framework of the photoaging pathways and mechanisms of the broadly detected nps mps of different compositions and structures in natural waters uv irradiation causes the formation of cracks and increases specific surface area of nps mps which may facilitate the leaching of chemical additives and polymer constituents such as brominated flame retardants plasticizers and metal ions e g cr6 and pb2 duan et al 2021 these secondary pollutants may further elevate the adverse impacts of plastic particles on the environment and human health furthermore ros generation may affect the transport and distribution of nps mps in natural waters for instance under the attack from oh the surface coating degradation of ps nh2 nps decreased the electrostatic repulsion and promoted the aggregation under uv irradiation wang et al 2020b this may further affect the plastic particle mobility and transport in natural waters therefore elucidation of ros generation from nps mps and ros induced aging processes is essential for understanding their environmental fate behavior and

16100,reactive oxygen species ros generation is considered as an important photoaging mechanism of microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps to elucidate the ros induced mp np aging processes in water under uv365 irradiation we examined the effects of surface coatings polymer types and grain sizes on ros generation and photoaging intermediates bare polystyrene ps nps generated hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 while coated ps nps carboxyl modified ps ps cooh amino modified ps ps nh2 and ps mps generated fewer ros due to coating scavenging or size effects polypropylene polyethylene polyvinyl chloride polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate mps only generated oh for aromatic polymers oh addition preferentially occurred at benzene rings to form monohydroxy polymers excess oh resulted in h abstraction cc scission and phenyl ring opening to generate aliphatic ketones esters aldehydes and aromatic ketones for coated ps nps oh preferentially attacked the surface coatings to result in decarboxylation and deamination reactions for aliphatic polymers oh attack resulted in the formation of carbonyl groups from peracid aldehyde or ketone via h abstraction and cc scission moreover 1o2 might participate in phenyl ring opening for ps nps and coating degradation for coated ps nps this study facilitates understanding the ros induced weathering process of nps mps in water under uv irradiation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics nanoplastics photoaging reactive oxygen species surface coating 1 introduction the increasing applications of

environments auta et al 2017 sun et al 2021 microbial degradation thermal degradation mechanical fragmentation and photochemical degradation are the major natural weathering processes of plastics liu et al 2020a song et al 2017 utetiwabo et al 2020 in particular photochemical aging processes were shown to alter the physicochemical properties e g crystallinity and surface morphology of nps mps and promote the release of toxic chemical additives or degradation byproducts liu et al 2020a tian et al 2019 these changes in physicochemical properties affect plastic decay transport bioavailability and the interactions between nps mps and surrounding organic or inorganic pollutants liu et al 2020b wang et al 2002 zhu et al 2020 during the photoaging process of nps mps the chromophores e g carbonyl or benzene rings of plastic materials may absorb uv energy converted to an excited triplet state by intersystem crossing and induces radical reactions generating reactive oxygen species ros or carbon centered radicals gewert et al 2018 liu et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 for example zhu et al 2020 detected hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 in an aqueous suspension of polystyrene ps mps 100 μm under uv vis irradiation our previous studies also reported the generation of oh by ps and polypropylene pp mps in artificial seawater and the formation of oh and 1o2 by ps carboxyl modified ps nps ps cooh nps and amino modified ps nps ps nh2 nps in nacl solution under uv irradiation at 365 nm uv365 chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020b despite extensive research the ros generation mechanisms and ros induced photo aging pathways are not yet determined the relationships of the plastic aging and the physiochemical properties of nps mps such as plastic compositions surface coatings and sizes under uv irradiation have not been well elucidated clearly such elucidation is critical for assessing the environmental fate and transformation of nps mps during the photoaging process of plastic materials ros or carbon centered radicals may cleave polymer chains and produce intermediates copolymers or monomers yousif and haddad 2013 light irradiation may also cause cc or ch scission and the formation of alkyl radicals r followed by oxidation hydrogen abstraction and decomposition into oh smith et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 oxidative intermediates formed through polymer oxidation and chain cleavage have also been demonstrated during the photoaging process gewert et al 2018 liu et al 2020b sørensen et al 2021 wong et al 2020 for example carbonyl hydroperoxide peroxides and unsaturated groups were detected on the surface of uv aged ps mps tian et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 uv degradation of poly ethylene terephthalate pet mps led to the formation of terephthalic acid phenacyl formate carboxylic acid and ester via breakage of the ester bonds sørensen et al 2021 in addition compounds with carboxylic acid end groups were identified as the main degradation products in ps pp pet and polyethylene pe suspensions under uv irradiation gewert et al 2018 recent studies demonstrated that the photoaging process of nps mps is largely attributed to ros induced chemical bond cleavage and subsequent formation of oxygen containing functional groups duan et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 however how ros attack and oxidize the structures of polymeric particles at molecular levels remains unknown which is critical to understand the ros mediated aging pathways and mechanisms of nps mps this work investigated the photochemical aging processes of different nps and mps with various particle sizes surface coatings and compositions under uv365 irradiation uv365 was selected as a light source because it is the main fraction of uv light reaching the earth surface li et al 2018 in addition the photoaging rate was faster than that under visible light e g xenon lamp irradiation and thus allowed us to efficiently observe the photoaging and weathering process of nps mps ps ps cooh and ps nh2 nps with100 nm in diameter were used to study the influence of the np surface coating on aging and ros generation accordingly the polymer composition influence was studied using aromatic polymers ps pet and polycarbonate pc and aliphatic polymers pp pe and polyvinylchloride pvc mps with mean diameters ranging from 42 to 107 μm these employed polymers are widely used in commercial products and represent most of the plastic pollution in the natural environment auta et al 2017 wu et al 2017 to interpret the aging mechanisms the ros generation of these nps mps was assessed to assess the aging degree we further characterized the physicochemical property changes by examining the surface functional groups and crystallinity of aged nps mps moreover the interfacial electrical properties were studied to verify polymer surface aging finally possible ros induced aging pathways or mechanisms of plastic particles were analyzed and proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of nps mps ps ps cooh and ps nh2 np suspensions were purchased from polyscience inc warrington usa pp pe and pet mps with diameters in the range of 71 8 106 7 μm were purchased from sigma aldrich reagent company shanghai china cospheric llc santa barbara usa and zhongcheng plastic inc dongguan china respectively pvc ps and pc mps with diameters in the range of 42 1 107 2 μm were obtained from guanbu electromechanical technology inc shanghai china these nps mps were of high analytical grade without addition of manufacturing additives to avoid the effect of residual substances in the synthesis process or storage medium e g surfactants and amine catalyst all mp powders were rinsed three times sequentially with ethanol and deionized di water and then dried at 30 for 24 h in a temperature humidity chamber before characterization and aging experiments other chemicals used in this study are provided in section s1 of the supporting information si the physicochemical properties of pristine and aged plastic particle were measured and the experimental details including the sample preparation procedures and instrument parameters are provided in section s2 the hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potential of plastic particles before and after aging treatment are compared in section s3 and fig s1 2 2 photochemical aging experiments under uv irradiation in the photoaging experiments 100 mg plastic particles were suspended in 100 ml di water and stirred on a magnetic stirring apparatus um 6t youcheng china to obtain effective exposure to uv irradiation a uv365 lamp uv tec philips china was placed vertically above the suspension at a distance of 1 cm from the reaction suspension surface the light intensity was set at 12 3 w m 2 which was selected because the uva light intensity of natural sunlight on the earth s surface is typically less than 17 2 w m 2 liu et al 2019c to control the temperature of suspensions and reduce the solution evaporation the lamp was turn off every 24 h to cool the solution for 1 h moreover the reaction temperature was kept at 22 2 by placing the reaction beaker in a constant temperature water bath the volume of the reaction suspension was checked constantly and di water was added to keep the volume at 100 ml di water was selected to eliminate the interferences from other water constituents e g salts heavy metal and natural organic matter on ros generation and clarify the photo aging pathways of nps mps liu and wang 2020 luo et al 2021 approximately 10 ml of the surface suspension was sampled at different uv exposure times 0 1000 and 2000 h for physiochemical property characterization 2 3 ros detection in aqueous suspensions of nps mps electron spin resonance spectrometry esr jes fa100 tokyo japan was used to measure ros in pristine or uv aged nps mps in a water suspension at ambient temperature the generation of oh and 1o2 was detected using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 50 mm and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp 10 mm as trapping agents respectively 5 tert butoxycarbonyl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide bmpo 30 mm was selected as the trapping agent of oh and o2 thirty u ml 1 superoxide dismutase sod was added to the mixture of nps mps and bmpo to scavenge o2 and distinguish the bmpo oh and bmpoo2 spin adducts he et al 2014 briefly 1 g l 1 pristine or aged sample solutions containing trapping agent were siphoned into quartz capillary tubes 0 5 100 mm 50 μl each tube was irradiated for 10 min by the same uv 365 lamp as used in the photoaging experiments and was then inserted into the esr cavity vitrex ltd denmark to monitor the spectrogram of ros adducts negative control experiments were performed in the aqueous trapping agent solution under uv365 irradiation or in the np mp suspension spiked with trapping agents without uv irradiation the esr measurements were conducted under a center field of 336 mt a sweep width of 5 mt frequency of 9441 mhz modulation width of 1 0 1 mt a time constant of 0 1 s amplitude of 5 100 power of 4 mw and sweep time of 1 min 2 4 the calculation of quantum yield for ros generation to quantify the photogenerated concentrations of oh and 1o2 by ps nps 5 μm of para chlorobenzoic acid pcba and 200 μm of furfuryl alcohol ffa were used as selective molecular indicators for oh and 1o2 respectively the concentrations of two indicators were measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 u s a following the published methods li et al 2014 the quantum yield qy was calculated by dividing the produced radical s number by the adsorbed photon s number according to the reported methods li et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 2 5 statistical analysis all photochemical testing particle size distribution zeta potential and xps characterization experiments were conducted at least three times to confirm their reproducibility the data points were expressed as the mean values standard deviation sd from three independent experiments or samples the significant difference of relative proportion of functional groups on c 1 s and o 1 s spectra o c ratio on pristine and aged nps mps and ros intensity on pristine and aged nps were conducted by paired samples t test using the statistical product and service solutions spss 26 0 differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of surface coatings on ros generation under uv irradiation fig 1 a compares the generated ros in the water suspensions of pristine and aged ps nps with or without surface coatings as indicated by the esr spectral intensities of different radical adducts the negative control experiments confirmed that no obvious ros signal peaks was observed in all pristine and aged plastic suspensions spiked with the trapping agent without uv irradiation data not shown or in pure water containing only the trapping agent under uv irradiation fig s2 fig 1a shows that the pristine ps nps without coating generated oh under uv irradiation as the esr spectrum shows four characteristic peaks of the dmpo oh spin adducts an ah 14 9 g in the ps np suspension as shown in fig s3a in contrast no obvious dmpo oh adduct signals are observed in pristine ps nh2 and ps cooh np suspensions probably due to the sequestration of oh by the surface coatings similarly only pristine ps nps yielded the four typical peaks of bmpo oh or bmpoo2 adducts with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 fig s3b the red line indicates that after the addition of sod to scavenge o2 the peak intensity changed slightly which means that o2 was not produced by ps nps under uv irradiation as shown in fig 1a 1 o2 was detected by esr in pristine ps and ps cooh np aqueous suspensions under uv irradiation which was confirmed by the three characteristic peaks of tempo with intensity ratios of 1 1 1 fig s3c no 1o2 was detected in pristine ps nh2 suspensions by esr in comparison with pristine nps fig 1a shows that the aged ps cooh and ps nh2 nps after 2000 h uv irradiation generated oh p 0 05 and the aged ps nh2 nps produced 1o2 p 0 05 this indicated that the degradation or removal of surface coatings of ps nh2 and ps cooh under uv irradiation promoted ros generation the uv irradiation did not have significant effects on the 1o2 generation for ps cooh nps p 0 05 probably because the loss of surfactant caused the formation of ps cooh np aggregates which accelerated the decay of excited triplet state ps cooh a precursor of 1o2 by quenching the surrounding ground state ps cooh and another triplet ps cooh thus the number of quenched 1o2 offset that of newly generated 1o2 furthermore dmpo carbon centered radical e g r adducts were observed in aged ps np aqueous suspensions fig s3d indicative of the generation of r in water the key radicals that promote oh generation zhu et al 2020 moreover the aged ps nps produced a lower oh signal than pristine ps nps p 0 05 because phenol could be generated in the photoaging process and thus could quench the oh radicals in ps np solution ceccarini et al 2018 similarly the aged ps nps appeared to generate a weaker signal of 1o2 than the pristine ps nps p 0 05 due to quenching effect to 1o2 by aggregated aged ps nps resulting from the loss of surfactant as like aged ps cooh nps again no o2 was detected in any of the ps suspensions as shown in fig s3e the possible radical generation mechanisms on ps nps are illustrated in fig 1b first the chromophore of ps such as the benzene ring absorbs uv photons to reach an excited singlet state and results in the formation of a triplet state by intersystem crossing zhu et al 2020 this triplet state could transfer energy to o2 to form 1o2 yousif and haddad 2013 zhu et al 2020 1o2 acts mainly as an electrophile preferring to be quenched by an electron rich amino coating at a rate with order of magnitude of 107 mol l 1 s 1 higher than that of a carboxyl coating 106 mol l 1 s 1 lundeen and mcneill 2013 pospíšil et al 2008 causing the faster consume rate of 1o2 by amino groups and resulted in a lower generation concentration of 1o2 in the ps nh2 suspension than in the ps cooh suspension on the other hand the triplet state energy is transferred to the ch or cc bonds to generate r that could readily react with molecular o2 in water to produce peroxyl radicals roo this reaction is followed by hydrogen abstraction from the nearest ch bond of the ps polymer to produce hydroperoxide rooh tian et al 2019 the rupture of the rooh bond results in the formation of oh smith et al 2018 yousif and haddad 2013 therefore the scission of rooh bond and transfer energy to o2 are considered as the key generation mechanisms of oh and 1o2 respectively finally these ros could have been involved in the photoaging process 3 2 effect of grain size and polymeric compositions on ros generation under uv irradiation no ros were detected in water suspensions of all pristine mps under uv irradiation fig s4a c because of the high hydrophobicity and chemical inertness of pristine mps the pristine ps nps were shown to produce more ros than ps mps probably due to the larger surface areas of nanosized particles that provided more reactive sites or surface defects for uv absorption and radical formation reactions ter halle et al 2016 fig s5 shows the concentration changes of pcba and ffa in the suspension of ps nps in 24 h under uv365 irradiation particularly pristine ps nps showed the highest qy of oh and 1o2 generation among all nps mps which were 0 0026 and 1 82 respectively the reported qy of ros generation on semiconductor photocatalysts such as tio2 varies on the order of 10 2 10 1 sun and bolton 1996 which are much greater than those qys obtained by the nps or mps interestingly oh was detected in aged mps whereas 1o2 and o2 were not observed fig s4d f the formation of degradation intermediates e g c o on aged mp surface may extend uv absorption and increase surface hydrophilicity and reactivity liu et al 2020b which may facilitate photochemical reactions at the surface and free radical generation these carbonyl functional groups absorb near uv radiation and subsequently generate oh following norrish type i and norrish type ii reactions atiqullah et al 2012 in particular norrish i cleavage would produce ch3 and induce initial ros reactions the oh intensities of the aromatic polymers ps pet and pc mps were lower than those of the aliphatic polymers pp pe and pvc mps fig s4d possibly due to their compositional differences for aromatic polymers phenyl moieties in the side groups of ps mps and the aromatic structure in the main chain of pet pc mps decrease their chain flexibility and increase the stiffness which might hinder the contact of free radical donor e g rooh and c o and acceptor sites e g ch lomonaco et al 2020 zhang and julian 2012 thus the rigid structures of aromatic polymers constrain radical e g r and alkoxyl radicals ro migration and thus result in a low concentration of oh for aliphatic polymers dmpo carbon centered radical adducts were only observed in aged pp pe and pvc mps under uv irradiation fig s4d suggesting that the aliphatic cc ch bond was broken and then promoted r and oh formation as similar with the mechanism described in fig 1b particularly pp produced the most evident signal of oh among all the aged mps primarily because its unstable tertiary ch bond was broken easily with concurrent r generation guo et al 2020 previous studies also demonstrated that the methyl group on pp chains enhanced the possibility of surface photochemical modification in comparison to pe under xenon lamp irradiation julienne et al 2019 3 3 crystallinity changes of nps mps the xrd diffraction patterns were also assessed to analyze the crystal phase structural changes of nps mps generally plastics with a high crystalline degree have sharp diffraction peaks liu et al 2019a an amorphous halo at a 2θ of 19 21 can be found on pristine ps ps cooh and ps nh2 nps fig s6 obvious sharp diffraction peaks were exhibited on pristine pp pe and pet mps indicating the high crystallinity of these polymers pc also had a semi crystalline structure and the crystallinity could be increased via production processes such as by annealing techniques kloos et al 2018 for pvc and ps mps the wide and gentle slopes of diffraction peaks with relatively low intensity suggested that the crystallinity of pvc and ps was lower than that of other mps after 2000 h of uv irradiation the xrd diffraction intensity of all nps mps increased which was consistent with a previous study wu et al 2020a this was probably because ros induced oxidative carbon chain cleavage and rearrangement in the amorphous phase of nps mps which resulted in post crystallization and crystallization increase after uv irradiation 3 4 functional group changes of nps mps fig 2 shows the fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir spectra for the surface functional groups of ps ps cooh and ps nh2 nps before and after uv irradiation ps nps exhibited new peaks at 1683 1716 1722 and 1731 cm 1 after 2000 h uv irradiation these spectral peaks were assigned to the c o stretching vibration of aromatic ketone benzaldehyde aliphatic ketone and aliphatic esters respectively arráez et al 2019 wong et al 2020 particularly ps nps exhibited obvious oh stretching of phenol or hydroperoxide in 3430 cm 1 because ps nps had a larger surface area and more reactive sites or surface defects for uv absorption and oh or 1o2 attack which led to the evident production of oxidation products for ps cooh nps the spectral peaks for oh at approximately 3450 cm 1 disappeared and c o at 1697 cm 1 decreased significantly after 1000 h of uv irradiation suggesting the ros induced degradation of the cooh surface coating for ps nh2 nps partial or complete removal of nh at 3436 cm 1 and o c at 1704 cm 1 were observed after 1000 h uv irradiation indicating the degradation of the amino surface coating by ros additionally new peaks such as a hydroxyl stretching at 3450 3436 cm 1 with shoulders from 3686 to 3274 cm 1 on ps cooh and ps nh2 were detected after 2000 h of uv irritation because the hydroxylation process or h abstraction by ro produced phenol alcohol or hydroperoxide moieties on the np surfaces arráez et al 2019 the newly added c o groups were also observed at 1715 cm 1 and 1777 cm 1 on aged ps cooh np surface which were attributed to benzaldehyde and peracid c oooh respectively meanwhile a weak c o absorption peak 1725 cm 1 was also detected on the aged ps nh2 surface the formation of new oxygen containing functional groups suggested that ros induced aging of nps resulted in bond breakage and oxidation of the surface coating or surface polymeric backbone under uv irradiation similarly obvious oxidation of the surface functional groups was shown in the ftir spectra for pp pe and pvc mps under uv irradiation and ros attack fig s7 for instance aged pp mps yielded new strong peaks at approximately 1771 1740 and 1715 cm 1 which were attributed to the absorption of c o in peracid aldehyde and ketone respectively rjeb et al 2000 moreover the ftir spectrum of aged pe mps had new peaks at 1720 and 1715 cm 1 which were ascribed to the absorption of the carbonyl groups in ketones and carboxylic acids respectively rjeb et al 2000 the aged pvc mps exhibited new peaks at 1725 and 1735 cm 1 which were assigned to ketones and aldehydes respectively zhou et al 2016 in addition the new peaks at 1617 and 1638 cm 1 may also be attributed to c c stretching vibrations wu et al 2020b probably due to the elimination of chlorine in the photoaging of pvc wang et al 2020a moreover the intensity of characteristic peaks at wavenumbers ranging from 3420 to 3430 cm 1 increased appreciably for the aged pp pe and pvc mps due to the oh attack in contrast there was no obvious generation of c o on ps pet and pc mps only hydroxyl functional groups had slight change for aged pet mps the peak around 3550 cm 1 became wider possibly due to oh formation from carboxylic acid with the scission of ester bond in addition aged pc and ps mps exhibited no obvious changes of spectral peaks in the hydroxyl region 3200 3800 cm 1 after 2000 h irradiation compared with ps nps ps mps had a negligible aging degree probably because ps mps with smaller surface areas may absorb less uv energy and generate less ros when the two particles were exposed to the same lamp with the same light intensity to quantitatively evaluate the polymer oxidation degree the carbonyl index ci and hydroxyl index hi were calculated in table s1 which are the ratios of the absorbance of the carbonyl peak at 1712 1765 cm 1 or hydroxyl peak at 3420 3550 cm 1 to those of the reference peaks at 1460 cm 1 for pp 1465 cm 1 for pe 1328 cm 1 for pvc 1452 cm 1 for ps ps cooh and ps nh2 and 1511 cm 1 for pet and pc mps balakit et al 2015 liu et al 2019b pires et al 2015 the ci value of aged ps nps 0 70 was 1 08 and 2 52 times as high as aged ps cooh and ps nh2 nps respectively for different types of the aged mps only ci of pp pe and pvc mps increased to 0 63 0 04 and 0 15 respectively these findings suggested that ps nps and pp mps are the most susceptible to uv irradiation and undergo the most severe ros induced photoaging process in the nps mps however the ci of aged pet mps declined due to the rupture of the ester bond after absorbing uv energy to form carboxylic acid group lin et al 2020 the ci of pc changed slightly suggesting pc was resistant to uv light without significant photoaging correspondingly the hi value for the aged ps nps increased by about 10 times of the pristine ps nps the hi values of some mps also increased after 2000 h irradiation except for pc mps indicating that the photoaging of mps resulted in oh formation which agreed with the changes of ci values for these aged particles 3 5 chemical binding state changes of nps mps the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps surveys different binding states of carbon and oxygen and the relative proportion of oxygen containing functional groups on nps mps before and after uv irradiation for 2000 h are shown in fig s8 s10 and tables s2 s4 a small amount of oxygen atoms and oxygen containing functional groups are inevitable to produce during polymer processing such as mechanical crushing or and storage zhu et al 2019 thus carbon and oxygen elements are identified for pristine plastic particles fig s8 in addition we observed nitrogen for ps nh2 nps and chlorine for pvc mps an obvious peak at 3442 cm 1 attributing to hydroxy functional groups was observed in pristine ps mps by ftir spectra however no obvious oxygen element content on pristine ps mp surface was observed by xps probably because the oxygen content was below the detection limitation of xps fig s10 shows that after ros attack during 2000 h of uv treatment all nps mps expect for pc mps produced coo hydroperoxide or alkyl peroxide in addition new oxygen containing functional groups were observed on the surface of aged ps nps fig s9a and s10a such as c o ketones or aldehydes and o co ester or carboxyl moreover other functional groups were detected by xps on aged plastics including o c o o peracid and c o on ps cooh nps o c o o c o and o co on pp mps c o and o co on pe mps and c o of pvc mps all the above functional groups were also observed in the ftir spectra in addition to the same functional groups detected by ftir c o emerged on ps mp surface as shown by o 1 s spectra fig s10g the formation of oxygen containing group is different among various mp compositions which were mainly attributed to the different polymeric structures and impurity chromophores that may affect the photo oxidation processes on different mps fig 3 shows the difference in the o c ratio relative proportion of aliphatic cc ch and π π shake up peaks of the pristine and aged nps mps as shown in fig 3a 3b the o c ratios increased and the relative content of cc ch bonds declined significantly for all nps and mps expect for pet mps after 2000 h of uv exposure p 0 05 suggesting that the broken of cc ch bonds by ros resulted in the formation of oxygen containing functional groups moreover the relative proportion of π π shake up significantly decreased on aged ps nps ps cooh nps and ps mps p 0 05 due to the possible opening of phenyl rings liu et al 2019b which provides evidence of the ros mediated aging process on the contrary uv irradiation did not have significant effects on the content of π π shake up of ps nh2 nps pet mps and pc mps p 0 05 due to the minor effects of ros attack which is relevant to the stronger scavenging effects of amino surface coating or rigid structures of aromatic polymers lomonaco et al 2020 lundeen and mcneill 2013 3 6 electrochemical impedance changes of nps mps the eis measurement devices electrolyte and electrode preparation process are shown in fig 4 a and fig s11 eis spectra for the uncoated ti plate the nafion coated plate and the ps mp coated ti plate are compared in fig 4b clearly after the surface coating the interfacial impedance of the ti plate electrodes dramatically increased primarily because of the low conductivity and slow electron transfer process of the coatings compared with the bare ti plate liu et al 2009 furthermore a comparison of the pristine and aged ps mps shows the change in the interfacial charge transfer resistance as indicated by the arc radius in the nyquist plots the nyquist plots of the pristine and aged ps mps in fig 4b shows that the diameter of the semicircle arc of aged ps mps is significantly smaller than that of pristine ps mps a smaller semicircle arc diameter corresponds to faster interfacial charge transport on the electrode surface thus the electrical conductivity of aged ps mps should be higher than that of pristine ps mps the eis data for the other eight kinds of nps or mps are presented in fig s12 which consistently indicates that ros induced functional group change resulted in impedance difference and possible interfacial property changes of aged plastic particles to explain this interfacial impedance change the eis spectra data were fitted using a hypothetical equivalent electric circuit model as shown in the inset of fig 4b where r s is the resistance of the solution ohm r c represents the charge transfer resistance of the coating layer ohm and a constant phase element cpe coating represents the electrode double layer capacitance f the value of r c was further converted to resistivity using the surface coverage and coating thickness of the plastic particle layer li et al 2016 the fitting data is summarized in table s5 the r s values had minor variations at different measurements which is reasonable because the electrolyte should change slightly in the different batches of eis measurements however the resistivity values increased after the surface deposition of some plastic particles on ti plates as the plastic particle coating layer reduced the electrical conductivity zhang et al 2015 after uv treatment some of the aged plastic particles such as ps nps ps nh2 nps and pvc mps resulted in an increased resistivity whereas other plastic particles had a decreased or unchanged resistivity the changes in resistivity could be attributed to the ros induced surface chemistry changes of these aged plastic particles coated on the electrode mirzaeian et al 2020 for instance the hydrophilic nitrogen and chlorine surface functional groups on the respective ps nh2 nps and pvc mps could be degraded table s2 and s3 the aged ps nps underwent ring opening reactions as shown in table s2 thus the number of delocalized π electrons decreased ramanavicius and ramanavicius 2021 these phenomena resulted in the increase in surface hydrophobicity mirzaeian et al 2020 which reduced the electrical conductivity of the plastic particles conversely the oxygen surface functional groups of ps cooh nps and pp pe ps and pet mps increased after ros attack table s2 s4 and thus the surface hydrophilicity and conductivity both increased the minor resistivity changes of pc mps indicated a low photoaging degree which was consistent with the ftir and xps data 3 7 ros mediated aging pathways and mechanisms clearly oh is the most important radical responsible for plastic photoaging due to its strong oxidation potential 2 8 v and large electrophilicity oh reacts almost instantaneously and nonselectively wang et al 2017 based on the above ftir xps and esr analyses we propose the photoaging pathways of various plastics under oh or 1o2 attack in fig 5 for aromatic polymers ps pet and pc mp suspensions generated low amounts of oh and they preferentially underwent oh addition at the benzene ring with a high electron density to generate phenols and other monohydroxy polymers xiao et al 2014 as confirmed by ftir xps and illustrated in pathways 1 2 and 3 although aliphatic ch cc scission or ring opening were observed on ps pet and pc mps table s4 the degradation products containing c o groups were only slightly detected probably because their concentrations were below the detection limits of ftir and xps for ps nps more oh radicals were detected as shown in fig s3a and they may have attacked ps polymers via addition to the benzene ring h abstraction and cc scission specifically oh addition first resulted in the formation of phenol fig 2a as described in pathway 6 moreover oh abstracted h from ps or phenol to generate tertiary polystyryl radicals which were further oxidized into ro these carbon centered radicals were confirmed by esr fig s3d subsequently these products underwent c2 c3 bond scission to form aliphatic ketones 1722 cm 1 and acyl radicals r co which combined with ro to form esters 1731 cm 1 in pathway 4 in pathway 5 oh may attack the c2 c4 bond of ro to form aromatic ketones 1683 cm 1 and then attack the c1 c2 bond to form benzaldehyde 1716 cm 1 excessive oh or 1o2 attack causes the opening of the phenyl ring as indicated by the decrease in the π π shake up signal in the xps spectra at 291 4 ev after uv treatment fig 3c previous work has demonstrated that the ring opening byproduct was aldehyde ps p1 formed after oh or 1o2 attack cyclohexa 2 4 dien 1 one or four membered ring intermediates ps im in pathways 6 and 7 respectively rånby 1993 yang and yang 2013 compared with bare ps nps carboxyl or amine coatings are more likely to be oxidized under uv irradiation for example the cooh coating can be oxidized by oh or 1o2 into unstable peracid and then undergo a decarboxylation process which was confirmed by the absence of c o of cooh after 2000 h irradiation in ftir fig 2e the deamination reaction took place on ps nh2 nps confirmed by a 35 7 nitrogen removal rate through relative element content calculation with xps table s2 fig 5 also illustrates the speculated photoaging pathways for aliphatic polymers for instance pp mps in pathway 8 undergo h abstraction and oxidation in the c2 h bond to form ro and then the breakage of the c2 c3 bond to form a ketone 1715 cm 1 then the oh attack on the c1 c2 bond generates aldehydes 1740 cm 1 and peracids 1771 cm 1 followed by the formation of acyloxy radicals and oh for pe mps the possible pathway 9 shows h abstraction from the c2 h bond with the formation of ro with subsequent oh attack to form ketones 1720 cm 1 and carboxylic acids 1715 cm 1 pvc mps are attacked by oh via h abstraction from c2 h bond and oxidation with the formation of ro ketone 1725 cm 1 and cl as confirmed by a dechlorination rate of 16 7 in xps analysis table s3 then oh attacks the c1 c2 bond of ketone to form an aldehyde 1735 cm 1 in pathway 10 in the meanwhile cl abstracts h from r to generate olefins 1617 cm 1 and 1638 cm 1 and hcl as shown in pathway 11 4 conclusion the grain size composition and surface coating of plastic particles were found to influence the generation of oh and 1o2 under uv365 irradiation in this work furthermore the physicochemical property changes of nps mps after uv irradiation were investigated to elucidate the ros induced photoaging pathways by oh addition at benzene rings h abstraction cc scission or aromatic ring opening for nps mps the findings successfully elucidated the structural changes and degradation of nps mps and streamlined the development of a theoretical framework of the photoaging pathways and mechanisms of the broadly detected nps mps of different compositions and structures in natural waters uv irradiation causes the formation of cracks and increases specific surface area of nps mps which may facilitate the leaching of chemical additives and polymer constituents such as brominated flame retardants plasticizers and metal ions e g cr6 and pb2 duan et al 2021 these secondary pollutants may further elevate the adverse impacts of plastic particles on the environment and human health furthermore ros generation may affect the transport and distribution of nps mps in natural waters for instance under the attack from oh the surface coating degradation of ps nh2 nps decreased the electrostatic repulsion and promoted the aggregation under uv irradiation wang et al 2020b this may further affect the plastic particle mobility and transport in natural waters therefore elucidation of ros generation from nps mps and ros induced aging processes is essential for understanding their environmental fate behavior and

16101,wastewater based epidemiology wbe is amply used for mining information about public health such as the estimation of consumption intake of certain substances yet proper biomarker selection is critical to obtain reliable data this study measured a broad range of pharmaceuticals and metabolites in a wastewater treatment plant in beijing china and evaluated their suitability as consumption estimation biomarkers wastewater sampling was conducted during a normal week and two holiday weeks to assess the impact of the holiday on population normalized daily mass loads pndls one hundred and forty nine out of 168 pharmaceuticals were detected with 94 analytes being quantified in all sampling events moreover digestive drug cimetidine mdl 672 ng l 1 and anabolic steroid trenbolone mdl 53 ng l 1 were only detected during holiday weeks pndls of some substances showed disparities between weekdays and weekends during the normal week this study proposed a framework to diagnose whether a parent compound or its metabolite is suitable for intake prevalence rate estimation our results support that not all the metabolites can be employed as biomarkers for back calculation when the in sewer stability of these compounds is unclear such as metoprolol acid and o desmethyl venlafaxine public healthcare data for drug utilization were applied to validate the prevalence of average substance use in this study as a popular anti epileptic ranging from hundreds to thousands of ng l 1 in this study the parent compound levetiracetam is more appropriate to be used in wbe under our framework referring to public healthcare data this wbe study illustrates the changes in pharmaceutical use and population lifestyle that stem from holidays and commutes in addition it can provide data support for the selection of more suitable biomarkers in wbe studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ppcps wastewater based epidemiology metabolites holiday impact chemical mining 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been widely utilized as a potent instrument for mining information on public health with the development of cities and the concentration of population more and more attention is paid to public health because of its relevant economic impact not to mention ethical implications hence reliable data and information on pharmaceutical consumption chemical exposure dietary health and disease outbreak warning of population etc have become vital traditional methods such as self declaration surveys or medical system reports and public health statistics have been unable to meet the requirements of timeliness and integrity kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a as wastewater is a mixture of human excretions that contains information on chemical intake exposure metabolism and excretion daughton 2018 kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a it can further reflect substance use and socioeconomic information choi et al 2020b so far many cases showed that wbe is an objective timely and convenient tool for estimation of pharmaceutical consumption birošová et al 2014 boogaerts et al 2021 gao et al 2016 petrie et al 2016 and illicit drug use daughton 2011 lancaster et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 levels of lifestyle biomarkers choi et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 pathogenic organism prevalence fernandez cassi et al 2021 hillary et al 2021 lundy et al 2021 and pollutants exposure kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a rousis et al 2020 2017a 2017b with the continuous exploration of the wbe method it was also applied to site or event specific analysis and spatiotemporal consumption pattern evaluation verovšek et al 2020 such as in prisons postigo et al 2011 van dyken et al 2014 or colleges burgard et al 2013 zuccato et al 2017 and during holidays foppe et al 2018 krizman matasic et al 2019 zhang et al 2019d or music festivals lai et al 2013 however most of these studies focused on illicit drugs or psychoactive compounds as well as alcohol and tobacco in specific sites but few on prescription and over the counter pharmaceuticals kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a thiebault et al 2019 different weekly and seasonal consumption variations of illicit drugs alcohol and tobacco were observed among previous studies for example increased use of tobacco and alcohol was observed during the weekend in a belgian city van wel et al 2016 but in australia no weekly patterns were noted for tobacco zheng et al 2020 these studies demonstrated that on the one hand wastewater analysis can reflect the population consumption and exposure of chemicals on the other hand more consideration should be given to specific sites or events when designing wbe investigation campaigns verovšek et al 2020 population normalized daily mass loads pndls were often used to investigate the spatial or temporal variations of substance consumption gonzalez mariño et al 2020 furtherly from pndls to pharmaceutical consumption biomarkers for back estimation should satisfy several criteria including representativity excretion rate detection frequency and in sewer stability choi et al 2020a 2019 daughton 2018 in kasprzyk hordern et al s study overestimation of pharmaceutical intake using parent biomarkers was observed and metabolic biomarkers were recommended to reduce overestimation as well as excluding direct disposal kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a 2021b meanwhile estimates using metabolic biomarkers may also be overstated if there are other production routes or sources of this substance e g morphine for heroin zuccato et al 2016 hence it is essential to involve multi biomarkers especially metabolites in wbe analysis to reflect a comprehensive chemical consumption at community scales and provide data support for feasibility assessment of metabolic biomarkers in our previous study a rapid and sensitive method was developed for 168 pharmaceuticals including 17 metabolites zhang et al 2020 which enables multi chemical analysis and biomarker screening in the wbe studies therefore this study focuses on a wastewater treatment plant in beijing and aims to i determine the occurrence of 168 pharmaceuticals and metabolites in influent ii calculate the pndl value of major compounds and investigate the temporal variations of pndls and iii evaluate the feasibility of metabolic biomarkers for back calculation and estimate community wide intake using appropriate markers this is the first report of a broad range of pharmaceuticals and metabolites in wastewater using the wbe method in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 target compounds and reagents one hundred and sixty eight target compounds including 17 metabolites in 8 categories were examined following our previous study zhang et al 2020 including anti asthma anti diabetic anti hypertensive anti microbial hormone replacement anti psychotic and other pharmaceuticals the analytes are described in table s1 of supporting information 1 si 1 chemical standards including native and internal standards were purchased from sigma aldrich us trc canada and first standard china and stored at 80 c methanol acetonitrile ammonium hydroxide hydrochloric acid sodium ethylenediaminetetracetate na4 edta and formic acid were obtained from sigma aldrich sinopharm china and fisher scientific us all the solvents were of uplc grade or higher ultrapure water upw was prepared by a millipore system us 2 2 sampling campaigns the wastewater treatment plant wwtp investigated in this study is located in beijing china with a designed treatment capacity of 80 000 m3d 1 three sampling campaigns of 7 or 9 consecutive days were performed during dec 07 2018 dec 13 2018 dec 30 2018 jan 04 2019 and apr 29 2019 may 07 2019 respectively the second and the third sampling period included the new year holiday dec 30 2018 jan 01 2019 and the may day holiday may 01 2019 may 04 2019 there were no rainy days during the investigation period sub samples were collected from wwtp influent every 15 min using a sd900 sampler hach co usa kept at 4 c and mixed into one as a representative sample of the day daily flow data and hydrochemical parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n suspended solid ss total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ph and temperature were obtained from the wwtp regular monitoring see si 1 table s2 and fig s1 in supporting information 2 si 2 2 3 sample pretreatment and analysis the samples were stored in the dark at 18 c and pretreated within 24 h the pretreatment and analytical method were based on our previous study zhang et al 2020 briefly 50 ml raw wastewater samples spiked with surrogate internal standards were centrifuged at 10 000 g 4 c for 5 min after which 25 mg na4edta were added to the supernatant then duplicate samples were adjusted to ph 3 0 0 5 and ph 7 0 0 5 respectively using hydrochloric acid or ammonium hydroxide for analysis of different compounds the target analytes were extracted using spe cartridges with functionalized polymer sorbent agela cleanert pep 2 200 mg 6 ml the spe cartridges were preconditioned with 6 ml 3 ml 2 of methanol and 6 ml 3 ml 2 of water at ph 3 or ph 7 and eluted with 4 ml 2 ml 2 of methanol samples were reconstituted into 500 μl with a 2 8 v v mixture of methanol and water containing 0 1 formic acid and then were spiked with 25 ng instrumental standards atrazine d5 and trichlorophenocyacetic acid d4 target compounds were analyzed with a shimadzu prominence ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc system japan coupled with a sciex 4500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization source the raw data were quantified by analyst mq 3 0 2 sciex us and the final concentration was obtained according to the dilution factor method performance parameter details including correlation coefficients of standard curve accuracy and limits of detection quantitation can be found in table s0 of si 2 the relative standard deviations of the two instrument internal standard detection were 5 7 for atrazine d5 and 3 2 for trichlorophenocyacetic acid d4 the spe recoveries were estimated using surrogate internal standard to range from 67 to 135 except mefenamic acid d3 40 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 population estimation we estimated the population equivalent pe using four hydrochemical parameters via eq 1 1 p e 1000 i n h a b i t a n t c p a r a m e t e r m g l 1 f m 3 d a y 1 m p a r a m e t e r g d a y 1 i n h a b i t a n t 1 where pe 1000 inhabitant in the equation refers to a real time population estimated cparameter mg l 1 is the concentration of measured parameter and f m3 day 1 is the daily influent flow rate the mparameter g day 1 inhabitant 1 is the daily emission of parameter per capita in the study area which was obtained from the national waste production and discharge coefficient report south china institute of environmental science 2011 the mparameter value is 88 for cod 9 74 for nh4 n 12 91 for tn and 0 94 for tp the detailed results of pe calculated with the four parameters are showed in table s2 in si 1 data distributions of pe on basis of the four parameters were compared fig s2 cod nh4 n and tn were observed with a similar distribution of data comparable expectation value and variance value while tp was with higher expectation and variance value ammonium as nh4 n is an indirect marker of urine and was applied to estimate the population in previous studies been et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 in addition wwtp in this study almost receives domestic sewage hence pe in this study was estimated using nh4 n load fig 1 shows the variations in number of inhabitants estimated using nh4 n in the catchment during three sampling campaigns the overall relative variation of pe was 18 which is acceptable zhang et al 2019b the mean of pes for the three sampling campaigns were 119 588 130 204 and 105 861 which were close to the declared service population of the wwtp at the time when more population movement was expected e g commuting holiday etc pe fluctuated more than the other time during the same period for example 2018 dec 10th dec 13th workdays of the 1st sampling period compared to 2018 dec 7th dec 9th 2018 dec 30th 2019 jan 1st holidays of the 2nd sampling period compared to 2019 jan 2nd jan 5th and 2019 may 1st may 4th holidays of the 3rd sampling period compared to 2019 apr 29th apr 30th and may 5th may 7th 2 4 2 back calculation the daily mass load was calculated according to the following equation 2 m a s s l o a d m g d a y 1 c n g l 1 f m 3 d a y 1 10 3 where c ng l 1 is the concentration of the analyte and f m3 day 1 is the 24 hr cumulative influent flow with the mass load of compounds calculated via eq 2 and a real time population estimated via eq 1 population normalized daily mass load pndl kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a was calculated using eq 3 3 p n d l m g d a y 1 1000 i n h a b i t a n t 1 m a s s l o a d m g d a y 1 p e 1000 i n h a b i t a n t to estimate the actual intake of substance using selected biomarkers the correction factor cf was introduced according to eq 4 4 c f m w p a r e n t c o m p o u n d m w m e t a b o l i t e e x c r e t i o n f r a c t i o n o f m e t a b o l i t e where mw parent compound is the molecular weight of parent compound and mw metabolite is the molecular weight of metabolite then the actual intake value was calculated following eq 5 5 i n t a k e m g d a y 1 p e r s o n 1 p n d l c f 1000 in addition with the combination of defined daily dose ddd which is defined by the world health organization who collaborating center for drug statistics methodology the prevalence of substance use can be estimated via eq 6 6 p r e v a l e n c e o f s u b s t a n c e u s e i n t a k e d d d 1000 2 4 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis and data visualization were implemented using r version 4 0 2 excel microsoft and tableau desktop version 2020 1 pearson correlations were used to inspect the correlation between two individual compounds and a p value of 0 05 was employed to describe the significance of correlation 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pharmaceuticals and metabolites 3 1 1 overall occurrence of pharmaceuticals in wwtp influent one hundred and forty nine out of 168 pharmaceuticals were detected in the wwtp influent among detected compounds 76 compounds were identified in all the samples and 107 compounds including 12 metabolites were found in more than 50 of samples antihypertensive antimicrobial antipyretic analgesic or anti inflammatory and others were determined with the highest total grouped concentrations during the three sampling campaigns fig s3 specifically acetaminophen and its metabolite 4 acetaminophen sulfate as well as caffeine and its metabolite paraxanthine 1 7 dimethylxanthine exhibited the highest concentrations with the median values of 7 1 μg l 1 4 2 11 2 μg l 1 12 7 μg l 1 2 8 169 2 μg l 1 5 6 μg l 1 3 2 24 3 μg l 1 and 4 1 μg l 1 2 7 16 9 μg l 1 respectively acetaminophen level was comparable with that reported in other studies 1 57 56 9 μg l 1 luo et al 2014 while the levels of caffeine and its metabolite were at a lower concentrations compared to those reported in the previous studies in the range 0 22 209 μg l 1 luo et al 2014 styszko et al 2020 for the other groups ambroxol a metabolite of bromhexine in group i anti asthmatic gliclazide in group ii antidiabetic metoprolol acid a metabolite of metoprolol in group iii antihypertensive ceftazidime in group iv antimicrobial hydrocortisone in group vi hormone replacement and levetiracetam acid a metabolite of levetiracetam in group vii anti psychotic were the main compound in each group more details about the concentrations and detection frequencies of each compound can be found in table s3 3 1 2 detection differences among three sampling events compound detections were different among the three sampling events according to loq detected concentration loq means can be quantified exactly as illustrated in fig 2 detections of target compounds differed among three sampling events ninety four compounds could be quantified in all three investigations event unique compounds were also found in each or every two sampling campaigns but most of them were quantifiable partially in a single sampling event except for these partially detected compounds enoxacin 42 0 102 ng l 1 oxolinic acid 1 15 6 01 ng l 1 and anti ulcer omeprazole 12 0 24 4 ng l 1 were only quantifiable in the 2 sampling event hypolipidemic gemfibrozil 2 0 2 8 ng l 1 and normorphine 8 1 27 3 ng l 1 a metabolite of morphine were only quantifiable in the 3 sampling event the differences of detection indicated different drug use patterns which reflect holiday or seasonal effects fig 3 moreover it is interesting to find that 2 analytes histamine h2 receptor antagonist cimetidine and anabolic steroid trenbolone were only detected in all the samples during the national holiday 2 and 3 sampling events cimetidine is used for the short term treatment of digestive system diseases e g gastric ulcer duodenal ulcer fda 2021 it was reported that hospital admissions for peptic ulcer during holidays was significantly higher than weekdays in china kao et al 2015 the detected concentration of cimetidine during holiday periods points out digestive system problems likely caused by increased food consumption and drinking compared to normal weeks even so cimetidine concentration observed in influent in this study concentration range mdl 672 ng l 1 was lower than that detected in other studies 1 μg l 1 choi et al 2008 petrie et al 2015 trenbolone is a synthetic anabolic steroid hormone used by sports competitors and bodybuilders kicman 2008 its occurrence only in the holiday period might be due to more sports activities 3 2 temporal variations of pndls compounds that can be quantified with detection rates higher than 50 in all the three sampling events were used to calculate population normalized daily mass load pndl according to eq 3 according to the class of compounds the sum of the group i vii was calculated separately for initial analysis the pndl value distributions of 18 classes of compounds in three sampling events are displayed in fig 4 it shows that most compounds were in a wider pndl range in 3 sampling events than the other two which might be because 3 sampling event period included a longer holiday 4 days during this time people were more willing to travel longer distances yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019c and then it led to greater variation in medication habits at the community level in addition the pndl distribution exhibited two distinct peaks in most cases of the 1 sampling event which indicated that there might be other factors impacting the pndl distribution one of the factors could be the differences between weekdays and weekends as shown in fig 5 a higher pndl values of some compounds such as climbazole and cotinine were found on weekdays than on weekends in the 1 sampling event 20181207 20181213 the correlation analysis of 18 classes of compounds was performed and the differences in compound correlations in the various periods were discussed linear correlation coefficient corr and significance p value of each sampling event and the whole investigation were calculated respectively fig s4 significant correlation was found only between viii 03 diphenhydramine and group iv antimicrobials not including pcps for each sampling event corr 1 0 97 p 0 001 corr 2 0 91 p 0 01 corr 3 0 83 p 0 01 and the whole investigation corr all 0 83 p 0 001 these correlation results indicated that co use of these two categories of pharmaceuticals might occur diphenhydramine dph is an antihistamine and is commonly used to treat allergy and cold and flu roberts et al 2016 the combination therapy of dhp with antimicrobials has been reported in previous studies areej et al 2021 gocmen et al 2009 caffeine viii 18 was expected to be correlated with its metabolite paraxanthine viii 14 choi et al 2019 however in this study the two compounds did show good linear correlations at most of the sampling points corr 0 9 except for 2 points in 1 sampling event with higher caffeine paraxanthine ratios see fig s5 moreover these two compounds were also observed with similar correlations with other compounds fig s4 which is consistent with the results of a previous study choi et al 2019 differences between the holiday including period 2 and 3 sampling and normal week period 1 sampling were emphasized in bold line in fig 5 b significant correlations were found between the following compounds just in normal week yellow line 1 viii 17 cotinine and group v antipyretic analgesic or anti inflammatory and 2 viii 11 clofibric acid and iv 13 climbazole as mentioned above pndl values of all these substances were observed with a weekday weekend difference fig 5 a combined with the pndl values of principal compounds in this group the significant correlation in the 1 sampling event was due to higher pndl values on weekdays than on weekends which can be illustrated more clearly in fig s5 specifically cotinine viii 17 was observed with a significant intra week difference in a normal week in this study p 0 001 198 222 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 in the weekend while 469 539 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 in the weekday which might be due to weekly commuting the job house ratio which is the ratio of the number of people in employment to the number of people living in an area can reflect the commuting situation to some extent the ratio in this study area is around 1 1 jiguang 2018 which means that the study area contains more work areas than living ones in the weekend presence of fewer commuters brings to different smoking and drug using patterns however other studies over a long time period or large spatial scale found no weekly pattern of cotinine lai et al 2018 rico et al 2017 wang et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 commuting pattern significant intra week difference in normal week found in this study indicates that it should be considered whether a special day e g holidays is included when a wbe investigation is designed more samples should be taken in normal weeks of a long time period to verify the commuting pattern in future studies in contrast significant correlations were only observed during the holiday including period red line came to more combinations viii 18 caffeine and group i anti asthmatic group iii antihypertensive viii 14 paraxanthine and group i group ii antidiabetic viii 10 bezafibrate and group i group iii and viii 01 codeine and viii 03 dph group iv antimicrobial during the holidays higher blood sugar level is more likely to occur with more consumption of caffeine containing foods and drinks positive correlations between antidiabetic and paraxanthine a metabolite of caffeine in holiday could prove this hypothesis the same phenomenon was also observed in another study in china song et al 2020 as for the other correlations the better one observed during the holidays might be due to the changes in drug use 3 3 framework to estimate the feasibility of metabolic biomarkers for intake estimation 3 3 1 ratio of metabolite parent compound m p as 17 metabolites were analyzed in this study these metabolites and their parent compounds were discussed in this section the ratio of metabolite parent compound m p calculated by dividing the metabolite load by parent compound load was proposed to identify whether a drug is the result of human use or direct disposal gracia lor et al 2017b rousis et al 2017b zuccato et al 2005 an m p ratio based framework is summarized to estimate the feasibility of metabolic biomarkers for intake calculation as showed in fig 6 relevant parameters are exhibited in table 1 it was reported that more than 90 of families in yunnan province in china throw away expired or unused drugs with household garbage or send them to a recycling point but not flush them down the toilet luo et al 2021 it reflects the disposal manner of expired or unused medicines by most chinese households and indicates that compounds detected in the influent of wwtps are mainly ascribed to human consumption therefore the following discussion of the m p ratio is of a certain value here compounds with small temporal variations rsd 0 5 are discussed and temporal variations of pndl and the m p ratio are presented in fig 7 it should be noted that in sewer stability of both parent and metabolic biomarkers should be considered when evaluating the feasibility of consumption biomarkers as well as interpretation of estimation results gracia lor et al presented that sewer instability of some compounds may introduce errors in intake estimates gracia lor et al 2017a 1 carbamazepine cbz and its metabolites notably 10 11 dihydroxy carbamazepine diohcbz as the main metabolite of carbamazepine cbz detected in urine eichelbaum et al 1985 was detected in all the samples with approximately 3 times higher concentrations than the parent compound mean m p ratio 3 0 0 5 confidence interval ci 95 a comparable ratio was also found in other studies table 1 in addition the ratio was close to the ratio in pharmacokinetic studies 2 1 3 2 although diohcbz can also be generated from oxcarbazepine oxcbz a keto analogue of carbamazepine the contribution of oxcbz is negligible due to its low excretion rate as diohcbz 3 in urine and low concentration detected in sewage in this study in summary diohcbz is a recommended metabolic biomarker under the framework for cbz intake estimation dihydro 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine cbz ep another metabolite of cbz via the main metabolic pathway was calculated to have a m p value of 0 2 0 1 ci 95 which is slightly higher than pharmacokinetic result 0 07 0 1 it was reported that cbz ep is excreted in lower concentration compared with diohcbz and it can be converted further to diohcbz catalyzed by cyp3a4 and cyp2c8 in humans miao et al 2005 in addition the epoxides are unstable in aquatic solutions and researchers speculated that cbz ep can transform into diohcbz in sewage leclercq et al 2008 from previous studies different m p ratios of cbz ep were found as shown in table 1 bahlmann et al 2014 ekpeghere et al 2018 leclercq et al 2008 miao and metcalfe 2003 miao et al 2005 additionally in this study the m p ratio of cbz ep showed more fluctuations during three sampling periods compared to the diohcbz ratio especially in the third sampling campaign which might be related to the higher temperature fig 7 b as cbz has been confirmed with a high stability in sewer different m p ratio of cbz ep cbz and fluctuations strongly points out the instability of cbz ep according to the framework cbz ep is not recommended to be a suitable metabolic biomarker in this study further study should be undertaken to assess the stability of cbz metabolites in sewer 2 caffeine caf and its metabolite interestingly the m p ratio of caffeine caf and its major metabolite paraxanthine pxt displayed a constant variation during the sampling period mean m p ratio 0 7 0 1 ci 95 which agreed with the correlations between these two biomarkers obtained in section 3 2 the m p ratio was close to the ratio observed in other studies gracia lor et al 2017b kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a besides similar temporal variations of caf and pxt in influent samples taken over consecutive days were also found out in other studies hillebrand et al 2012 the m p ratio was lower than that in pharmacokinetic studies 2 5 it was likely that a portion of caffeine detected in sewage stemmed from the direct disposal of the products containing caffeine such as tea and other soft drinks moreover the degradation of the two compounds and the difference in the instability between the rising main and gravity sewers gao et al 2019 may also lead to such observations nonetheless as one of the main metabolites of caffeine paraxanthine s stability under 4 c and 20 c in samples make it still used for caffeine estimation driver et al 2020 gracia lor et al 2017a kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a 3 metoprolol mtp venlafaxine vfx and their metabolites as shown in fig 6 b and c the m p ratio of metoprolol mtp and its main metabolite metoprolol acid mtpa and venlafaxine vfx and its main metabolite o desmethyl venlafaxine o dvfx was also observed with relatively little diurnal fluctuations comparable m p ratios were also observed in this study mtpa mtp 8 6 0 9 ci 95 o dvfx vfx 4 7 0 6 ci 95 compared with others mtpa mtp 6 6 11 5 o dvfx vfx 2 0 5 9 boogaerts et al 2019 gurke et al 2015 rubirola et al 2014 however the m p ratios of these two compounds were lower than the ratios estimated by the pharmacokinetic studies as the previous study indicated that venlafaxine and atenolol a pharmaceutical that is of the same type of metoprolol having a similar structure were stable in the sewers gao et al 2019 lower m p ratio might be caused by degradations of the metabolites which need further investigations this could also be supported by the reduction in the proportion of o dvfx compared to vfx found downstream of a wwtp metcalfe et al 2010 therefore mtp and vfx were chosen for intake estimation in section 3 3 2 according to the framework more studies should be undertaken to obtain a revised correlation factor of mtpa and o dvfx combined with description data du et al 2020 gao et al 2021 4 levetiracetam lev and its metabolite levetiracetam lev and its metabolite levetiracetam acid leva were both 100 detected with concentrations ranging from hundreds to thousands of ng l 1 in this study in the u s it was reported that the use of lev increased from 5 1 to 32 from 1999 to 2009 liu et al 2017 for this reason we think it is worth assessing both lev and leva in wbe studies however until now we have not found any studies on the simultaneous detection of the two substances or their stability in the sewers in this study a small temporal variation of m p ratios was found 1 9 0 3 ci 95 which was higher than the value assessed in the pharmacokinetic study 0 4 more research is needed to explain the stability of the compounds in the sewer and discuss the m p ratio 5 fluoxetine flx and its metabolite comparable m p ratios of fluoxetine flx and its metabolite norfluoxetine nflx were observed between sewage 0 9 0 2 ci 95 and human excretion 0 5 3 3 the mean value of the m p ratio in sewage was slightly higher than the result of kasprzyk hordern s study 0 6 kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a additionally they found that using nflx for back calculation underestimated the intake compared with actual prescriptions one of the reasons might be the further transformation of nflx according to the m p ratio in our study another reason might be the direct disposition of flx which indicated poor adherence to the medicine 6 other compounds and their metabolites as for the other compounds the m p ratios showed relatively significant temporal variations and in sewage ratios were not consistent with pharmacokinetic ratios this could be caused by generation from other sources or transformation of the compound in the sewer system in addition they had low levels of detection or a lack of relevant data the results are illustrated and discussed in si 2 fig s6 and table s2 3 3 2 intake estimation combining the in sewer stability and transformation of compounds discussed in section 3 3 1 10 compounds were further analyzed with correction factors cf to quantify the actual compound intake of the population in the study catchment the results of cf and intake estimations are listed in table 1 1 tobacco consumption and caffeine intake cotinine cot a metabolite of nicotine nic was used for consumption estimation since previous studies already confirmed its stability in the sewers gao et al 2019 nic intake calculated in this study ranged from 0 30 mg day 1 person 1 to 5 4 mg day 1 person 1 with a median value of 1 2 mg day 1 person 1 as shown in table 1 nic intake in this study was comparable with other studies in china gao et al 2020 and australia lai et al 2018 but two times lower than in italy castiglioni et al 2015 and the u s chen et al 2019 tobacco consumption could be estimated considering that nic content is circa 0 9 mg per cigarette in the chinese market and 88 of people aged over 15 are smokers in the study area hence tobacco consumption in the study area was calculated being approximately 1 5 cigarettes person aged 15 day cpd which is at a lower level in china gao et al 2020 the highest tobacco consumption nicotine intake 5 5 cpd 5 4 mg day 1 person 1 occurred during the third sampling event and the date 20 190 503 was both a weekend and a may day holiday see fig s7 in the case of caf paraxanthine pxt was chosen as a biomarker for intake calculation the intake value ranged from 16 mg day 1 person 1 to 121 mg day 1 person 1 which is in the range of 0 8 424 mg day 1 person 1 reported in another study conducted in china in 2014 gao et al 2016 caffeine intake estimated in this study is lower than that in australia europe and the united states table 1 as the largest contributors of caf intake are drink and food the difference is ascribable to different dietary habits between china and the west 2 prevalence rate of substance use and the role of public healthcare data as for the other five pharmaceuticals the prevalence rate of substance use was calculated in combination with the defined daily dose ddd via eq 6 ddd values and results of substance prevalence are listed in table 1 as for antiepileptic cbz the cf value obtained by back calculation was 7 69 which is in the range of the recommended value of 7 66 10 03 calculated on the basis of dispensed prescription data in a recent wbe study gao et al 2021 the estimated prevalence rate of cbz use is with a median value of 0 051 and 0 054 respectively using the parent compound cbz and metabolite diohcbz the approximate prevalence rate of cbz use suggested that diohcbz was suitable for back calculation of cbz intake and prevalence rate for future studies wbe results can be triangulated with the public healthcare data and in turn public healthcare data on drug utilization can provide evidence for biomarker selection as can be seen from the golden parallelogram in fig 6 studies on utilization of antiepileptic drugs in beijing hospitals found that lev the other antiepileptic detected in this study was one of the top three among the antiepileptics sheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a with a utilization proportion that was about 3 4 times that of cbz zhang et al 2019a although the prevalence rate results of lev applying the two biomarkers were different with median values of 0 19 for lev and 0 77 for leva and all these results were higher than the value of cbz 0 054 which validated the result in public healthcare data qualitatively in addition three to four times relative utilization ratio between lev and cbz from public healthcare data indicated that parent compound biomarker lev might be more reasonable as a marker for back calculation of consumption as prevalence rate using lev 0 19 was in the range of 3 4 times the prevalence of cbz 0 162 0 216 similar prevalence of the two antidepressants vfx and flx use were calculated with the median value of 0 0011 however it was recently reported that vfx is one of the top three antidepressants in beijing guo et al 2020 this work also showed that flx is utilized more frequently by adolescent patients 2 9 than middle aged and elderly patients 1 9 while vfx is almost equal 11 in both groups guo et al 2020 therefore the equal prevalence of vfx and flx use suggested that there might be a relatively large number of young patients with depression in the study area 4 conclusion one hundred and forty nine out of 168 pharmaceuticals and metabolites were detected in the influent of a wwtp of beijing 94 analytes could be quantified in all the three sampling events wbe was applied to investigate the patterns of drug use and daily consumption in holidays and commutes we proposed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of metabolic biomarkers for intake estimation and applied it in this study according to the results not all the metabolites were suitable to be employed as biomarkers for intake back calculation when in sewer stability of them is not well ascertained in addition public healthcare data validated the numeric results about the prevalence of substance use in our wbe study for example within this framework we identified the parent compound levetiracetam a popular anti epileptic pharmaceutical as an appropriate biomarker to be used in wbe referring to public healthcare data nonetheless further studies should be taken on the occurrence and the in sewer stability of levetiracetam and its metabolites declaration of competing

16101,wastewater based epidemiology wbe is amply used for mining information about public health such as the estimation of consumption intake of certain substances yet proper biomarker selection is critical to obtain reliable data this study measured a broad range of pharmaceuticals and metabolites in a wastewater treatment plant in beijing china and evaluated their suitability as consumption estimation biomarkers wastewater sampling was conducted during a normal week and two holiday weeks to assess the impact of the holiday on population normalized daily mass loads pndls one hundred and forty nine out of 168 pharmaceuticals were detected with 94 analytes being quantified in all sampling events moreover digestive drug cimetidine mdl 672 ng l 1 and anabolic steroid trenbolone mdl 53 ng l 1 were only detected during holiday weeks pndls of some substances showed disparities between weekdays and weekends during the normal week this study proposed a framework to diagnose whether a parent compound or its metabolite is suitable for intake prevalence rate estimation our results support that not all the metabolites can be employed as biomarkers for back calculation when the in sewer stability of these compounds is unclear such as metoprolol acid and o desmethyl venlafaxine public healthcare data for drug utilization were applied to validate the prevalence of average substance use in this study as a popular anti epileptic ranging from hundreds to thousands of ng l 1 in this study the parent compound levetiracetam is more appropriate to be used in wbe under our framework referring to public healthcare data this wbe study illustrates the changes in pharmaceutical use and population lifestyle that stem from holidays and commutes in addition it can provide data support for the selection of more suitable biomarkers in wbe studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ppcps wastewater based epidemiology metabolites holiday impact chemical mining 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been widely utilized as a potent instrument for mining information on public health with the development of cities and the concentration of population more and more attention is paid to public health because of its relevant economic impact not to mention ethical implications hence reliable data and information on pharmaceutical consumption chemical exposure dietary health and disease outbreak warning of population etc have become vital traditional methods such as self declaration surveys or medical system reports and public health statistics have been unable to meet the requirements of timeliness and integrity kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a as wastewater is a mixture of human excretions that contains information on chemical intake exposure metabolism and excretion daughton 2018 kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a it can further reflect substance use and socioeconomic information choi et al 2020b so far many cases showed that wbe is an objective timely and convenient tool for estimation of pharmaceutical consumption birošová et al 2014 boogaerts et al 2021 gao et al 2016 petrie et al 2016 and illicit drug use daughton 2011 lancaster et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 levels of lifestyle biomarkers choi et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 pathogenic organism prevalence fernandez cassi et al 2021 hillary et al 2021 lundy et al 2021 and pollutants exposure kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a rousis et al 2020 2017a 2017b with the continuous exploration of the wbe method it was also applied to site or event specific analysis and spatiotemporal consumption pattern evaluation verovšek et al 2020 such as in prisons postigo et al 2011 van dyken et al 2014 or colleges burgard et al 2013 zuccato et al 2017 and during holidays foppe et al 2018 krizman matasic et al 2019 zhang et al 2019d or music festivals lai et al 2013 however most of these studies focused on illicit drugs or psychoactive compounds as well as alcohol and tobacco in specific sites but few on prescription and over the counter pharmaceuticals kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a thiebault et al 2019 different weekly and seasonal consumption variations of illicit drugs alcohol and tobacco were observed among previous studies for example increased use of tobacco and alcohol was observed during the weekend in a belgian city van wel et al 2016 but in australia no weekly patterns were noted for tobacco zheng et al 2020 these studies demonstrated that on the one hand wastewater analysis can reflect the population consumption and exposure of chemicals on the other hand more consideration should be given to specific sites or events when designing wbe investigation campaigns verovšek et al 2020 population normalized daily mass loads pndls were often used to investigate the spatial or temporal variations of substance consumption gonzalez mariño et al 2020 furtherly from pndls to pharmaceutical consumption biomarkers for back estimation should satisfy several criteria including representativity excretion rate detection frequency and in sewer stability choi et al 2020a 2019 daughton 2018 in kasprzyk hordern et al s study overestimation of pharmaceutical intake using parent biomarkers was observed and metabolic biomarkers were recommended to reduce overestimation as well as excluding direct disposal kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a 2021b meanwhile estimates using metabolic biomarkers may also be overstated if there are other production routes or sources of this substance e g morphine for heroin zuccato et al 2016 hence it is essential to involve multi biomarkers especially metabolites in wbe analysis to reflect a comprehensive chemical consumption at community scales and provide data support for feasibility assessment of metabolic biomarkers in our previous study a rapid and sensitive method was developed for 168 pharmaceuticals including 17 metabolites zhang et al 2020 which enables multi chemical analysis and biomarker screening in the wbe studies therefore this study focuses on a wastewater treatment plant in beijing and aims to i determine the occurrence of 168 pharmaceuticals and metabolites in influent ii calculate the pndl value of major compounds and investigate the temporal variations of pndls and iii evaluate the feasibility of metabolic biomarkers for back calculation and estimate community wide intake using appropriate markers this is the first report of a broad range of pharmaceuticals and metabolites in wastewater using the wbe method in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 target compounds and reagents one hundred and sixty eight target compounds including 17 metabolites in 8 categories were examined following our previous study zhang et al 2020 including anti asthma anti diabetic anti hypertensive anti microbial hormone replacement anti psychotic and other pharmaceuticals the analytes are described in table s1 of supporting information 1 si 1 chemical standards including native and internal standards were purchased from sigma aldrich us trc canada and first standard china and stored at 80 c methanol acetonitrile ammonium hydroxide hydrochloric acid sodium ethylenediaminetetracetate na4 edta and formic acid were obtained from sigma aldrich sinopharm china and fisher scientific us all the solvents were of uplc grade or higher ultrapure water upw was prepared by a millipore system us 2 2 sampling campaigns the wastewater treatment plant wwtp investigated in this study is located in beijing china with a designed treatment capacity of 80 000 m3d 1 three sampling campaigns of 7 or 9 consecutive days were performed during dec 07 2018 dec 13 2018 dec 30 2018 jan 04 2019 and apr 29 2019 may 07 2019 respectively the second and the third sampling period included the new year holiday dec 30 2018 jan 01 2019 and the may day holiday may 01 2019 may 04 2019 there were no rainy days during the investigation period sub samples were collected from wwtp influent every 15 min using a sd900 sampler hach co usa kept at 4 c and mixed into one as a representative sample of the day daily flow data and hydrochemical parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n suspended solid ss total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ph and temperature were obtained from the wwtp regular monitoring see si 1 table s2 and fig s1 in supporting information 2 si 2 2 3 sample pretreatment and analysis the samples were stored in the dark at 18 c and pretreated within 24 h the pretreatment and analytical method were based on our previous study zhang et al 2020 briefly 50 ml raw wastewater samples spiked with surrogate internal standards were centrifuged at 10 000 g 4 c for 5 min after which 25 mg na4edta were added to the supernatant then duplicate samples were adjusted to ph 3 0 0 5 and ph 7 0 0 5 respectively using hydrochloric acid or ammonium hydroxide for analysis of different compounds the target analytes were extracted using spe cartridges with functionalized polymer sorbent agela cleanert pep 2 200 mg 6 ml the spe cartridges were preconditioned with 6 ml 3 ml 2 of methanol and 6 ml 3 ml 2 of water at ph 3 or ph 7 and eluted with 4 ml 2 ml 2 of methanol samples were reconstituted into 500 μl with a 2 8 v v mixture of methanol and water containing 0 1 formic acid and then were spiked with 25 ng instrumental standards atrazine d5 and trichlorophenocyacetic acid d4 target compounds were analyzed with a shimadzu prominence ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc system japan coupled with a sciex 4500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization source the raw data were quantified by analyst mq 3 0 2 sciex us and the final concentration was obtained according to the dilution factor method performance parameter details including correlation coefficients of standard curve accuracy and limits of detection quantitation can be found in table s0 of si 2 the relative standard deviations of the two instrument internal standard detection were 5 7 for atrazine d5 and 3 2 for trichlorophenocyacetic acid d4 the spe recoveries were estimated using surrogate internal standard to range from 67 to 135 except mefenamic acid d3 40 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 population estimation we estimated the population equivalent pe using four hydrochemical parameters via eq 1 1 p e 1000 i n h a b i t a n t c p a r a m e t e r m g l 1 f m 3 d a y 1 m p a r a m e t e r g d a y 1 i n h a b i t a n t 1 where pe 1000 inhabitant in the equation refers to a real time population estimated cparameter mg l 1 is the concentration of measured parameter and f m3 day 1 is the daily influent flow rate the mparameter g day 1 inhabitant 1 is the daily emission of parameter per capita in the study area which was obtained from the national waste production and discharge coefficient report south china institute of environmental science 2011 the mparameter value is 88 for cod 9 74 for nh4 n 12 91 for tn and 0 94 for tp the detailed results of pe calculated with the four parameters are showed in table s2 in si 1 data distributions of pe on basis of the four parameters were compared fig s2 cod nh4 n and tn were observed with a similar distribution of data comparable expectation value and variance value while tp was with higher expectation and variance value ammonium as nh4 n is an indirect marker of urine and was applied to estimate the population in previous studies been et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 in addition wwtp in this study almost receives domestic sewage hence pe in this study was estimated using nh4 n load fig 1 shows the variations in number of inhabitants estimated using nh4 n in the catchment during three sampling campaigns the overall relative variation of pe was 18 which is acceptable zhang et al 2019b the mean of pes for the three sampling campaigns were 119 588 130 204 and 105 861 which were close to the declared service population of the wwtp at the time when more population movement was expected e g commuting holiday etc pe fluctuated more than the other time during the same period for example 2018 dec 10th dec 13th workdays of the 1st sampling period compared to 2018 dec 7th dec 9th 2018 dec 30th 2019 jan 1st holidays of the 2nd sampling period compared to 2019 jan 2nd jan 5th and 2019 may 1st may 4th holidays of the 3rd sampling period compared to 2019 apr 29th apr 30th and may 5th may 7th 2 4 2 back calculation the daily mass load was calculated according to the following equation 2 m a s s l o a d m g d a y 1 c n g l 1 f m 3 d a y

via eq 1 population normalized daily mass load pndl kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a was calculated using eq 3 3 p n d l m g d a y 1 1000 i n h a b i t a n t 1 m a s s l o a d m g d a y 1 p e 1000 i n h a b i t a n t to estimate the actual intake of substance using selected biomarkers the correction factor cf was introduced according to eq 4 4 c f m w p a r e n t c o m p o u n d m w m e t a b o l i t e e x c r e t i o n f r a c t i o n o f m e t a b o l i t e where mw parent compound is the molecular weight of parent compound and mw metabolite is the molecular weight of metabolite then the actual intake value was calculated following eq 5 5 i n t a k e m g d a y 1 p e r s o n 1 p n d l c f 1000 in addition with the combination of defined daily dose ddd which is defined by the world health organization who collaborating center for drug statistics methodology the prevalence of substance use can be estimated via eq 6 6 p r e v a l e n c e o f s u b s t a n c e u s e i n t a k e d d d 1000 2 4 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis and data visualization were implemented using r version 4 0 2 excel microsoft and tableau desktop version 2020 1 pearson correlations were used to inspect the correlation between two individual compounds and a p value of 0 05 was employed to describe the significance of correlation 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pharmaceuticals and metabolites 3 1 1 overall occurrence of pharmaceuticals in wwtp influent one hundred and forty nine out of 168 pharmaceuticals were detected in the wwtp influent among detected compounds 76 compounds were identified in all the samples and 107 compounds including 12 metabolites were found in more than 50 of samples antihypertensive antimicrobial antipyretic analgesic or anti inflammatory and others were determined with the highest total grouped concentrations during the three sampling campaigns fig s3 specifically acetaminophen and its metabolite 4 acetaminophen sulfate as well as caffeine and its metabolite paraxanthine 1 7 dimethylxanthine exhibited the highest concentrations with the median values of 7 1 μg l 1 4 2 11 2 μg l 1 12 7 μg l 1 2 8 169 2 μg l 1 5 6 μg l 1 3 2 24 3 μg l 1 and 4 1 μg l 1 2 7 16 9 μg l 1 respectively acetaminophen level was comparable with that reported in other studies 1 57 56 9 μg l 1 luo et al 2014 while the levels of caffeine and its metabolite were at a lower concentrations compared to those reported in the previous studies in the range 0 22 209 μg l 1 luo et al 2014 styszko et al 2020 for the other groups ambroxol a metabolite of bromhexine in group i anti asthmatic gliclazide in group ii antidiabetic metoprolol acid a metabolite of metoprolol in group iii antihypertensive ceftazidime in group iv antimicrobial hydrocortisone in group vi hormone replacement and levetiracetam acid a metabolite of levetiracetam in group vii anti psychotic were the main compound in each group more details about the concentrations and detection frequencies of each compound can be found in table s3 3 1 2 detection differences among three sampling events compound detections were different among the three sampling events according to loq detected concentration loq means can be quantified exactly as illustrated in fig 2 detections of target compounds differed among three sampling events ninety four compounds could be quantified in all three investigations event unique compounds were also found in each or every two sampling campaigns but most of them were quantifiable partially in a single sampling event except for these partially detected compounds enoxacin 42 0 102 ng l 1 oxolinic acid 1 15 6 01 ng l 1 and anti ulcer omeprazole 12 0 24 4 ng l 1 were only quantifiable in the 2 sampling event hypolipidemic gemfibrozil 2 0 2 8 ng l 1 and normorphine 8 1 27 3 ng l 1 a metabolite of morphine were only quantifiable in the 3 sampling event the differences of detection indicated different drug use patterns which reflect holiday or seasonal effects fig 3 moreover it is interesting to find that 2 analytes histamine h2 receptor antagonist cimetidine and anabolic steroid trenbolone were only detected in all the samples during the national holiday 2 and 3 sampling events cimetidine is used for the short term treatment of digestive system diseases e g gastric ulcer duodenal ulcer fda 2021 it was reported that hospital admissions for peptic ulcer during holidays was significantly higher than weekdays in china kao et al 2015 the detected concentration of cimetidine during holiday periods points out digestive system problems likely caused by increased food consumption and drinking compared to normal weeks even so cimetidine concentration observed in influent in this study concentration range mdl 672 ng l 1 was lower than that detected in other studies 1 μg l 1 choi et al 2008 petrie et al 2015 trenbolone is a synthetic anabolic steroid hormone used by sports competitors and bodybuilders kicman 2008 its occurrence only in the holiday period might be due to more sports activities 3 2 temporal variations of pndls compounds that can be quantified with detection rates higher than 50 in all the three sampling events were used to calculate population normalized daily mass load pndl according to eq 3 according to the class of compounds the sum of the group i vii was calculated separately for initial analysis the pndl value distributions of 18 classes of compounds in three sampling events are displayed in fig 4 it shows that most compounds were in a wider pndl range in 3 sampling events than the other two which might be because 3 sampling event period included a longer holiday 4 days during this time people were more willing to travel longer distances yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019c and then it led to greater variation in medication habits at the community level in addition the pndl distribution exhibited two distinct peaks in most cases of the 1 sampling event which indicated that there might be other factors impacting the pndl distribution one of the factors could be the differences between weekdays and weekends as shown in fig 5 a higher pndl values of some compounds such as climbazole and cotinine were found on weekdays than on weekends in the 1 sampling event 20181207 20181213 the correlation analysis of 18 classes of compounds was performed and the differences in compound correlations in the various periods were discussed linear correlation coefficient corr and significance p value of each sampling event and the whole investigation were calculated respectively fig s4 significant correlation was found only between viii 03 diphenhydramine and group iv antimicrobials not including pcps for each sampling event corr 1 0 97 p 0 001 corr 2 0 91 p 0 01 corr 3 0 83 p 0 01 and the whole investigation corr all 0 83 p 0 001 these correlation results indicated that co use of these two categories of pharmaceuticals might occur diphenhydramine dph is an antihistamine and is commonly used to treat allergy and cold and flu roberts et al 2016 the combination therapy of dhp with antimicrobials has been reported in previous studies areej et al 2021 gocmen et al 2009 caffeine viii 18 was expected to be correlated with its metabolite paraxanthine viii 14 choi et al 2019 however in this study the two compounds did show good linear correlations at most of the sampling points corr 0 9 except for 2 points in 1 sampling event with higher caffeine paraxanthine ratios see fig s5 moreover these two compounds were also observed with similar correlations with other compounds fig s4 which is consistent with the results of a previous study choi et al 2019 differences between the holiday including period 2 and 3 sampling and normal week period 1 sampling were emphasized in bold line in fig 5 b significant correlations were found between the following compounds just in normal week yellow line 1 viii 17 cotinine and group v antipyretic analgesic or anti inflammatory and 2 viii 11 clofibric acid and iv 13 climbazole as mentioned above pndl values of all these substances were observed with a weekday weekend difference fig 5 a combined with the pndl values of principal compounds in this group the significant correlation in the 1 sampling event was due to higher pndl values on weekdays than on weekends which can be illustrated more clearly in fig s5 specifically cotinine viii 17 was observed with a significant intra week difference in a normal week in this study p 0 001 198 222 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 in the weekend while 469 539 mg day 1 1000 inhabitant 1 in the weekday which might be due to weekly commuting the job house ratio which is the ratio of the number of people in employment to the number of people living in an area can reflect the commuting situation to some extent the ratio in this study area is around 1 1 jiguang 2018 which means that the study area contains more work areas than living ones in the weekend presence of fewer commuters brings to different smoking and drug using patterns however other studies over a long time period or large spatial scale found no weekly pattern of cotinine lai et al 2018 rico et al 2017 wang et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 commuting pattern significant intra week difference in normal week found in this study indicates that it should be considered whether a special day e g holidays is included when a wbe investigation is designed more samples should be taken in normal weeks of a long time period to verify the commuting pattern in future studies in contrast significant correlations were only observed during the holiday including period red line came to more combinations viii 18 caffeine and group i anti asthmatic group iii antihypertensive viii 14 paraxanthine and group i group ii antidiabetic viii 10 bezafibrate and group i group iii and viii 01 codeine and viii 03 dph group iv antimicrobial during the holidays higher blood sugar level is more likely to occur with more consumption of caffeine containing foods and drinks positive correlations between antidiabetic and paraxanthine a metabolite of caffeine in holiday could prove this hypothesis the same phenomenon was also observed in another study in china song et al 2020 as for the other correlations the better one observed during the holidays might be due to the changes in drug use 3 3 framework to estimate the feasibility of metabolic biomarkers for intake estimation 3 3 1 ratio of metabolite parent compound m p as 17 metabolites were analyzed in this study these metabolites and their parent compounds were discussed in this section the ratio of metabolite parent compound m p calculated by dividing the metabolite load by parent compound load was proposed to identify whether a drug is the result of human use or direct disposal gracia lor et al 2017b rousis et al 2017b zuccato et al 2005 an m p ratio based framework is summarized to estimate the feasibility of metabolic biomarkers for intake calculation as showed in fig 6 relevant parameters are exhibited in table 1 it was reported that more than 90 of families in yunnan province in china throw away expired or unused drugs with household garbage or send them to a recycling point but not flush them down the toilet luo et al 2021 it reflects the disposal manner of expired or unused medicines by most chinese households and indicates that compounds detected in the influent of wwtps are mainly ascribed to human consumption therefore the following discussion of the m p ratio is of a certain value here compounds with small temporal variations rsd 0 5 are discussed and temporal variations of pndl and the m p ratio are presented in fig 7 it should be noted that in sewer stability of both parent and metabolic biomarkers should be considered when evaluating the feasibility of consumption biomarkers as well as interpretation of estimation results gracia lor et al presented that sewer instability of some compounds may introduce errors in intake estimates gracia lor et al 2017a 1 carbamazepine cbz and its metabolites notably 10 11 dihydroxy carbamazepine diohcbz as the main metabolite of carbamazepine cbz detected in urine eichelbaum et al 1985 was detected in all the samples with approximately 3 times higher concentrations than the parent compound mean m p ratio 3 0 0 5 confidence interval ci 95 a comparable ratio was also found in other studies table 1 in addition the ratio was close to the ratio in pharmacokinetic studies 2 1 3 2 although diohcbz can also be generated from oxcarbazepine oxcbz a keto analogue of carbamazepine the contribution of oxcbz is negligible due to its low excretion rate as diohcbz 3 in urine and low concentration detected in sewage in this study in summary diohcbz is a recommended metabolic biomarker under the framework for cbz intake estimation dihydro 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine cbz ep another metabolite of cbz via the main metabolic pathway was calculated to have a m p value of 0 2 0 1 ci 95 which is slightly higher than pharmacokinetic result 0 07 0 1 it was reported that cbz ep is excreted in lower concentration compared with diohcbz and it can be converted further to diohcbz catalyzed by cyp3a4 and cyp2c8 in humans miao et al 2005 in addition the epoxides are unstable in aquatic solutions and researchers speculated that cbz ep can transform into diohcbz in sewage leclercq et al 2008 from previous studies different m p ratios of cbz ep were found as shown in table 1 bahlmann et al 2014 ekpeghere et al 2018 leclercq et al 2008 miao and metcalfe 2003 miao et al 2005 additionally in this study the m p ratio of cbz ep showed more fluctuations during three sampling periods compared to the diohcbz ratio especially in the third sampling campaign which might be related to the higher temperature fig 7 b as cbz has been confirmed with a high stability in sewer different m p ratio of cbz ep cbz and fluctuations strongly points out the instability of cbz ep according to the framework cbz ep is not recommended to be a suitable metabolic biomarker in this study further study should be undertaken to assess the stability of cbz metabolites in sewer 2 caffeine caf and its metabolite interestingly the m p ratio of caffeine caf and its major metabolite paraxanthine pxt displayed a constant variation during the sampling period mean m p ratio 0 7 0 1 ci 95 which agreed with the correlations between these two biomarkers obtained in section 3 2 the m p ratio was close to the ratio observed in other studies gracia lor et al 2017b kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a besides similar temporal variations of caf and pxt in influent samples taken over consecutive days were also found out in other studies hillebrand et al 2012 the m p ratio was lower than that in pharmacokinetic studies 2 5 it was likely that a portion of caffeine detected in sewage stemmed from the direct disposal of the products containing caffeine such as tea and other soft drinks moreover the degradation of the two compounds and the difference in the instability between the rising main and gravity sewers gao et al 2019 may also lead to such observations nonetheless as one of the main metabolites of caffeine paraxanthine s stability under 4 c and 20 c in samples make it still used for caffeine estimation driver et al 2020 gracia lor et al 2017a kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a 3 metoprolol mtp venlafaxine vfx and their metabolites as shown in fig 6 b and c the m p ratio of metoprolol mtp and its main metabolite metoprolol acid mtpa and venlafaxine vfx and its main metabolite o desmethyl venlafaxine o dvfx was also observed with relatively little diurnal fluctuations comparable m p ratios were also observed in this study mtpa mtp 8 6 0 9 ci 95 o dvfx vfx 4 7 0 6 ci 95 compared with others mtpa mtp 6 6 11 5 o dvfx vfx 2 0 5 9 boogaerts et al 2019 gurke et al 2015 rubirola et al 2014 however the m p ratios of these two compounds were lower than the ratios estimated by the pharmacokinetic studies as the previous study indicated that venlafaxine and atenolol a pharmaceutical that is of the same type of metoprolol having a similar structure were stable in the sewers gao et al 2019 lower m p ratio might be caused by degradations of the metabolites which need further investigations this could also be supported by the reduction in the proportion of o dvfx compared to vfx found downstream of a wwtp metcalfe et al 2010 therefore mtp and vfx were chosen for intake estimation in section 3 3 2 according to the framework more studies should be undertaken to obtain a revised correlation factor of mtpa and o dvfx combined with description data du et al 2020 gao et al 2021 4 levetiracetam lev and its metabolite levetiracetam lev and its metabolite levetiracetam acid leva were both 100 detected with concentrations ranging from hundreds to thousands of ng l 1 in this study in the u s it was reported that the use of lev increased from 5 1 to 32 from 1999 to 2009 liu et al 2017 for this reason we think it is worth assessing both lev and leva in wbe studies however until now we have not found any studies on the simultaneous detection of the two substances or their stability in the sewers in this study a small temporal variation of m p ratios was found 1 9 0 3 ci 95 which was higher than the value assessed in the pharmacokinetic study 0 4 more research is needed to explain the stability of the compounds in the sewer and discuss the m p ratio 5 fluoxetine flx and its metabolite comparable m p ratios of fluoxetine flx and its metabolite norfluoxetine nflx were observed between sewage 0 9 0 2 ci 95 and human excretion 0 5 3 3 the mean value of the m p ratio in sewage was slightly higher than the result of kasprzyk hordern s study 0 6 kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a additionally they found that using nflx for back calculation underestimated the intake compared with actual prescriptions one of the reasons might be the further transformation of nflx according to the m p ratio in our study another reason might be the direct disposition of flx which indicated poor adherence to the medicine 6 other compounds and their metabolites as for the other compounds the m p ratios showed relatively significant temporal variations and in sewage ratios were not consistent with pharmacokinetic ratios this could be caused by generation from other sources or transformation of the compound in the sewer system in addition they had low levels of detection or a lack of relevant data the results are illustrated and discussed in si 2 fig s6 and table s2 3 3 2 intake estimation combining the in sewer stability and transformation of compounds discussed in section 3 3 1 10 compounds were further analyzed with correction factors cf to quantify the actual compound intake of the population in the study catchment the results of cf and intake estimations are listed in table 1 1 tobacco consumption and caffeine intake cotinine cot a metabolite of nicotine nic was used for consumption estimation since previous studies already confirmed its stability in the sewers gao et al 2019 nic intake calculated in this study ranged from 0 30 mg day 1 person 1 to 5 4 mg day 1 person 1 with a median value of 1 2 mg day 1 person 1 as shown in table 1 nic intake in this study was comparable with other studies in china gao et al 2020 and australia lai et al 2018 but two times lower than in italy castiglioni et al 2015 and the u s chen et al 2019 tobacco consumption could be estimated considering that nic content is circa 0 9 mg per cigarette in the chinese market and 88 of people aged over 15 are smokers in the study area hence tobacco consumption in the study area was calculated being approximately 1 5 cigarettes person aged 15 day cpd which is at a lower level in china gao et al 2020 the highest tobacco consumption nicotine intake 5 5 cpd 5 4 mg day 1 person 1 occurred during the third sampling event and the date 20 190 503 was both a weekend and a may day holiday see fig s7 in the case of caf paraxanthine pxt was chosen as a biomarker for intake calculation the intake value ranged from 16 mg day 1 person 1 to 121 mg day 1 person 1 which is in the range of 0 8 424 mg day 1 person 1 reported in another study conducted in china in 2014 gao et al 2016 caffeine intake estimated in this study is lower than that in australia europe and the united states table 1 as the largest contributors of caf intake are drink and food the difference is ascribable to different dietary habits between china and the west 2 prevalence rate of substance use and the role of public healthcare data as for the other five pharmaceuticals the prevalence rate of substance use was calculated in combination with the defined daily dose ddd via eq 6 ddd values and results of substance prevalence are listed in table 1 as for antiepileptic cbz the cf value obtained by back calculation was 7 69 which is in the range of the recommended value of 7 66 10 03 calculated on the basis of dispensed prescription data in a recent wbe study gao et al 2021 the estimated prevalence rate of cbz use is with a median value of 0 051 and 0 054 respectively using the parent compound cbz and metabolite diohcbz the approximate prevalence rate of cbz use suggested that diohcbz was suitable for back calculation of cbz intake and prevalence rate for future studies wbe results can be triangulated with the public healthcare data and in turn public healthcare data on drug utilization can provide evidence for biomarker selection as can be seen from the golden parallelogram in fig 6 studies on utilization of antiepileptic drugs in beijing hospitals found that lev the other antiepileptic detected in this study was one of the top three among the antiepileptics sheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a with a utilization proportion that was about 3 4 times that of cbz zhang et al 2019a although the prevalence rate results of lev applying the two biomarkers were different with median values of 0 19 for lev and 0 77 for leva and all these results were higher than the value of cbz 0 054 which validated the result in public healthcare data qualitatively in addition three to four times relative utilization ratio between lev and cbz from public healthcare data indicated that parent compound biomarker lev might be more reasonable as a marker for back calculation of consumption as prevalence rate using lev 0 19 was in the range of 3 4 times the prevalence of cbz 0 162 0 216 similar prevalence of the two antidepressants vfx and flx use were calculated with the median value of 0 0011 however it was recently reported that vfx is one of the top three antidepressants in beijing guo et al 2020 this work also showed that flx is utilized more frequently by adolescent patients 2 9 than middle aged and elderly patients 1 9 while vfx is almost equal 11 in both groups guo et al 2020 therefore the equal prevalence of vfx and flx use suggested that there might be a relatively large number of young patients with depression in the study area 4 conclusion one hundred and forty nine out of 168 pharmaceuticals and metabolites were detected in the influent of a wwtp of beijing 94 analytes could be quantified in all the three sampling events wbe was applied to investigate the patterns of drug use and daily consumption in holidays and commutes we proposed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of metabolic biomarkers for intake estimation and applied it in this study according to the results not all the metabolites were suitable to be employed as biomarkers for intake back calculation when in sewer stability of them is not well ascertained in addition public healthcare data validated the numeric results about the prevalence of substance use in our wbe study for example within this framework we identified the parent compound levetiracetam a popular anti epileptic pharmaceutical as an appropriate biomarker to be used in wbe referring to public healthcare data nonetheless further studies should be taken on the occurrence and the in sewer stability of levetiracetam and its metabolites declaration of competing

16102,urban rivers receive used water derived from anthropogenic activities and are a crucial source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o however considerable uncertainties still exist regarding the variation and mechanisms of n2o production in response to the discharge of treated sewage from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps this study investigated n2o concentrations and microbial processes responsible for nitrogen conversion upstream and downstream of wwtps along the tama river flowing through tokyo japan we evaluated the effect of treated sewage on dissolved n2o concentrations and inherent n2o consumption activities in the river sediments in summer and winter the mean dissolved n2o concentrations were 0 67 µg n l 1 and 0 82 µg n l 1 respectively although the dissolved n2o was supersaturated mean 288 7 in summer mean 240 7 in winter in the river the n2o emission factors ef5r 0 013 0 025 were significantly lower than those in other urban rivers and the intergovernmental panel on climate change default value 0 25 the nitrate no3 concentration in the tama river increased downstream of the wwtps discharge sites and it was the main nitrogen constituent an increasing trend of no3 concentration was observed from upstream to downstream along with an increase in the n2o consumption potential of the river sediment a multiple regression model showed that no3 is the crucial factor influencing n2o saturation the diversity in the upstream microbial communities was greater than that in the downstream ones indicating the involvement of treated sewage discharge in shaping the microbial communities functional gene quantification for n2o production and consumption suggested that nirk type denitrifiers likely contributed to n2o production structural equation models sems revealed that treated sewage discharged from wwtps increased the no3 loading from upstream to downstream in the river inducing changes in the microbial communities and enhancing the n2o consumption activities collectively aerobic conditions limited denitrification and in turn facilitated nitrification leading to low n2o emissions even despite high no3 loadings in the tama river our findings unravel an overestimation of the n2o emission potential in an urban oxygen rich river affected by treated sewage discharge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide nitrogen treated wastewater function genes the tama river functional genes microbial community 1 introduction nitrogen is essential for all living organisms and limits primary production in rivers and other aquatic ecosystems over the past several decades the growing demand for food and energy has increased wastewater discharge fertilizer overuse and atmospheric deposition resulting in nitrogen pollution cui et al 2013 vitousek et al 1997 such nitrogen overloading causes a series of environmental issues such as eutrophication and nitrous oxide n2o emissions in aquatic ecosystems zhou et al 2019 given that n2o is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming the production and emission of n2o from natural environments is cause for concern kortelainen et al 2020 rivers are important zones for global nitrogen turnover and n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 rosamond et al 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 the amount of n2o emitted globally from river systems is estimated to be 0 68 0 90 tg yr 1 equivalent to 10 17 of the global agricultural n2o emission rate beaulieu et al 2011 rosamond et al 2012 high n2o emissions are potentially facilitated by higher nitrogen concentrations rosamond et al 2012 wang et al 2015 which also cause uncertainties in predicting n2o emissions qin et al 2019 yu et al 2013 therefore estimating n2o emissions from rivers and understanding the underlying mechanisms is essential to explore effective measures for deterring global climate change to clarify the n2o emission patterns the ecophysiologies of microorganisms responsible for the n2o production and consumption need to be addressed n2o is produced via nitrification and denitrification in river systems beaulieu et al 2011 denitrification is composed of a series of consecutive enzymatic reactions from nitrate no3 to n2 via nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and n2o as intermediates hence complete denitrifying bacteria fully responsible for the consecutive reactions could serve as the n2o source and sink kortelainen et al 2020 this balance is regulated by microbial communities consisting of n2o producers and consumers zhao et al 2018 exploiting n2o consuming bacteria has gathered attention for mitigating n2o emissions duan et al 2021 shan et al 2021 and their activities are influenced by environmental conditions e g temperature oxygen and nitrogen loading chun et al 2020 rosamond et al 2012 wang et al 2015 primarily nitrogen loading stimulates n2o emissions and the nitrogen removal capacity in rivers weisener et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 phylogeny based on the n2o reductase amino acid sequences can be used to classify n2o consuming bacteria into either clade i nosz or clade ii nosz types jones et al 2013 sanford et al 2012 however the ecophysiologies of clade i nosz and clade ii nosz n2o consuming bacteria under various environmental conditions in rivers remain poorly understood urban rivers have been identified as the largest inland water source of n2o yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2021b they receive substantial amounts of treated and occasionally untreated sewage from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and nitrogen loadings are much higher than those in natural rivers lofton et al 2007 martinez santos et al 2018 the disturbance to urban rivers by these nitrogen loads may lead to the uncertainties in n2o emission fluxes making estimating the n2o fluxes more difficult several studies have advocated that the current intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc approaches substantially underestimate n2o emissions from anthropogenically impacted river systems beaulieu et al 2011 hu et al 2016 significant variation in nitrogen loading from wwtp discharge and urban runoff may greatly alter the riverine microbial processes associated with nitrogen conversion lofton et al 2007 treated water discharge from wwtps affected the balance of nitrogen transformation and eventually enhanced n2o emissions from downstream waterways chun et al 2020 despite the significance of n2o emission little is known about the relative contribution of wwtp effluent to microbial activities associated with the n2o production and consumption in urban rivers in addition the n2o consumption capability in river systems has rarely been explored the tama river is a typical urban river that receives massive amounts of treated sewage discharged from municipal wwtps in tokyo japan according to the bureau of sewerage tokyo metropolitan government 2012 up to 50 of the river water originates from treated water discharged from the wwtps along the river given higher concentrations of nitrogen compounds mostly no3 in the treated sewage than those in the river we raised a research question if the treated sewage affects microbial community compositions and n2o production consumption activities resulting in higher or lower n2o emission this study therefore examined the seasonal and spatial variation of n2o production and its associated key microbial processes in the urban river receiving treated sewage the aims of this study are 1 to understand the effect of environmental factors on n2o production in the midstream of the tama river 2 to explain the link between the potential n2o consumption rate of the river sediment and the apparent n2o production and 3 to understand the sediment microbial community compositions associated with n2o production and consumption to this end a sampling campaign was performed in the midstream region of the tama river and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and functional gene quantification for ammonia oxidation and denitrification were conducted the intrinsic n2o consumption potentials of sediments from upstream to downstream of the river were compared the results of this study will guide the management of treated sewage and further support the assessment of regional n2o budgets in an urban river system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and field sample collection the tama river with a total length of 138 km and a drainage area of 1240 km2 is a major urban river flowing through the tokyo metropolitan into the tokyo bay japan furuichi et al 2004 ten municipal wwtps are distributed in the tama river basin the amount of industrial effluent directly discharged into the river is relatively small field sampling campaigns were performed in winter 2018 and summer 2019 eight sampling sites distributed into the upstream and downstream of wwtps in the urbanized area of the tama river were selected as shown in fig 1 there are seven wwtps in the tama river basin around the upstream and downstream sampling sites these wwtps use different activated sludge process configurations to treat organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus table s1 the

the mean ph of the riverine water was in the neutral range 6 6 0 2 in summer 6 7 0 3 in winter the do concentrations in the river water ranged from 6 1 to 7 9 mg l 1 with a mean of 7 3 0 6 mg l 1 in summer and from 6 4 to 7 5 mg l 1 with a mean of 7 1 0 5 mg l 1 in winter ph and do concentrations displayed marginal differences among these examined sites in contrast the n contents tn nh4 no3 and no2 exhibited substantial differences between the upstream and downstream sites of the wwtp figs 2 and s1 tn concentrations increased toward the downstream p 0 05 ranging from 2 1 to 7 8 mg n l 1 in summer and from 4 0 to 7 2 mg n l 1 in winter fig 2a and table s3 in conjunction with the increased tn concentrations no3 and no2 concentrations increased from upstream to downstream fig 2b and d p 0

from w7 4 4 mg n l 1 table s1 and fig s1 further increase in no3 concentration was observed from g to h plausibly due to the oxidation of nh4 from the w7 discharge table s1 and fig s1 the mean nh4 concentrations in the upstream and downstream groups were 0 31 0 17 mg n l 1 and 0 56 0 07 mg n l 1 in summer and 0 35 0 09 mg n l 1 and 0 57 0 03 mg n l 1 in winter respectively nh4 concentrations in the upstream and downstream river were significantly different only in winter p 0 05 the other nitrogen contents except for nh4 in summer and winter were not significantly different in the upstream

summer and from 0 50 to 1 25 µg n l 1 mean 0 82 0 23 µg n l 1 in winter table s3 the dissolved n2o concentrations in winter were significantly higher than those in summer paired sample t test p 0 01 in addition the dissolved n2o concentration varied spatially with an obvious increasing tendency from upstream to downstream table s3 a significantly positive linear correlation was obtained between the dissolved n2o concentration and no3 r2 0 96 p 0 01 in summer r2 0 77 p 0 01 in winter fig 3 a the dissolved n2o concentration also displayed positive correlations with tn nh4 no2 and doc table s4 the dissolved n2o concentrations were above the saturated levels s1 and s2 in supplementary material at all the examined sites table s3 and the n2o saturation ranged from 189 1 to 503 7 with a mean of

was greater in summer than in winter displaying that the sites were more intensive spots for n2o emissions in summer than in winter table s3 the variation of n2o saturation in the water flow direction was analogous to that of the dissolved n2o concentration table s3 furthermore the n2o saturation was positively correlated with tn nh4 no2 and doc p 0 01 table s4 the ef5r i e the ratio of dissolved n2o over no3 ranged from 0 013 to 0 025 with an average of 0 015 0 004 in summer and from 0 015 to 0 020 with an average of 0 018 0 003 in winter table s3 multiple stepwise regression models incorporating environmental factors were established to represent n2o saturation table 1 the results showed that no3 temperature and c n ratio were able to jointly predict n2o saturation r2 0 86 p 0

and winter were evaluated with a microcosm experiment table s3 the intrinsic n2o consumption rates ranged from 16 7 to 60 6 mg n kg 1 dw d 1 in summer and from 15 2 to 47 0 mg n kg 1 dw d 1 in winter the rates in summer were higher than those in winter paired sample t test p 0 109 these rates exhibited an increasing trend from upstream to downstream and were positively and linearly correlated with

at the phylum and otu levels in summer and winter fig 4 a overall the top 15 phyla covered more than approximately 95 of microbial communities in river sediments the following five phyla accounted for over 60 of the total population in both summer and winter proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and planctomycetes the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria with a relative abundance of 31 3 69 7 in summer and 26 7 71 9 in winter a significant difference in the abundance of proteobacteria was observed between the upstream 46 4 71 9 in summer and 41 6 69 7 in winter and downstream 26 8 29 4 in summer and 31 3 38 3 in winter p 0 01 in contrast the relative abundances of acidobacteria and actinobacteria in the downstream river were higher than those in the upstream river in both winter and summer p 0 01 regarding the dissimilarities in microbial communities the pca showed that the first two axes covered 92 of the total microbial community at the phylum level fig 4b the trajectories of the microbial community transition in the upstream river were much broader on the pca plots than those in the downstream river the microbial communities at each sampling site were comparable between summer and winter the genus level analysis as shown in fig s2 identified different predominant genera in the upstream and downstream samples uncultured cyanobacteria were dominant in the upstream samples especially at site b in summer 27 8 and winter 20 2 in addition the relative abundance of acinetobacter was irregularly higher at site e in summer 28 9 and winter 24 6 the downstream samples had much more diverse microbial communities and acidobacteria was the most dominant genera 7 3 in summer at site f and 7 7 in winter at site h among nitrifying microorganisms nitrospira was the most abundant 0 35 4 24 followed by the ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa i e candidatus nitrososphaera 0 005 0 79 and nitrosopumilus 0 003 0 76 fig 4c meanwhile the β proteobacterial

species in the upstream and downstream river table s5 the upstream samples possessed the α proteobacteria bradyrhizobiaceae and hyphomicrobium gemmatimonas optutus and nitrospira the downstream samples possessed nitrospira and ca nitrososphaera followed by the α proteobacteria bradyrhizobiaceae these bacteria and archaea were present in both summer and winter 3 4 abundances of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in the tama river the relative abundances of functional genes associated with ammonia oxidation bacterial amoa archaeal amoa and comammox amob nitrite reduction cytochrome and copper nitrite reductase encoding genes nirs and nirk and n2o reduction clade i nosz and clade ii nosz were analyzed fig 5 the relative abundances of the ammonia oxidation genes comammox amob and bacterial amoa over the 16s rrna gene abundances indicated insignificant differences between the upstream and downstream sites p 0 05 in contrast the relative archaeal amoa gene abundance was higher in the downstream than in the upstream sites irrespective of the season p 0 05 the comammox amob gene abundances 0 33 103 to 5 31 103 copies ng dna 1 were one to two orders of magnitude higher than the bacterial amoa gene abundances 0 80 101 to 8 07 101 copies ng dna 1 at all the sites fig s3b archaeal amoa gene copy numbers were comparable with those of comammox amob in the downstream river but one order of magnitude lower than those of comammox amob in the upstream river the gene abundances for ammonia oxidizers i e the bacterial and archaeal amoa and comammox amob were one to two orders of magnitude lower than nirk type denitrifiers 3 26 104 to 1 49 105 copies ng dna 1 the nirk type denitrifiers were more abundant than nirs type denitrifiers in both seasons figs 5 and s3c the relative gene abundances of nirk over 16s rrna in the upstream river 0 11 and 0 16 were lower than those in the downstream river 0 28 and 0 29 in summer and winter respectively p 0 05 the relative gene abundance of clade ii nosz over 16s rrna was higher in the downstream than in the upstream sites p 0 05 the clade ii nosz gene copy numbers 1 01 104 to 6 11 104 copies ng dna 1 were more abundant than the clade i nosz gene copy numbers 0 20 104 to 2 88 104 copies ng dna 1 paired sample t test p 0 05 the sum of nirk and nirs gene copies was higher than that of the clade i nosz and clade ii nosz gene copies in the sampling sites fig s4 c and d the relationship between individual environmental factors and relative functional gene abundances over 16s rrna genes in the tama river is shown in fig 6 the relative gene abundances of the archaeal amoa nirk and clade ii nosz were positively correlated with tn no3 no2 and nh4 while these correlations were not found between the bacterial amoa comammox amob nirs and clade i nosz genes fig 6a sems were constructed to reveal the effect of the wwtp distribution likely facilitating the changes in the nitrogen constituent concentrations and microbial community compositions on the dissolved n2o concentrations in the tama river fig 6b the model elucidated the remarkable impacts in the upstream region fig 1 of the river a combination of the factors no3 nirk clade ii nosz and potential n2o consumption rate explained the 77 variance in dissolved n2o concentrations in the tama river sem showed that the changes in no3 concentrations associated with the wwtp distribution strongly affected the abundances of nirk and clade ii nosz genes and the potential n2o consumption rates statistical analysis data were consistent with the intrinsic n2o consumption activities of the sediment biomass in the tama river 4 discussion 4 1 potential overestimation of n2o emissions from the tama river rivers have been intensively investigated as potential n2o emission sources qin et al 2019 rosamond et al 2012 the variations of nitrogen loading into a river cause uncertainties in predicting n2o emissions wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b which means further research on n2o in river systems is required the uncertainty is noticeable in urban rivers receiving treated sewage this study therefore examined the effect of nitrogen loading on n2o emissions in the middle and downstream regions of the tama river as a representative of urban rivers the sampling campaign and laboratory analysis determined that the peak n2o concentration 1 25 µg n l 1 in the river was far below the levels previously reported in urban rivers but was comparable with agricultural river systems table 2 this result contradicts previous studies observing the substantially higher n2o emissions in urban rivers receiving higher nitrogen loadings chun et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 further the ef5r in the tama river 0 015 0 004 in summer 0 018 0 003 in winter was lower than the ef5r in other urban river systems with comparable nitrogen loadings table 2 and was one order of magnitude lower than the ipcc default value 0 25 the considerably low ef5r suggests a possible overestimation of n2o emissions from the tama river when the ipcc default value is applied de klein et al 2006 given that the ef5r n2o n no3 n estimation is based on denitrification activities de klein et al 2006 the low ef5r in the tama river could be caused by the limited denitrification rates the increasing trend of no3 concentrations from the upstream to downstream sites in the river was attributed to the limited denitrification activities figs 2 and s1 likely resulting in fewer opportunities to produce n2o via heterotrophic denitrification the seasonal effects on the n2o concentrations and microbial community compositions were insignificant fig 3 and 4 which may be explained by the stable discharge water qualities from the wwtps regardless of the season reportedly n2o emissions derived from the net n2o production and consumption activities are sensitive to temperature kortelainen et al 2020 zhou et al 2021a 2021b which is inconsistent with our results that the slightly higher n2o emission potential possessed in winter fig 3a and table s3 and the marginal difference in n2o consumption rates were attained as a function of no3 concentration fig 3b such inconsistent results highlighted that the amount composition and concentration of the discharged treated sewage likely regulated n2o production and consumption table 2 our results suggest that the degree of nitrogen removal by municipal wwtp likely determines n2o emissions in the downstream river and importantly the environments in the tama river suit zones for lower n2o emissions 4 2 denitrification dominated n2o production in the tama river a combination of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and qpcr for functional gene quantification showed that heterotrophic denitrifiers dominated the population with higher abundances than nitrifying microorganisms figs 5 and s2 as observed by the orders of magnitude differences in the gene abundances this underscores that heterotrophic denitrification mainly contributes to n2o production and consumption in the tama river the high copy numbers for denitrification genes e g nirs and nirk were likely caused by the high doc no3 ratio at the sampling sites because the ratios were 1 in this study fig s1 doc was not deemed limited to denitrification at the sites the result contrasts a previous study implicating that denitrification is limited at mean doc no3 ratios of 1 cooper et al 2017 the high concentrations of no3 as an electron acceptor in this study likely facilitated denitrification when anoxic conditions are present fig s1b indicating that the intrinsic n2o consumption rates were linearly correlated with no3 concentrations in the river fig 3b in conjunction with the higher abundances of denitrifying genes figs 2b 5 and 6a the downstream region received higher no3 input than the upstream region in addition no3 and n2o concentrations had a significant positive correlation fig 3a which supported denitrification serving as a significant driver of n2o production and consumption as previously reported beaulieu et al 2011 this assumption also agrees with a previous report clarifying n2o production via denitrification in the tama river as determined by n2o isotopic measurements thuan et al 2017 together with the intrinsic n2o consumption activities of the river sediments in this study the n2o emissions from the tama river could be derived from the net activities of n2o production and consumption by the indigenous denitrifying bacteria this study also demonstrated that sediments in the mid and downstream regions of the tama river harbored higher abundances of aoa ca nitrososphaera and comammox nitorospira than β proteobacterial ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob archaeal amoa and comammox amob genes were one order of magnitude higher than the β proteobacterial amoa gene fig s3 implying that aoa and comammox nitrospira mainly performed ammonia oxidation reportedly aoa and comammox nitrospira preferentially thrive in nh4 limited environments because they have a higher affinity for nh4 half saturation coefficient 0 02 mg n l 1 kits et al 2017 martens habbena et al 2009 than the β proteobacterial aob given that nh4 concentrations in our study were lower than 0 5 mg n l 1 it is reasonable that aoa and comammox nitrospira outcompeted the β proteobacterial aob the predominance of aoa with high nh4 affinity and comammox nitrospira may be ideal for mitigating n2o emissions from urban river systems aoa and comammox nitrospira do not produce n2o via hydroxylamine oxidation but produce n2o via an abiotic pathway kits et al 2019 stieglmeier et al 2014 in addition a recent study reported that the contribution of ammonia oxidation to n2o production is limited when no3 is a major nitrogen constituent masuda et al 2021 together the findings from this study imply that heterotrophic denitrification but not ammonia oxidation is the primary source of n2o production in the tama river 4 3 limited denitrification curbing n2o production in the tama river denitrification is crucial for n2o production this study demonstrated a high proportion of no3 in the tama river fig s1 underlining the presence of abundant electron acceptors for denitrification however denitrification did not intensively occur because of the high oxygen concentrations table s3 increasing no3 concentrations from upstream to downstream figs 2 and s1 two possible potential mechanisms lie behind the high no3 concentrations in the downstream river 1 downstream received no3 from upstream because of marginal nitrogen conversion 2 exogenous no3 downstream from the municipal wwtps was transported into the river the municipal wwtps were densely distributed in the upstream region and contributed to increased no3 concentration and the shaping of microbial communities in the upstream and downstream river fig 4 one remarkable result was the higher abundances of acidobacteria and actinobacteria in the downstream river fig 4a these phyla reportedly play roles in degrading litters zhang et al 2021a cellulose and chitin in riverine environments ouyang et al 2020 terrestrial organic matter such as plant residues are transported into river systems through runoff and gradually accumulate zhou et al 2019 given that the upstream region was mainly affected by the treated sewage discharge fig 1 organic matter associated with plant residues did not function as electron donors for acidobactria and actinobacteria in the upstream river potentially leading to the higher abundances of these bacteria in the downstream region fig 4a the functions and activities of these bacteria at these zones e g the contributions to organic matter nitrogen and triethylamine degradation garcia et al 2014 warrant future thorough investigations together these findings supported limited denitrification activity in the tama river resulting in no3 accumulation in the downstream region the do concentration in river alters the composition of the denitrifying community and regulates denitrification activity huang et al 2011 knapp et al 2009 rosamond et al 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 qpcr revealed a higher abundance of nirk denitrifying bacteria than nirs denitrifying bacteria fig 5 given that nirk denitrifiers have a higher resistance against oxygen than nirs denitrifiers huang et al 2011 knapp et al 2009 denitrifying bacteria in the tama river may have high oxygen resistances allowing them to survive at high do concentrations table s3 the abundance of nirk and nirs genes was higher than the abundance of clade i and clade ii nosz genes figs s3 and s4 implying that this river is a net n2o source oxygen rich conditions are reported to limit denitrification functioning as another n2o source qin et al 2019 rosamond et al 2012 do concentrations of 2 mg l 1 in overlying water allow denitrification to occur and stimulate n2o emission galloway et al 2003 2004 zhou et al 2019 there is generally a negative correlation between do concentrations and denitrification activities in river systems qin et al 2019 rosamond et al 2012 the lowest do concentration in the tama river was 6 1 mg l 1 table s3 therefore denitrification especially nitrate reduction to nitrite was likely restricted at the surface and shallow water depths resulting in decreased n2o production via denitrification zhou et al 2019 indeed a substantial increase in n2o emissions was reported in overlying hypoxic water with high nitrogen loadings rosamond et al 2012 wang et al 2015 hence temporal and spatial hypoxia anoxia may boost n2o emissions in the tama river the otu level analysis identified the α proteobacterial bradyrhizorium and hyphomicrobium as the predominant species in all sampling sites the functional analysis by the kegg pathway database https www kegg jp kegg pathway html kanehisa and goto 2000 observes that most species of bradyrhizorium and hyphomicrobium are complete denitrifying bacteria responsible for n2o production and consumption in anoxic environments despite abundant no3 in the tama river this type of anaerobic respiration cannot be activated under oxygen rich conditions as summarized in table 1 denitrification including n2o production and consumption requires the presence of no3 and anoxic conditions the latter of which becomes a stronger driver than the former in river systems rosamond et al 2012 collectively n2o production and the resultant n2o emissions in oxic water bodies receiving no3 warrants further study because the redox condition may overestimate n2o emissions 4 4 implication for n2o emissions in urban rivers this study shows that n2o production in the tama river was related to the discharge of treated sewage from municipal wwtps nitrogen constituents in urban rivers are substantially affected by the massive amount of treated water from municipal wwtps lofton et al 2007 yu et al 2013 the high volume of treated water compared to natural river water likely affects the microbial community compositions and activities related to n2o production and consumption determining the net n2o emissions nevertheless the influence of treated wastewater discharged from wwtps on n2o production has not been quantitatively estimated the conceptual diagram constructed by sem explained that treated sewage from wwtps in the tama river determined 77 of the dissolved n2o concentration fig 6b in addition to the latest findings that treated sewage stimulated n2o emissions chun et al 2020 masuda et al 2021 this study demonstrated that increases in no3 caused by treated sewage discharge stimulated the potential n2o consumption activities in the natural river sediments fig 6 the combination of sem and n2o consumption potentials reveals a possible contribution of n2o consuming bacteria to decrease n2o emissions from urban oxygen rich rivers nonetheless the current sem does not incorporate the effect of do and may result in an incorrect n2o emission estimate qin et al 2019 rosamond et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the refinement of the model requires a better understanding of n2o production mechanisms to accurately estimate n2o emissions in urban rivers receiving a large amount of treated sewage 5 conclusion the present study revealed that treated wastewater discharge from municipal wwtps affected n2o production in the tama river the field investigation revealed that downstream dissolved n2o concentrations were significantly higher than upstream we show that the n2o production and consumption potentials are mediated by no3 concentrations in the tama river the combination of the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and qpcr revealed that treated sewage altered the composition of microbial communities and the abundance of functional genes involved in nitrogen cycles revealing that denitrifying bacteria are predominant guild in river sediments the trend was corroborated by the application of sem confirming the significance of the treated sewage discharge on n2o emissions the assessment of ef5r in the tama river showed a much lower n2o emission factor than other urban river systems likely caused by oxygenated conditions and resulting decrease in denitrifying activities our result underscores that n2o emission is potentially overestimated in urban oxygen rich river systems receiving treated sewage and an aerobic environment in the tama river resulted in the lower n2o emission despite receiving high nitrogen loadings collectively more intensive

16102,urban rivers receive used water derived from anthropogenic activities and are a crucial source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o however considerable uncertainties still exist regarding the variation and mechanisms of n2o production in response to the discharge of treated sewage from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps this study investigated n2o concentrations and microbial processes responsible for nitrogen conversion upstream and downstream of wwtps along the tama river flowing through tokyo japan we evaluated the effect of treated sewage on dissolved n2o concentrations and inherent n2o consumption activities in the river sediments in summer and winter the mean dissolved n2o concentrations were 0 67 µg n l 1 and 0 82 µg n l 1 respectively although the dissolved n2o was supersaturated mean 288 7 in summer mean 240 7 in winter in the river the n2o emission factors ef5r 0 013 0 025 were significantly lower than those in other urban rivers and the intergovernmental panel on climate change default value 0 25 the nitrate no3 concentration in the tama river increased downstream of the wwtps discharge sites and it was the main nitrogen constituent an increasing trend of no3 concentration was observed from upstream to downstream along with an increase in the n2o consumption potential of the river sediment a multiple regression model showed that no3 is the crucial factor influencing n2o saturation the diversity in the upstream microbial communities was greater than that in the downstream ones indicating the involvement of treated sewage discharge in shaping the microbial communities functional gene quantification for n2o production and consumption suggested that nirk type denitrifiers likely contributed to n2o production structural equation models sems revealed that treated sewage discharged from wwtps increased the no3 loading from upstream to downstream in the river inducing changes in the microbial communities and enhancing the n2o consumption activities collectively aerobic conditions limited denitrification and in turn facilitated nitrification leading to low n2o emissions even despite high no3 loadings in the tama river our findings unravel an overestimation of the n2o emission potential in an urban oxygen rich river affected by treated sewage discharge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide nitrogen treated wastewater function genes the tama river functional genes microbial community 1 introduction nitrogen is essential for all living organisms and limits primary production in rivers and other aquatic ecosystems over the past several decades the growing demand for food and energy has increased wastewater discharge fertilizer overuse and atmospheric deposition resulting in nitrogen pollution cui et al 2013 vitousek et al 1997 such nitrogen overloading causes a series of environmental issues such as eutrophication and nitrous oxide n2o emissions in aquatic ecosystems zhou et al 2019 given that n2o is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming the production and emission of n2o from natural environments is cause for concern kortelainen et al 2020 rivers are important zones for global nitrogen turnover and n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 rosamond et al 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 the amount of n2o emitted globally from river systems is estimated to be 0 68 0 90 tg yr 1 equivalent to 10 17 of the global agricultural n2o emission rate beaulieu et al 2011 rosamond et al 2012 high n2o emissions are potentially facilitated by higher nitrogen concentrations rosamond et al 2012 wang et al 2015 which also cause uncertainties in predicting n2o emissions qin et al 2019 yu et al 2013 therefore estimating n2o emissions from rivers and understanding the underlying mechanisms is essential to explore effective measures for deterring global climate change to clarify the n2o emission patterns the ecophysiologies of microorganisms responsible for the n2o production and consumption need to be addressed n2o is produced via nitrification and denitrification in river systems beaulieu et al 2011 denitrification is composed of a series of consecutive enzymatic reactions from nitrate no3 to n2 via nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and n2o as intermediates hence complete denitrifying bacteria fully responsible for the consecutive reactions could serve as the n2o source and sink kortelainen et al 2020 this balance is regulated by microbial communities consisting of n2o producers and consumers zhao et al 2018 exploiting n2o consuming bacteria has gathered attention for mitigating n2o emissions duan et al 2021 shan et al 2021 and their activities are influenced by environmental conditions e g temperature oxygen and nitrogen loading chun et al 2020 rosamond et al 2012 wang et al 2015 primarily nitrogen loading stimulates n2o emissions and the nitrogen removal capacity in rivers weisener et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 phylogeny based on the n2o reductase amino acid sequences can be used to classify n2o consuming bacteria into either clade i nosz or clade ii nosz types jones et al 2013 sanford et al 2012 however the ecophysiologies of clade i nosz and clade ii nosz n2o consuming bacteria under various environmental conditions in rivers remain poorly understood urban rivers have been identified as the largest inland water source of n2o yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2021b they receive substantial amounts of treated and occasionally untreated sewage from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and nitrogen loadings are much higher than those in natural rivers lofton et al 2007 martinez santos et al 2018 the disturbance to urban rivers by these nitrogen loads may lead to the uncertainties in n2o emission fluxes making estimating the n2o fluxes more difficult several studies have advocated that the current intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc approaches substantially underestimate n2o emissions from anthropogenically impacted river systems beaulieu et al 2011 hu et al 2016 significant variation in nitrogen loading from wwtp discharge and urban runoff may greatly alter the riverine microbial processes associated with nitrogen conversion lofton et al 2007 treated water discharge from wwtps affected the balance of nitrogen transformation and eventually enhanced n2o emissions from downstream waterways chun et al 2020 despite the significance of n2o emission little is known about the relative contribution of wwtp effluent to microbial activities associated with the n2o production and consumption in urban rivers in addition the n2o consumption capability in river systems has rarely been explored the tama river is a typical urban river that receives massive amounts of treated sewage discharged from municipal wwtps in tokyo japan according to the bureau of sewerage tokyo metropolitan government 2012 up to 50 of the river water originates from treated water discharged from the wwtps along the river given higher concentrations of nitrogen compounds mostly no3 in the treated sewage than those in the river we raised a research question if the treated sewage affects microbial community compositions and n2o production consumption activities resulting in higher or lower n2o emission this study therefore examined the seasonal and spatial variation of n2o production and its associated key microbial processes in the urban river receiving treated sewage the aims of this study are 1 to understand the effect of environmental factors on n2o production in the midstream of the tama river 2 to explain the link between the potential n2o consumption rate of the river sediment and the apparent n2o production and 3 to understand the sediment microbial community compositions associated with n2o production and consumption to this end a sampling campaign was performed in the midstream region of the tama river and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and functional gene quantification for ammonia oxidation and denitrification were conducted the intrinsic n2o consumption potentials of sediments from upstream to downstream of the river were compared the results of this study will guide the management of treated sewage and further support the assessment of regional n2o budgets in an urban river system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and field sample collection the tama river with a total length of 138 km and a drainage area of 1240 km2 is a major urban river flowing through the tokyo metropolitan into the tokyo bay japan furuichi et al 2004 ten municipal wwtps are distributed in the tama river basin the amount of industrial effluent directly discharged into the river is relatively small field sampling campaigns were performed in winter 2018 and summer 2019 eight sampling sites distributed into the upstream and downstream of wwtps in the urbanized area of the tama river were selected as shown in fig 1 there are seven wwtps in the tama river basin around the upstream and downstream sampling sites these wwtps use different activated sludge process configurations to treat organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus table s1 the averaged parameters of these wwtp effluents are listed in table s1 overlying water 10 cm below the water level was collected in triplicate during each sampling campaign correspondingly dissolved

the longer distance between sites e and f than the other points the eight sampling sites were classified into upstream a e and downstream f h groups fig 1 the observed water temperature varied from 21

from w7 4 4 mg n l 1 table s1 and fig s1 further increase in no3 concentration was observed from g to h plausibly due to the oxidation of nh4 from the w7 discharge table s1 and fig s1 the mean nh4

was greater in summer than in winter displaying that the sites were more intensive spots for n2o emissions in summer than in winter table s3 the variation of n2o saturation in the water flow direction was analogous to that of the dissolved n2o concentration table s3 furthermore the n2o saturation was positively correlated with tn nh4 no2 and doc p 0 01 table s4 the ef5r i e the ratio of dissolved

incorporating environmental factors were established to represent n2o saturation table 1 the results showed that no3 temperature and c n ratio were able to jointly predict n2o saturation r2 0 86 p 0

the rates in summer were higher than those in winter paired sample t test p 0 109 these rates exhibited an increasing trend from upstream to downstream and were positively and linearly correlated with no3 concentration r2 0 76 p 0 01 for summer r2 0 89 p 0 01 for winter fig 3b 3 3 microbial community structure in the tama river the relative abundances of microbial community constituents are shown at the phylum and otu levels in summer and winter fig 4 a overall the top 15 phyla covered more than approximately 95 of microbial communities in river sediments the following five phyla accounted for over 60 of the total population in both summer and winter proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and planctomycetes the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria with a relative abundance of 31 3 69 7 in summer and 26 7 71 9 in winter a significant difference in the abundance of proteobacteria was observed between the upstream 46 4 71 9 in summer and 41 6 69 7 in winter and downstream 26 8 29 4 in summer and 31 3 38 3 in winter p 0 01 in contrast the relative abundances of acidobacteria and actinobacteria in the downstream river were higher than those in the upstream river in both winter and summer p 0 01 regarding the dissimilarities in microbial communities the pca showed that the first two axes covered 92 of the total microbial community at the phylum level fig 4b the trajectories of the microbial community transition in the upstream river were much broader on the pca plots than those in the downstream river the microbial communities at each sampling site were comparable between summer and winter the genus level analysis as shown in fig s2 identified different predominant genera in the upstream and downstream samples uncultured cyanobacteria were dominant in the upstream samples especially at site b in summer 27 8 and winter 20 2 in addition the relative abundance of acinetobacter was irregularly higher at site e in summer 28 9 and winter 24 6 the downstream samples had much more diverse microbial communities and acidobacteria was the most dominant genera 7 3 in summer at site f and 7 7 in winter at site h among nitrifying microorganisms nitrospira was the most abundant 0 35 4 24 followed by the ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa i e candidatus nitrososphaera 0 005 0 79 and nitrosopumilus 0 003 0 76 fig 4c meanwhile the β proteobacterial nitrosomonadaceae was rarely present relative abundances 0 08 in all the samples the sum of the relative abundances of nitrifying microorganisms were higher in the downstream samples f h average relative abundance in summer and winter of 5 13 1 04 and 4 79 0 15 respectively than in the upstream samples a e 0 76 0 64 in summer and 0 74 0 68 in winter the otu based analysis identified major species in the upstream and downstream river table s5 the upstream samples possessed the α proteobacteria bradyrhizobiaceae and hyphomicrobium gemmatimonas optutus and nitrospira the downstream samples possessed nitrospira and ca nitrososphaera followed by the α proteobacteria bradyrhizobiaceae these bacteria and archaea were present in both summer and winter 3 4 abundances of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in the tama river the relative abundances of functional genes associated with ammonia oxidation bacterial amoa archaeal amoa and comammox amob nitrite reduction cytochrome and copper nitrite reductase encoding genes nirs and nirk and n2o reduction clade i nosz and clade ii nosz were analyzed fig 5 the relative abundances of the ammonia oxidation genes comammox amob and bacterial amoa over the 16s rrna gene abundances indicated insignificant differences between the upstream and downstream sites p 0 05 in contrast the relative archaeal amoa gene abundance was higher in the downstream than in the upstream sites irrespective of the season p 0 05 the comammox amob gene abundances 0 33 103 to 5 31 103 copies ng dna 1 were one to two orders of magnitude higher than the bacterial amoa gene abundances 0 80 101 to 8 07 101 copies ng dna 1 at all the sites fig s3b archaeal amoa gene copy numbers were comparable with those of comammox amob in the downstream river but one order of magnitude lower than those of comammox amob in the upstream river the gene abundances for ammonia oxidizers i e the bacterial and archaeal amoa and comammox amob were one to two orders of magnitude lower than nirk type denitrifiers 3 26 104 to 1 49 105 copies ng dna 1 the nirk type denitrifiers were more abundant than nirs type denitrifiers in both seasons figs 5 and s3c the relative gene abundances of nirk over 16s rrna in the upstream river 0 11 and 0 16 were lower than those in the downstream river 0 28 and 0 29 in summer and winter respectively p 0 05 the relative gene abundance of clade ii nosz over 16s rrna was higher in the downstream than in the upstream sites p 0 05 the clade ii nosz gene copy numbers 1 01 104 to 6 11 104 copies ng dna 1 were more abundant than the clade i nosz gene copy numbers 0 20 104 to 2 88 104 copies ng dna 1 paired sample t test p 0 05 the sum of nirk and nirs gene copies was higher than that of the clade i nosz and clade ii nosz gene copies in the sampling sites fig s4 c and d the relationship between individual environmental factors and relative functional gene abundances over 16s rrna genes in the tama river is shown in fig 6 the relative gene abundances of the archaeal amoa nirk and clade ii nosz were positively correlated with tn no3 no2 and nh4 while these correlations were not found between the bacterial amoa comammox amob nirs and clade i nosz genes fig 6a sems were constructed to reveal the effect of the wwtp distribution likely facilitating the changes in the nitrogen constituent concentrations and microbial community compositions on the dissolved n2o concentrations in the tama river fig 6b the model elucidated the remarkable impacts in the upstream region fig 1 of the river a combination of the factors no3 nirk clade ii nosz and potential n2o consumption rate explained the 77 variance in dissolved n2o concentrations in the tama river sem showed that the changes in no3 concentrations associated with the wwtp distribution strongly affected the abundances of nirk and clade ii nosz genes and the potential n2o consumption rates statistical analysis data were consistent with the intrinsic n2o consumption activities of the sediment biomass in the tama river 4 discussion 4 1 potential overestimation of n2o emissions from the tama river rivers have been intensively investigated as potential n2o emission sources qin et al 2019 rosamond et al 2012 the variations of nitrogen loading into a river cause uncertainties in predicting n2o emissions wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b which means further research on n2o in river systems is required the uncertainty is noticeable in urban rivers receiving treated sewage this study therefore examined the effect of nitrogen loading on n2o emissions in the middle and downstream regions of the tama river as a representative of urban rivers the sampling campaign and laboratory analysis determined that the peak n2o concentration 1 25 µg n l 1 in the river was far below the levels previously reported in urban rivers but was comparable with agricultural river systems table 2 this result contradicts previous studies observing the substantially higher n2o emissions in urban rivers receiving higher nitrogen loadings chun et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 further the ef5r in the tama river 0 015 0 004 in summer 0 018 0 003 in winter was lower than the ef5r in other urban river systems with comparable nitrogen loadings table 2 and was one order of magnitude lower than the ipcc default value 0 25 the considerably low ef5r suggests a possible overestimation of n2o emissions from the tama river when the ipcc default value is applied de klein et al 2006 given that the ef5r n2o n no3 n estimation is based on denitrification activities de klein et al 2006 the low ef5r in the tama river could be caused by the limited denitrification rates the increasing trend of no3 concentrations from the upstream to downstream sites in the river was attributed to the limited denitrification activities figs 2 and s1 likely resulting in fewer opportunities to produce n2o via heterotrophic denitrification the seasonal effects on the n2o concentrations and microbial community compositions were insignificant fig 3 and 4 which may be explained by the stable discharge water qualities from the wwtps regardless of the season reportedly n2o emissions derived from the net n2o production and consumption activities are sensitive to temperature kortelainen et al 2020 zhou et al 2021a 2021b which is inconsistent with our results that the slightly higher n2o emission potential possessed in winter fig 3a and table s3 and the marginal difference in n2o consumption rates were attained as a function of no3 concentration fig 3b such inconsistent results highlighted that the amount composition and concentration of the discharged treated sewage likely regulated n2o production and consumption table 2 our results suggest that the degree of nitrogen removal by municipal wwtp likely determines n2o emissions in the downstream river and importantly the environments in the tama river suit zones for lower n2o emissions 4 2 denitrification dominated n2o production in the tama river a combination of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and qpcr for functional gene quantification showed that heterotrophic denitrifiers dominated the population with higher abundances than nitrifying microorganisms figs 5 and s2 as observed by the orders of magnitude differences in the gene abundances this underscores that heterotrophic denitrification mainly contributes to n2o production and consumption in the tama river the high copy numbers for denitrification genes e g nirs and nirk were likely caused by the high doc no3 ratio at the sampling sites because the ratios were 1 in this study fig s1 doc was not deemed limited to denitrification at the sites the result contrasts a previous study implicating that denitrification is limited at mean doc no3 ratios of 1 cooper et al 2017 the high concentrations of no3 as an electron acceptor in this study likely facilitated denitrification when anoxic conditions are present fig s1b indicating that the intrinsic n2o consumption rates were linearly correlated with no3 concentrations in the river fig 3b in conjunction with the higher abundances of denitrifying genes figs 2b 5 and 6a the downstream region received higher no3 input than the upstream region in addition no3 and n2o concentrations had a significant positive correlation fig 3a which supported denitrification serving as a significant driver of n2o production and consumption as previously reported beaulieu et al 2011 this assumption also agrees with a previous report clarifying n2o production via denitrification in the tama river as determined by n2o isotopic measurements thuan et al 2017 together with the intrinsic n2o consumption activities of the river sediments in this study the n2o emissions from the tama river could be derived from the net activities of n2o production and consumption by the indigenous denitrifying bacteria this study also demonstrated that sediments in the mid and downstream regions of the tama river harbored higher abundances of aoa ca nitrososphaera and comammox nitorospira than β proteobacterial ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob archaeal amoa and comammox amob genes were one order of magnitude higher than the β proteobacterial amoa gene fig s3 implying that aoa and comammox nitrospira mainly performed ammonia oxidation reportedly aoa and comammox nitrospira preferentially thrive in nh4 limited environments because they have a higher affinity for nh4 half saturation coefficient 0 02 mg n l 1 kits et al 2017 martens habbena et al 2009 than the β proteobacterial aob given that nh4 concentrations in our study were lower than 0 5 mg n l 1 it is reasonable that aoa and comammox nitrospira outcompeted the β proteobacterial aob the predominance of aoa with high nh4 affinity and comammox nitrospira may be ideal for mitigating n2o emissions from urban river systems aoa and comammox nitrospira do not produce n2o via hydroxylamine oxidation but produce n2o via an abiotic pathway kits et al 2019 stieglmeier et al 2014 in addition a recent study reported that the contribution of ammonia oxidation to n2o production is limited when no3 is a major nitrogen constituent masuda et al 2021 together the findings from this study imply that heterotrophic denitrification but not ammonia oxidation is the primary source of n2o production in the tama river 4 3 limited denitrification curbing n2o production in the tama river denitrification is crucial for n2o production this study demonstrated a high proportion of no3 in the tama river fig s1 underlining the presence of abundant electron acceptors for denitrification however denitrification did not intensively occur because of the high oxygen concentrations table s3 increasing no3 concentrations from upstream to downstream figs 2 and s1 two possible potential mechanisms lie behind the high no3 concentrations in the downstream river 1 downstream received no3 from upstream because of marginal nitrogen conversion 2 exogenous no3 downstream from the municipal wwtps was transported into the river the municipal wwtps were densely distributed in the upstream region and contributed to increased no3 concentration and the shaping of microbial communities in the upstream and downstream river fig 4 one remarkable result was the higher abundances of acidobacteria and actinobacteria in the downstream river fig 4a these phyla reportedly play roles in degrading litters zhang et al 2021a cellulose and chitin in riverine environments ouyang et al 2020 terrestrial organic matter such as plant residues are transported into river systems through runoff and gradually accumulate zhou et al 2019 given that the upstream region was mainly affected by the treated sewage discharge fig 1 organic matter associated with plant residues did not function as electron donors for acidobactria and actinobacteria in the upstream river potentially leading to the higher abundances of these bacteria in the downstream region fig 4a the functions and activities of these bacteria at these zones e g the contributions to organic matter nitrogen and triethylamine degradation garcia et al 2014 warrant future thorough investigations together these findings supported limited denitrification activity in the tama river resulting in no3 accumulation in the downstream region the do concentration in river alters the composition of the denitrifying community and regulates denitrification activity huang et al 2011 knapp et al 2009 rosamond et al 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 qpcr revealed a higher abundance of nirk denitrifying bacteria than nirs denitrifying bacteria fig 5 given that nirk denitrifiers have a higher resistance against oxygen than nirs denitrifiers huang et al 2011 knapp et al 2009 denitrifying bacteria in the tama river may have high oxygen resistances allowing them to survive at high do concentrations table s3 the abundance of nirk and nirs genes was higher than the abundance of clade i and clade ii nosz genes figs s3 and s4 implying that this river is a net n2o source oxygen rich conditions are reported to limit denitrification functioning as another n2o source qin et al 2019 rosamond et al 2012 do concentrations of 2 mg l 1 in overlying water allow denitrification to occur and stimulate n2o emission galloway et al 2003 2004 zhou et al 2019 there is generally a negative correlation between do concentrations and denitrification activities in river systems qin et al 2019 rosamond et al 2012 the lowest do concentration in the tama river was 6 1 mg l 1 table s3 therefore denitrification especially nitrate reduction to nitrite was likely restricted at the surface and shallow water depths resulting in decreased n2o production via denitrification zhou et al 2019 indeed a substantial increase in n2o emissions was reported in overlying hypoxic water with high nitrogen loadings rosamond et al 2012 wang et al 2015 hence temporal and spatial hypoxia anoxia may boost n2o emissions in the tama river the otu level analysis identified the α proteobacterial bradyrhizorium and hyphomicrobium as the predominant species in all sampling sites the functional analysis by the kegg pathway database https www kegg jp kegg pathway html kanehisa and goto 2000 observes that most species of bradyrhizorium and hyphomicrobium are complete denitrifying bacteria responsible for n2o production and consumption in anoxic environments despite abundant no3 in the tama river this type of anaerobic respiration cannot be activated under oxygen rich conditions as summarized in table 1 denitrification including n2o production and consumption requires the presence of no3 and anoxic conditions the latter of which becomes a stronger driver than the former in river systems rosamond et al 2012 collectively n2o production and the resultant n2o emissions in oxic water bodies receiving no3 warrants further study because the redox condition may overestimate n2o emissions 4 4 implication for n2o emissions in urban rivers this study shows that n2o production in the tama river was related to the discharge of treated sewage from municipal wwtps nitrogen constituents in urban rivers are substantially affected by the massive amount of treated water from municipal wwtps lofton et al 2007 yu et al 2013 the high volume of treated water compared to natural river water likely affects the microbial community compositions and activities related to n2o production and consumption determining the net n2o emissions nevertheless the influence of treated wastewater discharged from wwtps on n2o production has not been quantitatively estimated the conceptual diagram constructed by sem explained that treated sewage from wwtps in the tama river determined 77 of the dissolved n2o concentration fig 6b in addition to the latest findings that treated sewage stimulated n2o emissions chun et al 2020 masuda et al 2021 this study demonstrated that increases in no3 caused by treated sewage discharge stimulated the potential n2o consumption activities in the natural river sediments fig 6 the combination of sem and n2o consumption potentials reveals a possible contribution of n2o consuming bacteria to decrease n2o emissions from urban oxygen rich rivers nonetheless the current sem does not incorporate the effect of do and may result in an incorrect n2o emission estimate qin et al 2019 rosamond et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the refinement of the model requires a better understanding of n2o production mechanisms to accurately estimate n2o emissions in urban rivers receiving a large amount of treated sewage 5 conclusion the present study revealed that treated wastewater discharge from municipal wwtps affected n2o production in the tama river the field investigation revealed that downstream dissolved n2o concentrations were significantly higher than upstream we show that the n2o production and consumption potentials are mediated by no3 concentrations in the tama river the combination of the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and qpcr revealed that treated sewage altered the composition of microbial communities and the abundance of functional genes involved in nitrogen cycles revealing that denitrifying bacteria are predominant guild in river sediments the trend was corroborated by the application of sem confirming the significance of the treated sewage discharge on n2o emissions the assessment of ef5r in the tama river showed a much lower n2o emission factor than other urban river systems likely caused by oxygenated conditions and resulting decrease in denitrifying activities our result underscores that n2o emission is potentially overestimated in urban oxygen rich river systems receiving treated sewage and an aerobic environment in the tama river resulted in the lower n2o emission despite receiving high nitrogen loadings collectively more intensive investigations are needed to accurately assess the ef5r and regional n2o budgets in urban river systems declaration of competing interest all authors claim no actual or potential conflict of interest

16103,both the pore size and surface properties of silicon carbide sic membranes are demonstrated to significantly affect their separation efficiency when used for oily water treatment however the potential influences of open porosity together with the pore size of sic membranes on their surface properties and oil water separation performance have rarely been investigated in this work porous sic ceramic membranes with tunable open porosity and pore size were purposely prepared and selected to systematically study the effect of pore structure dependent wettability on the oil water separation performance the measured pure water flux of selected membranes as a function of open porosity 34 48 and pore size 0 43 0 67 μm was well fitted by using a modified h p equation interestingly the hydrophilicity of sic membranes was improved with the increase in open porosity and pore size as evidenced by the gradually decreased dynamic water contact angle and underwater adhesion of oil droplets further the open porosity of sic membranes was found to contribute more to the improved surface wettability as a result the stable flux of sic membranes in oil in water o w emulsions was increased by 24 with the increased open porosity while the oil rejection rate remained above 90 this work quantitatively reveals the contributions of the pore structure to the surface wettability of ceramic membranes and thus provides an effective pathway to improve their performance in oil water separation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silicon carbide ceramic membrane low

effect of chemistry and structural properties on the membrane surface would further promote the wettability and improve the oil water separation efficiency gu et al 2021b wang et al 2021 porous silicon carbide sic ceramic membrane is such a kind of materials that intrinsically exhibits excellent superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic features jiang et al 2020 moreover the sic

better sustainable permeability zsirai et al 2016 and anti fouling ability hofs et al 2011 under the same operation and maintenance conditions in oily wastewater treatment although ceramic materials including sic are well known for their excellent hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic features their wettability even for those of the same materials varies notably as indicated by various water contact angles zhang et al 2020a gu et al 2020 wei et al 2020 in addition to the intrinsic features of membrane materials pore structural parameters including pore size shimanovich et al 2018 and open porosity yue et al 2019 are key factors that can affect the wettability of membrane surface previous attempts have mainly examined the effects of membrane pore size especially on the oil water separation performance wei et al 2017 pan et al 2019 for example chen et al chen et al 2020a proposed an economical way to prepare sic uf membranes on alumina mf support based on low pressure chemical vapor deposition lpcvd and the performance in oil in water emulsion separation was evaluated while the surface wettability of the membranes have not been examined recently eray et al eray et al 2021 employed aluminum nitrate nonahydrate as the sintering additive to prepare sic membrane layer where the purpose was also to prepare sic membranes at lower temperature however the influences of pore size on the surface wettability of sic membranes as well as that of open porosity have rarely been involved although open porosity is an important structural factor of ceramic membranes a detailed understanding about the effects of pore structure on their wettability would benefit the purposely design of ceramic membranes for better performance in o w emulsion separation the pore structures such as pore size and especially open porosity of ceramic membranes can be deliberately tuned by adjusting the content of pore forming agent hotza et al 2020 li et al 2019 sintering temperature zhang et al 2020b li et al 2021 and or molding pressure yin et al 2019 although the addition of pore forming agent can adjust the open porosity and pore size in a relatively wide range it would cause an abroad distribution of pore sizes and weaken the mechanical strength in contrast adjusting the processing parameters such as sintering temperature and or molding pressure is relatively facile and effective to tune the pore structure therefore in this work we aim to study the effect of pore structure on the surface wettability and oil water separation in porous sic ceramic membranes to this end the pore structure of sic ceramic membranes was purposely regulated in a cost efficient yet facile way by adjusting the sintering temperature and molding pressure where naa residue naa r was adopted as the low cost sintering aid to enable the in situ reactive sintering process after a systematically structural characterization the pure water flux of these sic membranes as a function of pore structure was analyzed by using both modified k c and h p equations significantly the effect of pore structure on the surface wettability of sic ceramic membranes was evaluated and the contributions of the pore structure dependent surface wettability to the separation performance in the separation of o w emulsion was further elucidated 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and chemicals green α

surface profiler vk1000 keyence japan 2 4 the model predicts pure water flux of sic membrane with different pore structures kozeny carman k c equation carman 1956 and hagen poiseuille h p equation kong et al 1999 can be derived to describe the relationship between the pore structure and permeability behavior of ceramic membranes that formed by particle packing xu et al 2003 have optimized the relationship between the sintered particle size and membrane pore size based on k c equation and established a new model between the microstructure and permeability flux of ceramic membranes as shown in eq 2 2 j δ p d m k 2 ε 3 k 1 1 ε 2 μ l the modified k c equation shows that with the increase in the operating pressure difference δp membrane pore size d m and open porosity ε and or the decrease in the liquid viscosity μ and membrane thickness l the pure water permeation flux j will increase k 1 and k 2 are the undetermined coefficients of the model which are obtained by fitting the experimental data regarding the ceramic membrane formed by the particle packing as a capillary bundle the h p equation can be used to express the relationship between the pore structure and the

analyzer zs 90 malvern uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 regulation of pore structure the pore structure of sic membranes was purposely regulated by adjusting the molding pressure and sintering temperature the open porosity of the prepared samples was in the range of 13 48 as plotted in fig 1 a at the same molding pressure the open porosity of sic membranes decreased gradually with the sintering temperature increasing from 1000 c to 1400 c the open porosity of sic membrane prepared at 1000 c with a molding pressure of 8 mpa is 48 with the sintering temperature rising to 1400 c the open porosity dropped to 30 the in situ reaction mechanism of sic membranes prepared with the aid of naa r can be explored by characterizing the crystal phase changes of the samples at different temperatures as shown in fig 1b when the sintering temperature was 1000 c in addition to the sic phase moissanite 6h sic pdf 74 1302 as the main phase the sio2 phase cristobalite sio2 pdf 82 0512 generated by surface oxidation appeared as well as naalsio4 nepheline naalsio4 pdf 35 0424 phase which was formed from naa r zeolite a na na96al96si96o384 216h2o pdf 39 0222 after sintering at 1000 c as evidenced by the xrd patterns in fig 1c according to the chemical composition analysis table s1 the naa residues are mainly composed of na2o 19 38 wt al2o3 35 85 wt and sio2 44 50 wt once the sintering temperature gradually reached 1100 c the peak of cristobalite increased slightly with the sintering temperature continuously increased to 1400 c the peak intensity of cristobalite increased rapidly while that of sic decreased notably fig 1b when the sintering temperature increased from 1000 c to 1400 c the in situ reaction between nepheline and the silicon oxide formed by the oxidation of sic was promoted eq s1 s3 the continuous rise in temperature increased the amount of cristobalite produced fig 1b which gradually increased the necking connection between the sic aggregate particles and ultimately leads to a decrease in open porosity jiang et al 2020 accordingly the in situ reaction mechanism of sic membranes in this work is illustrated in fig 1d however at high sintering temperature 1400 c excessive cristobalite formation had a great adverse effect on the mechanical strength of sic membranes fig s1 which was related to the difference between sic and cristobalite in thermal expansion coefficient wang et al 2019 in addition when the sample molding pressure increased from 8 mpa to 24 mpa the open porosity of sic membranes prepared at the same sintering temperature decreased gradually fig 1a when the sintering temperature was 1300 c the open porosity of the sic membrane decreased from 35 to 24 a reduction ratio of 31 4 with the molding pressure increased from 8 mpa to 24 mpa this can be interpreted by the contact area between the sic aggregate particles that became larger as the pressure increased and thereby reduced the open porosity of the overall porous structure the pore size of the membrane also changed regularly under the influence of sample preparation conditions as can be seen from fig 2 a the mean pore size of sic membrane increased slightly with the increasing sintering temperature and decreased after reaching the peak value this trend was observed for the samples prepared at each molding pressure in the liquid phase sintering process the increasing temperature would gradually release the pore of the membrane while the degree of densification would be enhanced in the case of higher sintering temperature resulting in a reduction in pore size gu et al 2021a these sic membranes prepared at 1300 c showed the maximized mean pore size when the molding pressures were below 20 mpa when the molding pressure increased to 24 mpa the sintering temperature required to achieve the maximum pore size was reduced to 1200 c the increased molding pressure could densify the package of ceramic particles and promote the mass transfer during the sintering process thereby resulting the densification of ceramic membranes at a relatively lower temperature based on these results we can see that the mean pore size of sic membranes can be successfully tuned in the range of 0 18 to 0 74 μm by adjusting the molding pressure and sintering temperature fig 2b shows the pore size distribution of sic membranes prepared with different molding pressures and sintered at 1000 c it can be seen that the pore size of the membrane decreased gradually with the increasing molding pressure and the pore size distribution become narrowed for example the mean pore size of sic membranes prepared at a molding pressure of 8 mpa was 0 47 μm while that prepared at 24 mpa was 0 37 μm also the maximum pore size corresponding to the bubble point was reduced from 1 μm to 0 75 μm the maximum pore size and mean pore size of sic membranes prepared at 1100 c and 1300 c also tended to decrease with the increasing molding pressure fig 2c and the pore size distribution became narrowed at higher molding pressure the particles would be more closely packed and thus increased the density of green body this could benefit the mass transport in the sintering process which resulted in the smaller pore size and narrowed pore size distribution this suggests that a closer package of sic particles enabled by the increasing molding pressure is helpful for the formation of smaller and more uniform pores correspondingly the microstructure of sic membranes prepared under different conditions was observed as shown in fig 2d at a given sintering temperature of 1000 c the necking connections between sic aggregates were enriched with the increase in molding pressure in addition the raising molding pressure also made the particles more tightly arranged and the pore area on the membrane surface became smaller and more regular fig 2c shows the pore size distribution of samples prepared at different sintering temperatures and molding pressures with a molding pressure of 8 mpa the pore size of the sic membrane prepared at 1000 c was 0 02 μm larger than that sintered at 1100 c such a fluctuation in sintering temperature had little effect on the pore size distribution of the membrane when the molding pressure was fixed at a relatively high level of 24 mpa the pore size of the sic membrane prepared was decreased from 0 37 μm to about 0 2 μm with the rising of sintering temperature from 1000 c to 1100 c while the further increase of sintering temperature to 1300 c did not change the pore size for the samples prepared with a molding pressure of 24 mpa their pore size distribution can be affected by sintering temperature below 1100 c while a higher sintering 1300 c also had no obvious effect on the pore size distribution this can be attributed to the relatively high molding pressure even at a lower sintering temperature as a result the pore structure hardly changed with the further increase in sintering temperature 3 2 relationship between pore structure and water permeance pure water permeance of membranes with different pore structures is shown in fig 3 a the permeance of sic membrane prepared at 1000 c with a molding pressure of 8 mpa was about 4000 lm 2h 1bar 1 moreover the water permeance gradually increased to 5207 lm 2h 1bar 1 growth by 30 when the temperature rose to 1400 c based on the characterization of pore structure the open porosity fig 1a of the sic membranes prepared at 1400 c are lower than that of others and also the mean pore size fig 2a is smaller than that of sic membranes prepared at 1200 c and 1300 c the possible contributions of pore structure to the water permeance can thus be rule out given that the water permeance is collectively determined by the pore structure and the surface wettability the improved pure water permeance of sic membranes prepared 1400 c shall be governed by the surface hydrophilicity rather than open porosity or mean pore size as evidenced by the enhanced peak intensity of sio2 in xrd patterns at 1400 c fig 1b the notable rise in water permeance was attributed to the aggravated surface oxidation of sic to sio2 which improved the surface hydrophilicity of sic membranes hosseini et al 2018 for the samples prepared with a higher molding pressure 12 24 mpa their pure water permeance gradually increased and then dropped with the increase in sintering temperature which was closely related to the variation of mean pore size see fig 2a for example at the molding pressure of 12 mpa the pure water permeance of sic membrane prepared at 1300 c showed the highest value however under the molding pressure of 24 mpa the pure water permeance of the sic membrane prepared at 1100 c was maximized and then gradually decreased when the sintering temperature was higher than 1100 c it was found that the maximum pure water permeance gradually decreased with the increase in molding pressure in cases of sintering temperature above 1300 c the pure water permeance of sic membranes dropped sharply when the molding pressure was 16 mpa the pure water permeance of sic membrane prepared at 1300 c was 3170 lm 2h 1bar 1 for the sample prepared at 1400 c the pure water permeance dropped to 505 lm 2h 1bar 1 reduced by 85 it was the mean pore size and open porosity that collectively and significantly reduced the pure water permeance at the same sintering temperature the pure water permeance of sic membranes decreased gradually with the increase in molding pressure when the molding pressure was increased from 8 mpa to 24 mpa the pure water permeance of sic membrane prepared at a sintering temperature of 1000 c or 1100 c decreased by about 50 similarly the pure water permeance of the sic membrane sintered at 1300 c or 1400 c declined rapidly with the molding pressure increasing from 8 mpa to 24 mpa particularly the permeance decreased by approximately 98 at 1400 c this is the result of the combined effect of open porosity and mean pore size namely the narrowing and reducing water transport channels resulted in a decrease in water flux samples with a comparable mean pore size and open porosity were further considered to understand the effect of pore size and open porosity on pure water flux respectively the open porosity and mean pore size were controlled by the combined regulation of molding pressure and sintering temperature as shown in table s2 the samples prepared at 16 mpa 1200 c s1 16 mpa 1100 c s2 and 8 mpa 1000 c s3 show the same mean pore sizes 0 53 μm but different open porosity 34 48 with the same open porosity of 40 the mean pore sizes of samples prepared at 24 mpa 1000 c p1 16 mpa 1100 c p2 and 8 mpa 1200 c p3 are 0 43 μm 0 53 μm and 0 67 μm respectively these samples were selected to systematically study the potential effect of open porosity and mean pore size on the surface wettability of the ceramic membranes the diameter of the selected sic membrane expanded slightly under the different sintering temperature see table s3 this can be attributed to the surface oxidation of sic to sio2 fig 1b ding et al 2006 however the degree of expansion was not significant up to 1 43 when compared with the diameter of the green body 30 05 mm it can be seen from fig 3b and fig 3c pure water flux increased with the mean pore size and open porosity respectively the modified k c equation and modified h p equation were used to predict the pure water flux of sic membranes with different pore structures table 1 the measured pure water flux was compared with the calculated values obtained by using the modified h p equation and modified k c equation fig 3b and c it can be seen from the comparison of the influences of the open porosity and mean pore size of sic membrane on pure water flux the modified h p equation could better describe the relationship between pure water flux and pore structure 0 43 μm d m 0 67 μm 34 ε 48 with a higher fitting degree r 2 0 980 see table 2 the results suggested that the pore structure in sic membranes can be described as the particle packing with a capillary bundle 3 3 correlation between pore structure and surface wettability the influence of open porosity and mean pore size on the surface roughness and surface wettability of sic membranes were investigated by measuring 3d confocal microscopy images dynamic water contact angle underwater oil contact angle and underwater oil adhesion surface roughness of the membrane has a great influence on the wettability of water or oil phase zhang et al 2015 fig s3 displays 3d confocal microscopy images of sic membranes with different pore structures showing the difference of surface morphology of each membrane it was clearly found that the larger open porosity of the membrane the smaller the roughness see fig 4 additionally membrane surface was relatively smooth when the mean pore size was larger given that the size and ratio of the staring powders used to prepare sic membrane were the same the difference in surface roughness was related to the different sample preparation conditions table s2 the increase in molding pressure and sintering temperature made the solid particles rearrange under the influence of mechanical and thermal stress thereby affecting the open porosity fig 1a and pore size fig 2a and the surface roughness of the membrane thus changed accordingly wettability of aqueous and oil phases on the membrane surface was studied fig 5 recorded the dynamic water contact angle of the sic membrane surface with different pore structure from the overall trend of variation the prepared sic membranes with different pore structures were relatively hydrophilic and the water contact angle could be reduced to 10 within 0 16 s and then quickly penetrated the membranes it can be seen from the fig 5a that the higher the open porosity of the sic membrane the stronger the water transport ability and the smaller the water contact angle when the open porosity of the sic membranes were 40 p1 p2 p3 and 48 s3 the initial contact angle was less than 16 and the penetration time was extremely short 0 04 s as for the membrane with an open porosity of 34 or even less the contact angle of water decreased relatively slowly according to the dynamic water contact angle of sic membrane with different mean pore sizes in fig 5b a smaller water contact angle and a better water transport ability were gained when the membrane had larger mean pore size the hydrophilicity of sic membranes with different pore structures also showed the same tendency as the value of their pure water permeance fig 3b and c as shown in fig 6 the underwater oil contact angle of all samples was over 150 this proves that the as prepared membranes are underwater super oleophobicity which is beneficial to prevent the attachment of oil droplets in oil water separation process chen et al 2019 the results indicate that no matter how the pore structure varies their underwater oil contact angles do not change significantly this may be explained by the following two aspects i the variation range of the roughness was not large enough and it does not cause the change of the underwater oil contact angle ii the difference of the contact angle cannot be well reflected by the optical contact angle instrument however it can be identified in underwater oil adhesion due to changes in membrane surface roughness when an adhesion meter was equipped with a high sensitivity microelectromechanical balance as the results presented in fig 7 the variation of underwater oil adhesion of sic membranes with different pore structures was then investigated figs 7a and b and the pictures showed the shape of oil droplets when the maximum adhesion force was displayed fig s4 the maximum force detected by the instrument corresponded to the adhesion force of the membrane surface to the oil droplets with the increase in open porosity and mean pore size the underwater oil adhesion on the surface of the membrane gradually decreased in the range of 57 132 μn the smaller the adhesion force the smaller the contact area between the membrane surface and the oil droplets under the state of maximum force fig s4 correspondingly the oil droplets would be more easily separated from the membrane surface wenzel and cassie baxter mixed states are often observed due to partial penetration of the liquid inside the air pockets formed into the rough surface features ismail et al 2022 wenzel state is a state in which oil droplets wet the membrane the increase in the roughness of the membrane surface the increase in the contact area between the membrane and the oil droplet will greatly increase the adhesion of the oil droplet to the membrane surface while for the cassie baxter state trapped water in the valleys characterized by nanoscale and microscale roughness will provide a barrier to oil adhesion at this time the increasing roughness will reduce the adhesion of oil droplets to the membrane surface as illustrated in fig 7c the oil droplets are in wenzel state on the sic membrane surface owing to the microblocks in sic membrane zhang et al 2015 with the increase in pore size and porosity thereby reduced surface roughness the contact area between the oil phase and the solid phase would be reduced leading to the gradually reduction in adhesion of oil droplets on membrane surface zhang et al 2015 3 4 correlation between the pore structure and filtration performance figs 8 a and b shows the permeate flux as a function of time where these sic membranes were used for treating oily wastewater with an initial concentration of 500 ppm under such oil concentration all these membranes with different pore structures were fouled rapidly as indicated by the quickly dropped flux in the first 10 min such a rapid flux decline can be attributed to the relatively high viscosity of lubricating oil 125 mpa s 25 c and thus high propensity of membrane fouling as presented in our previous work jiang et al 2020 when other oils with lower viscosity were used the permeate flux tended to decrease more slowly lubricant oil with a relatively high viscosity and thus high propensity of membrane fouling was selected in this work to challenge the sic membranes when the filtration time exceeded 20 min the flux continuously reduced but the change was not obvious in such an extreme condition the sic membranes also showed a high stable flux when the oil concentration was 100 ppm figs 8c and d the membrane fouling phenomenon was obviously reduced namely the flux decline rate was slower and a stable permeate flux was reached after about 40 min hermia models hermia 1982 debnath et al 2019 maiti et al 2012 were used to analyzed the oil fouling mechanism of the sic membrane at different o w emulsions with different initial concentrations table s4 when treating 500 ppm o w emulsions the r 2 values were the highest for cake filtration indicating that this model represented the dominant fouling mechanism as for the treatment of 100 ppm o w emulsions the intermediate pore blocking model was dominant in the early 20 min resulting in a relatively fast flux decline when the permeate flux reached a steady state 20 t 60 min the cake filtration dominated in the fouling process due to the formation of a dynamically stable oil layer in case of a high initial oil concentration 500 ppm a large number of oil droplets deposited on the membrane surface under the operating pressure 0 5 bar resulting in the appearance of cake filtration when the oil concentration was low 100 ppm a small amount of oil droplets deposited on the membrane surface and gradually formed cake filtration with the increasing filtration time the relationship between the stable flux and open porosity and mean pore size can be established as plotted in figs 9 a and b for the membranes with a similar mean pore size of 0 53 μm the stable permeate flux was increased with the open porosity fig 9a which can be further attributed to the improved hydrophilicity fig 5a and weakened oil adhesion fig 7a when the open porosity was the same sic membranes with a larger mean pore size showed a lower stable permeate flux fig 9b and d as oil droplets are elastic particles the larger pores would ease the entry of oil droplets thereby accelerating membrane fouling and reducing the permeate flux such as p3 accordingly the sample had the smallest mean pore size p1 and its flux decline rate was thus the slowest however due to its low initial flux its final stable flux was close to that of sample p3 in all cases when the concentration of o w emulsion was reduced from 500 ppm to 100 ppm the stable flux increased to over 3 times with the increase in open porosity of sic membranes the oil rejection rate increased while it hardly changed with the variation in mean pore size as has been observed in fig 6 the sic membrane was super oleophobic underwater therefore the water phase in the oil in water emulsion was more likely to penetrate the membrane at the same time when the hydrophilicity of the sic membrane was stronger the less oil adhesion made the membrane more resistant to oil droplet penetration thus the hydrophilicity and oleophobicity of the membrane contributed to the improved oil water separation performance of sic membranes in addition by comparing the pure water flux and pure oil flux of membranes with different open porosity fig s5a it was found that the larger the difference of liquid flux between these two pure phases the corresponding membrane mean pore size of 0 53 μm had a higher oil rejection rate as for the membranes with the same open porosity the oil water separation performance was affected by mean pore size and surface wettability the smaller mean pore size of the sic membrane could better retain the oil droplets in the oil in water emulsion through pore size sieving effect so the rejection rate of sample p1 0 43 μm is slightly higher than that of sample p2 0 53 μm when the mean pore size was 0 53 μm the sieving capacity of pore size was weakened but the oil adhesion was smaller than that of sample p1 therefore the oil droplets were less likely to pass through the membrane making the oil rejection rate comparable to sample p1 when the mean pore size of the sample was too large p3 0 67 μm thereby more oil droplets entered the pores and trapped in the shrinkage and or bends in the pores correspondingly contaminations occurred on the surface of the membrane and inside the membrane and a severe decline in water permeation was observed together with a higher oil rejection as a result the sic membrane with a suitable mean pore size 0 53 μm and a higher open porosity 48 could have better oil water separation performance fig 9a in general an increase in open porosity will lead to the decrease in mechanical strength of ceramic membranes fortunately with the utilization of sintering additives the bending strength of the sic membrane with such pore structure still remained 45 mpa which can sufficiently meet the application requirements specifically the oil rejection rate reached 95 6 and the stable flux was 163 l m 2h 1 when treating the o w emulsion with a concentration of 500 ppm as the feed concentration reduced to 100 ppm the stable flux jumped to 490 l m 2h 1 and the oil rejection rate still remained more than 90 compared with the commercial sic membranes and other oxide ceramic membranes jiang et al 2020 the sic membrane in this work presented relatively better oil water separation performance namely a much improved stable flux at a comparable rejection rate for example the recently reported sic microfiltration membrane xu et al 2020 has an oil rejection rate of 93 5 when treating 200 ppm oily wastewater but its stable flux was only 103 9 l m 2h 1 the improved oil water separation performance was attributed to the combined effects of pore size and open porosity which enabled the formation of superhydrophilic surface of sic membranes the size distributions of oil droplets in the feed and the permeate are shown in figs 9c and d the average particle size of the oil droplets on the feed side was about 850 nm and that on the permeate side decreased to certain degrees depending on the sic membranes used from fig 9c when the open porosity of the sic membrane gradually increased the oil droplets size of the permeate side after membrane treatment gradually decreased this phenomenon can be explained by the open porosity dependent adhesion of oil droplets underwater as shown in fig 7a since the sic membranes with a higher open porosity possessed the lower adhesion of oil droplets underwater the oil droplets were easily taken away from membrane surface thus reducing its possibility of penetrating the membrane when the mean pore size of the membrane increased from 0 43 μm to 0 53 μm open porosity 40 the reduction in the oil adhesion of the membrane surface led to a relatively small oil droplet on the permeate side however when the mean pore size was too large 0 67 μm fig 9d the resistance of oil droplets through the membrane decreased resulting in the largest size of oil droplets in all permeable liquid samples 4 conclusion sic microfiltration membranes were purposely selected to study the effects of pore structure dependent wettability on the oil water separation performance the pore structure of porous sic ceramic membranes was effectively regulated in a cost effective yet facile way by varying the molding pressure 8 24 mpa and sintering temperature 1000 1400 c without adding additional pore forming agent an in situ reaction sintering technology enabled the successful preparation of sic membranes at a relatively low sintering temperature the open porosity of sic ceramic membranes was controlled between 13 and 48 and the mean pore size was tuned from 0 18 μm to 0 74 μm compared with the variation in mean pore size 0 43 0 67 μm a higher open porosity 34 48 would be beneficial to improve the hydrophilicity of sic membranes with a similar mean pore size thereby improved the stable flux and oil rejection rate of the membrane in the oil water separation process the sic membranes with mean pore size of 0 53 μm and open porosity of 48 showed a superior performance among others namely an oil rejection rate of above 90 and a stable flux of 490 lm 2h 1 was achieved at a relatively low transmembrane pressure of 0 5 bar this work successfully correlated the pore structure of sic membranes to the surface wettability and demonstrated that pore structure engineering could be adopted to effectively improve the oil water separation performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16103,both the pore size and surface properties of silicon carbide sic membranes are demonstrated to significantly affect their separation efficiency when used for oily water treatment however the potential influences of open porosity together with the pore size of sic membranes on their surface properties and oil water separation performance have rarely been investigated in this work porous sic ceramic membranes with tunable open porosity and pore size were purposely prepared and selected to systematically study the effect of pore structure dependent wettability on the oil water separation performance the measured pure water flux of selected membranes as a function of open porosity 34 48 and pore size 0 43 0 67 μm was well fitted by using a modified h p equation interestingly the hydrophilicity of sic membranes was improved with the increase in open porosity and pore size as evidenced by the gradually decreased dynamic water contact angle and underwater adhesion of oil droplets further the open porosity of sic membranes was found to contribute more to the improved surface wettability as a result the stable flux of sic membranes in oil in water o w emulsions was increased by 24 with the increased open porosity while the oil rejection rate remained above 90 this work quantitatively reveals the contributions of the pore structure to the surface wettability of ceramic membranes and thus provides an effective pathway to improve their performance in oil water separation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silicon carbide ceramic membrane low

ge et al 2017 qiu et al 2020 at the same time the flux decline can be slowed down and the long term stability of the membranes can be ensured wei et al 2017 zhao et al 2021b besides the synergistic effect of chemistry and structural properties on the membrane surface would further promote the wettability and improve the oil water separation efficiency gu et al 2021b wang et al 2021 porous silicon carbide sic ceramic membrane is such a kind of materials that intrinsically exhibits excellent superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic features jiang et al 2020 moreover the sic membrane has higher mechanical strength and exceptionally hydrophilic compared with other oxide ceramic membranes asif et al 2021 recently sic membranes have been experimentally demonstrated to show better sustainable permeability zsirai et al 2016 and anti fouling ability hofs et al 2011 under the same operation and maintenance conditions in oily wastewater treatment although ceramic materials including sic are well known for their excellent hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic features their wettability even for those of the same materials varies notably as indicated by various water contact angles zhang et al 2020a gu et al 2020 wei et al 2020 in addition to the intrinsic features of membrane materials pore structural parameters including pore size shimanovich et al 2018 and open porosity yue et al 2019 are key factors that can affect the wettability of membrane surface previous attempts have mainly examined the effects of membrane pore size especially on the oil water separation performance wei et al 2017 pan et al 2019 for example chen et al chen et al 2020a proposed an economical way to prepare sic uf membranes on alumina mf support based on low pressure chemical vapor deposition lpcvd and the performance in oil in water emulsion separation was evaluated while the surface wettability of the membranes have not been examined recently eray et al eray et al 2021 employed aluminum nitrate nonahydrate as the sintering additive to prepare sic membrane layer where the purpose was also to prepare sic membranes at lower temperature however the influences of pore size on the surface wettability of sic membranes as well as that of open porosity have rarely been involved although open porosity is an important structural factor of ceramic membranes a detailed understanding about the effects of pore structure on their wettability would benefit the purposely design of ceramic membranes for better performance in o w emulsion separation the pore structures such as pore size and especially open porosity of ceramic membranes can be deliberately tuned by adjusting the content of pore forming agent hotza et al 2020 li et al 2019 sintering temperature zhang et al 2020b li et al 2021 and or molding pressure yin et al 2019 although the addition of pore forming agent can adjust the open porosity and pore size in a relatively wide range it would cause an abroad distribution of pore sizes and weaken the mechanical strength in contrast adjusting the processing parameters such as sintering temperature and or molding pressure is relatively facile and effective to tune the pore structure therefore in this work we aim to study the effect of pore structure on the surface wettability and oil water separation in porous sic ceramic membranes to this end the pore structure of sic ceramic membranes was purposely regulated in a cost efficient yet facile way by adjusting the sintering temperature and molding pressure where naa residue naa r was adopted as the low cost sintering aid to enable the in situ reactive sintering process after a systematically structural characterization the pure water flux of these sic membranes as a function of pore structure was analyzed by using both modified k c and h p equations significantly the effect of pore structure on the surface wettability of sic ceramic membranes was evaluated and the contributions of the pore structure dependent surface wettability to the separation performance in the separation of o w emulsion was further elucidated 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and chemicals green α

surface profiler vk1000 keyence japan 2 4 the model predicts pure water flux of sic membrane with different pore structures kozeny carman k c equation carman 1956 and hagen poiseuille h p equation kong et al 1999 can be derived to describe the relationship between the pore structure and permeability behavior of ceramic membranes that formed by particle packing xu et al 2003 have optimized the relationship between the sintered particle size and membrane pore size based on k c equation and established a new model between the microstructure and permeability flux of ceramic membranes as shown in eq 2 2 j δ p d m k 2 ε 3 k 1 1 ε 2 μ l the modified k c equation shows that with the increase in the operating pressure difference δp membrane pore size d m and open porosity ε and or the decrease in the liquid viscosity μ and membrane thickness l the pure water permeation flux j will increase k 1 and k 2 are the undetermined coefficients of the model which are obtained by fitting the experimental data regarding the ceramic membrane formed by the particle packing as a capillary bundle the h p equation can be used to express the relationship between the pore structure and the permeation flux as shown in eq 3 3 j δ p d m 2 ε 32 μ l τ where τ is the tortuosity factor the coefficient k 3 shape factor caused by particle size distribution and shape irregularity was proposed to modify the relationship between tortuosity factor and open porosity speciale et al 1990 4 τ k 3 ε by substituting eq 4 into eq 3 the relationship between the permeation flux and membrane

125 mpa s 20 c is the oil phase and span 80 1 10 mass of the oil phase was added as the emulsifier the oil in water o w emulsion was pumped at a cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s and the transmembrane pressure was 0 5 bar the water flux j during the separation of o w emulsion was calculated by eq 2 6 j lm 2 h 1 v a 0 δ t these parameters in eq 2 are the same as those in eq 1 oil rejection rate r

an uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2600i shimadzu corporation japan the size distribution of oil droplets in o w emulsion was measured with dynamic light scattering by using the malvern mastersizer analyzer zs 90 malvern uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 regulation of pore structure the pore structure of sic membranes was purposely regulated by adjusting the molding pressure and sintering temperature the open porosity of the prepared samples was in the range of 13 48 as plotted in fig 1 a at the same molding pressure the open porosity of sic membranes decreased gradually with the sintering temperature increasing from 1000 c to 1400 c the open porosity of sic membrane prepared at 1000 c with a molding pressure of 8 mpa is 48 with the sintering temperature rising to 1400 c the open porosity dropped to 30 the in situ reaction mechanism of sic membranes prepared with the aid of naa r can be explored by characterizing the crystal phase changes of the samples at different temperatures as shown in fig 1b when the sintering temperature was 1000 c in addition to the sic phase moissanite 6h sic pdf 74 1302 as the main phase the sio2 phase cristobalite sio2 pdf 82 0512 generated by surface oxidation appeared as well as naalsio4 nepheline naalsio4 pdf 35 0424 phase which was formed from naa r zeolite a na na96al96si96o384 216h2o pdf 39 0222 after sintering at 1000 c as evidenced by the xrd patterns in fig 1c according to the chemical composition analysis table s1 the naa residues are mainly composed of na2o 19 38 wt al2o3 35 85 wt and sio2 44 50 wt once the sintering temperature gradually reached 1100 c the peak of cristobalite increased slightly with the sintering temperature continuously increased to 1400 c the peak intensity of cristobalite increased rapidly while that of sic decreased notably fig 1b when the sintering temperature increased from 1000 c to 1400 c the in situ reaction between nepheline and the silicon oxide formed by the oxidation of sic was promoted eq s1 s3 the continuous rise in temperature increased the amount of cristobalite produced fig 1b which gradually increased the necking connection between the sic aggregate particles and ultimately leads to a decrease in open porosity jiang et al 2020 accordingly the in situ reaction mechanism of sic membranes in this work is illustrated in fig 1d however at high sintering temperature 1400 c excessive cristobalite formation had a great adverse effect on the mechanical strength of sic membranes fig s1 which was related to the difference between sic and cristobalite in thermal expansion coefficient wang et al 2019 in addition when the sample molding pressure increased from 8 mpa to 24 mpa the open porosity of sic membranes prepared at the same sintering temperature decreased gradually fig 1a when the sintering temperature was 1300 c the open porosity of the sic membrane decreased from 35 to 24 a reduction ratio of 31 4 with the molding pressure increased from 8 mpa to 24 mpa this can be interpreted by the contact area between the sic aggregate particles that became larger as the pressure increased and thereby reduced the open porosity of the overall porous structure the pore size of the membrane also changed regularly under the influence of sample preparation conditions as can be seen from fig 2 a the mean pore size of sic membrane increased slightly with the increasing sintering temperature and decreased after reaching the peak value this trend was observed for the samples prepared at each molding pressure in the liquid phase sintering process the increasing temperature would gradually release the pore of the membrane while the degree of densification would be enhanced in the case of higher sintering temperature resulting in a reduction in pore size gu et al 2021a these sic membranes prepared at 1300 c showed the maximized mean pore size when the molding pressures were below 20 mpa when the molding pressure increased to 24 mpa the sintering temperature required to achieve the maximum pore size was reduced to 1200 c the increased molding pressure could densify the package of ceramic particles and promote the mass transfer during the sintering process thereby resulting the densification of ceramic membranes at a relatively lower temperature based on these results we can see that the mean pore size of sic membranes can be successfully tuned in the range of 0 18 to 0 74 μm by adjusting the molding pressure and sintering temperature fig 2b shows the pore size distribution of sic membranes prepared with different molding pressures and sintered at 1000 c it can be seen that the pore size of the membrane decreased gradually with the increasing molding pressure and the pore size distribution become narrowed for example the mean pore size of sic membranes prepared at a molding pressure of 8 mpa was 0 47 μm while that prepared at 24 mpa was 0 37 μm also the maximum pore size corresponding to the bubble point was reduced from 1 μm to 0 75 μm the maximum pore size and mean pore size of sic membranes prepared at 1100 c and 1300 c also tended to decrease with the increasing molding pressure fig 2c and the pore size distribution became narrowed at higher molding pressure the particles would be more closely packed and thus increased the density of green body this could benefit the mass transport in the sintering process which resulted in the smaller pore size and narrowed pore size distribution this suggests that a closer package of sic particles enabled by the increasing molding pressure is helpful for the formation of smaller and more uniform pores correspondingly the microstructure of sic membranes prepared under different conditions was observed as shown in fig 2d at a given sintering temperature of 1000 c the necking connections between sic aggregates were enriched with the increase in molding pressure in addition the raising molding pressure also made the particles more tightly arranged and the pore area on the membrane surface became smaller and more regular fig 2c shows the pore size distribution of samples prepared at different sintering temperatures and molding pressures with a molding pressure of 8 mpa the pore size of the sic membrane prepared at 1000 c was 0 02 μm larger than that sintered at 1100 c such a fluctuation in sintering temperature had little effect on the pore size distribution of the membrane when the molding pressure was fixed at a relatively high level of 24 mpa the pore size of the sic membrane prepared was decreased from 0 37 μm to about 0 2 μm with the rising of sintering temperature from 1000 c to 1100 c while the further increase of sintering temperature to 1300 c did not change the pore size for the samples prepared with a molding pressure of 24 mpa their pore size distribution can be affected by sintering temperature below 1100 c while a higher sintering 1300 c also had no obvious effect on the pore size distribution this can be attributed to the relatively high molding pressure even at a lower sintering temperature as a result the pore structure hardly changed with the further increase in sintering temperature 3 2 relationship between pore structure and water permeance pure water permeance of membranes with different pore structures is shown in fig 3 a the permeance of sic membrane prepared at 1000 c with a molding pressure of 8 mpa was about 4000 lm 2h 1bar 1 moreover the water permeance gradually increased to 5207 lm 2h 1bar 1 growth by 30 when the temperature rose to 1400 c based on the characterization of pore structure the open porosity fig 1a of the sic membranes prepared at 1400 c are lower than that of others and also the mean pore size fig 2a is smaller than that of sic membranes prepared at 1200 c and 1300 c the possible contributions of pore structure to the water permeance can thus be rule out given that the water permeance is collectively determined by the pore structure and the surface wettability the improved pure water permeance of sic membranes prepared 1400 c shall be governed by the surface hydrophilicity rather than open porosity or mean pore size as evidenced by the enhanced peak intensity of sio2 in xrd patterns at 1400 c fig 1b the notable rise in water permeance was attributed to the aggravated surface oxidation of sic to sio2 which improved the surface hydrophilicity of sic membranes hosseini et al 2018 for the samples prepared with a higher molding pressure 12 24 mpa their pure water permeance gradually increased and then dropped with the increase in sintering temperature which was closely related to the variation of mean pore size see fig 2a for example at the molding pressure of 12 mpa the pure water permeance of sic membrane prepared at 1300 c showed the highest value however under the molding pressure of 24 mpa the pure water permeance of the sic membrane prepared at 1100 c was maximized and then gradually decreased when the sintering temperature was higher than 1100 c it was found that the maximum pure water permeance gradually decreased with the increase in molding pressure in cases of sintering temperature above 1300 c the pure water permeance of sic membranes dropped sharply when the molding pressure was 16 mpa the pure water permeance of sic membrane prepared at 1300 c was 3170 lm 2h 1bar 1 for the sample prepared at 1400 c the pure water permeance dropped to 505 lm 2h 1bar 1 reduced by 85 it was the mean pore size and open porosity that collectively and significantly reduced the pure water permeance at the same sintering temperature the pure water permeance of sic membranes decreased gradually with the increase in molding pressure when the molding pressure was increased from 8 mpa to 24 mpa the pure water permeance of sic membrane prepared at a sintering temperature of 1000 c or 1100 c decreased by about 50 similarly the pure water permeance of the sic membrane sintered at 1300 c or 1400 c declined rapidly with the molding pressure increasing from 8 mpa to 24 mpa particularly the permeance decreased by approximately 98 at 1400 c this is the result of the combined effect of open porosity and mean pore size namely the narrowing and reducing water transport channels resulted in a decrease in water flux samples with a comparable mean pore size and open porosity were further considered to understand the effect of pore size and open porosity on pure water flux respectively the open porosity and mean pore size were controlled by the combined regulation of molding pressure and sintering temperature as shown in table s2 the samples prepared at 16 mpa 1200 c s1 16 mpa 1100 c s2 and 8 mpa 1000 c s3 show the same mean pore sizes 0 53 μm but different open porosity 34 48 with the same open porosity of 40 the mean pore sizes of samples prepared at 24 mpa 1000 c p1 16 mpa 1100 c p2 and 8 mpa 1200 c p3 are 0 43 μm 0 53 μm and 0 67 μm respectively these samples were selected to systematically study the potential effect of open porosity and mean pore size on the surface wettability of the ceramic membranes the diameter of the selected sic membrane expanded slightly under the different sintering temperature see table s3 this can be attributed to the surface oxidation of sic to sio2 fig 1b ding et al 2006 however the degree of expansion was not significant up to 1 43 when compared with the diameter of the green body 30 05 mm it can be seen from fig 3b and fig 3c pure water flux increased with the mean pore size and open porosity respectively the modified k c equation and modified h p equation were used to predict the pure water flux of sic membranes with different pore structures table 1 the measured pure water flux was compared with the calculated values obtained by using the modified h p equation and modified k c equation fig 3b and c it can be seen from the comparison of the influences of the open porosity and mean pore size of sic membrane on pure water flux the modified h p equation could better describe the relationship between pure water flux and pore structure 0 43 μm d m 0 67 μm 34 ε 48 with a higher fitting degree r 2 0 980 see table 2 the results suggested that the pore structure in sic membranes can be described as the particle packing with a capillary bundle 3 3 correlation between pore structure and surface wettability the influence of open porosity and mean pore size on the surface roughness and surface wettability of sic membranes were investigated by measuring 3d confocal microscopy images dynamic water contact angle underwater oil contact angle and underwater oil adhesion surface roughness of the membrane has a great influence on the wettability of water or oil phase zhang et al 2015 fig s3 displays 3d confocal microscopy images of sic membranes with different pore structures showing the difference of surface morphology of each membrane it was clearly found that the larger open porosity of the membrane the smaller the roughness see fig 4 additionally membrane surface was relatively smooth when the mean pore size was larger given that the size and ratio of the staring powders used to prepare sic membrane were the same the difference in surface roughness was related to the different sample preparation conditions table s2 the increase in molding pressure and sintering temperature made the solid particles rearrange under the influence of mechanical and thermal stress thereby affecting the open porosity fig 1a and pore size fig 2a and the surface roughness of the membrane thus changed accordingly wettability of aqueous and oil phases on the membrane surface was studied fig 5 recorded the dynamic water contact angle of the sic membrane surface with different pore structure from the overall trend of variation the prepared sic membranes with different pore structures were relatively hydrophilic and the water contact angle could be reduced to 10 within 0 16 s and then quickly penetrated the membranes it can be seen from the fig 5a that the higher the open porosity of the sic membrane the stronger the water transport ability and the smaller the water contact angle when the open porosity of the sic membranes were 40 p1 p2 p3 and 48 s3 the initial contact angle was less than 16 and the penetration time was extremely short 0 04 s as for the membrane with an open porosity of 34 or even less the contact angle of water decreased relatively slowly according to the dynamic water contact angle of sic membrane with different mean pore sizes in fig 5b a smaller water contact angle and a better water transport ability were gained when the membrane had larger mean pore size the hydrophilicity of sic membranes with different pore structures also showed the same tendency as the value of their pure water permeance fig 3b and c as shown in fig 6 the underwater oil contact angle of all samples was over 150 this proves that the as prepared membranes are underwater super oleophobicity which is beneficial to prevent the attachment of oil droplets in oil water separation process chen et al 2019 the results indicate that no matter how the pore structure varies their underwater oil contact angles do not change significantly this may be explained by the following two aspects i the variation range of the roughness was not large enough and it does not cause the change of the underwater oil contact angle ii the difference of the contact angle cannot be well reflected by the optical contact angle instrument however it can be identified in underwater oil adhesion due to changes in membrane surface roughness when an adhesion meter was equipped with a high sensitivity microelectromechanical balance as the results presented in fig 7 the variation of underwater oil adhesion of sic membranes with different pore structures was then investigated figs 7a and b and the pictures showed the shape of oil droplets when the maximum adhesion force was displayed fig s4 the maximum force detected by the instrument corresponded to the adhesion force of the membrane surface to the oil droplets with the increase in open porosity and mean pore size the underwater oil adhesion on the surface of the membrane gradually decreased in the range of 57 132 μn the smaller the adhesion force the smaller the contact area between the membrane surface and the oil droplets under the state of maximum force fig s4 correspondingly the oil droplets would be more easily separated from the membrane surface wenzel and cassie baxter mixed states are often observed due to partial penetration of the liquid inside the air pockets formed into the rough surface features ismail et al 2022 wenzel state is a state in which oil droplets wet the membrane the increase in the roughness of the membrane surface the increase in the contact area between the membrane and the oil droplet will greatly increase the adhesion of the oil droplet to the membrane surface while for the cassie baxter state trapped water in the valleys characterized by nanoscale and microscale roughness will provide a barrier to oil adhesion at this time the increasing roughness will reduce the adhesion of oil droplets to the membrane surface as illustrated in fig 7c the oil droplets are in wenzel state on the sic membrane surface owing to the microblocks in sic membrane zhang et al 2015 with the increase in pore size and porosity thereby reduced surface roughness the contact area between the oil phase and the solid phase would be reduced leading to the gradually reduction in adhesion of oil droplets on membrane surface zhang et al 2015 3 4 correlation between the pore structure and filtration performance figs 8 a and b shows the permeate flux as a function of time where these sic membranes were used for treating oily wastewater with an initial concentration of 500 ppm under such oil concentration all these membranes with different pore structures were fouled rapidly as indicated by the quickly dropped flux in the first 10 min such a rapid flux decline can be attributed to the relatively high viscosity of lubricating oil 125 mpa s 25 c and thus high propensity of membrane fouling as presented in our previous work jiang et al 2020 when other oils with lower viscosity were used the permeate flux tended to decrease more slowly lubricant oil with a relatively high viscosity and thus high propensity of membrane fouling was selected in this work to challenge the sic membranes when the filtration time exceeded 20 min the flux continuously reduced but the change was not obvious in such an extreme condition the sic membranes also showed a high stable flux when the oil concentration was 100 ppm figs 8c and d the membrane fouling phenomenon was obviously reduced namely the flux decline rate was slower and a stable permeate flux was reached after about 40 min hermia models hermia 1982 debnath et al 2019 maiti et al 2012 were used to analyzed the oil fouling mechanism of the sic membrane at different o w emulsions with different initial concentrations table s4 when treating 500 ppm o w emulsions the r 2 values were the highest for cake filtration indicating that this model represented the dominant fouling mechanism as for the treatment of 100 ppm o w emulsions the intermediate pore blocking model was dominant in the early 20 min resulting in a relatively fast flux decline when the permeate flux reached a steady state 20 t 60 min the cake filtration dominated in the fouling process due to the formation of a dynamically stable oil layer in case of a high initial oil concentration 500 ppm a large number of oil droplets deposited on the membrane surface under the operating pressure 0 5 bar resulting in the appearance of cake filtration when the oil concentration was low 100 ppm a small amount of oil droplets deposited on the membrane surface and gradually formed cake filtration with the increasing filtration time the relationship between the stable flux and open porosity and mean pore size can be established as plotted in figs 9 a and b for the membranes with a similar mean pore size of 0 53 μm the stable permeate flux was increased with the open porosity fig 9a which can be further attributed to the improved hydrophilicity fig 5a and weakened oil adhesion fig 7a when the open porosity was the same sic membranes with a larger mean pore size showed a lower stable permeate flux fig 9b and d as oil droplets are elastic particles the larger pores would ease the entry of oil droplets thereby accelerating membrane fouling and reducing the permeate flux such as p3 accordingly the sample had the smallest mean pore size p1 and its flux decline rate was thus the slowest however due to its low initial flux its final stable flux was close to that of sample p3 in all cases when the concentration of o w emulsion was reduced from 500 ppm to 100 ppm the stable flux increased to over 3 times with the increase in open porosity of sic membranes the oil rejection rate increased while it hardly changed with the variation in mean pore size as has been observed in fig 6 the sic membrane was super oleophobic underwater therefore the water phase in the oil in water emulsion was more likely to penetrate the membrane at the same time when the hydrophilicity of the sic membrane was stronger the less oil adhesion made the membrane more resistant to oil droplet penetration thus the hydrophilicity and oleophobicity of the membrane contributed to the improved oil water separation performance of sic membranes in addition by comparing the pure water flux and pure oil flux of membranes with different open porosity fig s5a it was found that the larger the difference of liquid flux between these two pure phases the corresponding membrane mean pore size of 0 53 μm had a higher oil rejection rate as for the membranes with the same open porosity the oil water separation performance was affected by mean pore size and surface wettability the smaller mean pore size of the sic membrane could better retain the oil droplets in the oil in water emulsion through pore size sieving effect so the rejection rate of sample p1 0 43 μm is slightly higher than that of sample p2 0 53 μm when the mean pore size was 0 53 μm the sieving capacity of pore size was weakened but the oil adhesion was smaller than that of sample p1 therefore the oil droplets were less likely to pass through the membrane making the oil rejection rate comparable to sample p1 when the mean pore size of the sample was too large p3 0 67 μm thereby more oil droplets entered the pores and trapped in the shrinkage and or bends in the pores correspondingly contaminations occurred on the surface of the membrane and inside the membrane and a severe decline in water permeation was observed together with a higher oil rejection as a result the sic membrane with a suitable mean pore size 0 53 μm and a higher open porosity 48 could have better oil water separation performance fig 9a in general an increase in open porosity will lead to the decrease in mechanical strength of ceramic membranes fortunately with the utilization of sintering additives the bending strength of the sic membrane with such pore structure still remained 45 mpa which can sufficiently meet the application requirements specifically the oil rejection rate reached 95 6 and the stable flux was 163 l m 2h 1 when treating the o w emulsion with a concentration of 500 ppm as the feed concentration reduced to 100 ppm the stable flux jumped to 490 l m 2h 1 and the oil rejection rate still remained more than 90 compared with the commercial sic membranes and other oxide ceramic membranes jiang et al 2020 the sic membrane in this work presented relatively better oil water separation performance namely a much improved stable flux at a comparable rejection rate for example the recently reported sic microfiltration membrane xu et al 2020 has an oil rejection rate of 93 5 when treating 200 ppm oily wastewater but its stable flux was only 103 9 l m 2h 1 the improved oil water separation performance was attributed to the combined effects of pore size and open porosity which enabled the formation of superhydrophilic surface of sic membranes the size distributions of oil droplets in the feed and the permeate are shown in figs 9c and d the average particle size of the oil droplets on the feed side was about 850 nm and that on the permeate side decreased to certain degrees depending on the sic membranes used from fig 9c when the open porosity of the sic membrane gradually increased the oil droplets size of the permeate side after membrane treatment gradually decreased this phenomenon can be explained by the open porosity dependent adhesion of oil droplets underwater as shown in fig 7a since the sic membranes with a higher open porosity possessed the lower adhesion of oil droplets underwater the oil droplets were easily taken away from membrane surface thus reducing its possibility of penetrating the membrane when the mean pore size of the membrane increased from 0 43 μm to 0 53 μm open porosity 40 the reduction in the oil adhesion of the membrane surface led to a relatively small oil droplet on the permeate side however when the mean pore size was too large 0 67 μm fig 9d the resistance of oil droplets through the membrane decreased resulting in the largest size of oil droplets in all permeable liquid samples 4 conclusion sic microfiltration membranes were purposely selected to study the effects of pore structure dependent wettability on the oil water separation performance the pore structure of porous sic ceramic membranes was effectively regulated in a cost effective yet facile way by varying the molding pressure 8 24 mpa and sintering temperature 1000 1400 c without adding additional pore forming agent an in situ reaction sintering technology enabled the successful preparation of sic membranes at a relatively low sintering temperature the open porosity of sic ceramic membranes was controlled between 13 and 48 and the mean pore size was tuned from 0 18 μm to 0 74 μm compared with the variation in mean pore size 0 43 0 67 μm a higher open porosity 34 48 would be beneficial to improve the hydrophilicity of sic membranes with a similar mean pore size thereby improved the stable flux and oil rejection rate of the membrane in the oil water separation process the sic membranes with mean pore size of 0 53 μm and open porosity of 48 showed a superior performance among others namely an oil rejection rate of above 90 and a stable flux of 490 lm 2h 1 was achieved at a relatively low transmembrane pressure of 0 5 bar this work successfully correlated the pore structure of sic membranes to the surface

16104,understanding the negative effects of widespread implementation of optimal water efficient solutions may have on existing centralised sewer systems is still limited one of these effects is the accumulation of solids in sewer pipes predicting these effects requires setting up and simulating complex detailed hydraulic sewer network models often precise details of the sewer network layout and diurnal patterns of the wastewater flows are not available limiting the applicability of using model predictions for such phenomena in this study the applicability of supervised machine learning ml algorithms for the development of a simplified surrogate model to predict solid accumulation in sewer pipes was investigated a large number of highly variable sewer networks were synthetically generated and used to produce results that can be generalizable within the limitations of the current study a hydrodynamic sewer model was set up and simulated for each synthetic sewer network and various scenarios in which different water efficient solutions were considered simulation results indicated that the most impacts are expected to occur in the upstream part of the sewer networks and that with 50 reduction in waste water flows 3 20 more pipes are expected to accumulate solids it was further found that ml algorithms can be used to successfully predict locations of solids accumulation in sewer pipes without using hydrodynamic models a simple tool based on the findings of this study sparing the need to conduct complex hydraulic simulations was developed it allows the user to enter a set of pipe characteristics and the proportion of flow that is reduced due to the implementation of water efficient solutions and it predicts whether the pipe will accumulate solids or not the study results and the proposed ml algorithms can support the implementation of optimal water efficient solutions that will promote designing and managing the water sensitive cities of the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords linear regression neural networks random forest sediments synthetic sewer networks water saving 1 introduction centralised wastewater systems are widely applied in most well developed urban areas however they may not always provide the most sustainable urban drainage solutions attractive decentralised water efficient solutions dwes to replace or complement the existing centralised systems separate or combined 1 1 drainage systems can be classified as separate or combined the first type conveys wastewater and the second collects and transports both wastewater and stormwater are being widely promoted and developed e g larsen et al 2016 centralised systems convey wastewater over long distances to centralised wastewater treatment plants instead decentralised systems are characterised by localised spatially distributed water treatment and reuse solutions the implementation of dwes is therefore expected to significantly contribute to the sustainability of the urban water cycle optimal transition from the current business as usual practice to a more sustainable urban water system can nevertheless only be achieved when the negative influence it may have on the operation and maintenance of existing centralised systems is considered of the expected and concerning effects of such a transition are the accumulation of solids in sewers and their negative contribution to sewer blockages loss of hydraulic capacity and the formation of toxic gases such as hydrogen sulphide butler and davies 2010 model predictions of sewer pipe hazards such as those expected from the implementation of dwes require setting up and simulating detailed hydraulic sewer models e g butler and davies 2010 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 very often details of the network layout and diurnal patterns of the flows are not available limiting the applicability of these models to predict these hazards supervised machine learning ml algorithms can be used to develop simplified models to be used for various sewer related predictions while sparing the need to conduct complex simulations e g jiang et al 2016 hu et al 2018 zounemat kermani et al 2020 in this study the applicability of ml algorithms to predict solids accumulation in sewers due to the implementation of dwes was investigated dwes may include measures such as greywater reuse full on site domestic wastewater treatment sewer mining and water efficient domestic appliances including water efficient toilets grant et al 2012 in many situations dwes may provide better solutions than existing centralised options e g marlow et al 2013 these situations include cases in which flexibility of the systems is desired due to anticipated changes in climate land use or demography schlör et al 2009 target 155 campaign 2022 in addition dwes with lower investment costs may be preferable to expensive rehabilitation of existing centralised systems eggimann et al 2015 2016 therefore novel dwes technologies are being extensively promoted e g guo and englehardt 2015 larsen et al 2016 our understanding of the effects of implementing dwes especially on large scales on the operation and maintenance of centralised systems is still rudimentary therefore reaching comprehensive conclusions of transition effects and of implementing such a transition on a large scale remains challenging hence investigating transition feasibility and mitigating transition problems is a global challenge gaining the attention of academic and professional circles e g mattsoon et al 2015 penn et al 2012 research shows that decreasing wastewater quantity in pipes may cause solids accumulations in sewer pipes penn et al 2013 2017a marleni et al 2015 mattsoon et al 2015 cook et al 2018 murali et al 2021 these sediments may cause the formation of blockages loss of hydraulic capacity and they can store pollutants and enhance the formation of hydrogen sulphide h2s butler and davies 2010 liu et al 2015 shypanski 2018 the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the sewers is associated with health related effects odour problems and concrete and metal corrosion hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 the limitation of these studies is that they are based on a limited number of sewer networks making their findings case specific using highly variable synthetically generated sewer networks as performed in this study allows capturing the high variability within these networks and making more general conclusions the use of synthetically generated sewer networks for assessing the impact of transition from centralised to decentralised water solutions on existing infrastructure was previously demonstrated by sitzenfrei et al 2013 however only alpine region cities characterized by flat valleys and combined sewer systems were considered in their study in this study separate and highly variable networks with a larger range in slopes were generated it enabled to explore the negative impacts of widespread and systematic implementation of dwes on entire separate sewer systems in order to investigate whether a sewer pipe will accumulate solids detailed pipe flow conditions are usually required to evaluate the impact of the flow changes on a specific pipe flow conditions information about entire network is also needed this is because pipes are interconnected and flows are affected from upstream and downstream flows one option to investigate these impacts is to have real sewer flow measurements which is usually not possible since placing sensors to cover the entire sewer network is complex and extremely expensive and time consuming an alternative to this is to set up hydrologic models that require detailed data about the sewer network layout and on the water usage patterns which are many times difficult to obtain finally ml algorithms can be used to develop a simplified surrogate system of the hydraulic model to circumvent the need of detailed information for setting up the hydraulic models ml algorithms enable automated analytical model building based on sampled data known as training data this allows to make predictions on new unseen samples these algorithms are used in a wide range of applications such as email filtering data mining and computer vision various studies have shown the applicability of using ml algorithms in the field of sewer systems in caradot et al 2018 several statistical and ml models were applied for detecting sewer pipes in poor maintenance condition the ml models provided 95 and 67 accuracy for fault detection on network and pipe level respectively mohammadi et al 2020 demonstrated the use of gradient boosting trees for predictive maintenance of sewer pipes providing an accuracy of 87 other successful implementation included using ml algorithms for predicting flows in combined sewers hu et al 2018 corrosion in concrete jiang et al 2016 zounemat kermani et al 2020 and sewer overflows zhang et al 2018 similar to the presented work ebtehaj and bonakdari 2013 evaluated the reliability of existing models predicting sediments transport using artificial neural networks they trained ml on samples obtained from laboratory experiments conducted on a single pipe however the data set was very limited 125 samples which is a crucial limitation for ml applications a small data set could not represent the high variability in sewer networks which is instead represented in our study 196 878 samples with a wide range of features further due to the influence sewer pipe conditions have on the flows of their interconnected pipes in the network the effects of dwes implementation can only be evaluated while the entire sewer system is considered and hence data from one sewer pipe as utilised in ebtehaj and bonakdari 2013 is not sufficient for the case study presented in this paper in this work three ml algorithms were tested in order to develop a model to identify sewer pipes prone to accumulate solids the predictions can be conducted for the current situation where no changes in wastewater flow patterns are expected as well as for future scenarios where wastewater flows may be reduced due to water saving measures the significance of this study is that the ml algorithms spare the need for detailed information and complex hydraulic simulations to the best of our knowledge no previous attempt has been conducted so far to train the ml algorithms a large number of highly variable synthetic sewer networks were generated using drainnetgen muranho et al 2016 for each of the generate networks a hydrodynamic sewer model integrating detailed stochastically generated water usage patterns was set up and used to simulate various scenarios of dwes implementation after the training step the three ml algorithms were tested on unseen data of different networks with different characteristics including also extreme data which were networks with expected high proportions of pipes accumulating solids based on the simulation results the sewer network characteristics more conducive to solids accumulation due to the implementation of dwes were identified the features used by the ml algorithms include design parameters of the network features obtained from hydraulic simulations and the detailed water usage patterns which are usually difficult to obtain were not used the algorithms performance was analysed finally the ml algorithms were examined to what extent they can be simplified while maintaining a satisfying prediction accuracy to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method a simple tool 2 2 link to tool https bit ly app solids accumulation sewer pipes was developed to predict if the sewer pipes accumulate solids or not in order to obtain the prediction one only needs to add the properties of a pipe the tool does not need to be re trained as long as the characteristics of the pipe and of the network fall within the range of the networks examined which covers a wide range of the characteristic s values 2 methods 2 1 generating synthetic sewer networks the synthetic separate sewer networks were generated using drainnetgen muranho et al 2016 the network generation process in drainnetgen starts by defining the height and width of a rectangular area that represents the catchment or domain area then the number of nodes the range of pipe lengths and the range of pipe slopes are defined the user chooses one of four general average diurnal water usage patterns population size per capita demand and wastewater inflow factor i e proportion of the water usage discharged as wastewater based on these user defined parameters the software automatically assigns suitable pipe diameters in this study we used patterns representing high flow peaks this corresponds to patterns that are discharged into sewers before they attenuate as they flow downstream butler and davies 2010 2 2 hydraulic simulations the hydraulic simulations conducted in this study were performed using the us epa swmm rossman 2004 usepa website the dynamic wave routing that solves the complete one dimensional saint venant flow differential equations was used detailed properties of sewer flows including flows velocities and water depths allowed diurnal patterns of shear stress to be calculated and locations of solids accumulations to be derived 2 3 stochastic inflow inputs to the model wastewater flows discharged from single homes are highly variable therefore their representation by an average diurnal pattern does not sufficiently represent real world conditions moreover the flows in sewer pipes especially in those located upstream in the catchment are characterised by high peaks that become smoothed by the average patterns these peaks influence significantly the movement of solids and hence should be represented by the simulated flows therefore the average diurnal wastewater patterns implemented in drainnetgen to assign pipe diameters was replaced by stochastically generated diurnal patterns of flows discharged from single households these were derived from a stochastic wastewater generator penn et al 2017b an israeli dataset of an end use individual domestic appliances water usage measurement campaign shteynberg 2015 was used as input data to the generator the generator considers dependencies between household size and water consumption in house water use events and the nonlinear dependencies between household size and the variations in water usage patterns and quantities the flows for each household were generated by a sampling procedure from the data set the average wastewater discharge was 123 l pe d patterns were generated for the base scenario in which no changes in flows were made diurnal input patterns with reduced flows were derived by modifying these base scenario patterns as described below 2 4 scenarios simulated eleven scenarios were simulated the scenarios were based on available measures for water savings together with future potential scenarios which include a range of hardly any up to full or almost full domestic wastewater reuse current available measures may include greywater i e wastewater discharged from showers and washbasins reuse for toilet flushing and garden irrigation which save up to 40 water consumption penn et al 2012 it may further include vacuum toilets and water saving showers which can result in 90 saving of their water usage e g eventcubes 2022 orbital systems 2022 respectively and if both are implemented up to 50 of the total domestic water consumption can be saved dauber 2011 scenario 1 was assigned as the base scenario in which no dwes were implemented i e flows are not modified in scenarios 2 6 the flows were reduced by 10 30 50 70 and 90 of the total daily discharge the reduction was distributed uniformly across the day and attributed to all the houses in the catchment these scenarios enabled an assessment of the performance of the system without considering specific transition technologies implementing greywater reuse for toilet flushing and garden irrigation does not distribute reduction of wastewater flows evenly throughout the day but instead impacts peak usage penn et al 2012 to mimic such a phenomenon the peaks were reduced in addition to the even reduction of the daily pattern first the n highest peaks in one simulation day were detected then their value was reduced to that of the lowest of these peaks the value of n was different for each scenario and equalled the appropriate percentage of reduction in flow this procedure enabled to maintain a similar overall daily reduction in flows of 12 9 34 3 54 5 73 7 91 6 of the total daily flow in scenarios 7 11 respectively 2 5 evaluation of the variability of the generated synthetic sewer networks 117 highly variable synthetic separate sewer networks were generated using drainnetgen an example of four networks is presented in fig 1 these were examined for their applicability by ensuring that the percentage of pipes accumulating solids in the base scenario i e when no dwes were implemented were kept below 20 in most networks it was below 10 however in the extreme cases of low residents densities and low slopes it was only possible to generate networks with up to 20 of pipes accumulating solids this situation represents real life conditions as sewer systems are never perfectly designed and solids accumulate causing loss of hydraulic capacity and in extreme cases blockages this information was collected from interviews of sewer operators in israel based on empirical knowledge various parameters were used to obtain variability in the network s characteristics these include resident s density of 4000 15 000 and 23 000 residents km2 representing densities of cities in developed countries with a well established centralised sewer system such as zurich tel aviv and paris respectively three ranges of slopes were considered when designing the sewer networks 0 3 3 typical slopes 5 10 high slopes to allow investigation of extreme slope cases and 0 3 10 to cover the full range large and small networks differentiated by the number of pipes in the network networks with 50 150 and 300 were also included in the study all networks covered an area of 2 7 km2 and varied in their aspect ratios which is the ratio between the height and width of the domain rectangle the aspect ratios implemented were between 0 13 and 7 5 the 117 networks generated comprised of various combinations of the above mentioned characteristics the precise combinations are presented in table 1 where almost all the networks in the table were generated for all three densities described above analysis of the generated networks variability was performed using three comparative parameters taken from graph theory shreve stream order so shreve 1966 indicating the links level of branching flow paths fp indicating the length of the paths from the most upstream pipes to the network s outlet and betweenness centrality bc freeman 1977 a measure of centrality in a graph based on shortest paths centrality is graph based measures indicating the importance of various types of elements corresponding to the elements position in the graph borgatti 2005 these three comparative parameters are expected to affect the flows in the system and hence also solids transport networks with the same density slope range and number of pipes were compared based on these parameters networks with varying values of these characteristics i e density slope range and number of pipes were not compared based on these comparative parameters i e so and fp this is since these characteristics were intentionally chosen to be significantly different and as they highly influence the flows and hence also solids movement in the pipes no additional variability test was needed 2 6 inference of solids accumulation in the pipes a handful of models for predicting solids transport processes have been previously developed e g ashley et al 2004 butler and davies 2010 penn et al 2018 these processes are highly affected by the flow conditions physical and chemical characteristics of sewer solids and the geometric structure of sewer systems the high variability of these characteristics renders the precise description of solid processes challenging and many of the existing models suffer from high uncertainties ashley et al 2004 butler and davies 2010 schellart et al 2010 murali et al 2019 therefore predicting the exact transport processes transport disintegration consolidation with various solids and stagnation of solids in sewers remains uncertain a more general approach using a single critical value bed shear stress τ was hence implemented to determine whether a pipe accumulates solids or not 2 pa was considered as the critical shear stress as it is a typical value used to ensure proper wash off of solids accumulating in sewer pipes vongvisessomjai et al 2010 by using this general criterion the solids characteristics e g size water content etc which are highly variable and mostly unknown do not need to be taken into consideration the sensitivity of the model to this critical value was examined by calculating the proportion of pipes accumulating solids for a range of critical shear stress values between 1 and 3 pa diurnal patterns of shear stress in the pipes were derived from the hydrodynamic simulations of the flows by applying eqs 1 3 a pipe was categorized as a solid accumulating pipe if the shear stress did not reach the critical shear stress value 1 τ ρ g r h s where τ bed shear stress pa ρ density of water 1000 kg m3 g gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 r h hydraulic radius m s slope m m the slope in eq 1 is the friction slope nevertheless the dynamic wave routing approach which was implemented in swmm to solve the complete st venant flow equations shows that in regular separate sewer pipes without storage pumps or pressurised pipes the friction slope hardly changes along the day and is relatively similar to the pipe slope this trend enhances with the reduction in flows supplementary information therefore for modelling simplification the pipe slope was used it should be emphasised that these two slopes are equal in uniform flows which can be solved using the more simplified kinematic wave routing in swmm nevertheless only the dynamic wave routing approach allows predictions of attenuation of the flow s peaks these peaks significantly affect predictions of solids accumulation since the peak flows are responsible for the solid s movement therefore a more detailed dynamic wave routing approach was required the hydraulic radius in eq 1 was derived using eq 2 2 r h a p r 2 θ s i n s i n θ 2 r θ d 4 θ s i n θ θ where a cross sectional area of the pipe m2 p wetted parameter m r pipe radius m d pipe diameter m θ function of pipe radius and water depth was derived using eq 3 3 θ 2 c o s 1 r d r where d water depth m 2 7 ml algorithms to identify sewer pipes prone to solids accumulation supervised ml algorithms use a training data set d x i y i i 1 n consisting of n data records where x i x d is a data sample represented as a d dimensional feature vector and y i y is the provided label for it the elements of x i are referred to as features during training of the model the task is to learn a function f x y to predict the response for every new unseen data sample in this study we built a surrogate of the hydraulic model by training ml regression algorithms to predict the shear stress in a sewer pipe pipes prone to accumulate solids were classified based on these predictions the features used for training and testing the algorithms were design characteristics of the pipe in regression applications y i can acquire a continuous quantity for each sample x i in this study this output consists of the maximum diurnal shear stress value for each sample pipe where a low shear stress τ 2 p a indicates accumulation and a high shear stress τ 2 p a indicates no accumulation of solids with the implementation of regression algorithms non physically feasible predictions of y i 0 can occur physics informed algorithms in which the shear stress is constrained to be positive do not exist therefore a post processing algorithm was applied converting every y i 0 to y i 0 the hydraulic simulation data indicating the locations prone to solids accumulation were used to train and test the ml algorithms the simulated data d 196 887 16 comprised 196 878 data samples i e the pipes from all the networks and the scenarios simulated and 16 features the 16 columns included 15 features and one label y i for each sample y i indicating the shear stress value the features used included design parameters of the network as well as centrality features of each node obtained from graph theory table 2 each pipe was attributed the value of the centrality feature of its upstream node flow paths which was used to evaluate the networks variability was not used as a feature since it is a network attribute and not pipe specific and has various values for each network the data were split into two sub sets 80 were used for training and validating the algorithms and the remaining unseen 20 for testing networks from which data were derived for training were not used to generate data for testing an additional test data set was simulated to include newly generated sewer networks identified as most extreme i e those in which the highest number of accumulating pipes were identified those networks had population densities of 4000 15 000 and 23 000 residents km2 and a range of slope of 0 3 3 which represents also the typical and most common slopes in sewer networks the aspect ratio of these systems was 1 fifteen networks with these characteristics were generated this new test set will be referred to as extreme test each network was simulated for all 11 scenarios resulting in a data set of 24 750 samples the algorithms which were trained only on the original data set were then also tested on this new extreme data set to evaluate their generalisation capabilities in predicting more extreme situations three regression algorithms were applied to predict the shear stress in each pipe i linear regression lr fits a linear model to minimize the error between the observed labels in the data set and the predictions of the linear approximation model ii random forest rf is an ensemble approach based on decision trees which are used repeatedly to split the input data in a top down approach with the intent to separate samples with different labels from each other the predicted output is the mean prediction of all the trees and iii neural network nn this algorithm transforms the input data into the predicted value through a complex network of non linear unit operations neurons nns are extremely flexible due to the ability to use large numbers of layers between data samples and predictions each including many neurons shalev shwarz and ben david 2014 these algorithms present an incremental order of their complexity the correlation between the algorithms complexity and prediction accuracy was examined the regression predictions were then used for identifying whether pipes will accumulate solids or not to do so a cut off threshold value t was selected such that pipes with predicted outputs y t were classified as accumulating and pipes with y t were classified as non accumulating the computation and effects of the cut off t on the models performance are explained in the next section 2 8 evaluation of prediction algorithms performance the regression algorithms accuracy was evaluated based on r squared the squared correlation between the observed outcome values and the predicted values by the algorithm and mean absolute error mae the average absolute difference between observed and predicted outcomes james et al 2013 classification metric were used to evaluate the algorithms capability of identifying pipes with accumulating solids these include f1 score and accuracy which are commonly used in classification applications shalev shwarz and ben david 2014 for f1 score calculations the following are used true positives tp the number of correctly identified pipes accumulating solids true negatives tn the number of correctly classified pipes non accumulating solids false negatives fn and false positives fp the number of incorrectly classified pipes non accumulating and accumulating solids respectively accordingly the following measures can be computed following eqs 4 and 5 shalev shwarz and ben david 2014 4 p r e c i s i o n tp tp fp 5 r e c a l l tp tp fn in this study the data is unbalanced i e the number of pipes accumulating solids is substantially lower than the pipes not accumulating solids varying from 10 to 50 of pipes accumulating solids depending on the scenario simulated commonly in these unbalanced cases as precision increases recall decreases this is called the precision recall trade off for this reason f1 score a popular score used to measure algorithm performance for unbalanced problems was also included as a performance metric this score is computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall eq 6 6 f 1 2 p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l in contrast to standard evaluation metrics e g accuracy defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions this allows us to better evaluate the performance of the algorithms in detecting problematic although rare accumulating pipes which can negatively affect the operation of the system for comparison the algorithms were also evaluated based on the accuracy metric note that the identification of pipes accumulating solids or not was based on the cut off value t separating the regression predictions of the shear stress zachary et al 2014 in tasks having a significant class imbalance as it is in this study the cut off value should be tuned in order to locate its optimal value such tuning will impact the precision and recall values and it should therefore depend on the performance required in this case the optimum cut off value providing the maximum f1 score on the validation data was selected it was found by iteratively calculating the f1 score for a range of cut off values between 1 and 3 pa in intervals of 0 01 pa then the cut off value providing the best f1 score on the validation data was chosen note that the cut off value has the sole purpose of separating the ml predictions into pipes accumulating solids and not this has a different meaning than the critical shear stress of 2 pa used in the hydrodynamic simulation however in a perfect prediction model the cut off value will be exactly as the critical value implemented in the simulations it is clear that using a low or virtually zero cut off value will result in all predicted pipes accumulating solids and therefore a high recall and low precision vice versa for a high cut off value it is therefore necessary to optimise such choice to decrease fp and fn while increasing tp the identification of pipes accumulating solids will be also presented using a confusing matrix zachary et al 2014 such a matrix is a specific table layout that allows visualisation of the performance of predictive algorithms on a set of test data for which the true values are known each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class the confusion matrix will be presented in the results as mentioned in section 2 6 a critical shear stress of 2 pa for classifying pipes prone to solids accumulation may have some uncertainties therefore a sensitivity analysis of the algorithm s predictions to various values of critical shear stress was examined to do so based on the regression predictions of the shear stress classification of pipes in which solids will accumulate was done for a range of critical shear stresses of 1 3 pa the accuracy and f1 score classification metrics were calculated for each critical shear stress and were used to evaluate the accuracy of these classifications evaluation of the features correlation and importance for predicting solids accumulation in sewer pipes the correlation of the features and their correlation to the target shear stress was examined by the pearson correlation test rodgers and nicewander 1988 the pearson correlation coefficient of two variables is the ratio between the covariance of the two variables and the product of their standard deviation eq 7 7 ρ x y c o v x y σ x σ y where cov x y is the covariance of the variables x and y σ x σ y are the standard deviations of variables x and y respectively the importance of the features was analysed using permutation tests altmann et al 2010 in this case the algorithm s performance is evaluated while randomly permuting the features used during training the mean decrease in performance gives an indication to the feature s importance it should be emphasised that permutation importance does not reflect the intrinsic predictive value of a feature by itself but how important this feature is for a particular algorithm additionally it was investigated to which extent the number of features can be reduced while keeping a satisfactory model performance as mentioned above all features rely on the design of the network and do not require hydraulic simulations the features were therefore arranged into three classes based on their estimated availability table 3 for example a pipe diameter is a relatively available value and is therefore assigned to class 1 however the pipe slope may be difficult to achieve due to lack of data or expected changes of the slope over the years therefore the pipe slope is assigned to class 3 data on slopes are often not available and the slope is expected to highly influence solids movement eq 1 therefore an additional feature range of slope was added the range of slope allows to assign an estimated value instead of the exact value estimation of the range of slope can be done based on the topology for example or based on a survey of only a selection of pipes in the surrounding area the following ranges of slope percentages were defined 0 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 5 5 10 since most of the slopes are between 0 3 and 3 in this range smaller ranges were defined the new attributed slope for each pipe was the average of the range which contains its original slope the range of slope is assigned to class 2 the ml algorithms performance were examined when trained on a combination of such features a full model was defined as the one trained using features belonging to classes 1 and 3 all features a simplified model was generated using classes 1 and 2 finally the simplest model used class 1 only features which are the easiest to obtain 3 results in this section the hydrodynamic simulated data are presented and analysed to indicate the locations in sewer networks more prone to accumulate solids these are analysed for the current situation and future scenarios in which dwes are implemented the applicability of implementing ml for predicting solids accumulation due to the implementation of dwes are evaluated and the features most important for models predictions are identified finally the plausibility of using ml algorithms for predicting solids accumulation in sewer pipes due to the implementation of dwes is examined in section 2 of the supplementary information a detailed description of the variability of the synthetic sewer networks generated is presented the networks were found to be significantly different with respect to slopes stream order flow paths betweenness centrality and population density 3 1 analysis of dwes scenarios and pipe properties contributing to solids accumulation in sewer networks with typical ranges of slopes of 0 3 3 50 reduction in wastewater flows results in a minimum of 7 maximum of 49 and median of 23 of all the pipes in the network accumulating solids for all stream orders an increase of 3 20 from the base scenario i e when dwes are not implemented was characterised by a minimum of 4 maximum of 19 and median of 12 of pipes accumulating solids fig 2 a b these results follow previous studies findings conducted on a limited number of case studies e g penn and maurer 2021 examination of the full range of slopes of 0 3 10 revealed that the percentage of pipes accumulating solids was significantly reduced in comparison to the range 0 3 3 fig 2b most of the accumulating pipes were found to be located upstream i e with low stream order values fig 7 in the supplementary information this is explained as the flows in these locations are relatively low due to the low number of wastewater contributors and hence the shear stress does not reach the critical value of 2 pa it was further observed that reduction in the flow peak did not significantly affect the results fig 6 in the supplementary information sensitivity analysis of the proportion of pipes accumulating solids for a range of critical shear stresses is presented in fig 3 a b it can be observed that with a higher reduction in flows the value of the critical shear stress influences more the proportion of pipes accumulating solids a higher difference was observed for pipes with a slopes range of 0 3 3 for both ranges of slopes of 0 3 10 and of 0 3 3 the median changed by 0 2 0 5 and by 0 07 0 3 respectively 3 2 ml predictions accuracy from the three regression ml algorithms investigated the rf algorithm presented the highest shear stress prediction accuracy and the lr the lowest the relatively simple lr algorithm showed a poor performance with r2 of 0 77 and mae of 3 62 pa fig 4 a table 4 note that r2 close to 1 as in the case of the three algorithms examined shows that the predictions approximate the ground truth data points while a low mae being the average magnitude of the errors in the test set is also desirable géron 2019 james et al 2013 in this case the ground truth data points are the shear stresses derived from the hydrodynamic simulations r2 of 0 96 and mae of 1 25 pa were observed for the rf fig 4b table 4 the nn regressor presented a very similar prediction accuracy of r2 of 0 96 and mae of 1 25 pa fig 4c table 4 it can further be observed in fig 4 that most of the test data points fall within the range of shear stresses of up to 10 pa 66 of the data points a closer observation around this range shows that the rf algorithm provided the best predictions and lowest scattering around the expected values fig 5 with more accurate predictions around the threshold value of 2 pa r2 of 1 2 0 75 0 74 and mae of 3 02 0 76 0 86 for the lr rf and nn respectively when these measures were derived from analysing the data up to 10 pa therefore even though the rf and nn produced similar values for the regression metric the rf algorithm enables slightly more accurate identification of pipes prone to accumulate solids presented in the next paragraph these results contradict the initial assumption that the prediction accuracy increases with model complexity the algorithms also provided high accuracies when identifying pipes prone to accumulation or not with classification accuracy performance in the same order as presented by the regression metric i e r2 and mae where the rf showed the highest performance accuracy and lr the lowest the results are presented in the form of a confusion matrix in fig 6 where the top left corner cell is the tn the bottom right is tp the top right corner is fp and the bottom left corner is fn the values of the classification metric were 0 92 0 97 and 0 95 for the accuracy and f1 score were 0 84 0 93 0 91 for the lr rf nn respectively table 4 the optimum cut off value for which the maximum f1 score was obtained is presented in table 4 it can be observed that the cut off value was closer to the real critical value of shear stress from which solids will tend to accumulate 2 pa as the prediction accuracy of the algorithm increases the rf regression algorithm which showed the best prediction accuracy and average complexity was further tested on the new data set of extreme cases with a typical range of slopes of 0 3 3 and a large proportion of pipes accumulating solids it showed an r2 of 0 9 table 5 and mae of 1 48 pa not presented as for the identification of pipes accumulating solids the rf algorithm showed high prediction accuracy with an f1 score of 0 93 and accuracy of 0 94 when it was both trained and tested on the extended extreme data its f1 score and prediction accuracy slightly decreased to 0 92 and 0 93 respectively table 5 the sensitivity analysis of the algorithms to the critical shear stress is presented in fig 7 it can be seen that with an increase in the critical shear stress the proportion of the major class decreases this is since with higher critical values more pipes will be classified as accumulating solids reduction in the size of the major class affects the accuracy and f1 score with a slight decrease and increase respectively the accuracy decreased by 0 025 0 028 0 025 and the f1 score increased by 0 12 0 021 0 066 for the lr rf and nn respectively for a shear stress range of 1 3 pa the accuracy decreases since as the major class decreases the potential for the model to predict the major class correctly decreases the f1 score on the other hand increases since it is more sensitive to the size of the minor class a higher quality model is that in which the f1 score is not affected by the critical value fig 7 a and b reveals that the rf proved to be the best classifier the optimum cut off of an ideal classifier will be close to the critical shear stress as can be seen in fig 7c this was observed for the rf and nn algorithms 3 3 analysis of features correlation and importance the correlation matrix in fig 8 shows that features linked to the number of residents discharging wastewater were observed to be relatively highly correlated with a pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 74 number of residents pipes diameter and stream order going downstream in the network the cumulative number of residents increases increasing the flows and hence also the pipes diameters by definition the stream order also raises in pipes located downstream the shear stress is positively highly correlated with pipes residents and slope both affecting its value the effect of the slope is clearly presented in eq 1 the number of residents affects the flows and hence also water depth which is also a variable in eq 1 current flow centrality is highly correlated with katz and closeness centrality pearson correlation coefficient of 0 8 and 0 87 respectively all centrality measures presented relatively low correlation with the shear stress pearson coefficient lower than 0 4 nevertheless their importance to model predictions was not negligible as presented in fig 9 and elaborated below the high correlation of the features is also observed in fig 9 here the features importance for the three regression algorithms for the three cases i e difficult medium and easy case are presented it can be observed that the most influencing feature receives the highest importance scale and its correlated features are assigned with less importance this is because in the permutation feature importance test correlated features are usually not selected as most important in all three models pipe slope and pipe residents were observed as most important strengthening the findings presented in fig 8 showing their high correlation to the shear stress in the medium and easy cases the slope was replaced with the range of slope in the medium case fig 9 ii and the importance of the stream order and diameter increased fig 9 ii and iii this is due to their high correlation to the number of residents which is not used in the medium and easy case flow proportion had a relatively high importance in all cases and models even though this feature had a relatively low correlation to the shear stress 0 32 fig 8 it got high importance due to its low correlation with the other features the centrality measures showed feature importance each case and algorithm had at least one centrality measure as an important feature most cases had two important centrality measures and some cases had three the second order centrality pipe which showed negative correlation to the shear stress and to most of the other features fig 8 was not found to be important to any of the tested algorithms in fig 10 the extent to which the algorithms can be simplified by reducing the number of features is presented the results demonstrate that removing the features most difficult to obtain i e slope and pipe residents reduces the algorithms prediction accuracy that is because these are also of the most important features as shown in fig 9 nevertheless the medium case in which the slopes are defined by a range which can more easily be evaluated than its actual value showed relatively good performance especially for the rf and nn algorithms interestingly when the data for training and for testing were obtained from the same networks the centrality features significantly increased the accuracy of the easy case of the rf algorithm the f1 score increased by 11 5 from 74 06 to 85 6 when compared to the case in which the centrality features were not used fig 8 supplementary information when the data for training and testing were obtained from different networks as done in all the analysis presented the increase in the algorithms performance was less substantial when comparing the cases in which the centrality features were used and not used fig 9 supplementary information 3 4 analysis of the applicability of ml algorithms for the prediction of solids accumulation due to the implementation of dwes the rf algorithm which showed the highest accuracy was further tested for its prediction accuracy for each dwes scenario separately fig 11 presents the distributions of the increase in proportion of pipes accumulating solids for each scenario compared to the base scenario a comparison between the distributions obtained from the hydraulic simulations with those obtained from the ml predictions are also presented some difference between both predictions can be observed though these are not large in fig 12 the accuracy and f1 score obtained from the rf predictions for each dwes scenario are presented it can be seen that the accuracy decreases with the increase in water saving i e with the decrease of wastewater flow this has to do with the imbalance of the training data i e the model is trained on more pipes which do not accumulate solids than those that do the f1 score is generally a better measure for evaluating ml algorithms predictions with unbalanced data the f1 score did not show a specific trend for the difficult case this is most probably since the f1 score was already high and hence it is less affected from changes in the distribution of the data i e in the quantity of pipes accumulating solids compared to those not accumulating in the medium and easy cases the f1 score increases with reduction of flows i e with the increase of the number of pipes accumulating solids when data are more balanced the increase in its value is more profound in the easy case we suspect that this is because in the easy case the sensitivity of the model to imbalanced data increases due to the reduction of number of features these measures were examined while using a cut off value of 2 08 pa which was the optimum value found for the rf table 4 4 discussion 4 1 dwes and network properties contributing to solids accumulation 117 synthetic sewer networks representing different characteristics were successfully generated using drainnetgen muranho et al 2016 the large number and the variability of the sewer networks used to produce the results presented in this study aimed at making this study generalizable it should be recalled that in this study one network was generated for each set of parameters defined during generation of the networks including range of slopes number of pipes population density size of the network and length of pipes it will also be interesting to examine in future studies the variability of a batch of networks generated with the same set of parameters in case this variability will be higher they can be used to cover a wider range of conditions for sewer related model predictions it was observed that with the implementation of dwes most of the pipes accumulating solids are located in the upstream parts of the networks and when the flows were reduced by 50 a significant proportion of pipes accumulating solids was observed this indicates that dwes should be mainly implemented in the downstream parts of the networks where flows are larger alternatively in new systems pipes can be built with higher slopes and smaller diameters increasing flow velocities and water depth and hence also the shear stresses responsible for the movement of the solids increasing sewer slopes should be considered while evaluating the trade offs between the costs associated with extra excavation and additional maintenance activities e g pipe cleaning and the benefits of water savings due to the implementation of dwes sensitivity analysis of the effects of the shear stress on models predictions showed that by changing the critical shear stress in a relatively wide range between 1 and 3 pa significant differences in the prediction of the proportion of pipes accumulating solids can occur it is important to mention that this range in critical shear stress is large when observing a lower range much closer to the typical value of 2 pa a much smaller difference in predictions was observed this range in predictions should be considered when implementation of dwes is desired this uncertainty needs further examinations while implementing more detailed solids transport models which need to be developed in the future 4 2 ml algorithms are able to predict sewer pipe solids accumulation it was found that ml algorithms can be used as surrogate systems of detailed hydraulic models to predict the pipes that are prone to accumulate solids due to the implementation of dwes the algorithms were tested on unseen data of different networks with different characteristics including also extreme data representing networks with expected high proportions of pipes accumulating solids the algorithms predictions accuracies were high also when a small number of sewer pipe features were used compared to the swmm model the ml model does not require as input the water depth the diurnal patterns of the flows and the length of the pipes these inputs are needed for simulation in swmm but are usually not known or difficult to be obtained additionally simulations in swmm require knowledge of not only the slope of a specific pipe but rather the slopes of all pipes in the network more specifically it is the invert elevation of all nodes in the network which accounts for the slopes this is since all pipes are interconnected and their properties affect the flows in the other pipes in the system in conclusion this means that the input to the swmm model requires diurnal patterns of the flows discharged to each junction specific location coordinates of each junction and their invert elevation and the diameters of the pipes by using the ml model fewer and more easily obtained features are required invert elevations which are usually difficult to obtain of all junctions are not needed but rather only of the specific pipes which we are examining or its slope in practice it is not the detailed layout of the system that is needed but only which pipes are connected and their connection order further in the medium case examined which showed high prediction accuracies a range of slope which is usually more easily obtained can be employed instead of the exact slope value of the pipe the time required for simulating one topology and one scenario was not substantially different between the hydrodynamic swmm model and the ml based model since it is relatively short in both types of models 15 s and 0 01 s for swmm and ml respectively the significance of the ml model is that it also saves time and resources required for setting up the detailed model required for swmm further the computational time of the hydrodynamic model will significantly scale up with the complexity of the model complexity will increase for example with the integration of more elaborated models for solids transport and biochemical processes this study is currently under development by co author penn on the other hand the prediction time of the ml model would stay almost unchanged these make the ml algorithms advantageous for implementation the random forest algorithm provided the highest prediction performance with accuracy values of 0 97 and f1 score of 0 93 in fact linear regression proved to be too simple for solving the problem at hand while the neural network algorithm being the most complex might require much more data to perform optimally such results might be due to the fact that random forest is less prone to overfitting also the advantage of random forest is that it has fewer hyperparameters to tune compared to complex models as neural networks liu et al 2013 additionally when the random forest algorithm was examined on a new unseen data set comprising a higher number of pipes with the potential to accumulate solids it also presented high prediction performance showing its generalisation capabilities on the prediction of extreme out of sample scenarios in this research negative shear stress predictions which are not physically feasible were replaced by zero further research is needed for the development of physics informed models that can consider the physical meaning of the shear stress sensitivity analysis showed that the value of the critical shear stress had some influence on models predictions accuracy this was mostly due to the fact that changing its value affects the size of the major class rf showed to be the least influenced it is noteworthy the use of a cut off to predict the accumulating and non accumulating pipes from the prediction results of the regression algorithms in tasks having a significant class imbalance as it is in this study the cut off is tuned in order to locate its optimal value such tuning impacts the precision and recall values and its tuning should depend on the preferable outcome or in other words which of the classifications should be predicted with higher accuracy specifically the cut off value is generally tuned based on the more expensive operation for example the operator can decide on the operation cut off depending on whether there is a higher preference for cleaning the system more frequently than needed because a pipe was erroneously identified as accumulating or for dealing with unpredicted blockages because a pipe was faultily identified as not accumulating in this study by optimizing the cut off to receive the highest f1 score possible the predictions will tend to be equally accurate for the pipes accumulating and not accumulating solids the most important features for predicting solids accumulation in pipes i e those directly influencing the shear stress were identified these include pipe residents and slope as they are also the features that are more difficult to obtain it was examined to what extent removing them would influence algorithms prediction accuracy a relatively good compromise was found in the medium stage where the slopes were clustered in a range and their precise value was not required using a random forest algorithm with these features can significantly reduce the complexity of running such investigations for evaluating the effects implementation of dwes may have on solids accumulation in sewer pipes a more detailed model could then be set up and used for the more sensitive locations 4 3 ml algorithms to predict solids accumulation due to the implementation of dwes the rf algorithm which showed the highest prediction accuracy was further tested to evaluate its prediction accuracy for each dwes scenario a clear increasing trend in the f1 score was observed for the medium case with the reduction in wastewater flows as a result of the implementation of dwes these findings strengthen the applicability of using the rf for predicting solids accumulation as a result of the implementation of dwes one practical contribution of this study is a simple web tool in which one can enter the properties of a pipe from a new network and obtain the prediction about whether the specific pipe will accumulate or not solids these pipe properties i e features include design features such as the pipes slope or range of slope in which the real slope is expected to be density of the population discharging wastewater into the network proportion of the flow to be reduced due to the implementation of dwes and graphbased measures which require the simple layout of the network i e which pipe is connected to which but not the its height slope and length hydraulic simulations are not required for the predictions and neither detailed water usage patterns which are mostly unknown the developed tool can be used to predict whether a pipe from a new network will accumulate solids without the need to retrain the model as long as the characteristics of the pipe and of the network fall within the range of the networks examined which cover a wide range of the characteristic s values as mentioned above the prediction tool can also be used to examine the impacts of reduced flows on a specific or several sewer pipes as mentioned above this requires that the characteristics of the pipe and of the network it belongs to fall within the ranges of characteristics examined in this study which based on the design of the study are wide 5 conclusions machine learning algorithms were found to successfully predict locations of solids accumulation in sewer pipes when dwes are implemented the features used for training the algorithms include only the design parameters of the network not including features obtained from hydraulic simulations further the detailed wastewater flows that are required by the hydrodynamic model and are usually unknown were not included in the features used by the ml algorithms a simplified tool that implements the findings of this study was also developed and can be used for simple and fast predictions of whether a sewer pipe will accumulate solids saving the need to set up a detailed hydraulic model and conduct hydraulic simulations the predictions can be made for the current situation and for future dwes scenarios the results found in this study are based on a large number of highly variable synthetic sewer networks covering a wide range of sewer pipes and network characteristics this aimed at obtaining results that can be generalised to multiple case studies the results showed that pipes prone to accumulate solids are located mainly upstream with a reduction of 50 of the flows 7 40 with a median of 23 of the pipes in a network would tend to accumulate solids a difference of 3 20 from the base scenario in which dwes are not implemented the proportion of pipes accumulating solids is affected by the value of the critical shear stress which can reach a significant difference of up to 0 5 in the extreme scenario of 90 reduction in flows when the critical shear stress ranges from 1 to 3 pa the rf algorithm accurately predicts pipes accumulating solids when dwes are implemented its predictive performance were r2 of 0 96 for regression of shear stress and f1 score of 0 93 for classification of accumulating pipes the rf was further found to be the least influenced by varying the value of the critical shear stress by 1 3 pa the most important features were found to be the accumulated number of residents discharging wastewater to the pipe the pipes slope and the scenario of implementing dwes a good compromise between simplifying the rf algorithm and its prediction accuracy was obtained by omitting the number of residents contributing wastewater and clustering the slopes into ranges the model is now based on data that is more easily available and it was shown that this does not compromise the predictions accuracy the rf algorithm was further observed to provide high prediction accuracies high f1 scores for each scenario of dwes implementation separately with an increase in its value as the flows are reduced for the medium and easy case strengthening the applicability of its implementation it is noteworthy that only synthetic data was considered in this study because the effects of implementation of dwes on a large scale make data collection almost impossible the developed approach can later be implemented on more sophisticated models including complex biochemical processes for the prediction of hydrogen sulphide and more detailed

16104,understanding the negative effects of widespread implementation of optimal water efficient solutions may have on existing centralised sewer systems is still limited one of these effects is the accumulation of solids in sewer pipes predicting these effects requires setting up and simulating complex detailed hydraulic sewer network models often precise details of the sewer network layout and diurnal patterns of the wastewater flows are not available limiting the applicability of using model predictions for such phenomena in this study the applicability of supervised machine learning ml algorithms for the development of a simplified surrogate model to predict solid accumulation in sewer pipes was investigated a large number of highly variable sewer networks were synthetically generated and used to produce results that can be generalizable within the limitations of the current study a hydrodynamic sewer model was set up and simulated for each synthetic sewer network and various scenarios in which different water efficient solutions were considered simulation results indicated that the most impacts are expected to occur in the upstream part of the sewer networks and that with 50 reduction in waste water flows 3 20 more pipes are expected to accumulate solids it was further found that ml algorithms can be used to successfully predict locations of solids accumulation in sewer pipes without using hydrodynamic models a simple tool based on the findings of this study sparing the need to conduct complex hydraulic simulations was developed it allows the user to enter a set of pipe characteristics and the proportion of flow that is reduced due to the implementation of water efficient solutions and it predicts whether the pipe will accumulate solids or not the study results and the proposed ml algorithms can support the implementation of optimal water efficient solutions that will promote designing and managing the water sensitive cities of the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords linear regression neural networks random forest sediments synthetic sewer networks water saving 1 introduction centralised wastewater systems are widely applied in most well developed urban areas however they may not always provide the most sustainable urban drainage solutions attractive decentralised water efficient solutions dwes to replace or complement the existing centralised systems separate or combined 1 1 drainage systems can be classified as separate or combined the first type conveys wastewater and the second collects and transports both wastewater and stormwater are being widely promoted and developed e g larsen et al 2016 centralised systems convey wastewater over long distances to centralised wastewater treatment plants instead decentralised systems are characterised by localised spatially distributed water treatment and reuse solutions the implementation of dwes is therefore expected to significantly contribute to the sustainability of the urban water cycle optimal transition from the current business as usual practice to a more sustainable urban water system can nevertheless only be achieved when the negative influence it may have on the operation and maintenance of existing centralised systems is considered of the expected and concerning effects of such a transition are the accumulation of solids in sewers and their negative contribution to sewer blockages loss of hydraulic capacity and the formation of toxic gases such as hydrogen sulphide butler and davies 2010 model predictions of sewer pipe hazards such as those expected from the implementation of dwes require setting up and simulating detailed hydraulic sewer models e g butler and davies 2010 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 very often details of the network layout and diurnal patterns of the flows are not available limiting the applicability of these models to predict these hazards supervised machine learning ml algorithms can be used to develop simplified models to be used for various sewer related predictions while sparing the need to conduct complex simulations e g jiang et al 2016 hu et al 2018 zounemat kermani et al 2020 in this study the applicability of ml algorithms to predict solids accumulation in sewers due to the implementation of dwes was investigated dwes may include measures such as greywater reuse full on site domestic wastewater treatment sewer mining and water efficient domestic appliances including water efficient toilets grant et al 2012 in many situations dwes may provide better solutions than existing centralised options e g marlow et al 2013 these situations include cases in which flexibility of the systems is desired due to anticipated changes in climate land use or demography schlör et al 2009 target 155 campaign 2022 in addition dwes with lower investment costs may be preferable to expensive rehabilitation of existing centralised systems eggimann et al 2015 2016 therefore novel dwes technologies are being extensively promoted e g guo and englehardt 2015 larsen et al 2016 our understanding of the effects of implementing dwes especially on large scales on the operation and maintenance of centralised systems is still rudimentary therefore reaching comprehensive conclusions of transition effects and of implementing such a transition on a large scale remains challenging hence investigating transition feasibility and mitigating transition problems is a global challenge gaining the attention of academic and professional circles e g mattsoon et al 2015 penn et al 2012 research shows that decreasing wastewater quantity in pipes may cause solids accumulations in sewer pipes penn et al 2013 2017a marleni et al 2015 mattsoon et al 2015 cook et al 2018 murali et al 2021 these sediments may cause the formation of blockages loss of hydraulic capacity and they can store pollutants and enhance the formation of hydrogen sulphide h2s butler and davies 2010 liu et al 2015 shypanski 2018 the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the sewers is associated with health related effects odour problems and concrete and metal corrosion hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 the limitation of these studies is that they are based on a limited number of sewer networks making their findings case specific using highly variable synthetically generated sewer networks as performed in this study allows capturing the high variability within these networks and making more general conclusions the use of synthetically generated sewer networks for assessing the impact of transition from centralised to decentralised water solutions on existing infrastructure was previously demonstrated by sitzenfrei et al 2013 however only alpine region cities characterized by flat valleys and combined sewer systems were considered in their study in this study separate and highly variable networks with a larger range in slopes were generated it enabled to explore the negative impacts of widespread and systematic implementation of dwes on entire separate sewer systems in order to investigate whether a sewer pipe will accumulate solids detailed pipe flow conditions are usually required to evaluate the impact of the flow changes on a specific pipe flow conditions information about entire network is also needed this is because pipes are interconnected and flows are affected from upstream and downstream flows one option to investigate these impacts is to have real sewer flow measurements which is usually not possible since placing sensors to cover the entire sewer network is complex and extremely expensive and time consuming an alternative to this is to set up hydrologic models that require detailed data about the sewer network layout and on the water usage patterns which are many times difficult to obtain finally ml algorithms can be used to develop a simplified surrogate system of the hydraulic model to circumvent the need of detailed information for setting up the hydraulic models ml algorithms enable automated analytical model building based on sampled data known as training data this allows to make predictions on new unseen samples these algorithms are used in a wide range of applications such as email filtering data mining and computer vision various studies have shown the applicability of using ml algorithms in the field of sewer systems in caradot et al 2018 several statistical and ml models were applied for detecting sewer pipes in poor maintenance condition the ml models provided 95 and 67 accuracy for fault detection on network and pipe level respectively mohammadi et al 2020 demonstrated the use of gradient boosting trees for predictive maintenance of sewer pipes providing an accuracy of 87 other successful implementation included using ml algorithms for predicting flows in combined sewers hu et al 2018 corrosion in concrete jiang et al 2016 zounemat kermani et al 2020 and sewer overflows zhang et al 2018 similar to the presented work ebtehaj and bonakdari 2013 evaluated the reliability of existing models predicting sediments transport using artificial neural networks they trained ml on samples obtained from laboratory experiments conducted on a single pipe however the data set was very limited 125 samples which is a crucial limitation for ml applications a small data set could not represent the high variability in sewer networks which is instead represented in our study 196 878 samples with a wide range of features further due to the influence sewer pipe conditions have on the flows of their interconnected pipes in the network the effects of dwes implementation can only be evaluated while the entire sewer system is considered and hence data from one sewer pipe as utilised in ebtehaj and bonakdari 2013 is not sufficient for the case study presented in this paper in this work three ml algorithms were tested in order to develop a model to identify sewer pipes prone to accumulate solids the predictions can be conducted for the current situation where no changes in wastewater flow patterns are expected as well as for future scenarios where wastewater flows may be reduced due to water saving measures the significance of this study is that the ml algorithms spare the need for detailed information and complex hydraulic simulations to the best of our knowledge no previous attempt has been conducted so far to train the ml algorithms a large number of highly variable synthetic sewer networks were generated using drainnetgen muranho et al 2016 for each of the generate networks a hydrodynamic sewer model integrating detailed stochastically generated water usage patterns was set up and used to simulate various scenarios of dwes implementation after the training step the three ml algorithms were tested on unseen data of different networks with different characteristics including also extreme data which were networks with expected high proportions of pipes accumulating solids based on the simulation results the sewer network characteristics more conducive to solids accumulation due to the implementation of dwes were identified the features used by the ml algorithms include design parameters of the network features obtained from hydraulic simulations and the detailed water usage patterns which are usually difficult to obtain were not used the algorithms performance was analysed finally the ml algorithms were examined to what extent they can be simplified while maintaining a satisfying prediction accuracy to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method a simple tool 2 2 link to tool https bit ly app solids accumulation sewer pipes was developed to predict if the sewer pipes accumulate solids or not in order to obtain the prediction one only needs to add the properties of a pipe the tool does not need to be re trained as long as the characteristics of the pipe and of the network fall within the range of the networks examined which covers a wide range of the characteristic s values 2 methods 2 1 generating synthetic sewer networks the synthetic separate sewer networks were generated using drainnetgen muranho et al 2016 the network generation process in drainnetgen starts by defining the height and width of a rectangular area that represents the catchment or domain area then the number of nodes the range of pipe lengths and the range of pipe slopes are defined the user chooses one of four general average diurnal water usage patterns population size per capita demand and wastewater inflow factor i e proportion of the water usage discharged as wastewater based on these user defined parameters the software automatically assigns suitable pipe diameters in this study we used patterns representing high flow peaks this corresponds to patterns that are discharged into sewers before they attenuate as they flow downstream butler and davies 2010 2 2 hydraulic simulations the hydraulic simulations conducted in this study were performed using the us epa swmm rossman 2004 usepa website the dynamic wave routing that solves the complete one dimensional saint venant flow differential equations was used detailed properties of sewer flows including flows velocities and water depths allowed diurnal patterns of shear stress to be calculated and locations of solids accumulations to be derived 2 3 stochastic inflow inputs to the model wastewater flows discharged from single homes are highly variable therefore their representation by an average diurnal pattern does not sufficiently represent real world conditions moreover the flows in sewer pipes especially in those located upstream in the catchment are characterised by high peaks that become smoothed by the average patterns these peaks influence significantly the movement of solids and hence should be represented by the simulated flows therefore the average diurnal wastewater patterns implemented in drainnetgen to assign pipe diameters was replaced by stochastically generated diurnal patterns of flows discharged from single households these were derived from a stochastic wastewater generator penn et al 2017b an israeli dataset of an end use individual domestic appliances water usage measurement campaign shteynberg 2015 was used as input data to the generator the generator considers dependencies between household size and water consumption in house water use events and the nonlinear dependencies between household size and the variations in water usage patterns and quantities the flows for each household were generated by a sampling procedure from the data set the average wastewater discharge was 123 l pe d patterns were generated for the base scenario in which no changes in flows were made diurnal input patterns with reduced flows were derived by modifying these base scenario patterns as described below 2 4 scenarios simulated eleven scenarios were simulated the scenarios were based on available measures for water savings together with future potential scenarios which include a range of hardly any up to full or almost full domestic wastewater reuse current available measures may include greywater i e wastewater discharged from showers and washbasins reuse for toilet flushing and garden irrigation which save up to 40 water consumption penn et al 2012 it may further include vacuum toilets and water saving showers which can result in 90 saving of their water usage e g eventcubes 2022 orbital systems 2022 respectively and if both are implemented up to 50 of the total domestic water consumption can be saved dauber 2011 scenario 1 was assigned as the base scenario in which no dwes were implemented i e flows are not modified in scenarios 2 6 the flows were reduced by 10 30 50 70 and 90 of the total daily discharge the reduction was distributed uniformly across the day and attributed to all the houses in the catchment these scenarios enabled an assessment of the performance of the system without considering specific transition technologies implementing greywater reuse for toilet flushing and garden irrigation does not distribute reduction of wastewater flows evenly throughout the day but instead impacts peak usage penn et al 2012 to mimic such a phenomenon the peaks were reduced in addition to the even reduction of the daily pattern first the n highest peaks in one simulation day were detected then their value was reduced to that of the lowest of these peaks the value of n was different for each scenario and equalled the appropriate percentage of reduction in flow this procedure enabled to maintain a similar overall daily reduction in flows of 12 9 34 3 54 5 73 7 91 6 of the total daily flow in scenarios 7 11 respectively 2 5 evaluation of the variability of the generated synthetic sewer networks 117 highly variable synthetic separate sewer networks were generated using drainnetgen an example of four networks is presented in fig 1 these were examined for their applicability by ensuring that the percentage of pipes accumulating solids in the base scenario i e when no dwes were implemented were kept below 20 in most networks it was below 10 however in the extreme cases of low residents densities and low slopes it was only possible to generate networks with up to 20 of pipes accumulating solids this situation represents real life conditions as sewer systems are never perfectly designed and solids accumulate causing loss of hydraulic capacity and in extreme cases blockages this information was collected from interviews of sewer operators in israel based on empirical knowledge various parameters were used to obtain variability in the network s characteristics these include resident s density of 4000 15 000 and 23 000 residents km2 representing densities of cities in developed countries with a well established centralised sewer system such as zurich tel aviv and paris respectively three ranges of slopes were considered when designing the sewer networks 0 3 3 typical slopes 5 10 high slopes to allow investigation of extreme slope cases and 0 3 10 to cover the full range large and small networks differentiated by the number of pipes in the network networks with 50 150 and 300 were also included in the study all networks covered an area of 2 7 km2 and varied in their aspect ratios which is the ratio between the height and width of the domain rectangle the aspect ratios implemented were between 0 13 and 7 5 the 117 networks generated comprised of various combinations of the above mentioned characteristics the precise combinations are presented in table 1 where almost all the networks in the table were generated for all three densities described above analysis of the generated networks variability was performed using three comparative parameters taken from graph theory shreve stream order so shreve 1966 indicating the links level of branching flow paths fp indicating the length of the paths from the most upstream pipes to the network s outlet and betweenness centrality bc freeman 1977 a measure of centrality in a graph based on shortest paths centrality is graph based measures indicating the importance of various types of elements corresponding to the elements position in the graph borgatti 2005 these three comparative parameters are expected to affect the flows in the system and hence also solids transport networks with the same density slope range and number of pipes were compared based on these parameters networks with varying values of these characteristics i e density slope range and number of pipes were not compared based on these comparative parameters i e so and fp this is since these characteristics were intentionally chosen to be significantly different and as they highly influence the flows and hence also solids movement in the pipes no additional variability test was needed 2 6 inference of solids accumulation in the pipes a handful of models for predicting solids transport processes have been previously developed e g ashley et al 2004 butler and davies 2010 penn et al 2018 these processes are highly affected by the flow conditions physical and chemical characteristics of sewer solids and the geometric structure of sewer systems the high variability of these characteristics renders the precise description of solid processes challenging and many of the existing models suffer from high uncertainties ashley et al 2004 butler and davies 2010 schellart et al 2010 murali et al 2019 therefore predicting the exact transport processes transport disintegration consolidation with various solids and stagnation of solids in sewers remains uncertain a more general approach using a single critical value bed shear stress τ was hence implemented to determine whether a pipe accumulates solids or not 2 pa was considered as the critical shear stress as it is a typical value used to ensure proper wash off of solids accumulating in sewer pipes vongvisessomjai et al 2010 by using this general criterion the solids characteristics e g size water content etc which are highly variable and mostly unknown do not need to be taken into consideration the sensitivity of the model to this critical value was examined by calculating the proportion of pipes accumulating solids for a range of critical shear stress values between 1 and 3 pa diurnal patterns of shear stress in the pipes were derived from the hydrodynamic simulations of the flows by applying eqs 1 3 a pipe was categorized as a solid accumulating pipe if the shear stress did not reach the critical shear stress value 1 τ ρ g r h s where τ bed shear stress pa ρ density of water 1000 kg m3 g gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 r h hydraulic radius m s slope m m the slope in eq 1 is the friction slope nevertheless the dynamic wave routing approach which was implemented in swmm to solve the complete st venant flow equations shows that in regular separate sewer pipes without storage pumps or pressurised pipes the friction slope hardly changes along the day and is relatively similar to the pipe slope this trend enhances with the reduction in flows supplementary information therefore for modelling simplification the pipe slope was used it should be emphasised that these two slopes are equal in uniform flows which can be solved using the more simplified kinematic wave routing in swmm nevertheless only the dynamic wave routing approach allows predictions of attenuation of the flow s peaks these peaks significantly affect predictions of solids accumulation since the peak flows are responsible for the solid s movement therefore a more detailed dynamic wave routing approach was required the hydraulic radius in eq 1 was derived using eq 2 2 r h a p r 2 θ s i n s i n θ 2 r θ d 4 θ s i n θ θ where a cross sectional area of the pipe m2 p wetted parameter m r pipe radius m d pipe diameter m θ function of pipe radius and water depth was derived using eq 3 3 θ 2 c o s

x i x d is a data sample represented as a d dimensional feature vector and y i y is the provided label for it the elements of x i are referred to as features during training of the model the task is to learn a function f x y to predict the response for every new unseen data sample in this study we built a surrogate of the hydraulic model by training ml regression algorithms to predict the shear stress in a sewer pipe pipes prone to accumulate solids were classified based on these predictions the features used for training and testing the algorithms were design characteristics of the pipe in regression applications y i can acquire a continuous quantity for each sample x i in this study this output consists of the maximum diurnal shear stress value for each sample pipe where a low shear stress τ 2 p a indicates accumulation and a high shear stress τ 2 p a indicates no accumulation of solids with the implementation of regression algorithms non physically feasible predictions of y i 0 can occur physics informed algorithms in which the shear stress is constrained to be positive do not exist therefore a post processing algorithm was applied converting every y i 0 to y i 0 the hydraulic simulation data indicating the locations prone to solids accumulation were used to train and test the ml algorithms the simulated data d 196 887 16 comprised 196 878 data samples i e the pipes from all the networks and the scenarios simulated and 16 features the 16 columns included 15 features and one label y i for each sample y i indicating the shear stress value the features used included design parameters of the network as well as centrality features of each node obtained from graph theory table 2 each pipe was attributed the value of the centrality feature of its upstream node flow paths which was used to evaluate the networks variability was not used as a feature since it is a network attribute and not pipe specific and has various values for each network the data were split into two sub sets 80 were used for training and validating the algorithms and the remaining unseen 20 for testing networks from which data were derived for training were not used to generate data for testing an additional test data set was simulated to include newly generated sewer networks identified as most extreme i e those in which the highest number of accumulating pipes were identified those networks had population densities of 4000 15 000 and 23 000 residents km2 and a range of slope of 0 3 3 which represents also the typical and most common slopes in sewer networks the aspect ratio of these systems was 1 fifteen networks with these characteristics were generated this new test set will be referred to as extreme test each network was simulated for all 11 scenarios resulting in a data set of 24 750 samples the algorithms which were trained only on the original data set were then also tested on this new extreme data set to evaluate their generalisation capabilities in predicting more extreme situations three regression algorithms were applied to predict the shear stress in each pipe i linear regression lr fits a linear model to minimize the error between the observed labels in the data set and the predictions of the linear approximation model ii random forest rf is an ensemble approach based on decision trees which are used repeatedly to split the input data in a top down approach with the intent to separate samples with different labels from each other the predicted output is the mean prediction of all the trees and iii neural network nn this algorithm transforms the input data into the predicted value through a complex network of non linear unit operations neurons nns are extremely flexible due to the ability to use large numbers of layers between data samples and predictions each including many neurons shalev shwarz and ben david 2014 these algorithms present an incremental order of their complexity the correlation between the algorithms complexity and prediction accuracy was examined the regression predictions were then used for identifying whether pipes will accumulate solids or not to do so a cut off threshold value t was selected such that pipes with predicted outputs y t were classified as accumulating and pipes with y t were classified as non accumulating the computation and effects of the cut off t on the models performance are explained in the next section 2 8 evaluation of prediction algorithms performance the regression algorithms accuracy was evaluated based on r squared the squared correlation between the observed outcome values and the predicted values by the algorithm and mean absolute error mae the average absolute difference between observed and predicted outcomes james et al 2013 classification metric were used to evaluate the algorithms capability of identifying pipes with accumulating solids these include f1 score and accuracy which are commonly used in classification applications shalev shwarz and ben david 2014 for f1 score calculations the following are used true positives tp the number of correctly identified pipes accumulating solids true negatives tn the number of correctly classified pipes non accumulating solids false negatives fn and false positives fp the number of incorrectly classified pipes non accumulating and accumulating solids respectively accordingly the following measures can be computed following eqs 4 and 5 shalev shwarz and ben david 2014 4 p r e c i s i o n tp tp fp 5 r e c a l l tp tp fn in this study the data is unbalanced i e the number of pipes accumulating solids is substantially lower than the pipes not accumulating solids varying from 10 to 50 of pipes accumulating solids depending on the scenario simulated commonly in these unbalanced cases as precision increases recall decreases this is called the precision recall trade off for this reason f1 score a popular score used to measure algorithm performance for unbalanced problems was also included as a performance metric this score is computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall eq 6 6 f 1 2 p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l in contrast to standard evaluation metrics e g accuracy defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions this allows us to better evaluate the performance of the algorithms in detecting problematic although rare accumulating pipes which can negatively affect the operation of the system for comparison the algorithms were also evaluated based on the accuracy metric note that the identification of pipes accumulating solids or not was based on the cut off value t separating the regression predictions of the shear stress zachary et al 2014 in tasks having a significant class imbalance as it is in this study the cut off value should be tuned in order to locate its optimal value such tuning will impact the precision and recall values and it should therefore depend on the performance required in this case the optimum cut off value providing the maximum f1 score on the validation data was selected it was found by iteratively calculating the f1 score for a range of cut off values between 1 and 3 pa in intervals of 0 01 pa then the cut off value providing the best f1 score on the validation data was chosen note that the cut off value has the sole purpose of separating the ml predictions into pipes accumulating solids and not this has a different meaning than the critical shear stress of 2 pa used in the hydrodynamic simulation however in a perfect prediction model the cut off value will be exactly as the critical value implemented in the simulations it is clear that using a low or virtually zero cut off value will result in all predicted pipes accumulating solids and therefore a high recall and low precision vice versa for a high cut off value it is therefore necessary to optimise such choice to decrease fp and fn while increasing tp the identification of pipes accumulating solids will be also presented using a confusing matrix zachary et al 2014 such a matrix is a specific table layout that allows visualisation of the performance of predictive algorithms on a set of test data for which the true values are known each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class the confusion matrix will be presented in the results as mentioned in section 2 6 a critical shear stress of 2 pa for classifying pipes prone to solids accumulation may have some uncertainties therefore a sensitivity analysis of the algorithm s predictions to various values of critical shear stress was examined to do so based on the regression predictions of the shear stress classification of pipes in which solids will accumulate was done for a range of critical shear stresses of 1 3 pa the accuracy and f1 score classification metrics were calculated for each critical shear stress and were used to evaluate the accuracy of these classifications evaluation of the features correlation and importance for predicting solids accumulation in sewer pipes the correlation of the features and their correlation to the target shear stress was examined by the pearson correlation test rodgers and nicewander 1988 the pearson correlation coefficient of two variables is the ratio between the covariance of the two variables and the product of their standard deviation eq 7 7 ρ x y c o v x y σ x σ y where cov x y is the covariance of the variables x and y σ x σ y are the standard deviations of variables x and y respectively the importance of the features was analysed using permutation tests altmann et al 2010 in this case the algorithm s performance is evaluated while randomly permuting the features used during training the mean decrease in performance gives an indication to the feature s importance it should be emphasised that permutation importance does not reflect the intrinsic predictive value of a feature by itself but how important this feature is for a particular algorithm additionally it was investigated to which extent the number of features can be reduced while keeping a satisfactory model performance as mentioned above all features rely on the design of the network and do not require hydraulic simulations the features were therefore arranged into three classes based on their estimated availability table 3 for example a pipe diameter is a relatively available value and is therefore assigned to class 1 however the pipe slope may be difficult to achieve due to lack of data or expected changes of the slope over the years therefore the pipe slope is assigned to class 3 data on slopes are often not available and the slope is expected to highly influence solids movement eq 1 therefore an additional feature range of slope was added the range of slope allows to assign an estimated value instead of the exact value estimation of the range of slope can be done based on the topology for example or based on a survey of only a selection of pipes in the surrounding area the following ranges of slope percentages were defined 0 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 5 5 10 since most of the slopes are between 0 3 and 3 in this range smaller ranges were defined the new attributed slope for each pipe was the average of the range which contains its original slope the range of slope is assigned to class 2 the ml algorithms performance were examined when trained on a combination of such features a full model was defined as the one trained using features belonging to classes 1 and 3 all features a simplified model was generated using classes 1 and 2 finally the simplest model used class 1 only features which are the easiest to obtain 3 results in this section the hydrodynamic simulated data are presented and analysed to indicate the locations in sewer networks more prone to accumulate solids these are analysed for the current situation and future scenarios in which dwes are implemented the applicability of implementing ml for predicting solids accumulation due to the implementation of dwes are evaluated and the features most important for models predictions are identified finally the plausibility of using ml algorithms for predicting solids accumulation in sewer pipes due to the implementation of dwes is examined in section 2 of the supplementary information a detailed description of the variability of the synthetic sewer networks generated is presented the networks were found to be significantly different with respect to slopes stream order flow paths betweenness centrality and population density 3 1 analysis of dwes scenarios and pipe properties contributing to solids accumulation in sewer networks with typical ranges of slopes of 0 3 3 50 reduction in wastewater flows results in a minimum of 7 maximum of 49 and median of 23 of all the pipes in the network accumulating solids for all stream orders an increase of 3 20 from the base scenario i e when dwes are not implemented was characterised by a minimum of 4 maximum of 19 and median of 12 of pipes accumulating solids fig 2 a b these results follow previous studies findings conducted on a limited number of case studies e g penn and maurer 2021 examination of the full range of slopes of 0 3 10 revealed that the percentage of pipes accumulating solids was significantly reduced in comparison to the range 0 3 3 fig 2b most of the accumulating pipes were found to be located upstream i e with low stream order values fig 7 in the supplementary information this is explained as the flows in these locations are relatively low due to the low number of wastewater contributors and hence the shear stress does not reach the critical value of 2 pa it was further observed that reduction in the flow peak did not significantly affect the results fig 6 in the supplementary information sensitivity analysis of the proportion of pipes accumulating solids for a range of critical shear stresses is presented in fig 3 a b it can be observed that with a higher reduction in flows the value of the critical shear stress influences more the proportion of pipes accumulating solids a higher difference was observed for pipes with a slopes range of 0 3 3 for both ranges of slopes of 0 3 10 and of 0 3 3 the median changed by 0 2 0 5 and by 0 07 0 3 respectively 3 2 ml predictions accuracy from the three regression ml algorithms investigated the rf algorithm presented the highest shear stress prediction accuracy and the lr the lowest the relatively simple lr algorithm showed a poor performance with r2 of 0 77 and mae of 3 62 pa fig 4 a table 4 note that r2 close to 1 as in the case of the three algorithms examined shows that the predictions approximate the ground truth data points while a low mae being the average magnitude of the errors in the test set is also desirable géron 2019 james et al 2013 in this case the ground truth data points are the shear stresses derived from the hydrodynamic simulations r2 of 0 96 and mae of 1 25 pa were observed for the rf fig 4b table 4 the nn regressor presented a very similar prediction accuracy of r2 of 0 96 and mae of 1 25 pa fig 4c table 4 it can further be observed in fig 4 that most of the test data points fall within the range of shear stresses of up to 10 pa 66 of the data points a closer observation around this range shows that the rf algorithm provided the best predictions and lowest scattering around the expected values fig 5 with more accurate predictions around the threshold value of 2 pa r2 of 1 2 0 75 0 74 and mae of 3 02 0 76 0 86 for the lr rf and nn respectively when these measures were derived from analysing the data up to 10 pa therefore even though the rf and nn produced similar values for the regression metric the rf algorithm enables slightly more accurate identification of pipes prone to accumulate solids presented in the next paragraph these results contradict the initial assumption that the prediction accuracy increases with model complexity the algorithms also provided high accuracies when identifying pipes prone to accumulation or not with classification accuracy performance in the same order as presented by the regression metric i e r2 and mae where the rf showed the highest performance accuracy and lr the lowest the results are presented in the form of a confusion matrix in fig 6 where the top left corner cell is the tn the bottom right is tp the top right corner is fp and the bottom left corner is fn the values of the classification metric were 0 92 0 97 and 0 95 for the accuracy and f1 score were 0 84 0 93 0 91 for the lr rf nn respectively table 4 the optimum cut off value for which the maximum f1 score was obtained is presented in table 4 it can be observed that the cut off value was closer to the real critical value of shear stress from which solids will tend to accumulate 2 pa as the prediction accuracy of the algorithm increases the rf regression algorithm which showed the best prediction accuracy and average complexity was further tested on the new data set of extreme cases with a typical range of slopes of 0 3 3 and a large proportion of pipes accumulating solids it showed an r2 of 0 9 table 5 and mae of 1 48 pa not presented as for the identification of pipes accumulating solids the rf algorithm showed high prediction accuracy with an f1 score of 0 93 and accuracy of 0 94 when it was both trained and tested on the extended extreme data its f1 score and prediction accuracy slightly decreased to 0 92 and 0 93 respectively table 5 the sensitivity analysis of the algorithms to the critical shear stress is presented in fig 7 it can be seen that with an increase in the critical shear stress the proportion of the major class decreases this is since with higher critical values more pipes will be classified as accumulating solids reduction in the size of the major class affects the accuracy and f1 score with a slight decrease and increase respectively the accuracy decreased by 0 025 0 028 0 025 and the f1 score increased by 0 12 0 021 0 066 for the lr rf and nn respectively for a shear stress range of 1 3 pa the accuracy decreases since as the major class decreases the potential for the model to predict the major class correctly decreases the f1 score on the other hand increases since it is more sensitive to the size of the minor class a higher quality model is that in which the f1 score is not affected by the critical value fig 7 a and b reveals that the rf proved to be the best classifier the optimum cut off of an ideal classifier will be close to the critical shear stress as can be seen in fig 7c this was observed for the rf and nn algorithms 3 3 analysis of features correlation and importance the correlation matrix in fig 8 shows that features linked to the number of residents discharging wastewater were observed to be relatively highly correlated with a pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 74 number of residents pipes diameter and stream order going downstream in the network the cumulative number of residents increases increasing the flows and hence also the pipes diameters by definition the stream order also raises in pipes located downstream the shear stress is positively highly correlated with pipes residents and slope both affecting its value the effect of the slope is clearly presented in eq 1 the number of residents affects the flows and hence also water depth which is also a variable in eq 1 current flow centrality is highly correlated with katz and closeness centrality pearson correlation coefficient of 0 8 and 0 87 respectively all centrality measures presented relatively low correlation with the shear stress pearson coefficient lower than 0 4 nevertheless their importance to model predictions was not negligible as presented in fig 9 and elaborated below the high correlation of the features is also observed in fig 9 here the features importance for the three regression algorithms for the three cases i e difficult medium and easy case are presented it can be observed that the most influencing feature receives the highest importance scale and its correlated features are assigned with less importance this is because in the permutation feature importance test correlated features are usually not selected as most important in all three models pipe slope and pipe residents were observed as most important strengthening the findings presented in fig 8 showing their high correlation to the shear stress in the medium and easy cases the slope was replaced with the range of slope in the medium case fig 9 ii and the importance of the stream order and diameter increased fig 9 ii and iii this is due to their high correlation to the number of residents which is not used in the medium and easy case flow proportion had a relatively high importance in all cases and models even though this feature had a relatively low correlation to the shear stress 0 32 fig 8 it got high importance due to its low correlation with the other features the centrality measures showed feature importance each case and algorithm had at least one centrality measure as an important feature most cases had two important centrality measures and some cases had three the second order centrality pipe which showed negative correlation to the shear stress and to most of the other features fig 8 was not found to be important to any of the tested algorithms in fig 10 the extent to which the algorithms can be simplified by reducing the number of features is presented the results demonstrate that removing the features most difficult to obtain i e slope and pipe residents reduces the algorithms prediction accuracy that is because these are also of the most important features as shown in fig 9 nevertheless the medium case in which the slopes are defined by a range which can more easily be evaluated than its actual value showed relatively good performance especially for the rf and nn algorithms interestingly when the data for training and for testing were obtained from the same networks the centrality features significantly increased the accuracy of the easy case of the rf algorithm the f1 score increased by 11 5 from 74 06 to 85 6 when compared to the case in which the centrality features were not used fig 8 supplementary information when the data for training and testing were obtained from different networks as done in all the analysis presented the increase in the algorithms performance was less substantial when comparing the cases in which the centrality features were used and not used fig 9 supplementary information 3 4 analysis of the applicability of ml algorithms for the prediction of solids accumulation due to the implementation of dwes the rf algorithm which showed the highest accuracy was further tested for its prediction accuracy for each dwes scenario separately fig 11 presents the distributions of the increase in proportion of pipes accumulating solids for each scenario compared to the base scenario a comparison between the distributions obtained from the hydraulic simulations with those obtained from the ml predictions are also presented some difference between both predictions can be observed though these are not large in fig 12 the accuracy and f1 score obtained from the rf predictions for each dwes scenario are presented it can be seen that the accuracy decreases with the increase in water saving i e with the decrease of wastewater flow this has to do with the imbalance of the training data i e the model is trained on more pipes which do not accumulate solids than those that do the f1 score is generally a better measure for evaluating ml algorithms predictions with unbalanced data the f1 score did not show a specific trend for the difficult case this is most probably since the f1 score was already high and hence it is less affected from changes in the distribution of the data i e in the quantity of pipes accumulating solids compared to those not accumulating in the medium and easy cases the f1 score increases with reduction of flows i e with the increase of the number of pipes accumulating solids when data are more balanced the increase in its value is more profound in the easy case we suspect that this is because in the easy case the sensitivity of the model to imbalanced data increases due to the reduction of number of features these measures were examined while using a cut off value of 2 08 pa which was the optimum value found for the rf table 4 4 discussion 4 1 dwes and network properties contributing to solids accumulation 117 synthetic sewer networks representing different characteristics were successfully generated using drainnetgen muranho et al 2016 the large number and the variability of the sewer networks used to produce the results presented in this study aimed at making this study generalizable it should be recalled that in this study one network was generated for each set of parameters defined during generation of the networks including range of slopes number of pipes population density size of the network and length of pipes it will also be interesting to examine in future studies the variability of a batch of networks generated with the same set of parameters in case this variability will be higher they can be used to cover a wider range of conditions for sewer related model predictions it was observed that with the implementation of dwes most of the pipes accumulating solids are located in the upstream parts of the networks and when the flows were reduced by 50 a significant proportion of pipes accumulating solids was observed this indicates that dwes should be mainly implemented in the downstream parts of the networks where flows are larger alternatively in new systems pipes can be built with higher slopes and smaller diameters increasing flow velocities and water depth and hence also the shear stresses responsible for the movement of the solids increasing sewer slopes should be considered while evaluating the trade offs between the costs associated with extra excavation and additional maintenance activities e g pipe cleaning and the benefits of water savings due to the implementation of dwes sensitivity analysis of the effects of the shear stress on models predictions showed that by changing the critical shear stress in a relatively wide range between 1 and 3 pa significant differences in the prediction of the proportion of pipes accumulating solids can occur it is important to mention that this range in critical shear stress is large when observing a lower range much closer to the typical value of 2 pa a much smaller difference in predictions was observed this range in predictions should be considered when implementation of dwes is desired this uncertainty needs further examinations while implementing more detailed solids transport models which need to be developed in the future 4 2 ml algorithms are able to predict sewer pipe solids accumulation it was found that ml algorithms can be used as surrogate systems of detailed hydraulic models to predict the pipes that are prone to accumulate solids due to the implementation of dwes the algorithms were tested on unseen data of different networks with different characteristics including also extreme data representing networks with expected high proportions of pipes accumulating solids the algorithms predictions accuracies were high also when a small number of sewer pipe features were used compared to the swmm model the ml model does not require as input the water depth the diurnal patterns of the flows and the length of the pipes these inputs are needed for simulation in swmm but are usually not known or difficult to be obtained additionally simulations in swmm require knowledge of not only the slope of a specific pipe but rather the slopes of all pipes in the network more specifically it is the invert elevation of all nodes in the network which accounts for the slopes this is since all pipes are interconnected and their properties affect the flows in the other pipes in the system in conclusion this means that the input to the swmm model requires diurnal patterns of the flows discharged to each junction specific location coordinates of each junction and their invert elevation and the diameters of the pipes by using the ml model fewer and more easily obtained features are required invert elevations which are usually difficult to obtain of all junctions are not needed but rather only of the specific pipes which we are examining or its slope in practice it is not the detailed layout of the system that is needed but only which pipes are connected and their connection order further in the medium case examined which showed high prediction accuracies a range of slope which is usually more easily obtained can be employed instead of the exact slope value of the pipe the time required for simulating one topology and one scenario was not substantially different between the hydrodynamic swmm model and the ml based model since it is relatively short in both types of models 15 s and 0 01 s for swmm and ml respectively the significance of the ml model is that it also saves time and resources required for setting up the detailed model required for swmm further the computational time of the hydrodynamic model will significantly scale up with the complexity of the model complexity will increase for example with the integration of more elaborated models for solids transport and biochemical processes this study is currently under development by co author penn on the other hand the prediction time of the ml model would stay almost unchanged these make the ml algorithms advantageous for implementation the random forest algorithm provided the highest prediction performance with accuracy values of 0 97 and f1 score of 0 93 in fact linear regression proved to be too simple for solving the problem at hand while the neural network algorithm being the most complex might require much more data to perform optimally such results might be due to the fact that random forest is less prone to overfitting also the advantage of random forest is that it has fewer hyperparameters to tune compared to complex models as neural networks liu et al 2013 additionally when the random forest algorithm was examined on a new unseen data set comprising a higher number of pipes with the potential to accumulate solids it also presented high prediction performance showing its generalisation capabilities on the prediction of extreme out of sample scenarios in this research negative shear stress predictions which are not physically feasible were replaced by zero further research is needed for the development of physics informed models that can consider the physical meaning of the shear stress sensitivity analysis showed that the value of the critical shear stress had some influence on models predictions accuracy this was mostly due to the fact that changing its value affects the size of the major class rf showed to be the least influenced it is noteworthy the use of a cut off to predict the accumulating and non accumulating pipes from the prediction results of the regression algorithms in tasks having a significant class imbalance as it is in this study the cut off is tuned in order to locate its optimal value such tuning impacts the precision and recall values and its tuning should depend on the preferable outcome or in other words which of the classifications should be predicted with higher accuracy specifically the cut off value is generally tuned based on the more expensive operation for example the operator can decide on the operation cut off depending on whether there is a higher preference for cleaning the system more frequently than needed because a pipe was erroneously identified as accumulating or for dealing with unpredicted blockages because a pipe was faultily identified as not accumulating in this study by optimizing the cut off to receive the highest f1 score possible the predictions will tend to be equally accurate for the pipes accumulating and not accumulating solids the most important features for predicting solids accumulation in pipes i e those directly influencing the shear stress were identified these include pipe residents and slope as they are also the features that are more difficult to obtain it was examined to what extent removing them would influence algorithms prediction accuracy a relatively good compromise was found in the medium stage where the slopes were clustered in a range and their precise value was not required using a random forest algorithm with these features can significantly reduce the complexity of running such investigations for evaluating the effects implementation of dwes may have on solids accumulation in sewer pipes a more detailed model could then be set up and used for the more sensitive locations 4 3 ml algorithms to predict solids accumulation due to the implementation of dwes the rf algorithm which showed the highest prediction accuracy was further tested to evaluate its prediction accuracy for each dwes scenario a clear increasing trend in the f1 score was observed for the medium case with the reduction in wastewater flows as a result of the implementation of dwes these findings strengthen the applicability of using the rf for predicting solids accumulation as a result of the implementation of dwes one practical contribution of this study is a simple web tool in which one can enter the properties of a pipe from a new network and obtain the prediction about whether the specific pipe will accumulate or not solids these pipe properties i e features include design features such as the pipes slope or range of slope in which the real slope is expected to be density of the population discharging wastewater into the network proportion of the flow to be reduced due to the implementation of dwes and graphbased measures which require the simple layout of the network i e which pipe is connected to which but not the its height slope and length hydraulic simulations are not required for the predictions and neither detailed water usage patterns which are mostly unknown the developed tool can be used to predict whether a pipe from a new network will accumulate solids without the need to retrain the model as long as the characteristics of the pipe and of the network fall within the range of the networks examined which cover a wide range of the characteristic s values as mentioned above the prediction tool can also be used to examine the impacts of reduced flows on a specific or several sewer pipes as mentioned above this requires that the characteristics of the pipe and of the network it belongs to fall within the ranges of characteristics examined in this study which based on the design of the study are wide 5 conclusions machine learning algorithms were found to successfully predict locations of solids accumulation in sewer pipes when dwes are implemented the features used for training the algorithms include only the design parameters of the network not including features obtained from hydraulic simulations further the detailed wastewater flows that are required by the hydrodynamic model and are usually unknown were not included in the features used by the ml algorithms a simplified tool that implements the findings of this study was also developed and can be used for simple and fast predictions of whether a sewer pipe will accumulate solids saving the need to set up a detailed hydraulic model and conduct hydraulic simulations the predictions can be made for the current situation and for future dwes scenarios the results found in this study are based on a large number of highly variable synthetic sewer networks covering a wide range of sewer pipes and network characteristics this aimed at obtaining results that can be generalised to multiple case studies the results showed that pipes prone to accumulate solids are located mainly upstream with a reduction of 50 of the flows 7 40 with a median of 23 of the pipes in a network would tend to accumulate solids a difference of 3 20 from the base scenario in which dwes are not implemented the proportion of pipes accumulating solids is affected by the value of the critical shear stress which can reach a significant difference of up to 0 5 in the extreme scenario of 90 reduction in flows when the critical shear stress ranges from 1 to 3 pa the rf algorithm accurately predicts pipes accumulating solids when dwes are implemented its predictive performance were r2 of 0 96 for regression of shear stress and f1 score of 0 93 for classification of accumulating pipes the rf was further found to be the least influenced by varying the value of the critical shear stress by 1 3 pa the most important features were found to be the accumulated number of residents discharging wastewater to the pipe the pipes slope and the scenario of implementing dwes a good compromise between simplifying the rf algorithm and its prediction accuracy was obtained by omitting the number of residents contributing wastewater and clustering the slopes into ranges the model is now based on data that is more easily available and it was shown that this does not compromise the predictions accuracy the rf algorithm was further observed to provide high prediction accuracies high f1 scores for each scenario of dwes implementation separately with an increase in its value as the flows are reduced for the medium and easy case strengthening the applicability of its implementation it is noteworthy that only synthetic data was considered in this study because the effects of implementation of dwes on a large scale make data collection almost impossible the developed approach can later be implemented on more sophisticated models including complex biochemical processes for the prediction of hydrogen sulphide and more detailed modelling of solids transport processes in sewers such models are currently under development by co author penn declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
