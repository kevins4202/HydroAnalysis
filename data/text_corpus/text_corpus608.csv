3040,peatlands one of the largest biosphere carbon reservoirs are facing climate change induced water table drawdown and carbon loss to provide insights into peatland protection and carbon water cycle under the background of global change the detailed relationship between peatland ecology and water table depth wtd should be considered in this study we focused on carbon flux and synthesized datasets on wtd carbon dynamics vegetation and microbiologic activities in the dajiuhu peatland to better understand the ecological response to the hydrological variations based on modern monitoring the daily ch4 emission decreased and co2 emission increased with the fall of the wtd when the wtd was deeper than 30 cm daily carbon sequestration reduced until it approached 0 according to nonlinear models by comparisons with previous spatial soil toc vegetation and microbiologic surveys we proposed that approximately 30 cm is a critical wtd level turning point or zone affecting the structure and function of peatland ecosystems prolonged and severe droughts might trigger an ecological shift of peatland because increase in oxygen availability and decrease in water availability are not able to meet the physiological needs of living organisms which further decreases ch4 emission due to limited methanogenesis and enhanced methanotrophy and weakens carbon sequestration through enhanced litter decomposition this was also confirmed by palaeo ecological records in particular precipitation induced declines of wtd wtd 30 cm during 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp caused a series of ecological changes including the decreases in wet preferred sphagnum and herbs enhanced aerobic bacteria activities and ecosystem respiration and changed soil carbon sequestration drought during 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp induced low carbon sequestration however rapid vegetation succession and peat accumulation caused by the abrupt hydrological variations during 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp might have resulted in temporary increases in carbon sequestration our results demonstrate that wtd is crucial to the regulation of peatland ecological

in china ge 2007 gu et al 2009 and covers abundant wetland sources the dajiuhu peatland which is covered by abundant sphagnums xiao et al 2015 is the largest subtropical subalpine peatland in central china peat has accumulated since the late pleistocene xiao et al 2015 and records the local ecological and environment signals he et al 2015 huang et al 2013a huang et al 2013b li et al 2013 tian et

ecosystem functions and the mechanisms of biochemical physiological variation when ecosystems overstep the critical wtd this will allow us to predict the peatland ecological evolution under the future global climate change and to take mitigation measures for extensive peatland protection 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the dajiuhu basin 31 34 31 33 n 109 56 110 11 e 1760 m a s l fig 1 a is surrounded by steep mountains ranging from 2 200 to 2 400 m a s l with low mountains and hills in the east and plateaus and high mountains in the west li et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 the basin bedrock is mostly composed of cambrian dolomite a conglomerate clay layer that mainly originates from alluvial fans and fluvial lacustrine deposits covers on the basement several small streams flow into the basin and eventually disappear into an underground karst cave network therefore the basin has no surface outlet fig 1b he 2007 xiao et al 2015 the dajiuhu basin has a long geological history with various topographic types and developed stratigraphic systems fig 1b and peatland was initiated in the last glacial maximum fig 1c d he 2007 xiao et al 2015 the climate of the dajiuhu peatland has a seasonal variability under the control of the east asian monsoon ma et al 2009 the average annual temperature is 7 2 c and the average annual precipitation is approximately 1550 mm the different natural vegetation zonations on the shennongjia mountain natural heritage site are distributed along elevation gradients fig 2 a ma et al 2017 modern natural vegetation types in the dajiuhu basin are primarily meadow and marshy plants miscellaneous grass meadow is dominant at highlands with smooth drainage sphagnum is distributed in developed eutrophic peat fen due to cool wet conditions as a result of human activities such as the excavation of moss and farming there is sporadic distribution of shrubs in the areas close to the surrounding mountains fig 2b luo et al 2015 zhu and song 1999 2 2 monitoring on modern hydro climate and carbon flux the open path eddy covariance systems are placed 3 m over the ground surface at the center of the dajiuhu peatland consistent with an open way infrared methane ch4 li 7700 li cor usa measurement system and an open way infrared co2 h2o li 7500 li cor usa measurement system a biological and meteorological auxiliary sensor system biomet 100 li

ml2x at the depth of 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm a data logger cr5000 xt campbell scientific utah usa reported all channels on weather and ground sensors every 30 min and the data were recovered from a portable usb unit a monitoring system levelogger edge m20 solinst canada for wtd changes can measure the absolute pressure the sum of water pressure and atmospheric pressure and was set to record data every 30 min the absolute pressure was then converted into the corresponding wtd with accuracy of 1 cm using solinst levelogger software what the software does is to estimate gauge pressure by subtracting the measured barometric pressure from the absolute pressure measured in the water column given an assumed barometric efficiency environmental data gaps were filled based on vuichard and papale 2015 and gaps of carbon flux data were filled according to reichstein et al 2005 and foltýnová et al 2020 carbon sequestration was calculated based on the deviation of co2 and ch4 emissions 2 3 data analysis to verify the hypothesis of correlation between wtd and peatland ecological function the generalized additive model gam a nonparametric regression technique not restricted by linear relationships and flexible regarding the statistical distribution of the data swartzman et al 1995 and segmented model regression model with turning point estimation muggeo 2017 were chosen to establish nonlinear correlations between carbon variables and the wtd for further prediction of the turning points the gam based analysis used the mgcv package version 1 8 39 and the segmented based analysis used the segmented package version 1 4 0 of the r program r development core team 2007 with rstudio version 1 3 1093 rstudio inc boston ma deviance explained analogous to variance in a linear regression adjusted r2 and gcv scores based on gam model and residual standard error adjusted r2 and turning points based on segmented model were calculated we considered statistical results with p 0 01 to be significant 2 4 ecological reconstruction based on multiproxy indicator datasets pollens and phytoliths from the dajiuhu peatland sediments have become useful tools and have been used widely in determining past plant communities and vegetation transitions and further in reconstructing palaeo climatic changes li et al 2013 liu et al 2018 2019 2020 sun et al 2019 xiao et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 leaf wax n alkanes with different carbon chain lengths huang et al 2018 are generally identified to indicate the relative ratio of aquatic to terrestrial plants high n c23 n c29 and p aquatic paq ratios indicate a high abundance of aquatic species huang et al 2018 microbial activities can be recorded by some biomarkers for example hopanoid concentrations mainly derived from aerobes xie et al 2013 are closely related to aerobic microbial biomass the average aromatic ring aar ratio calculated based on aromaticity of plant triterpenes huang et al 2013b was mediated by aerobic microbial activities moreover carbon related indicators such as total organic carbon toc carbon accumulation rate car and the carbon isotopes huang et al 2018 are believed to reflect the carbon dynamics and peatland development these indicators were therefore systematically intergrated for peatland ecological processes 3 results seasonally climatic change during 2019 indicated a typical cold dry and warm wet pattern fig 3 c 3f but long term 1900 2020 high resolution grids of meteorological observation data in this region showed a negative correlation r 0 28 p 0 002 0 01 between the mean annual air temperature and the mean annual precipitation fig 3a 3d a negative correlation between precipitation and peatland wtd rwtd pre 0 87 fig 3f was also shown based on correlation analysis the carbon flux result indicates an evident co2 sink a ch4 source and a shallow wtd relative humidity occurred in warm wet summer fig 3b c e with a daily mean wtd of 18 46 cm and mean ch4 and co2 emissions of 0 03 μmol m2 s and 1 48 μmol m2 s respectively the monthly mean ch4 emission decreased and co2 emission increased rapidly with the fall of wtd fig 3e especially during 2019 02 2019 03 and 2019 10 2019 12 with a daily mean wtd deeper than 30 cm daily mean value 33 5 cm the mean carbon sequestration daily mean value 0 1 μmol m2 s decreased closely to 0 on year round carbon water changes the daily mean wtd is 27 62 cm and mean carbon sequestration is 0 51 μmol m2 s so the study site overall acted as a weak carbon sink during 2019 significant correlations between carbon variables co2 ch4 c sequestration and spatial soil toc and wtd were shown according to p values 0 01 tables s2 and s3 gam models showed a synchronous transition of carbon variations at approximately 30 cm wtd thereafter ch4 and co2 emissions approached a plateau fig 3e 4a b and carbon sequestration and soil toc were synchronously close to 0 fig 4 c d segmented models estimated turning points of daily monthly co2 emission at 24 51 cm and 29 53 cm 34 74 cm daily monthly ch4 emission at 32 64 cm 33 88 cm daily monthly c sequestration at 24 50 cm and 29 51 cm 34 75 cm and toc at 28 99 cm liu et al 2018 due to the small sample size and low degree of dispersion for monthly data n 12 the model performance was better with higher adjusted r2 values than that of daily data n 365 tables s2 and s3 furthermore although linear regression r2 0 83 showed a close correlation between the hopanoid concentration and wtd xie et al 2013 in the dajiuhu peatland a turning point at 25 49 cm and a more significant correlation coefficient adjusted r2 0 94 were shown according to the segmented model which indicated an evident positive correlation when wtd fell deeper than 25 49 cm fig s1a 4 discussion 4 1 responses of modern carbon sequestration and ecology to the critical 30 cm wtd level as has been suggested by published studies our results showed that peatland ch4 emission decreased and co2 emission increased due to water table drawdown chivers et al 2009 gill et al 2017 laine et al 2019 which thus triggered a low carbon sequestration wang et al 2015 zeng and gao 2016 when the wtd was deeper than 30 cm a low value of the carbon sink potential occurred northern latitude peatland research showed that long term drought wtd 30 cm led to a functional transition of carbon sink to source fenner and freeman 2011 except for peatland carbon dynamics the wtd also regulates peatland vegetation and microorganism distributions and activities fig s1 the different vegetation community types hygrophyte peat bogs hygrophyte herbaceous marshes degraded semi hygrophyte marshes hygrophyte mesophyte meadow moderate xeric meadow and xeric meadow and their approximate distribution ranges fig 2b fig s1b in the dajiuhu basin show that almost all meadows were located in less humid and comparatively drier conditions with wtd 30 cm previous investigation also revealed that dominant peat forming plants in this peatland primarily had a root depth distribution of shallower than 30 cm huang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 vegetation degradation in qinghai tibetan peatlands occurred in habitats with wtd 40 cm wu et al 2020 moreover most wetland testate amoeba and diatoms in central china were not observed in habitats with wtd 30 cm fig s1d which is supported by a previous study in northeastern china chen et al 2020 diatom valve size evidently decreased under less humid peat conditions chen et al 2012 and the small types of eunotia paludosa had water table optima of 30 cm below the surface although slight differences in wtd turning point values for different organisms could probably result from differential sensitivity and or wtd measurement errors the modern synthesized ecological datasets in the dajiuhu peatland clearly indicated a critical wtd level at approximately 30 cm deeper than which significant shifts in the dajiuhu peatland ecosystem will occur the survival mechanism determined by physiological moisture needs could be used for the explanation of organism shifts at wtd deeper than 30 cm for example peat forming plants in the dajiuhu peatland with root depths shallower than 30 cm huang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 tapping groundwater by roots fan et al 2017 would suffer from severe water stress and survival crises under conditions of wtd deeper than 30 cm similarly the pattern of microorganism distributions and activities can also be explained as tolerance levels of physiological water needs and supply of oxygen chen et al 2014 qin et al 2013 xie et al 2013 moreover ecological shifts caused by sufficient oxygen and water stress might be crucial factors that cause an evident transition of peatland ecological functions and carbon sequestration previous research showed that hydrological constraints on decomposition could be removed by a long term wtd deeper than 30 cm fenner and freeman 2011 vertical extension of oxic zone led to a faster aerobic decomposition process instead of anaerobic decomposition jungkunst et al 2012 and accelerated co2 emission huang et al 2018 which induced a shift from carbon sink to source however in our datasets a daily carbon sequestration plateau occurred when the daily wtd fell deeper than 30 cm it could be considered that short term or and slight droughts could not completely remove limitations on carbon losses so a dynamic balance between c absorption through photosynthesis and emission through litter decomposition occurred górecki et al 2021 more prolonged or and severe droughts might tip the balance and lead to a transition of carbon sink to source spatial wtd ecological surveys indicated that although hopanoid concentration increased with the fall of wtd xie et al 2013 at wtd deeper than 30 cm soil toc remained stable unlike monitoring carbon data the spatial toc sampling sites of wtd 30 cm are mainly located in highlands with prolonged and severe drought which is necessary for removing the majority of limitation on carbon loss fenner and freeman 2011 and breaking the dynamic carbon balance once most sequestered organic carbon is degraded toc close to 0 limited soil organic carbon nutrition might restrict the aerobic decomposition rate consistent with previous studies dry conditions significantly reduced ch4 emission evans et al 2021 strack et al 2004 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 however ch4 emission did not decrease obviously with the water table drawdown fig 4b and was not significantly affected by other climatic factors yang et al 2014 when wtd fell deeper than 30 cm an important methanogenic pathway in peatlands is that transportation through the aerenchyma of vascular plants bypasses the oxic zones at the interfaces between sediment and water and or water and atmosphere zheng et al 2014 the increase in oxygen availability caused by water table drawdown not only suppressed methanogen populations but also allowed more methane diffusion into the atmosphere through the top oxic peat layer rather than aerenchyma mediated transportation zheng et al 2014 thus enhanced ch4 oxidation li et al 2019 and limited methanogenesis led to decreased ch4 emission when wtd 30 cm aerenchyma mediated transportation was almost cut off because most root depths were shallower than 30 cm a ch4 emission plateau close to 0 occurred because produced ch4 was oxidized in the process of diffusion through the oxic peat layer into the atmosphere zhang et al 2022 in brief approximately 30 cm wtd level exerted an overriding influence on peatland ecological shifts and carbon sequestration we therefore concluded that approximately the 30 cm wtd turning point or zone in the dajiuhu peatland could be a crucial wtd and a peat condition with long term wtd 30 cm might trigger biodiversity changes destabilize peatland carbon stocks and even lead to the ecological degradation 4 2 impact of 30 cm wtd level on peatland palaeoecology and carbon cycle palaeoecological changes also supported the critical wtd level hypothesis from modern ecological processes reconstructed droughts wtd 30 cm induced by decreased monsoonal precipitation during 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp induced a series of ecological changes including a slight decline in the percentage of wetland herbs increased bulliform abundance and hopanoid concentration negative shifts of carbon isotopes decreased toc and changed car fig 5 the increase in bulliform phytoliths indicated reductions in leaf light exposure and transpiration rate by leaf movements because of the water deficit liu et al 2020 high hopanoid concentration corresponded to aerobic conditions xie et al 2013 the carbon isotopic signatures of leaf wax and bacterial biomarkers showed increasing plant uptake of respired co2 caused by enhanced peat degradation huang et al 2018 moreover during 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp rapid peatland expansion led to gradual flooding of these initially terrestrial plant dominated communities huang et al 2018 zhu et al 2010 an abrupt transition occurred at approximately 3 600 cal yr bp from sphagnum subsecunda and drepanocladus sp preferring a wetter habitat to sphagnum imbricatum over a wide range of wtd dominance zhao et al 2007 however there is a conflict in the car changes during holocene which showed high cars during droughts of 9 500 9 200 cal ka bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp and a low car during 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp fig 5 according to previous research car reflects a combination of ecosystem production and respiration thus droughts could increase carbon decomposition and decrease the car huang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2018 undoubtedly enhanced ecosystem respiration reflected by the carbon isotopic signatures of leaf wax and bacterial biomarkers huang et al 2018 accelerated organic matter decomposition in three drought intervals the relatively low car during the mid holocene could be explained by increased carbon decomposition induced by drought huang et al 2013a liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 high cars during 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp might be caused by temporary increases in the peat sedimentary rates huang et al 2018 linked to abrupt water table drawdown induced rapid environmental ecological transitions zhao et al 2007 therefore it is not contrary to the interpretation that prolonged and severe droughts can decrease carbon storage and induce peatland degradation huang et al 2018 ise et al 2008 furthermore slight increases in car of marshy wetland fig 1c liu et al 2021 during intervals of 16 800 16 000 cal yr bp 13 600 12 800 cal yr bp and 11 500 11 000 cal yr bp also correspond to the falls of wtd as mentioned before carbon sequestration increases with the fall of wtd in a lacustrine or wetland with a shallow wtd zhou et al 2017 5 conclusions based on modern ecological monitoring and surveys we found that co2 emission increased and ch4 emission decreased with the fall of wtd and the changes of carbon flux reached plateaus over 30 cm wtd which might be a crucial wtd level for the dajiuhu peatland severe and prolonged droughts could induce changes in organisms e g vegetation and microorganisms and thus trigger peatland ecological function shifts this result is also supported by palaeo ecological records droughts wtd 30 cm during around 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp led to a series of ecological variations including decreases in wetland herbs and wet preferred sphagnum enhanced aerobic bacterial activities and decreased toc and changed car the decrease in car during 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp can be interpreted as drought induced enhancement of carbon decomposition but enhanced cars during 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp might be related to accelerated peat accumulation rates induced by abrupt hydrological oscillations more detailed research of the relationship between peatland ecology and hydrological variations will yield insights into the response of peatland ecosystem to hydroclimate changes credit authorship contribution

every 30 min the absolute pressure was then converted into the corresponding wtd with accuracy of 1 cm using solinst levelogger software what the software does is to estimate gauge pressure by subtracting the measured barometric pressure from the absolute pressure measured in the water column given an assumed barometric efficiency environmental data gaps were filled based on vuichard and papale 2015 and gaps of carbon flux data were filled according to reichstein et al 2005 and foltýnová et al 2020 carbon sequestration was calculated based on the deviation of co2 and ch4 emissions 2 3 data analysis to verify the hypothesis of correlation between wtd and peatland ecological function the generalized additive model gam a nonparametric regression technique not restricted by linear relationships and flexible regarding the statistical distribution of the data swartzman et al 1995 and segmented model regression model with turning point estimation muggeo 2017 were chosen to establish nonlinear correlations between carbon variables and the wtd for further prediction of the turning points the gam based analysis used the mgcv package version 1 8 39 and the segmented based analysis used the segmented package version 1 4 0 of the r program r development core team 2007 with rstudio version 1 3 1093 rstudio inc boston ma deviance explained analogous to variance in a linear regression adjusted r2 and gcv scores based on gam model and residual standard error adjusted r2 and turning points based on segmented model were calculated we considered statistical results with p 0 01 to be significant 2 4 ecological reconstruction based on multiproxy indicator datasets pollens and phytoliths from the dajiuhu peatland sediments have become useful tools and have been used widely in determining past plant communities and vegetation transitions and further in reconstructing palaeo climatic changes li et al 2013 liu et al 2018 2019 2020 sun et al 2019 xiao et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 leaf wax n alkanes with different carbon chain lengths huang et al 2018 are generally identified to indicate the relative ratio of aquatic to terrestrial plants high n c23 n c29 and p aquatic paq ratios indicate a high abundance of aquatic species huang et al 2018 microbial activities can be recorded by some biomarkers for example hopanoid concentrations mainly derived from aerobes xie et al 2013 are closely related to aerobic microbial biomass the average aromatic ring aar ratio calculated based on aromaticity of plant triterpenes huang et al 2013b was mediated by aerobic microbial activities moreover carbon related indicators such as total organic carbon toc carbon accumulation rate car and the carbon isotopes huang et al 2018 are believed to reflect the carbon dynamics and peatland development these indicators were therefore systematically intergrated for peatland ecological processes 3 results seasonally climatic change during 2019 indicated a typical cold dry and warm wet pattern fig 3 c 3f but long term 1900 2020 high resolution grids of meteorological observation data in this region showed a negative correlation r 0 28 p 0 002 0 01 between the mean annual air temperature and the mean annual precipitation fig 3a 3d a negative correlation between precipitation and peatland wtd rwtd pre 0 87 fig 3f was also shown based on correlation analysis the carbon flux result indicates an evident co2 sink a ch4 source and a shallow wtd relative humidity occurred in warm wet summer fig 3b c e with a daily mean wtd of 18 46 cm and mean ch4 and co2 emissions of 0 03 μmol m2 s and 1 48 μmol m2 s respectively the monthly mean ch4 emission decreased and co2 emission increased rapidly with the fall of wtd fig 3e especially during 2019 02 2019 03 and 2019 10 2019 12 with a daily mean wtd deeper than 30 cm daily mean value 33 5 cm the mean carbon sequestration daily mean value 0 1 μmol m2 s decreased closely to 0 on year round carbon water changes the daily mean wtd is 27 62 cm and mean carbon sequestration is 0 51 μmol m2 s so the study site overall acted as a weak carbon sink during 2019 significant correlations between carbon variables co2 ch4 c sequestration and spatial soil toc and wtd were shown according to p values 0 01 tables s2 and s3 gam models showed a synchronous transition of carbon variations at approximately 30 cm wtd thereafter ch4 and co2 emissions approached a plateau fig 3e 4a b and carbon sequestration and soil toc were synchronously close to 0 fig 4 c d segmented models estimated turning points of daily monthly co2 emission at 24 51 cm and 29 53 cm 34 74 cm daily monthly ch4 emission at 32 64 cm 33 88 cm daily monthly c sequestration at 24 50 cm and 29 51 cm 34 75 cm and toc at 28 99 cm liu et al 2018 due to the small sample size and low degree of dispersion for monthly data n 12 the model performance was better with higher adjusted r2 values than that of daily data n 365 tables s2 and s3 furthermore although linear regression r2 0 83 showed a close correlation between the hopanoid concentration and wtd xie et al 2013 in the dajiuhu peatland a turning point at 25 49 cm and a more significant correlation coefficient adjusted r2 0 94 were shown according to the segmented model which indicated an evident positive correlation when wtd fell deeper than 25 49 cm fig s1a 4 discussion 4 1 responses of modern carbon sequestration and ecology to the critical 30 cm wtd level as has been suggested by published studies our results showed that peatland ch4 emission decreased and co2 emission increased due to water table drawdown chivers et al 2009 gill et al 2017 laine et al 2019 which thus triggered a low carbon sequestration wang et al 2015 zeng and gao 2016 when the wtd was deeper than 30 cm a low value of the carbon sink potential occurred northern latitude peatland research showed that long term drought wtd 30 cm led to a functional transition of carbon sink to source fenner and freeman 2011 except for peatland carbon dynamics the wtd also regulates peatland vegetation and microorganism distributions and activities fig s1 the different vegetation community types hygrophyte peat bogs hygrophyte herbaceous marshes degraded semi hygrophyte marshes hygrophyte mesophyte meadow moderate xeric meadow and xeric meadow and their approximate distribution ranges fig 2b fig s1b in the dajiuhu basin show that almost all meadows were located in less humid and comparatively drier conditions with wtd 30 cm previous investigation also revealed that dominant peat forming plants in this peatland primarily had a root depth distribution of shallower than 30 cm huang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 vegetation degradation in qinghai tibetan peatlands occurred in habitats with wtd 40 cm wu et al 2020 moreover most wetland testate amoeba and diatoms in central china were not observed in habitats with wtd 30 cm fig s1d which is supported by a previous study in northeastern china chen et al 2020 diatom valve size evidently decreased under less humid peat conditions chen et al 2012 and the small types of eunotia paludosa had water table optima of 30 cm below the surface although slight differences in wtd turning point values for different organisms could probably result from differential sensitivity and or wtd measurement errors the modern synthesized ecological datasets in the dajiuhu peatland clearly indicated a critical wtd level at approximately 30 cm deeper than which significant shifts in the dajiuhu peatland ecosystem will occur the survival mechanism determined by physiological moisture needs could be used for the explanation of organism shifts at wtd deeper than 30 cm for example peat forming plants in the dajiuhu peatland with root depths shallower than 30 cm huang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 tapping groundwater by roots fan et al 2017 would suffer from severe water stress and survival crises under conditions of wtd deeper than 30 cm similarly the pattern of microorganism distributions and activities can also be explained as tolerance levels of physiological water needs and supply of oxygen chen et al 2014 qin et al 2013 xie et al 2013 moreover ecological shifts caused by sufficient oxygen and water stress might be crucial factors that cause an evident transition of peatland ecological functions and carbon sequestration previous research showed that hydrological constraints on decomposition could be removed by a long term wtd deeper than 30 cm fenner and freeman 2011 vertical extension of oxic zone led to a faster aerobic decomposition process instead of anaerobic decomposition jungkunst et al 2012 and accelerated co2 emission huang et al 2018 which induced a shift from carbon sink to source however in our datasets a daily carbon sequestration plateau occurred when the daily wtd fell deeper than 30 cm it could be considered that short term or and slight droughts could not completely remove limitations on carbon losses so a dynamic balance between c absorption through photosynthesis and emission through litter decomposition occurred górecki et al 2021 more prolonged or and severe droughts might tip the balance and lead to a transition of carbon sink to source spatial wtd ecological surveys indicated that although hopanoid concentration increased with the fall of wtd xie et al 2013 at wtd deeper than 30 cm soil toc remained stable unlike monitoring carbon data the spatial toc sampling sites of wtd 30 cm are mainly located in highlands with prolonged and severe drought which is necessary for removing the majority of limitation on carbon loss fenner and freeman 2011 and breaking the dynamic carbon balance once most sequestered organic carbon is degraded toc close to 0 limited soil organic carbon nutrition might restrict the aerobic decomposition rate consistent with previous studies dry conditions significantly reduced ch4 emission evans et al 2021 strack et al 2004 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 however ch4 emission did not decrease obviously with the water table drawdown fig 4b and was not significantly affected by other climatic factors yang et al 2014 when wtd fell deeper than 30 cm an important methanogenic pathway in peatlands is that transportation through the aerenchyma of vascular plants bypasses the oxic zones at the interfaces between sediment and water and or water and atmosphere zheng et al 2014 the increase in oxygen availability caused by water table drawdown not only suppressed methanogen populations but also allowed more methane diffusion into the atmosphere through the top oxic peat layer rather than aerenchyma mediated transportation zheng et al 2014 thus enhanced ch4 oxidation li et al 2019 and limited methanogenesis led to decreased ch4 emission when wtd 30 cm aerenchyma mediated transportation was almost cut off because most root depths were shallower than 30 cm a ch4 emission plateau close to 0 occurred because produced ch4 was oxidized in the process of diffusion through the oxic peat layer into the atmosphere zhang et al 2022 in brief approximately 30 cm wtd level exerted an overriding influence on peatland ecological shifts and carbon sequestration we therefore concluded that approximately the 30 cm wtd turning point or zone in the dajiuhu peatland could be a crucial wtd and a peat condition with long term wtd 30 cm might trigger biodiversity changes destabilize peatland carbon stocks and even lead to the ecological degradation 4 2 impact of 30 cm wtd level on peatland palaeoecology and carbon cycle palaeoecological changes also supported the critical wtd level hypothesis from modern ecological processes reconstructed droughts wtd 30 cm induced by decreased monsoonal precipitation during 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp induced a series of ecological changes including a slight decline in the percentage of wetland herbs increased bulliform abundance and hopanoid concentration negative shifts of carbon isotopes decreased toc and changed car fig 5 the increase in bulliform phytoliths indicated reductions in leaf light exposure and transpiration rate by leaf movements because of the water deficit liu et al 2020 high hopanoid concentration corresponded to aerobic conditions xie et al 2013 the carbon isotopic signatures of leaf wax and bacterial biomarkers showed increasing plant uptake of respired co2 caused by enhanced peat degradation huang et al 2018 moreover during 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp rapid peatland expansion led to gradual flooding of these initially terrestrial plant dominated communities huang et al 2018 zhu et al 2010 an abrupt transition occurred at approximately 3 600 cal yr bp from sphagnum subsecunda and drepanocladus sp preferring a wetter habitat to sphagnum imbricatum over a wide range of wtd dominance zhao et al 2007 however there is a conflict in the car changes during holocene which showed high cars during droughts of 9 500 9 200 cal ka bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp and a low car during 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp fig 5 according to previous research car reflects a combination of ecosystem production and respiration thus droughts could increase carbon decomposition and decrease the car huang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2018 undoubtedly enhanced ecosystem respiration reflected by the carbon isotopic signatures of leaf wax and bacterial biomarkers huang et al 2018 accelerated organic matter decomposition in three drought intervals the relatively low car during the mid holocene could be explained by increased carbon decomposition induced by drought huang et al 2013a liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 high cars during 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp might be caused by temporary increases in the peat sedimentary rates huang et al 2018 linked to abrupt water table drawdown induced rapid environmental ecological transitions zhao et al 2007 therefore it is not contrary to the interpretation that prolonged and severe droughts can decrease carbon storage and induce peatland degradation huang et al 2018 ise et al 2008 furthermore slight increases in car of marshy wetland fig 1c liu et al 2021 during intervals of 16 800 16 000 cal yr bp 13 600 12 800 cal yr bp and 11 500 11 000 cal yr bp also correspond to the falls of wtd as mentioned before carbon sequestration increases with the fall of wtd in a lacustrine or wetland with a shallow wtd zhou et al 2017 5 conclusions based on modern ecological monitoring and surveys we found that co2 emission increased and ch4 emission decreased with the fall of wtd and the changes of carbon flux reached plateaus over 30 cm wtd which might be a crucial wtd level for the dajiuhu peatland severe and prolonged droughts could induce changes in organisms e g vegetation and microorganisms and thus trigger peatland ecological function shifts this result is also supported by palaeo ecological records droughts wtd 30 cm during around 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp led to a series of ecological variations including decreases in wetland herbs and wet preferred sphagnum enhanced aerobic bacterial activities and decreased toc and changed car the decrease in car during 6 000 4 000 cal yr bp can be interpreted as drought induced enhancement of carbon decomposition but enhanced cars during 9 500 9 200 cal yr bp and 3 600 3 200 cal yr bp might be related to accelerated peat accumulation rates induced by abrupt hydrological oscillations more detailed research of the relationship between peatland ecology and hydrological variations will yield insights into the response of peatland ecosystem to hydroclimate changes credit authorship contribution

3041,aquifer storage and recovery asr is an important water management approach to store excess surface water into aquifers for later use quantitative evaluation of asr performance is not a trivial task and yet becomes more exacting when uncertainty analysis is added to the dimensionality of the problem inclusion of uncertainty into the framework of scheduling optimal asr operations also increases the level of complexity this study integrates a surrogate modeling approach coupled with a mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp algorithm to optimize multi objective asr operations the uncertainties are analyzed based upon a thorough sampling of the parameters space as well as a novel analysis of pareto fronts and variograms of representative solutions knee point of representative pareto fronts is selected for in depth analysis as a solution to the dimensionality of the problem artificial neural network ann is employed to generate surrogate models for predicting groundwater levels and injectate distribution within the aquifer during asr operations the computational complexity in building a large number of anns and deriving of numerous pareto fronts via solving the minlp problem are overcome by the assistance of parallel computing the results show that optimal asr operations are highly influenced by hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity higher hydraulic conductivity values lead to a higher number of active stress periods during storage and recovery phases which requires large volume of extraction to recover the dispersed injectate in contrast higher ratios of longitudinal dispersivity to hydraulic conductivity adversely impact the injectate recovery efficiency through meaningful representation of objective function uncertainty by variograms it is inferred that injectate recovery efficiency is more sensitive to longitudinal dispersivity than hydraulic conductivity keywords aquifer storage and recovery multi objective optimization surrogate modeling artificial neural network uncertainty analysis knee point of pareto front data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquifer storage and recovery asr is an important water resource management method that can be used to store excess surface water into aquifers via artificial recharge forghani 2018 the recharge can be accomplished by using various systems such as injection wells infiltration basins and infiltration galleries that can use excess surface water reclaimed water and stormwater and water from other aquifers sheng 2005 dillon et al 2009 there are two major phases in asr operations 1 storage phase and 2 recovery phase the asr can be classified as a category of managed aquifer recharge mar maliva 2014 in asr the recharged water mixes with native water which is then extracted from aquifer during the recovery phase during asr the storage phase injection is normally followed by the recovery phase extraction this study focuses on optimal scheduling of asr operations where the storage and recovery phases are designed through injection of non native water into the aquifer and subsequent extraction of stored groundwater from the aquifer using the same asr well fig 1 shows an asr operation well installed in a confined aquifer as shown in the figure the process of water injection raises the groundwater level at the injection point and around the well the groundwater raise leads to the development of an outward gradient from the asr well this mechanism can be used to develop hydraulic barriers that can force brackish saline water away in aquifers shammas 2008 pyne 2015 the rise in groundwater level can also help alleviate land subsidence in coastal areas where land loss is a core issue lu et al 2011 in addition to acting as a hydraulic barrier an asr well can be used for storing surface water in aquifers during a wet season and the stored water can be later utilized during the dry season forghani and peralta 2017 there are other benefits from an asr project such as agricultural water supply restoration of groundwater levels and reduction of environmental effects of streamflow diversions pyne 1995 khan et al 2008 planning and design of asr operations normally involve a sensitive balance between the amount of stored water and amount of withdrawn water considering the cost of various operations uddameri 2007 there are many cost components to asr operations which include capital costs and maintenance operation costs almulla et al 2005 and these costs may include the pumping cost injection cost and surface water treatment cost triki et al 2019 the asr operations may also be designed using multiple wells merritt 1986 these wells could either be single purpose wells where water is solely injected into the aquifer or solely pumped out of the aquifer or dual purpose wells that are used for both injection and pumping zuurbier et al 2014 sultana et al 2015 although not the focus of this study detrimental geochemical impacts of injectate and mobilization of contaminants in the receiving aquifer must be carefully considered during asr operations sun et al 2020 fakhreddine et al 2021 one of the operational aspects that has not received much attention is the scheduling of injection and pumping of these wells the concept of an asr cycle has been used for scheduling injection and pumping activities merritt 1986 the performance of an asr cycle can be quantitatively evaluated through the established concept of recovery efficiency lowry and anderson 2006 ward et al 2009 lu et al 2011 guo et al 2015 forghani and peralta 2017 it is worth emphasizing that utilization of groundwater and transport models can facilitate measuring the asr performance recovery efficiency is the fraction of injected water injectate being extracted out of an aquifer during the pumping period to calculate the recovery efficiency injectate needs to be tracked during the asr cycle solute transport models are normally coupled with groundwater flow models to track the injectate lowry and anderson 2006 a basic assumption employed in this approach is to assume a non zero solute concentration for injectate while considering a zero concentration for native water in the aquifer forghani and peralta 2018 previous studies have shown that the density effect buoyancy effect can be ignored as long as dispersive mixing is dominant and difference in density between injectate and native water is not large pavelic et al 2006 ward et al 2007 ward et al 2009 minsley et al 2011 hence groundwater models with constant fluid density is suitable for most asr operation assessments hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity in groundwater flow models and transport parameters such as dispersivity in solute transport models introduce uncertainty into recovery efficiency calculation it is a common practice to generate realizations based on probability distribution of various parameters and conduct statistical analysis of model outputs for evaluating uncertainties fu and gómez hernández 2009 refsgaard et al 2012 needless to say that including history matching techniques for estimating parameters significantly adds to computational burden of uncertainty quantification in presence of all of these complexities numerous runs of groundwater flow models and transport models become computationally expensive uncertainty quantification can become intractable without the aid of surrogate models which mimics the behavior of flow and transport models keating et al 2010 razavi et al 2012 supervised artificial neural networks ann have been demonstrated to be powerful surrogate models for groundwater flow and transport models yan and minsker 2006 yan and minsker 2011 luo and lu 2014 in addition to ann models deep learning approaches have shown promising results for flow and transport models chen et al 2021a the deep learning methods may also be utilized to generate subsurface structures in case of availability of sufficient data zhan et al 2022 due to robust and satisfying performance in groundwater and transport modeling the ann models were adopted as a machine learning method for prediction of groundwater levels and concentrations in this study nourani et al 2008 barzegar et al 2017 bedi et al 2020 this study introduces a supervised learning method with an evolutionary optimization algorithm to optimize asr operations under parameter uncertainty the objectives of an asr operation are 1 to maximize the amount of injectate stored in the aquifer during the storage phase and 2 to maximize the recovery efficiency during the recovery phase to demonstrate the results of this bi objective optimization problem where the objectives are conflicting outcomes are represented on pareto fronts where a trade off between objectives can be recognized reed et al 2013 reed and kollat 2013 trindade et al 2017 akhtar and shoemaker 2019 wang et al 2022 bau and lee 2011 uncertainty of the pareto front of the two objectives are investigated by considering uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity other sources of uncertainties are not considered due to extensive computational requirements to optimize asr operations considering the uncertainties in these parameters a supervised ann method is employed as a substitute for the groundwater and the transport models this study is organized into six sections including this introduction section section 2 describes the mathematical methodologies including uncertainty assessment as well as the formulation of the optimization problem section 3 introduces the study area section 4 provides the specifics of the groundwater flow model the transport model the ann models and the optimization model section 5 discusses the results section 6 summarizes the key conclusions of this study 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of asr operation optimization performance of an asr well is evaluated for an asr cycle which includes one storage phase and one recovery phase each phase involves several individual pumping injection stress periods the storage phase starts at t 0 and ends at t 1 the recovery phase immediately follows the storage phase and ends at t 2 the injection rates are constrained between i min and i max and the pumping rates are constrained between q min and q max the asr well is allowed to be inactive for certain periods where the injection pumping rate is set to zero the bi objective asr well operation optimization problem can be defined as 1 max f 1 t t 0 t 1 δ t u t i t 2 max f 2 t t 1 t 2 δ t v t q t c t t t 0 t 1 δ t u t i t c 0 subject to 3 i t i t if h t 1 h max 0 otherwise 4 q t q t if h t 1 h min 0 otherwise 5 i min i t i max 6 q min q t q max 7 t t 0 t 1 u t 1 t t 1 t 2 v t 1 u t v t 0 1 where δ t is the time interval of stress period t day i t and q t denote the injection and pumping rates m3 day respectively during the stress period t c t is the concentration of injectate in the aquifer at the end of stress period t c 0 is the initial injectate concentration h t is the groundwater level m at the end of stress period t u t and v t are binary variables to indicate injection and pumping activeness respectively u t 1 indicates that injection occurs with injection rate i t at stress period t v t 1 indicates that pumping occurs with pumping rate q t at stress period t the first objective eq 1 maximizes the amount of injectate into the aquifer during the storage phase the second objective eq 2 maximizes the injectate recovery efficiency during the recovery phase forghani and peralta 2018 the two objectives conflict with each other because f1 is in the denominator of f2 eq 3 and eq 4 are managerial constraints where the injection is not allowed when the groundwater level is above a threshold h max and pumping is prohibited when the groundwater level is below a threshold h min eq 5 and eq 6 are bound constraints for injection rates and pumping rates respectively when the pumps are active eq 7 guarantees at least one active injection stress period and at least one active pumping stress period since asr sites are typically small this study assumes that the aquifer is homogeneous with respect to hydraulic conductivity and porosity the asr operation optimization problem contains both continuous variables and binary variables consider the length of one asr cycle to be a year with 12 monthly stress periods the first 6 months are for the storage phase and the last 6 months are for the recovery phase as they resemble two natural phases of wet season and dry season in a year there are 12 binary variables u t v t by which the schedule is determined there are also 12 continuous variables i t q t where the injection rates and pumping rates are assigned the product of these binary and continuous variables results in injection rate or pumping rate for each stress period owing to the nonlinearity of the second objective function and groundwater level constraints the optimization problem becomes a mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp problem the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 has been shown to be a promising approach for solving minlp problems pasandideh et al 2015 rabbani et al 2019 chen et al 2021b yin et al 2020 the nsga ii algorithm utilizes the standard ga processes and can be summarized in 6 steps 1 population initialization 2 non dominated sorting 3 crowding distance 4 selection 5 genetic operations mutation and cross over 6 and recombination and selection although the nsga ii algorithm is selected for this study other evolutionary methods such as multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso with outputs of non dominated fronts can also be employed 2 2 uncertainty in model parameters and lhs sampling it is well known that the optimal solutions to asr operations will be impacted by various uncertainties that can include a wide range of model parameter and model structure uncertainties this study specifically focuses on uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity values used in the groundwater flow equation and dispersivity values used in the solution transpose equation since the injectate plume is highly sensitive to these two model parameters this study adopts the latin hypercube sampling lhs method to generate realizations of hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity values to address the uncertainty issues since the core to a successful monte carlo simulation is the sampling method doucet et al 2006 a better exploration of the parameter space would help perform a more thorough uncertainty assessment lack of a robust sampling method could introduce a computational curse janssen 2013 where the computation time and the number of model runs for unnecessary sampled points hinder the progress stratified sampling where different parts of a population is proportionally represented is necessary for a thorough probe of the sample space neyman 1992 imbens and lancaster 1996 in this study pairs of parameters for hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity are generated based on latin hypercube sampling lhs which is a stratified sampling approach iman and conover 1982 helton and davis 2003 an lhs process for sampling two parameters is illustrated in the supplementary material fig s1 2 3 supervised learning based surrogate modeling method calculating groundwater level h t and concentration c t at the end of each stress period for the asr operation optimization problem can be intractable if the groundwater flow equation and solution transport equations are directly solved this computational burden can be resolved by using surrogate models to efficiently produce groundwater levels and concentrations in the optimization framework the application of ann in groundwater and solute transport modeling has been well documented in nourani et al 2008 barzegar et al 2017 and bedi et al 2020 prediction accuracy can be improved through adaptive design based surrogate modeling approach that adaptively combines the favorable characteristics of different surrogate models zhang et al 2012 2 4 parameter and objective function uncertainties to conduct in depth uncertainty analysis a representative solution for each pareto front that is obtained by solving eq 1 to eq 7 for each set of parameters is selected in order to reduce computational requirements let z be the number of pareto fronts which is equal to the number of discrete parameter pairs at the first level all the pareto fronts are ranked to determine the representative fronts at the end all the pareto fronts will be ranked as the 1st the 2nd the zth we name the 1st the z 2 th and the zth pareto fronts as the superior front the median front and the inferior front respectively and interpret them as representative pareto fronts that cover the entire range of pareto solutions analyzing entire pareto fronts requires extensive computational resources to determine the ranks of the pareto fronts the non dominated sorting deb et al 2002 is utilized the ranking process is performed as follows i label the solutions of a given pareto front in order to distinguish them from the rest of the pareto fronts ii run non dominated sorting on the batch of all solutions of all pareto fronts to obtain non dominated solutions iii determine the pareto front with the most non dominated solutions belonging to as the 1st rank pareto front or the superior front iv by removing all solutions of the 1st rank pareto front from the batch repeat steps ii and iii to determine the 2nd rank pareto front v repeat step iv to determine ranks for the 3rd the 4th the zth rank pareto fronts at the second level a representative solution is selected on each of the superior front the median front and the inferior front the concept of the knee point a point on non dominated front for which a small gain in one objective costs a big loss on another objective is applied to choose the representative solutions zhang et al 2014 ramirez atencia et al 2017 hamada and chiba 2017 there are optimization methods to identify the knee point based on the trade off characteristics of the objective functions such as the hypervolume zhang et al 2014 the sum of objectives rachmawati and srinivasan 2006 the proper utility shukla et al 2013 and the angle based knee point selection yue et al 2017 this study utilizes das characterization das 1999 to identify the knee points of bi objective pareto fronts the method is predicated upon calculation of distance between a given solution on pareto front and the extreme line l as shown in fig 2 the extreme line l passes through extreme solutions s1 and s2 of a given pareto front where f1 and f2 have their lowest values on the front the basic assumption of the das characterization is that the knee point corresponds to the maximum bulge d4 of the pareto front as the final step a sensitivity analysis at knee points is performed to find out how the asr efficiency is affected through the parameter space for varieties of injection rates and pumping rates the second objective function f2 is the target random function in this study sensitivity of the first objective is not of interest due to obvious relationship between the first objective function and hydraulic conductivity k and as longitudinal dispersivity α t does not relate to the first objective function the sensitivity of the second objective function to parameters at knee points is investigated through the variogram analysis of response surfaces vars razavi and gupta 2016 k and α t are the focused random variables for sensitivity analysis in order to avoid the issue of incompatible rates of variability for different parameters and to have a unique range for which the impacts of different parameters can be compared with each other the parameters are scaled within their maximum and minimum values razavi and gupta 2016 hence k and α t are scaled by their upper and lower limits as k k k min k max k min and α t α t α t min α t max α t min by scaling so the variograms γ of f2 at distance lags δ k and δ α t are defined as 8 γ δ k 1 2 e f 2 k δ k f 2 k 2 9 γ δ α l 1 2 e f 2 α l δ α l f 2 α l 2 where e is the expectation operator the variograms will show the variability of f2 with respect to scaled lags of k and α t which indeed gives the flexibility of comparing f2 with respect to variations of the two dimensionally different parameters 3 hypothetical asr study site in southwest louisiana louisiana currently does not have an asr site however the concept of asr can be used to mitigate groundwater problems in louisiana s coastal zone which is routinely impacted by flooding and salinization this study targets a potential asr operation site based on the site selection suitability analysis for southwest louisiana conducted by lahaye et al 2021 the easy access to surface freshwater through local streams and suitable hydrogeologic characteristics of the underlying aquifer were the key criteria for selecting this potential asr field demonstration site the geochemical impacts of injected water could be investigated in future studies as water quality data become available fig 3 shows the location of the study area in the north of vermillion parish louisiana the model domain is 4 km by 4 km the surface water source for the asr operation may come from bayou grand marais the study area is covered by 27 meter thick clay layer at the top and is underlain by the thick undifferentiated sand of the chicot aquifer system vahdat aboueshagh and tsai 2021 the undifferentiated sand is heavily pumped for agricultural purposes and a large cone of depression has been created in the region fendick and nyman 1987 lovelace et al 2004 the adjacency to the gulf of mexico also makes this region prone to saltwater encroachment 4 modeling setup 4 1 groundwater flow model a modflow groundwater model harbaugh 2005 for the study area was developed based on the hydrogeological information generated from a previously developed groundwater model vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 the model vertical extent is from land surface around 1 m down to 260 m navd 88 the horizontal cells size is 25 m the model constitutes 24 layers with non uniform thickness the first layer and the last layer are confining layers for the year 2015 the groundwater level of 9 m navd 88 was used as the constant head boundary condition the initial groundwater level was 8 70 m navd 88 12 monthly stress periods were used for discretizing a one year long asr cycle the asr well screen was assumed to be from elevation of 129 m to 140 m navd 88 hydrogeologic properties of sand and clay were assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the specific storage and hydraulic conductivity values of sand are 1 9 10 5 m 1 and 45 6 m day respectively vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 previous studies suggested that natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivity ln k for an aquifer follows a normal distribution benson 1993 yeh and liu 2000 zhao and illman 2021 vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 derived the mean and standard deviation for ln k to be 3 82 and 0 74 respectively for the study site after appropriate model calibration the porosity of the aquifer was assumed 0 3 anisotropy and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and porosity may have effects on the solutions and were not explored in this study future studies could assess these effects 4 2 transport model this study employed the mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to track the injectate in the aquifer during the asr cycle to distinguish injectate from native groundwater the injected water is assumed to contain an imaginary conservative solute forghani and peralta 2017 with concentration of 1000 mg l probably the most challenging parameter in the contaminant transport models is the value of dispersivity burnett and frind 1987a b due to our lack of knowledge about the nature of dispersive processes in groundwater systems frind et al 1987 the longitudinal dispersivity is indeed an important uncertain parameter in this study the longitudinal dispersivity α l is assumed to be a constant and assumed to follow a uniform probability distribution with a lower and an upper bound of 0 05 m and 100 m respectively xu and eckstein 1995 schulze makuch 2005 assuming lower values of the longitudinal dispersivity leads to sharp fronts with advection dominant behavior while the higher values leads to mixed plumes having dispersion dominant behavior konikow 2011 the horizontal transverse dispersivity α h is assumed to be 0 1 of the longitudinal dispersivity and the ratio of vertical transverse dispersivity α v to longitudinal dispersivity is assumed to be 0 01 zheng and wang 1999 4 3 lhs sampling and model runs in this study 100 pairs of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity values were generated based on the lhs every pair was used to build a groundwater flow model and a solute transport model given a set of injection rates and pumping rates the simulation models took approximately 5 min on a single core of the lsu supermike ii cluster to calculate groundwater level and concentration for 12 months 4 4 ann models development with parallel computing for 12 stress periods 1000 random sets of injection rates and pumping rates i t and q t together with 1000 random sets of binary values u t and v t were generated the only consideration in sampling sets of u t and v t is the one shown in eq 7 these sets along with 100 generated pairs of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity were employed to train and validate ann models for predicting groundwater levels and concentrations for 12 months in the asr operation optimization problem all of the 105 modflow and mt3dms models were run on 100 processers parallelly on the lsu supermike ii cluster each processor ran 1000 pairs of modflow and mt3dms models the recorded groundwater levels from modflow and concentrations from mt3dms were input into ann models we developed an ann model for predicting groundwater level at the end of each stress period and another ann model for predicting concentration at the end of each pumping stress period therefore there are a total of 1800 ann models a total of 100 parallel processors were utilized in parallel mode eighteen 18 ann models were trained on each processor for predicting groundwater levels and concentrations for each pair of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity all the anns are feedforward networks with a single hidden layer of 5 neurons the training of the anns were performed in the parallel mode the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm was utilized to minimize the mean square error mse cost function of the network ampazis and perantonis 2000 singh et al 2007 the architectures of the ann models were finalized through trial and error razavi et al 2012 the proportions of training data testing data and validation data were determined as 70 15 and 15 respectively which are in accordance with the numbers reported in previous studies bowden et al 2002 shahin et al 2004 the activation function of the hidden layer was set to the sigmoid function as it has been proved to be the best performer in capturing non linearity of the modelled natural system nourani et al 2008 the number of epochs was 928 on average for different models the error average in groundwater level in different stress periods is less than 10 2 m in all the training testing and validation sets the great performance of the ann on groundwater level approximation has been reported frequently nourani et al 2008 trichakis et al 2011 the error average in concentration in all the sets reduces continuously from 19 ml l in the 7th stress period to 7 ml l in the last stress period the relatively higher concentration error in the 7th stress period is due probably to the complex behavior of the aquifer in transitioning from injection to pumping however the errors in concentration are all less than 2 which is satisfactory 4 5 optimization model with parallel computing for each pair of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity values the nsga ii deb et al 2002 was utilized to solve the bi objective minlp problem eq 1 eq 7 the h max and h min were considered as 2 m above and 2 m below the initial groundwater head in the aquifer respectively which guarantees that the groundwater level will remain in the holocene clay layer the minimum injection rate and minimum pumping rate were set to 4 000 m3 day roughly 1 million gallon per day the maximum injection rate and maximum pumping rate were set to 40 000 m3 day roughly 10 million gallon per day the minimum and maximum rates were chosen based on pumping in the study region the population size of 120 and generation size of 480 were set up for the nsga ii parallel computations were performed to solve the 100 asr optimization problems simultaneously table 1 lists the data used in the simulation models the ann models and the optimization model fig 4 shows the flowchart of methodology from sampling parameters to developing modflow mt3dms models to training validating ann models to solving the asr operations optimization problem and to analyzing pareto solutions 5 results and discussion 5 1 optimal solutions under uncertainty the results of 100 pareto fronts given 100 pairs of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity are shown in fig 5 the pareto fronts with the 1st rank the superior front the 50th rank the median front and the 100th rank the inferior front and their knee points were determined and shown in the figure the injectate amount f1 of pareto fronts ranges between the minimum amount of 1 2 105 m3 and 6 9 106 m3 that is close to the maximum amount based on the upper limit eq 5 this means that almost the maximum amount of injection may be exploited in some parameter sets the injectate recovery efficiency f2 varies between 0 1 and 5 1 which falls within the mathematical range of 0 6 for objective 2 based on the lower and upper limits eq 5 and eq 6 f2 1 indicates that the amount of extraction is higher than the amount of injectate in order to achieve a higher recovery efficiency because of the injectate dispersion in the aquifer thomas et al 2000 the diversity of the solutions of a pareto front decreases as from the higher rank to the lower rank of pareto fronts as the superior median and inferior fronts demonstrate in other words the higher the rank of a pareto front the more diverse the asr scheduling becomes to further investigate the effect of the parameters on the pareto fronts fig 6 a shows a general increasing trend in hydraulic conductivity k towards higher ranks of pareto fronts since pareto fronts with higher ranks have wider f1 and f2 values fig 6a indicates that an aquifer with a higher hydraulic conductivity field can give broader asr operation options because of lower fluctuations in groundwater level under higher injection and pumping rates on the contrary lower ratios of longitudinal dispersivity to hydraulic conductivity αl k fig 6b result in pareto solutions with higher ranks the ratio αl k was chosen since it adequately represents the ratio of the injectate amount to the extraction amount in f2 eq 2 high value of αl k implies lower values of k which leads to a lower amount of injectate reduction in f1 and lower pumping rates and leads to lower ranks of pareto fronts on the other hand lower value of αl corresponds to lower spread of injectate smaller bubble with high concentration ward et al 2007 which leads to high ranks of pareto fronts to complement the analysis the upper limit value of f2 on each pareto front with respect to corresponding αl k is shown in fig 7 this result is consistent with previous analyses that higher αl k tents to produce low rank pareto fronts which have lower values of the upper limit of f2 the upper limit of f2 approaches 0 when αl k 4 day 1 5 2 uncertainties in asr scheduling fig 8 a shows the operation occurrence probability for each stress period the operation occurrence refers to occurrence of either injection or pumping in a single stress period the probability is the average of ut or vt for each stress period over 12 000 pareto solutions on average the occurrence probability increases from 0 33 in the storage phase to 0 53 in the recovery phase indicating that the number of pumping operations is greater than the number of injection operations in both phases the operation occurrence probability increases towards the end of the phase the variation of the operation occurrence probability in the recovery phase is less than that in the storage phase in other words pumping occurrence is steadier throughout the entire recovery phase while injection occurrence is more likely near the end of the storage phase the low injection occurrence probabilities in the 1st and the 2nd stress periods indicate high certainty that the beginning of the storage phase is not recommended to store water into the aquifer in opposition the pumping occurrence probabilities close to 0 5 in the 8th and the 9th stress periods indicate the most uncertain stress periods as scheduling pumping in those periods are less predictable the average injection rate and the average pumping rate for each stress period over the 12 000 pareto solutions are provided in fig 8b the similar pattern for the operation occurrence probability indicates that the higher the number of operations the higher the volume of injectate or extraction the average injection rate is 5 200 m3 day and the average pumping rate is 7 200 m3 day this significant difference stems from the fact that injectate disperses in the aquifer as time passes thomas et al 2000 hence more miscible water needs to be extracted to achieve a higher asr efficiency the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity and the asr schedule is also investigated as shown in fig 9 the steady increase of number of active stress periods as the values of k increases is consistent with the previous discussions that an aquifer with a higher hydraulic conductivity field can give broader asr operation options the percent of the pareto solutions shows a decreasing trend as the number of active stress periods expands more than 50 of the pareto solutions have less than 6 active stress periods and only less than 10 of the pareto solutions have more than 9 active stress periods further analysis of pareto fronts obtained by the method in this study could be performed considering risk tolerant or risk averse polices in future studies white et al 2022 the hydraulic conductivity also affects the amount of injectate and extracted water during asr operations fig 10 shows increasing average volumes of injection and extraction for every pareto front with increasing hydraulic conductivity the gap between the volumes of extracted water and injected water widens as the hydraulic conductivity increases due to higher dispersion of injectate at higher hydraulic conductivity the injectate travels further away from the asr well which allows higher injectate volumes and leads to a bigger stored bubble ward et al 2007 consequently the wider bubble causes higher pumping rates in order to maximize the recovery lowry and anderson 2006 5 3 variation of groundwater level and concentration variation of groundwater levels at the asr well across all the pareto solutions in each stress period is shown in fig 11 a the last two stress periods stress period 5 and 6 of the storage phase have the largest variation in groundwater level while the least groundwater level variation corresponds to the first two stress periods these variations in groundwater level align with the probability of operation occurrence for stress periods explained in fig 8a the recovery phase has relatively small groundwater level variation nevertheless the range of groundwater level increases towards the end of the recovery phase concentration and its variation at the asr well in the recovery phase decrease with time as shown in fig 11b moreover the maximum concentration of each stress period reduces monotonically from the beginning to the end of the recovery phase the maximum concentration of the last stress period is 450 mg l indicating that concentration at the asr well is less than half of its initial concentration at the end of asr regardless of the scheduling and injection and pumping rates 5 4 variogram of f2 at knee points to extend the uncertainty analysis the uncertainty of the second objective function f2 with respect to uncertainty k and αl was expressed via variograms at the knee points of the superior front median front and inferior front as shown in fig 12 the values of k and αl were uniformly sampled from their corresponding parameter ranges the meaningful distance lag is up to 50 of the parameter range razavi and gupta 2016 according to the variograms αl uncertainty has more effect on the f2 uncertainty compared to the effect of k uncertainty on the f2 uncertainty in all three knee points it is concluded that based on the given ranges of parameters recovery efficiency is most sensitive to αl 6 conclusions this study formulates and solves a multi objective minlp optimization problem under uncertainty to optimally schedule operations for a one year asr operation cycle of injection and pumping the incorporation of the ann surrogate modeling into the minlp shows promising results and very satisfying computational performance through analysis of the pareto fronts it was revealed that the efficiency of asr is highly affected by the longitudinal dispersivity better performance of asr in terms of the amount of injectate is achieved with higher values of hydraulic conductivity better performance of asr in terms of injectate recovery efficiency is achieved with higher ratios of longitudinal dispersivity to hydraulic conductivity investigating the schedule of asr across pareto solutions showed that injection near the end of the storage phase and pumping near the end of the recovery phase are likely to be robust policies the pumping events tend to spread over the recovery phase while the injection events are mostly likely to occur at the end of the storage phase the pareto solutions for robust policies demonstrate that more than 50 of the optimal solutions include a schedule with less than 6 active stress periods either injection or pumping over a 12 stress period cycle in robust policies the volume of extracted water mostly exceeds the volume of injectate in optimal solutions and the gap between the volumes increases with higher values of hydraulic conductivity this difference is attributable to the expansion of stored bubble with lower injectate concentration in aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity the analysis of the groundwater levels variation showed that the variation in the groundwater levels is the most at the end of injection period which is due to higher uncertainties associated with the end of the storage phase the variation of injectate concentration diminishes with time through the recovery phase due to either pumping or dilution with the native groundwater the proposed method in this study can be applied to asr scheduling problems with more than one cycle and may be researched in future studies credit authorship contribution statement hamid vahdat aboueshagh conceptualization methodology software

3041,aquifer storage and recovery asr is an important water management approach to store excess surface water into aquifers for later use quantitative evaluation of asr performance is not a trivial task and yet becomes more exacting when uncertainty analysis is added to the dimensionality of the problem inclusion of uncertainty into the framework of scheduling optimal asr operations also increases the level of complexity this study integrates a surrogate modeling approach coupled with a mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp algorithm to optimize multi objective asr operations the uncertainties are analyzed based upon a thorough sampling of the parameters space as well as a novel analysis of pareto fronts and variograms of representative solutions knee point of representative pareto fronts is selected for in depth analysis as a solution to the dimensionality of the problem artificial neural network ann is employed to generate surrogate models for predicting groundwater levels and injectate distribution within the aquifer during asr operations the computational complexity in building a large number of anns and deriving of numerous pareto fronts via solving the minlp problem are overcome by the assistance of parallel computing the results show that optimal asr operations are highly influenced by hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity higher hydraulic conductivity values lead to a higher number of active stress periods during storage and recovery phases which requires large volume of extraction to recover the dispersed injectate in contrast higher ratios of longitudinal dispersivity to hydraulic conductivity adversely impact the injectate recovery efficiency through meaningful representation of objective function uncertainty by variograms it is inferred that injectate recovery efficiency is more sensitive to longitudinal dispersivity than hydraulic conductivity keywords aquifer storage and recovery multi objective optimization surrogate modeling artificial neural network uncertainty analysis knee point of pareto front data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquifer storage and recovery asr is an important water resource management method that can be used to store excess surface water into aquifers via artificial recharge forghani 2018 the recharge can be accomplished by using various systems such as injection wells infiltration basins and infiltration galleries that can use excess surface water reclaimed water and stormwater and water from other aquifers sheng 2005 dillon et al 2009 there are two major phases in asr operations 1 storage phase and 2 recovery phase the asr can be classified as a category of managed aquifer recharge mar maliva 2014 in asr the recharged water mixes with native water which is then extracted from aquifer during the recovery phase during asr the storage phase injection is normally followed by the recovery phase extraction this study focuses on optimal scheduling of asr operations where the storage and recovery phases are designed through injection of non native water into the aquifer and subsequent extraction of stored groundwater from the aquifer using the same asr well fig 1 shows an asr operation well installed in a confined aquifer as shown in the figure the process of water injection raises the groundwater level at the injection point and around the well the groundwater raise leads to the development of an outward gradient from the asr well this mechanism can be used to develop hydraulic barriers that can force brackish saline water away in aquifers shammas 2008 pyne 2015 the rise in groundwater level can also help alleviate land subsidence in coastal areas where land loss is a core issue lu et al 2011 in addition to acting as a hydraulic barrier an asr well can be used for storing surface water in aquifers during a wet season and the stored water can be later utilized during the dry season forghani and peralta 2017 there are other benefits from an asr project such as agricultural water supply restoration of groundwater levels and reduction of environmental effects of streamflow diversions pyne 1995 khan et al 2008 planning and design of asr operations normally involve a sensitive balance between the amount of stored water and amount of withdrawn water considering the cost of various operations uddameri 2007 there are many cost components to asr operations which include capital costs and maintenance operation costs almulla et al 2005 and these costs may include the pumping cost injection cost and surface water treatment cost triki et al 2019 the asr operations may also be designed using multiple wells merritt 1986 these wells could either be single purpose wells where water is solely injected into the aquifer or solely pumped out of the aquifer or dual purpose wells that are used for both injection and pumping zuurbier et al 2014 sultana et al 2015 although not the focus of this study detrimental geochemical impacts of injectate and mobilization of contaminants in the receiving aquifer must be carefully considered during asr operations sun et al 2020 fakhreddine et al 2021 one of the operational aspects that has not received much attention is the scheduling of injection and pumping of these wells the concept of an asr cycle has been used for scheduling injection and pumping activities merritt 1986 the performance of an asr cycle can be quantitatively evaluated through the established concept of recovery efficiency lowry and anderson 2006 ward et al 2009 lu et al 2011 guo et al 2015 forghani and peralta 2017 it is worth emphasizing that utilization of groundwater and transport models can facilitate measuring the asr performance recovery efficiency is the fraction of injected water injectate being extracted out of an aquifer during the pumping period to calculate the recovery efficiency injectate needs to be tracked during the asr cycle solute transport models are normally coupled with groundwater flow models to track the injectate lowry and anderson 2006 a basic assumption employed in this approach is to assume a non zero solute concentration for injectate while considering a zero concentration for native water in the aquifer forghani and peralta 2018 previous studies have shown that the density effect buoyancy effect can be ignored as long as dispersive mixing is dominant and difference in density between injectate and native water is not large pavelic et al 2006 ward et al 2007 ward et al 2009 minsley et al 2011 hence groundwater models with constant fluid density is suitable for most asr operation assessments hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity in groundwater flow models and transport parameters such as dispersivity in solute transport models introduce uncertainty into recovery efficiency calculation it is a common practice to generate realizations based on probability distribution of various parameters and conduct statistical analysis of model outputs for evaluating uncertainties fu and gómez hernández 2009 refsgaard et al 2012 needless to say that including history matching techniques for estimating parameters significantly adds to computational burden of uncertainty quantification in presence of all of these complexities numerous runs of groundwater flow models and transport models become computationally expensive uncertainty quantification can become intractable without the aid of surrogate models which mimics the behavior of flow and transport models keating et al 2010 razavi et al 2012 supervised artificial neural networks ann have been demonstrated to be powerful surrogate models for groundwater flow and transport models yan and minsker 2006 yan and minsker 2011 luo and lu 2014 in addition to ann models deep learning approaches have shown promising results for flow and transport models chen et al 2021a the deep learning methods may also be utilized to generate subsurface structures in case of availability of sufficient data zhan et al 2022 due to robust and satisfying performance in groundwater and transport modeling the ann models were adopted as a machine learning method for prediction of groundwater levels and concentrations in this study nourani et al 2008 barzegar et al 2017 bedi et al 2020 this study introduces a supervised learning method with an evolutionary optimization algorithm to optimize asr operations under parameter uncertainty the objectives of an asr operation are 1 to maximize the amount of injectate stored in the aquifer during the storage phase and 2 to maximize the recovery efficiency during the recovery phase to demonstrate the results of this bi objective optimization problem where the objectives are conflicting outcomes are represented on pareto fronts where a trade off between objectives can be recognized reed et al 2013 reed and kollat 2013 trindade et al 2017 akhtar and shoemaker 2019 wang et al 2022 bau and lee 2011 uncertainty of the pareto front of the two objectives are investigated by considering uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity other sources of uncertainties are not considered due to extensive computational requirements to optimize asr operations considering the uncertainties in these parameters a supervised ann method is employed as a substitute for the groundwater and the transport models this study is organized into six sections including this introduction section section 2 describes the mathematical methodologies including uncertainty assessment as well as the formulation of the optimization problem section 3 introduces the study area section 4 provides the specifics of the groundwater flow model the transport model the ann models and the optimization model section 5 discusses the results section 6 summarizes the key conclusions of this study 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of asr operation optimization performance of an asr well is evaluated for an asr cycle which includes one storage phase and one recovery phase each phase involves several individual pumping injection stress periods the storage phase starts at t 0 and ends at t 1 the recovery phase immediately follows the storage phase and ends at t 2 the injection rates are constrained between i min and i max and the pumping rates are constrained between q min and q max the asr well is allowed to be inactive for certain periods where the injection pumping rate is set to zero the bi objective asr well operation optimization problem can be defined as 1 max f 1 t t 0 t 1 δ t u t i t 2 max f 2 t t 1 t 2 δ t v t q t c t t t 0 t 1 δ t u t i t c 0 subject to 3 i t i t if h t 1 h max 0 otherwise 4 q t q t if h t 1 h min 0 otherwise 5 i min i t i max 6 q min q t q max 7 t t 0 t 1 u t 1 t t 1 t 2 v t 1 u t v t 0 1 where δ t is the time interval of stress period t day i t and q t denote the injection and pumping rates m3 day respectively during the stress period t c t is the concentration of injectate in the aquifer at the end of stress period t c 0 is the initial injectate concentration h t is the groundwater level m at the end of stress period t u t and v t are binary variables to indicate injection and pumping activeness respectively u t 1 indicates that injection occurs with injection rate i t at stress period t v t 1 indicates that pumping occurs with pumping rate q t at stress period t the first objective eq 1 maximizes the amount of injectate into the aquifer during the storage phase the second objective eq 2 maximizes the injectate recovery efficiency during the recovery phase forghani and peralta 2018 the two objectives conflict with each other because f1 is in the denominator of f2 eq 3 and eq 4 are managerial constraints where the injection is not allowed when the groundwater level is above a threshold h max and pumping is prohibited when the groundwater level is below a threshold h min eq 5 and eq 6 are bound constraints for injection rates and pumping rates respectively when the pumps are active eq 7 guarantees at least one active injection stress period and at least one active pumping stress period since asr sites are typically small this study assumes that the aquifer is homogeneous with respect to hydraulic conductivity and porosity the asr operation optimization problem contains both continuous variables and binary variables consider the length of one asr cycle to be a year with 12 monthly stress periods the first 6 months are for the storage phase and the last 6 months are for the recovery phase as they resemble two natural phases of wet season and dry season in a year there are 12 binary variables u t v t by which the schedule is determined there are also 12 continuous variables i t q t where the injection rates and pumping rates are assigned the product of these binary and continuous variables results in injection rate or pumping rate for each stress period owing to the nonlinearity of the second objective function and groundwater level constraints the optimization problem becomes a mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp problem the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 has been shown to be a promising approach for solving minlp problems pasandideh et al 2015 rabbani et al 2019 chen et al 2021b yin et al 2020 the nsga ii algorithm utilizes the standard ga processes and can be summarized in 6 steps 1 population initialization 2 non dominated sorting 3 crowding distance 4 selection 5 genetic operations mutation and cross over 6 and recombination and selection although the nsga ii algorithm is selected for this study other evolutionary methods such as multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso with outputs of non dominated fronts can also be employed 2 2 uncertainty in model parameters and lhs sampling it is well known that the optimal solutions to asr operations will be impacted by various uncertainties that can include a wide range of model parameter and model structure uncertainties this study specifically focuses on uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity values used in the groundwater flow equation and dispersivity values used in the solution transpose equation since the injectate plume is highly sensitive to these two model parameters this study adopts the latin hypercube sampling lhs method to generate realizations of hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity values to address the uncertainty issues since the core to a successful monte carlo simulation is the sampling method doucet et al 2006 a better exploration of the parameter space would help perform a more thorough uncertainty assessment lack of a robust sampling method could introduce a computational curse janssen 2013 where the computation time and the number of model runs for unnecessary sampled points hinder the progress stratified sampling where different parts of a population is proportionally represented is necessary for a thorough probe of the sample space neyman 1992 imbens and lancaster 1996 in this study pairs of parameters for hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity are generated based on latin hypercube sampling lhs which is a stratified sampling approach iman and conover 1982 helton and davis 2003 an lhs process for sampling two parameters is illustrated in the supplementary material fig s1 2 3 supervised learning based surrogate modeling method calculating groundwater level h t and concentration c t at the end of each stress period for the asr operation optimization problem can be intractable if the groundwater flow equation and solution transport equations are directly solved this computational burden can be resolved by using surrogate models to efficiently produce groundwater levels and concentrations in the optimization framework the application of ann in groundwater and solute transport modeling has been well documented in nourani et al 2008 barzegar et al 2017 and bedi et al 2020 prediction accuracy can be improved through adaptive design based surrogate modeling approach that adaptively combines the favorable characteristics of different surrogate models zhang et al 2012 2 4 parameter and objective function uncertainties to conduct in depth uncertainty analysis a representative solution for each pareto front that is obtained by solving eq 1 to eq 7 for each set of parameters is selected in order to reduce computational requirements let z be the number of pareto fronts which is equal to the number of discrete parameter pairs at the first level all the pareto fronts are ranked to determine the representative fronts at the end all the pareto fronts will be ranked as the 1st the 2nd the zth we name the 1st the z 2 th and the zth pareto fronts as the superior front the median front and the inferior front respectively and interpret them as representative pareto fronts that cover the entire range of pareto solutions analyzing entire pareto fronts requires extensive computational resources to determine the ranks of the pareto fronts the non dominated sorting deb et al 2002 is utilized the ranking process is performed as follows i label the solutions of a given pareto front in order to distinguish them from the rest of the pareto fronts ii run non dominated sorting on the batch of all solutions of all pareto fronts to obtain non dominated solutions iii determine the pareto front with the most non dominated solutions belonging to as the 1st rank pareto front or the superior front iv by removing all solutions of the 1st rank pareto front from the batch repeat steps ii and iii to determine the 2nd rank pareto front v repeat step iv to determine ranks for the 3rd the 4th the zth rank pareto fronts at the second level a representative solution is selected on each of the superior front the median front and the inferior front the concept of the knee point a point on non dominated front for which a small gain in one objective costs a big loss on another objective is applied to choose the representative solutions zhang et al 2014 ramirez atencia et al 2017 hamada and chiba 2017 there are optimization methods to identify the knee point based on the trade off characteristics of the objective functions such as the hypervolume zhang et al 2014 the sum of objectives rachmawati and srinivasan 2006 the proper utility shukla et al 2013 and the angle based knee point selection yue et al 2017 this study utilizes das characterization das 1999 to identify the knee points of bi objective pareto fronts the method is predicated upon calculation of distance between a given solution on pareto front and the extreme line l as shown in fig 2 the extreme line l passes through extreme solutions s1 and s2 of a given pareto front where f1 and f2 have their lowest values on the front the basic assumption of the das characterization is that the knee point corresponds to the maximum bulge d4 of the pareto front as the final step a sensitivity analysis at knee points is performed to find out how the asr efficiency is affected through the parameter space for varieties of injection rates and pumping rates the second objective function f2 is the target random function in this study sensitivity of the first objective is not of interest due to obvious relationship between the first objective function and hydraulic conductivity k and as longitudinal dispersivity α t does not relate to the first objective function the sensitivity of the second objective function to parameters at knee points is investigated through the variogram analysis of response surfaces vars razavi and gupta 2016 k and α t are the focused random variables for sensitivity analysis in order to avoid the issue of incompatible rates of variability for different parameters and to have a unique range for which the impacts of different parameters can be compared with each other the parameters are scaled within their maximum and minimum values razavi and gupta 2016 hence k and α t are scaled by their upper and lower limits as k k k min k max k min and α t α t α t min α t max α t min by scaling so the variograms γ of f2 at distance lags δ k and δ α t are defined as 8 γ δ k 1 2 e f 2 k δ k f 2 k 2 9 γ δ α l 1 2 e f 2 α l δ α l f 2 α l 2 where e is the expectation operator the variograms will show the variability of f2 with respect to scaled lags of k and α t which indeed gives the flexibility of comparing f2 with respect to variations of the two dimensionally different parameters 3 hypothetical asr study site in southwest louisiana louisiana currently does not have an asr site however the concept of asr can be used to mitigate groundwater problems in louisiana s coastal zone which is routinely impacted by flooding and salinization this study targets a potential asr operation site based on the site selection suitability analysis for southwest louisiana conducted by lahaye et al 2021 the easy access to surface freshwater through local streams and suitable hydrogeologic characteristics of the underlying aquifer were the key criteria for selecting this potential asr field demonstration site the geochemical impacts of injected water could be investigated in future studies as water quality data become available fig 3 shows the location of the study area in the north of vermillion parish louisiana the model domain is 4 km by 4 km the surface water source for the asr operation may come from bayou grand marais the study area is covered by 27 meter thick clay layer at the top and is underlain by the thick undifferentiated sand of the chicot aquifer system vahdat aboueshagh and tsai 2021 the undifferentiated sand is heavily pumped for agricultural purposes and a large cone of depression has been created in the region fendick and nyman 1987 lovelace et al 2004 the adjacency to the gulf of mexico also makes this region prone to saltwater encroachment 4 modeling setup 4 1 groundwater flow model a modflow groundwater model harbaugh 2005 for the study area was developed based on the hydrogeological information generated from a previously developed groundwater model vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 the model vertical extent is from land surface around 1 m down to 260 m navd 88 the horizontal cells size is 25 m the model constitutes 24 layers with non uniform thickness the first layer and the last layer are confining layers for the year 2015 the groundwater level of 9 m navd 88 was used as the constant head boundary condition the initial groundwater level was 8 70 m navd 88 12 monthly stress periods were used for discretizing a one year long asr cycle the asr well screen was assumed to be from elevation of 129 m to 140 m navd 88 hydrogeologic properties of sand and clay were assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the specific storage and hydraulic conductivity values of sand are 1 9 10 5 m 1 and 45 6 m day respectively vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 previous studies suggested that natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivity ln k for an aquifer follows a normal distribution benson 1993 yeh and liu 2000 zhao and illman 2021 vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 derived the mean and standard deviation for ln k to be 3 82 and 0 74 respectively for the study site after appropriate model calibration the porosity of the aquifer was assumed 0 3 anisotropy and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and porosity may have effects on the solutions and were not explored in this study future studies could assess these effects 4 2 transport model this study employed the mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to track the injectate in the aquifer during the asr cycle to distinguish injectate from native groundwater the injected water is assumed to contain an imaginary conservative solute forghani and peralta 2017 with concentration of 1000 mg l probably the most challenging parameter in the contaminant transport models is the value of dispersivity burnett and frind 1987a b due to our lack of knowledge about the nature of dispersive processes in groundwater systems frind et al 1987 the longitudinal dispersivity is indeed an important uncertain parameter in this study the longitudinal dispersivity α l is assumed to be a constant and assumed to follow a uniform probability distribution with a lower and an upper bound of 0 05 m and 100 m respectively xu and eckstein 1995 schulze makuch 2005 assuming lower values of the longitudinal dispersivity leads to sharp fronts with advection dominant behavior while the higher values leads to mixed plumes having dispersion dominant behavior konikow 2011 the horizontal transverse dispersivity α h is assumed to be 0 1 of the longitudinal dispersivity and the ratio of vertical transverse dispersivity α v to longitudinal dispersivity is assumed to be 0 01 zheng and wang 1999 4 3 lhs sampling and model runs in this study 100 pairs of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity values were generated based on the lhs every pair was used to build a groundwater flow model and a solute transport model given a set of injection rates and pumping rates the simulation models took approximately 5 min on a single core of the lsu supermike ii cluster to calculate groundwater level and concentration for 12 months 4 4 ann models development with parallel computing for 12 stress periods 1000 random sets of injection rates and pumping rates i t and q t together with 1000 random sets of binary values u t and v t were generated the only consideration in sampling sets of u t and v t is the one shown in eq 7 these sets along with 100 generated pairs of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity were employed to train and validate ann models for predicting groundwater levels and concentrations for 12 months in the asr operation optimization problem all of the 105 modflow and mt3dms models were run on 100 processers parallelly on the lsu supermike ii cluster each processor ran 1000 pairs of modflow and mt3dms models the recorded groundwater levels from modflow and concentrations from mt3dms were input into ann models we developed an ann model for predicting groundwater level at the end of each stress period and another ann model for predicting concentration at the end of each pumping stress period therefore there are a total of 1800 ann models a total of 100 parallel processors were utilized in parallel mode eighteen 18 ann models were trained on each processor for predicting groundwater levels and concentrations for each pair of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity all the anns are feedforward networks with a single hidden layer of 5 neurons the training of the anns were performed in the parallel mode the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm was utilized to minimize the mean square error mse cost function of the network ampazis and perantonis 2000 singh et al 2007 the architectures of the ann models were finalized through trial and error razavi et al 2012 the proportions of training data testing data and validation data were determined as 70 15 and 15 respectively which are in accordance with the numbers reported in previous studies bowden et al 2002 shahin et al 2004 the activation function of the hidden layer was set to the sigmoid function as it has been proved to be the best performer in capturing non linearity of the modelled natural system nourani et al 2008 the number of epochs was 928 on average for different models the error average in groundwater level in different stress periods is less than 10 2 m in all the training testing and validation sets the great performance of the ann on groundwater level approximation has been reported frequently nourani et al 2008 trichakis et al 2011 the error average in concentration in all the sets reduces continuously from 19 ml l in the 7th stress period to 7 ml l in the last stress period the relatively higher concentration error in the 7th stress period is due probably to the complex behavior of the aquifer in transitioning from injection to pumping however the errors in concentration are all less than 2 which is satisfactory 4 5 optimization model with parallel computing for each pair of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity values the nsga ii deb et al 2002 was utilized to solve the bi objective minlp problem eq 1 eq 7 the h max and h min were considered as 2 m above and 2 m below the initial groundwater head in the aquifer respectively which guarantees that the groundwater level will remain in the holocene clay layer the minimum injection rate and minimum pumping rate were set to 4 000 m3 day roughly 1 million gallon per day the maximum injection rate and maximum pumping rate were set to 40 000 m3 day roughly 10 million gallon per day the minimum and maximum rates were chosen based on pumping in the study region the population size of 120 and generation size of 480 were set up for the nsga ii parallel computations were performed to solve the 100 asr optimization problems simultaneously table 1 lists the data used in the simulation models the ann models and the optimization model fig 4 shows the flowchart of methodology from sampling parameters to developing modflow mt3dms models to training validating ann models to solving the asr operations optimization problem and to analyzing pareto solutions 5 results and discussion 5 1 optimal solutions under uncertainty the results of 100 pareto fronts given 100 pairs of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity are shown in fig 5 the pareto fronts with the 1st rank the superior front the 50th rank the median front and the 100th rank the inferior front and their knee points were determined and shown in the figure the injectate amount f1 of pareto fronts ranges between the minimum amount of 1 2 105 m3 and 6 9 106 m3 that is close to the maximum amount based on the upper limit eq 5 this means that almost the maximum amount of injection may be exploited in some parameter sets the injectate recovery efficiency f2 varies between 0 1 and 5 1 which falls within the mathematical range of 0 6 for objective 2 based on the lower and upper limits eq 5 and eq 6 f2 1 indicates that the amount of extraction is higher than the amount of injectate in order to achieve a higher recovery efficiency because of the injectate dispersion in the aquifer thomas et al 2000 the diversity of the solutions of a pareto front decreases as from the higher rank to the lower rank of pareto fronts as the superior median and inferior fronts demonstrate in other words the higher the rank of a pareto front the more diverse the asr scheduling becomes to further investigate the effect of the parameters on the pareto fronts fig 6 a shows a general increasing trend in hydraulic conductivity k towards higher ranks of pareto fronts since pareto fronts with higher ranks have wider f1 and f2 values fig 6a indicates that an aquifer with a higher hydraulic conductivity field can give broader asr operation options because of lower fluctuations in groundwater level under higher injection and pumping rates on the contrary lower ratios of longitudinal dispersivity to hydraulic conductivity αl k fig 6b result in pareto solutions with higher ranks the ratio αl k was chosen since it adequately represents the ratio of the injectate amount to the extraction amount in f2 eq 2 high value of αl k implies lower values of k which leads to a lower amount of injectate reduction in f1 and lower pumping rates and leads to lower ranks of pareto fronts on the other hand lower value of αl corresponds to lower spread of injectate smaller bubble with high concentration ward et al 2007 which leads to high ranks of pareto fronts to complement the analysis the upper limit value of f2 on each pareto front with respect to corresponding αl k is shown in fig 7 this result is consistent with previous analyses that higher αl k tents to produce low rank pareto fronts which have lower values of the upper limit of f2 the upper limit of f2 approaches 0 when αl k 4 day 1 5 2 uncertainties in asr scheduling fig 8 a shows the operation occurrence probability for each stress period the operation occurrence refers to occurrence of either injection or pumping in a single stress period the probability is the average of ut or vt for each stress period over 12 000 pareto solutions on average the occurrence probability increases from 0 33 in the storage phase to 0 53 in the recovery phase indicating that the number of pumping operations is greater than the number of injection operations in both phases the operation occurrence probability increases towards the end of the phase the variation of the operation occurrence probability in the recovery phase is less than that in the storage phase in other words pumping occurrence is steadier throughout the entire recovery phase while injection occurrence is more likely near the end of the storage phase the low injection occurrence probabilities in the 1st and the 2nd stress periods indicate high certainty that the beginning of the storage phase is not recommended to store water into the aquifer in opposition the pumping occurrence probabilities close to 0 5 in the 8th and the 9th stress periods indicate the most uncertain stress periods as scheduling pumping in those periods are less predictable the average injection rate and the average pumping rate for each stress period over the 12 000 pareto solutions are provided in fig 8b the similar pattern for the operation occurrence probability indicates that the higher the number of operations the higher the volume of injectate or extraction the average injection rate is 5 200 m3 day and the average pumping rate is 7 200 m3 day this significant difference stems from the fact that injectate disperses in the aquifer as time passes thomas et al 2000 hence more miscible water needs to be extracted to achieve a higher asr efficiency the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity and the asr schedule is also investigated as shown in fig 9 the steady increase of number of active stress periods as the values of k increases is consistent with the previous discussions that an aquifer with a higher hydraulic conductivity field can give broader asr operation options the percent of the pareto solutions shows a decreasing trend as the number of active stress periods expands more than 50 of the pareto solutions have less than 6 active stress periods and only less than 10 of the pareto solutions have more than 9 active stress periods further analysis of pareto fronts obtained by the method in this study could be performed considering risk tolerant or risk averse polices in future studies white et al 2022 the hydraulic conductivity also affects the amount of injectate and extracted water during asr operations fig 10 shows increasing average volumes of injection and extraction for every pareto front with increasing hydraulic conductivity the gap between the volumes of extracted water and injected water widens as the hydraulic conductivity increases due to higher dispersion of injectate at higher hydraulic conductivity the injectate travels further away from the asr well which allows higher injectate volumes and leads to a bigger stored bubble ward et al 2007 consequently the wider bubble causes higher pumping rates in order to maximize the recovery lowry and anderson 2006 5 3 variation of groundwater level and concentration variation of groundwater levels at the asr well across all the pareto solutions in each stress period is shown in fig 11 a the last two stress periods stress period 5 and 6 of the storage phase have the largest variation in groundwater level while the least groundwater level variation corresponds to the first two stress periods these variations in groundwater level align with the probability of operation occurrence for stress periods explained in fig 8a the recovery phase has relatively small groundwater level variation nevertheless the range of groundwater level increases towards the end of the recovery phase concentration and its variation at the asr well in the recovery phase decrease with time as shown in fig 11b moreover the maximum concentration of each stress period reduces monotonically from the beginning to the end of the recovery phase the maximum concentration of the last stress period is 450 mg l indicating that concentration at the asr well is less than half of its initial concentration at the end of asr regardless of the scheduling and injection and pumping rates 5 4 variogram of f2 at knee points to extend the uncertainty analysis the uncertainty of the second objective function f2 with respect to uncertainty k and αl was expressed via variograms at the knee points of the superior front median front and inferior front as shown in fig 12 the values of k and αl were uniformly sampled from their corresponding parameter ranges the meaningful distance lag is up to 50 of the parameter range razavi and gupta 2016 according to the variograms αl uncertainty has more effect on the f2 uncertainty compared to the effect of k uncertainty on the f2 uncertainty in all three knee points it is concluded that based on the given ranges of parameters recovery efficiency is most sensitive to αl 6 conclusions this study formulates and solves a multi objective minlp optimization problem under uncertainty to optimally schedule operations for a one year asr operation cycle of injection and pumping the incorporation of the ann surrogate modeling into the minlp shows promising results and very satisfying computational performance through analysis of the pareto fronts it was revealed that the efficiency of asr is highly affected by the longitudinal dispersivity better performance of asr in terms of the amount of injectate is achieved with higher values of hydraulic conductivity better performance of asr in terms of injectate recovery efficiency is achieved with higher ratios of longitudinal dispersivity to hydraulic conductivity investigating the schedule of asr across pareto solutions showed that injection near the end of the storage phase and pumping near the end of the recovery phase are likely to be robust policies the pumping events tend to spread over the recovery phase while the injection events are mostly likely to occur at the end of the storage phase the pareto solutions for robust policies demonstrate that more than 50 of the optimal solutions include a schedule with less than 6 active stress periods either injection or pumping over a 12 stress period cycle in robust policies the volume of extracted water mostly exceeds the volume of injectate in optimal solutions and the gap between the volumes increases with higher values of hydraulic conductivity this difference is attributable to the expansion of stored bubble with lower injectate concentration in aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity the analysis of the groundwater levels variation showed that the variation in the groundwater levels is the most at the end of injection period which is due to higher uncertainties associated with the end of the storage phase the variation of injectate concentration diminishes with time through the recovery phase due to either pumping or dilution with the native groundwater the proposed method in this study can be applied to asr scheduling problems with more than one cycle and may be researched in future studies credit authorship contribution statement hamid vahdat aboueshagh conceptualization methodology software

3042,the lack of in situ hydrological observations especially in remote and developing areas is one of the main challenges of drought monitoring this paper proposes a novel drought index the standardized river stage index srsi based on data retrieved from satellite altimetry missions the novelties of the srsi are that it can quantitatively monitor drought of river water deficits at multiple timescales and that it does not require in situ observations the mekong river is used as the case study to demonstrate and validate the srsi calculated from the multi mission satellite altimetry data envisat and jason 2 3 the log logistic distribution is best fitted for srsi calculation for the highest goodness of fit for river stages for the mekong river the comparison with the standardized streamflow index ssi from the in situ discharge observations shows that the srsi can reasonably capture the drought of river water deficit it is effective in identifying the timing and intensity of severe drought events such as the 2019 thailand drought the srsi is also compared with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and the grace drought index in revealing drought features such that the river water deficit of mekong river has time lags of 2 to 3 months for precipitation deficits and water storage deficits hence the srsi is more suitable for monitoring drought of river water deficit because it directly links to the streamflow via physical stage discharge relationship overall the srsi provides an effective indicator of drought of river water deficit when in situ observations are unavailable it can serve in the real time drought early warning in remote and developing areas keywords hydrological drought river water deficit satellite altimetry river stage drought index mekong river data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought is caused by the water supply below a certain normal threshold for a sustain long period it is one of the most frequent widespread and disastrous natural hazards mishra and singh 2010 wilhite 2000 there generally exist meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought wmo 2006 among them hydrological drought refers to deficiencies in terrestrial water bodies such as river lakes reservoirs and groundwater which are the direct fresh water source for human society therefore attentions also should be paid to hydrological drought for it can affect the river environment farm irrigation and the municipal water supply thomas et al 2014 wu et al 2018a wu et al 2022 hydrological drought commonly stems from precipitation deficits or enhanced evapotranspiration wu et al 2021a wu et al 2021b the effect of anthropogenic activities such as dam construction and urbanization on hydrological drought is also substantial wu et al 2019 wu et al 2018b climate change and global warming have substantially altered the global water cycle exacerbated meteorological and hydrological extremes and resulted in increases in the frequency and magnitude of drought events worldwide dai 2013 increases in the severity of drought have been widely observed in recent years in southwest china bai et al 2019 barriopedro et al 2012 zhong et al 2019a california griffin and anchukaitis 2014 the amazon basin saleska et al 2007 europe sutanto et al 2020 zaitchik et al 2006 and many other regions worldwide sahoo et al 2015 van huijgevoort et al 2012 van loon et al 2012 and these drought have resulted in tremendous social and environmental losses li et al 2020a thus there is a pressing need to develop more efficient real time drought monitoring and early warning approaches to improve the impact mitigation measures under the rapidly changing environment li et al 2020b li et al 2021 sutanto et al 2020 various drought indices and tools have been developed to characterize and monitor hydrological drought the palmer hydrological drought index phdi palmer 1965 and the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 are designed for drought related to surface runoff yield deficits the groundwater resource index gri mendicino et al 2008 and standardized groundwater level index sgi bloomfield and marchant 2013 are designed for groundwater deficits and the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 is designed for river water deficits these drought indices have provided useful tools for understanding spatiotemporal variation and the mechanism underlying drought guo et al 2020 lai et al 2019 wu et al 2018a nevertheless the application of these drought indices largely depends on the quality and density of in situ observations thus their application is limited in remote areas or developing countries where in situ hydrological observations are sparse or even unavailable monitoring hydrological drought by using the simulated data output from the large scale hydrological model is a feasible solution for such areas with limited in situ observations sutanto et al 2020 van huijgevoort et al 2012 van loon et al 2012 nevertheless such modeling based approach might also require reliable meteorological data inputs and might be difficult to model the drought in reality due to the influence of human activities satellite remote sensing facilitates powerful tools for characterizing the dynamics of terrestrial water bodies on a large spatial scale duan and bastiaanssen 2013 jiao et al 2021 lettenmaier et al 2015 providing efficient and low cost approach for monitoring drought especially in ungauged regions such techniques include but are not limited to high resolution imagery which can monitor the surface area of open water bodies such as lakes reservoirs and rivers li et al 2020c pekel et al 2016 wan et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 gravity anomaly remote sensing represented by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace missions which can monitor changes in groundwater bloomfield and marchant 2013 long et al 2013 thomas et al 2017 and satellite altimetry which can monitor the water stage dynamics of lakes reservoirs and rivers boergens et al 2019 han et al 2020 sulistioadi et al 2015 zhong et al 2020 several hydrological indices also have been developed based on satellite remote sensing such as the grace groundwater drought index ggdi for ground water deficit thomas et al 2014 2017 the reservoir area drought index radi based on cloud free high resolution optical images for reservoir water deficits zhao and gao 2018 and the water level deficit index wldi based on satellite altimetry for reservoir and lake water deficit hulsman et al 2021 although river channels are a major direct fresh water source in most areas worldwide few studies have developed the drought indices for monitoring and quantifying the drought severity related to river water deficits from the aspect of remote sensing lai et al 2019 developed an approach to monitor drought of river by simulating the discharge from satellite based precipitation products and then used it to calculate ssi however this approach requires in situ discharge observations for model calibration satellite optical imagery is considered useful for estimating river dynamics huang et al 2018a sun et al 2018a however the temporal continuity of optical imagery records is usually impaired by clouds pekel et al 2016 zhao and gao 2018 in comparison the satellite altimetry based on radar ranging is virtually unaffected by weather conditions and can provide more stable estimates of the river stage huang et al 2018a tourian et al 2017 providing an alternative way for knowing the drought of river water without ground based observations various works have developed efficient algorithms to retrieve river stage and discharge from satellite altimetry with many successful applications worldwide belloni et al 2021 boergens et al 2019 huang et al 2018b schwatke et al 2015 tourian et al 2013 tourian et al 2016 tourian et al 2017 by using altimetry missions like envisat jason 2 3 huang et al 2018a and sentinel 3 series huang et al 2019 several studies have showed that current satellite altimetry have the error of only tens of centimeters for river stage chang et al 2019 huang et al 2018a paris et al 2016 some institutes also established databases providing the already retrieved water level data for inland water bodies from satellite altimetry such as the river lake database the database for hydrological time series over inland water dahiti schwatke et al 2015 https dahiti dgfi tum de and the theia data and service center https hydroweb theia land fr although satellite altimetry still has some limitations like lower accuracy than in situ observation decimeter range temporally discrete records and less applicable for small rivers its drought monitoring potential is still found for some studies for instance boergens et al 2019 made an investigation on the ability of multi mission satellite altimetry in capturing extreme low river stage over mekong basin which helps to understand the potential of satellite altimetry in monitoring flood and drought nevertheless since drought is typically caused by long term accumulation of water deficit only capturing the instantaneous water deficit events might be inadequate to reveal severity of drought in practices a summary of the previous studies using satellite remote sensing data to monitor various types of hydrological drought are presented in table 1 no studies have been found to quantitatively monitor the time step drought related to river water deficits of different time scales without in situ data which thus still needs further development the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a satellite altimetry based drought monitoring framework for use in river water deficit in ungauged areas 2 propose a novel drought index the standardized river stage index srsi for characterizing river water deficit based on river stage data from satellite altimetry and 3 validate the performance of the proposed drought monitoring framework and srsi using a case study the mekong river an important international river in southeast asia passing china myanmar vietnam laos thailand and cambodia is used as the case study for validating the srsi several studies related to satellite altimetry have been performed over mekong river including river stage discharge series construction birkinshaw et al 2010 boergens et al 2016 2017 2019 pham et al 2018 and flood forecasting chang et al 2019 but development of altimetry based drought monitoring tools has not been reported yet satellite altimetry data from the jason 2 3 missions since 2008 are used to calculate srsi in the case study with introducing the altimetry data from the envisat mission to extend the altimetry series to 2002 to satisfy the need of drought utility although the reliability of drought indices is usually sensitive to the length of input data records wu et al 2018a zhong et al 2019a sahoo et al 2015 showed that a climate record shorter than 30 years is adequate for reflecting drought conditions probably because extreme climate events occurred along with normal events in recent years this suggests the potential of using the nearly 19 year envisat jason combined series for calculating srsi overall our study provides a practical method that stakeholders could use to monitor drought of river water deficit for ungauged areas 2 methodology 2 1 the standardized river stage index srsi the concept of the srsi is based on a normal standardization procedure with a theoretical probabilistic distribution of input river stage records and a temporal aggregation procedure that accounts for the temporal accumulation of water deficits under multiple timescales vicente serrano et al 2010 the concept of normal standardization procedure has been applied in several conventional drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 nevertheless these conventional drought indices rely on a continuous observation time series input differently the satellite altimetry data are typically temporally discrete for example one record for each 10 days for jason 2 3 and for each 35 days for envisat and saral altika which might be challenge for the application in the current standardized drought indices use of such temporally discrete data in standardized drought indices still needs further development and assessment which is especially useful for ungauged basins therefore different to the former studies srsi is proposed to exploit the satellite altimetry for multi timescale quantitative drought monitoring as well as adapt to the temporally discrete record of satellite altimetry based on the revised normal standardization procedure to match up with the monitoring and updating schema of satellite altimetry missions srsi records are also temporally discrete with the timestamps corresponding to the related satellite altimetry missions as a result srsi records can be immediately updated once the latest satellite altimetry record is released which permits near real time drought monitoring to be achieved the input river stage data can be derived from the sensor geophysical data records sgdrs usually released 2 months after real time and sensor interim geophysical data records sigdrs released a few days after real time from the archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic aviso team ftp access aviso altimetry fr which are the source data format of most satellite altimetry missions including jason 2 3 and envisat both sgdrs and sigdrs need further retrieving procedure to derive usable river stage data some publicly available satellite altimetry databases like dahiti https dahiti dgfi tum de and theia https hydroweb theia land fr also provide the already retrieved river stage data using river stages from satellite altimetry as input the steps to calculate srsi are as follows fig 1 1 temporal aggregation of river stage records drought is normally caused by a water deficit that accumulates during an antecedent period not merely the water conditions at the current time the aim of this step is to make the final calculated srsi capable of reflecting the antecedent river water deficits of different timescales this is essential because the response time to the water supply and the endurable river water deficit duration usually vary greatly among different sectors vicente serrano et al 2010 for example irrigation system can endure insufficient river water supply for a few months whereas large reservoirs can endure a year to coincide with the timescales of conventional drought indices typically 1 3 6 or 12 months we used a series of timescales of 30 day 90 day 180 day and 365 day for srsi which represented the monthly seasonal semiannual and annual drought scales respectively for the temporally discrete time series the temporal aggregated river stage for timescale s is defined as the mean value of the river stages within the s days before the current date 1 h t h t t s t t n t s t t where h t is the aggregated river stage at current date t h t is the river stage record at date t and n is the number of stage records within the s days before t this procedure is performed at all river stage records note that the time interval between the satellite based river stage records is not constant especially for the multi mission merged records and the gaps between two records are sometimes one month or even longer in such cases some aggregated river stage records might be less representative of the actual antecedent water deficit through trial and error we developed a series of rules to reject some aggregated river stage records that show low representativeness while maximizing the number of usable records retained for the 30 day timescale if there are no other records during the past 30 days the current record is rejected for the 90 day timescale the past 90 days are divided into two 45 day sub periods if any sub period lacks records the current record is rejected for the 180 day timescale the past 180 days are divided into two 90 day sub periods if any sub period has less than 2 records the current record is rejected and for the 365 day timescale the past 365 days are divided into four 90 day sub periods if any sub period has less than 2 records the current record is rejected 2 theoretical probability distribution selection and parameter estimation a suitable probability distribution of the river stage from satellite altimetry needs to be specified before normal standardization can be applied to the h records according to studies that have developed standardized drought indices vicente serrano et al 2010 vicente serrano et al 2012 wu et al 2018a the normal log normal pearson iii log logistic and weibull distributions are selected as candidates to be compared and the most suitable one would be finally adopted the kolmogorov smirnov k s test is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the candidate distributions to the h records the k s test is based on the cumulative distribution function cdf and uses the d max metric maximum difference between the empirical and theoretical cdfs to quantify the goodness of fit of the distributions smaller d max value indicates better goodness of fit for a given preset significance level typically 0 05 and a sample size there is a critical value d a of d max d max d a means that the candidate distribution can be rejected under the significance level i e does not pass the k s test before theoretical distribution selection and fitting the h records are categorized into 12 parts according to the calendar month of the records timestamps and the records in different calendar months are independently fitted by the candidate theoretical distributions more specifically the parameter sets of the candidate distributions are estimated for each calendar month separately this is because the statistical distribution of hydrological data like river stage and discharge are typically different for various seasons and even calendar months huang et al 2020 svensson et al 2017 tijdeman et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2012 moreover a single river stage also means different water supply condition for different calendar months all of the parameter sets of the candidate distributions fitted to the h records are estimated via the maximum likelihood estimation method next the k s test is applied to evaluate the fitted candidate theoretical distributions the candidate distribution passes the k s test and shows the smallest d max for most vss timescales and calendar months would be finally adopted for srsi calculation this means that all the h records would use the same theoretical distribution but the parameter sets would be different for every calendar month 3 normal standardization of aggregated river stage records the srsi can be calculated by normal standardization once the theoretical probability distribution is determined for each h the calendar month of the observation time is used to select the parameter set of the fitted distribution nevertheless the parameter sets are fitted for the monthly scale but h values are temporally discrete at the sub monthly scale which might cause discontinuity in the srsi series therefore the fitted distribution parameter sets θ m would be temporally linear interpolated to the timestamps of h as 2 θ m t d p θ m 1 d 0 θ m d f θ m 1 3 d i day 1 n day 1 0 5 d p 0 5 d d d 0 1 d d f 0 5 d d where m is the current month θ m t is the interpolated distribution parameter set i day is the day of the current month n day is the number of days of the current month and d p d 0 and d f are the coefficients of linear interpolation which are the weights for the previous current and next month respectively the quantile of h which is bound by 0 and 1 can be derived as 4 p c d f h t θ m t and the srsi value is derived as 5 srsi f p where f is the inverse cdf of the standard normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 which converts the p values with a range of 0 to 1 to become the srsi values centered by 0 and with a standard deviation of 1 in this step the input h to calculate srsi is based not only on the historical records for distribution fitting but also on the newly updated records from the latest satellite altimetry data the calculated srsi at the timescale of 30 90 365 days hereafter are referred to as srsi 30 srsi 90 srsi 365 respectively the category of drought according to the srsi value follows the schemes for the spi spei and ssi table 2 2 2 existing drought indices to validate the reasonability and performance of the srsi several existing widely used drought indices based on in situ observations or other remote sensing sources are used for comparison with srsi which are listed as follows 2 2 1 standardized streamflow index ssi the ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 is calculated from the in situ discharge observations at the gauging stations for comparison with the srsi the calculation of the ssi and srsi is similar a normal standardization procedure based on a fitted theoretical distribution is used and multiple timescales can be considered typically 1 3 6 and 12 month differently the ssi typically uses monthly mean discharge as input like other conventional drought indices the reliability of ssi is also sensitive to the length of input data records although sahoo et al 2015 found that a 10 year precipitation record is adequate for meteorological drought monitoring the reliability of data records shorter than 30 years has not been verified for drought related to river water therefore the ssi is calculated for two record lengths a 19 year length period 2002 2020 close to the length of records for envisat with jason 2 3 and a 30 year length period 1991 2020 the record length recommended by wmo wu et al 2018a to validate the reliability of short record lengths for hydrological drought monitoring 2 2 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a widely used meteorological drought indices the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 is calculated for comparison with the proposed srsi the calculation of spei is similar to ssi but it uses the differences between monthly precipitation to monthly potential evapotranspiration pet as input it is typically fitted by a log logistic distribution in this study the precipitation and pet data input are firstly spatially averaged on the subbasins controlled by the virtual stations vss for comparison with the srsi at the vss and then used to calculate the spei these subbasins are extracted from the flow direction images of hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 according to the location of vss 2 2 3 grace related drought index grace twsa data have frequently been used for drought monitoring with several related drought indices proposed including but not limited to the grace drought severity index grace dsi zhao et al 2017 ggdi thomas et al 2017 water storage deficit index wsdi sun et al 2018b and drought index terrestrial water storage di tws boergens et al 2020 in this study to ensure the comparability with the srsi the grace related drought index is calculated following the calculation of the sgi bloomfield and marchant 2013 which uses a standardized procedure based on standard normal distribution that similar to ssi and srsi the calculated drought index is called standardized grace drought index sgdi following bloomfield and marchant 2013 to calculate the sgdi twsa data are firstly fitted with the specific distributions for each calendar months individually and then the quantile p is calculated by using the fitted parameter set θ m 6 p c d f t w s a m y θ m and the sgdi can be derived as 7 sgdi f p where tws a m y is the twsa value for year y total n years and calendar month m θ m is the fitted parameter set for calendar month m f is the inverse cdf of the standard normal distribution according to bloomfield and marchant 2013 the twsa input to calculate sgdi should be fitted by the best fitting distribution in this study the normal distribution is used to calculate sgdi because it is found to have the best fitness with twsa records while other distributions like log logistic are found to did not pass the k s test for twsa records in most cases thus are less suitable for sgdi calculation in this study similar to the spei the input twsa data are firstly spatially averaged over the subbasins controlled by the vss and then used to calculate the sgdi 2 3 assessment metrics in this study the performance of the proposed srsi is validated using the following procedures 1 evaluation of the adopted river stages from satellite altimetry 2 evaluation of the calculated srsi and 3 comparison of srsi with existing drought indices two widely used assessment metrics are used to assess the results of the case study the pearson correlation coefficient pcc for linear correlations and the spearman s rank correlation coefficient srcc for nonlinear correlations the pcc is used to 1 assess the accuracy of the satellite derived river stages and srsi with respect to the in situ river stage observations and ssi calculated from in situ observations at adjacent gauging stations respectively and 2 compare the srsi with existing drought indices spei and grace based drought index for the latter the pcc would be calculated for different time lags between the srsi and existing drought indices to determine the lag times of the drought propagation from meteorological drought to drought of river water deficit the pcc is calculated as 8 pcc i 1 n s i s o i o i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where s i is the series to be assessed and o i is the series used as a reference note that the sub monthly calculated srsis would be temporally averaged to the monthly scale before evaluation and comparison in the evaluation of the satellite derived river stages with respect to the in situ observations the srcc is also adopted along with pcc this is because the relationship between river stage at different river sections might be nonlinear the calculation of srcc and pcc is similar but the inputs for srcc are the ranks of the series 9 srcc i 1 n r i r ro i ro i 1 n r i r 2 i 1 n ro i ro 2 where r i are the ranks of the series to be assessed and ro i are the ranks of the series used as a reference 3 case study 3 1 study area originating in the center of the tibetan plateau the mekong river is the largest international river in southeast asia it passes through several countries including china myanmar vietnam thailand laos and cambodia and has a total length of 4909 km and a drainage area of 811 103 km2 fig 2 the discharge of the mekong river which is 3800 m3 s on average at luang prabang and 13 600 at m3 s at the kratie section is critically important to environmental preservation agricultural irrigation navigation the water supply and hydropower generation of local countries baran and myschowoda 2009 sabo et al 2017 ziv et al 2012 the biodiversity of the mekong river is the second highest in the world after the amazon river and its local inland fishery is the main income source of local residents thus the mekong river is highly sensitive to water deficit several large cascade reservoirs and hydropower plants have been established in the upper mekong in the last decade and these structures have substantially altered the streamflow regime of the mekong river which has also increased the difficulty of modeling and prediction of river dynamics hecht et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhong et al 2019b the above characteristics also make it a suitable case study for demonstration and validation of our proposed drought monitoring framework it should be note that the mekong river as a case study is a well monitored system with adequate in situ observations although our drought monitoring framework of srsi is proposed for ungauged areas before the formal application over the ungauged areas an objective and reasonable validation for the newly proposed framework itself is necessary which is also an objective of this study therefore the mekong river is selected because it can provide reliable in situ observations as the reference for validation rather than it is used to represent the ungauged areas 3 2 satellite altimetry misssions there are several satellite altimetry missions launched that remain in running at present such as jason series saral altika hereafter abbreviated as saral cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 series however currently saral in drifting orbit mode since 2016 and cryosat 2 are long or non repeat cycle missions which are difficult to provide stable and frequent river stage monitoring for a river section sentinel 3 series were first launched in 2016 and thus have no adequate record length for drought utility therefore the satellite altimetry data from jason 2 3 series jason 1 did not retain most of the data over land are adopted as main source to provide the river stages of the mekong river to calculate srsi jason 2 was launched in june 2008 and provides short repeat cycle 10 days altimetry data from july 2008 to may 2017 jason 3 is the successor of jason 2 and has been collecting altimetry data since february 2016 it has the same ground tracks and 10 day repeat cycle as jason 2 in the middle and lower reaches of the mekong river there are four ground tracks of jason 2 3 no 001 103 140 and 179 across the trunk of the mekong river with five intersections here these five intersections are defined as virtual stations vss and referred to as vs1 vs5 to derive river stage data from jason 2 3 altimetry for srsi information on the vss is listed in table 3 considering that the length of river stage records from jason 2 3 series might be inadequate to calculate drought indices it is necessary to temporally extend the jason 2 3 records using the satellite altimetry missions that runed before 2008 like envisat topex poseidon and ers 1 2 in which only envisat is found to have efficient continuous monitor for most sections of the mekong river hence envisat with short repeat cycle data during 2002 to 2010 is adopted to provide historical river stage records to extend the jason 2 3 record series by a data merging approach based on linear regression please see chapter s2 in the supplementary information additionally this study also adopted the saral mission to increase the overlapping periods between jason 2 3 records and envisat records so that help the data merging of the two missions saral provides historical short repeat cycle data during 2013 2016 and has the same ground tracks and repeat cycle 35 days with envisat and can be regarded as the successor of envisat the river stage records based on the jason 2 3 and envisat saral missions are mainly derived from dahiti and theia water level archives we found that the spatial and temporal sampling frequency of these already for use river stage records might be insufficient more specifically these archives do not provide river stages at some potential virtual stations and the river stage records might be too few or have large deviations therefore this study also introduced the sgdr source data of jason 2 3 and envisat from the aviso ftp server ftp access aviso altimetry fr to retrieve the additional river stages the procedures for retrieving the river stage from sgdr data mainly follow the work of huang et al 2018a which has provided very detailed and easily followed procedures to process the sgdr data for save of space details of merging the jason 2 3 and envisat saral river stage records are in the supplementary material finally about 600 to 700 river stage records of about 19 year record length 2002 to 2020 are derived for the five vss 3 3 in situ observations before the formal application for ungauged areas validation of the reasonability and performance of the newly proposed srsi is necessary the performance of the river stages from satellite altimetry and the constructed srsi are assessed using the daily in situ river stage and discharge observations of mekong river are used to assess the accuracy of the river stages from satellite altimetry as well as to calculate the in situ based ssi for validating the satellite based srsi five gauging stations along the middle and lower reaches of the mekong river are used including luang prabang vientiane mukdahan pakse and kratie fig 2 with daily in situ observed river stage and discharge data from 1991 to 2020 sources of these datasets include mohammed et al 2018 and the mekong river commission website https www mrcmekong org note that these observational data above are not involved into the river stage retrieval from satellite altimetry and construction of srsi while only used as reference for validation of the retrieved river stages and the calculated srsi 3 4 meteorological datasets gridded meteorological datasets including precipitation and pet are used to calculate the spei for comparison with srsi the precipitation dataset is derived from the noaa climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based precipitation analysis chen et al 2008 which is spatially interpolated from precipitation observations at over 30 000 stations worldwide at a spatial resolution of 0 5 the original cpc unified precipitation data is at a daily resolution but are converted to the monthly scale before calculating spei the pet dataset is derived from the climatic research unit time series cru ts v4 05 monthly climate datasets harris et al 2020 this dataset is calculated from station interpolated gridded climate data including mean air temperature vapor pressure and cloud cover via the penman monteith formula harris et al 2020 at a resolution of 0 5 both datasets covered the period from 1991 to 2020 3 5 grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa dataset the grace twsa dataset is used to calculate the sgdi for comparison with srsi the grace missions monitor the change in gravity field caused by mass transfer and capture quantitative change in terrestrial water storage groundwater glacier and lake reservoir water thomas et al 2014 the twsa data is derived from the university of texas center for space research csr release 06 gridded mascon dataset https doi org 10 15781 cgq9 nh24 save et al 2016 based on the grace and grace fo missions which are expressed in centimeters of liquid water equivalent thickness the obtained twsa data is from the period of 2004 2020 at a spatial resolution of 0 5 and monthly temporal resolution it should be note that the original resolution of the grace product is of a few hundred kilometers even though the twsa data are presented on the 0 5 resolution 4 results 4 1 river stage data from satellite altimetry retrieved river stage time series based on satellite altimetry at the five vss with temporal resolution of averagely one record per 9 to 11 days see table 3 are shown in fig 3 the retrieved river stages captured seasonal variation in the hydrograph of the mekong river and the shapes of river stage curves also illustrate the characteristics of the river hydrograph of the subtropic monsoon zone for the upper vss especially vs1 the hydrograph of the river stage shows weaker variation such as increased dry season flow and lower flood peaks after late 2014 quantitatively the standard deviation std of the river stage of vs1 is about 3 2 m after 2014 which is about two third of the std before 2014 4 7 m this mainly stems from the fact that all large cascade reservoirs in the upstream reaches had been established and placed into operation at that time which significantly altered the streamflow regime of downstream reaches han et al 2019 while for the downstream vss because of the dilution of upper tributaries flow this phenomenon tends to become inapparent and the hydrograph tends to become natural for instance the river stage std of vs5 after 2014 3 6 m is up to about 90 of the std before 2014 4 1 m this indicates that the river stages from satellite altimetry can directly reflect the streamflow supply condition of local river section which itself has already been the result of the influence from the upper precipitation reservoir and tributaries therefore the framework of srsi directly links to the local river streamflow condition and thus has already reflected the upstream influences like reservoir regulation and interflow from tributaries on the focused river section in practices differences usually exist at satellite altimetry retrievals against ground truth thus data retrieval over inland water needs careful evaluation in order to quantify accuracy errors boergens et al 2016 the results of the evaluation of the retrieved river stages at the five vss versus the daily river stage observations at five gauging stations are shown in fig 4 note that no gauging stations are coincidently at the same river cross section of the vss so the local cross sections of the gauging stations and vss might have different elevations and shapes causing quite different river stage discharge relationships as a result the river stages at the vss do not necessarily have 1 1 direct proportion and even no linear relationship with the river stages at gauging stations even if the discharges are the same moreover since the river stages would be finally normalization by normal standardization in calculating srsi only the correlation of river stage with true values would affect the srsi s performance therefore the metrics based on differences between time series e g root mean square error are not adopted and only the linear and nonlinear correlation coefficients i e pcc and srcc are used to evaluate the merged river stage data there are no gauging stations close to vs3 fig 2 hence the evaluations at vs3 are based on both the upper vientiane station and the lower mukdahan station the river stages based on multi mission satellite altimetry and in situ observation generally showed high correlation with pccs and srccs over 0 95 revealing an acceptable accuracy of the satellite altimetry retrieved river stage and indicating that the extension for record length of jason 2 3 by using envisat saral records is feasible and reasonable see fig 4 there are also several outliers which corresponded to over or underestimated river stages there are several potential reasons for these outliers such as severe land contamination interfering with the satellite altimeter leading to mistakes in water level selection or the effect of interflow between the vss and the reference gauging station nevertheless further investigation on the causes of these outliers is not make in this study because more required in situ hydrological and topographical data are unavailable and the cause of error in satellite altimetry is not the major concern of this study overall the retrieved river stage is generally consistent with the observations under most conditions and the frequency and magnitude of outliers are in an acceptable range thus the river stage data are sufficient for srsi calculations 4 2 calculation of srsi to find the most suitable theoretical probability distribution for the srsi the retrieved river stage records at the five vss are temporally aggregated to four timescales 30 90 180 and 365 day by the procedure in section 2 1 and categorized into 12 calendar months to test the goodness of fit of the five candidate distributions the d max metrics of the k s test are shown in fig 5 with the exception of the normal distribution all of the four skewed distributions log normal pearson iii log logistic and weibull fit well with the river stages according to the k s test p less than 0 05 for all vss timescales and calendar months with only a few exceptions the log logistic distribution had the lowest d max and passes the k s test in most cases the weibull distribution has the second lowest d max therefore the log logistic distribution is considered the most suitable theoretical distribution and is used to calculate srsi 4 3 validation of srsi based on the fitted log logistic distribution parameters for river stage records above the srsis at the five vss are calculated at five timescales the srsis of the 30 90 and 365 day timescales are shown in fig 6 dry and wet spells of the mekong river are generally identified by the srsis especially the severe drought event in thailand in 2019 mekong river commission 2019 the srsis at the 30 day timescale show the greatest variation as they are affected to a greater degree by water deficit at shorter timescales by contrast the srsi series for longer timescales are smoother as they are affected to a greater degree by antecedent streamflow conditions over longer periods and the effect of outliers is weaker next the srsis are validated with respect to the ssi calculated from the observed discharge data at the five gauging stations the sub monthly srsis of 30 90 180 and 365 day corresponding to 1 3 6 and 12 month respectively timescales are first converted to a monthly time series by averaging and then compared with ssi 1 ssi 3 ssi 6 and ssi 12 respectively to ensure the comparability of the ssi with srsi the ssis are also calculated by using the log logistic distribution which also has passed the k s test when fitting the monthly streamflow data the ssis are calculated for a 19 year same as satellite altimetry 2002 to 2020 record length and a longer 30 year 1991 to 2020 record length respectively for investigating the influence of relatively short record length on the performance of srsi the 30 year record length is traditionally recommended as the requirement of data input for calculating drought indices the pccs of the validation are listed in table 4 the performance of the srsis is reasonable with pccs over 0 7 for most vss and timescales considering that the river stages of envisat era for extending record length might have lower sampling frequency it might thereby cause less accurate srsi since practical near real time drought monitoring would be mainly performed by the river stages for jason 2 3 era since 2008 we further calculate the pccs only for 2008 to 2020 for this period the pccs of srsi are apparently higher mostly over 0 8 indicating the acceptable performance for drought monitoring because of the sensitivity of the drought indices to record length the pccs of srsis are lower when referenced to ssis of 30 year records but the discrepancies are not apparent for most cases this might indicate that presently the length of 19 year river stag records could capture adequate extreme dry events and is appropriate for calculating drought indices fig 7 and fig 8 show the time series of the srsis and the ssis calculated for 19 year and 30 year record lengths by taking the 3 and 12 month timescales as examples for time series of the drought indices of all 1 3 6 and 12 month timescales please see the supplementary materials these figures show that the srsis are reasonably consistent with the ssis as interannual variation and trends in drought conditions are similar they also consistently capture the time range and intensity of some notable drought events such as the 2019 thailand drought beginning in the second half of 2019 thailand and the surrounding areas were hit by a disastrous drought event with srsis and ssis below 2 at all gauging stations and vss this finding suggests that the srsi could be a useful indicator of severe river water deficits although the satellite altimeter has sampling of about 10 days and might miss flood events it is still adequate to capture drought events since the drought is usually linked to the long period of continuous water deficiency that can even be captured by discrete hydrological records this further suggest that unlike the issues about flood monitoring drought events can be captured by the temporal discrete monitoring approach like satellite altimetry as long as the sampling is appropriately frequently averagely one record per 10 days and evenly nevertheless the srsi also shows some deviation in the estimates of drought intensity for slight and moderate drought this is particularly evident for srsi 365 at vs4 where srsi apparently underestimated the drought intensity during 2012 to 2018 see fig 8 with the exception of errors in the retrieved river stages the lower sampling frequency might be also a major cause of the inaccurate srsi as too much representative river stages might be missed even the vs4 has a total river stage record over 700 that comparable to other vss the jason 2 3 records are much fewer only 309 while other vss have over 400 see table s1 in the supplementary material for the issue about influence of accuracy and sampling frequency of satellite altimetry an investigation in depth is made by constructing the observed river stage time series with the same sampling frequency of satellite altimetry which then used to calculate srsi for comparison results are in the section s4 of supplementary material for saving space this investigation indicate that both accuracy and sampling frequency of satellite altimetry can affect the performance of srsi and the influence of sampling frequency is more apparent for longer timescale srsi especially the yearly scale srsi 365 moreover unevenly sampling of river stage also have potential impact on the srsi performance this might be the reason why much fewer jason 2 3 records relative to envisat series records at vs4 might cause the poorer srsi performances as the temporal distribution of envisat series records is much more uneven than the jason 2 3 records see fig s6 in the supplementary materials it is also should be note that the observation based ssis with 19 year and 30 year record length has highly consist curves which even overlapped for some cases this might further suggest that the 19 year record length is adequate for drought monitoring in this case study even for the srsi as we also found that the srsi of 19 year records are also consistent with the ssi calculated by 30 year records for most extreme wet and drought periods regardless of the timescales of ssi and srsi sahoo et al 2015 and zhong et al 2019a suggest that input data with shorter record lengths are appropriate for drought monitoring if they include both normal and extreme climate events in our case study this is probably because the severe drought events like the thailand drought of 2019 is included in the river stage and discharge datasets overall we suggest that the record length of the input data might have less of an effect on the reliability of the srsi compared with data accuracy and sampling frequencies there is nevertheless a need for caution when quantifying slight drought events to further understand the ability of srsi in capturing drought events the drought event recognition based on run theory wu et al 2017 wu et al 2018b is used to recognize the drought events of mekong river based on srsi and the ssi the recognition results of ssi are used as benchmark to evaluate the recognition ability of srsi following wu et al 2017 the consecutive months with srsi values below 0 5 would be regarded as drought events if two drought events have an interval less than 6 months and srsi is not higher than 0 5 during the interval the two drought events would be regarded as a single one and the area of the srsi curve below 0 in a drought event is defined as the drought severity by taking srsi 365 and ssi 12 as examples the drought events are recognized by them based on run theory for the five vss and results are shown in table s3 in the supplementary materials for lack of space results show that srsi can capture most of the drought events except 1 to 4 misses and misrepresents of drought events at each vs before 2008 i e before the monitoring period of jason 2 3 srsi also acceptably capture the timing and severity of the severe drought events in recent decade except for some cases at vs1 and vs4 for instance the severe thailand drought since late 2019 is accurately recognized by srsi at all vss with deviations in timing below 2 months and deviations in drought severity below 20 to the ssi results these results might indicate that the srsi proposed in this study generally works acceptable for drought recognition during the monitoring period of jason 2 3 even the used satellite altimetry data has lower sampling rate than the in situ observations 4 4 comparison with existing indices to further validate the efficacy of srsi the srsis at the vss are compared with the spei and sgdi which are spatially averaged for the subbasins controlled by the vss fig 9 fig 10 here the srsi 365 and spei 12 are used as examples the speis are calculated by using the log logistic distribution note that there is a gap period from june 2017 to may 2018 between grace and grace fo moreover during the last months of life of grace from november 2016 to june 2017 the data quality degraded because the accelerometer on one satellite was turned off bandikova et al 2019 boergens et al 2020 therefore the sgdi is not calculated for november 2016 to may 2018 the pattern of temporal variation of the two drought indices is similar to that of the srsis but time lags are present in the former this is expected because the drought of river water is the product of upstream meteorological drought while the lag time of terrestrial water storage deficits groundwater drought to meteorological drought is not necessarily similar with river water drought groundwater drought might be earlier than river water drought in some areas like the mekong basin cui et al 2021 to further investigate the temporal relationships between the srsi and the three other drought indices the pccs are calculated between the srsis at the five vss and the other drought indices for different time lags fig 11 positive time lags indicate that the responses of srsi are behind and vice versa the pccs between srsis and speis have maximums for the time lag of 2 to 3 months revealing that the responses of srsis are 2 to 3 months later compared with spei sgdis show close time lags with speis probably because the terrestrial water storage responds more directly to atmospheric precipitation and evapotranspiration than river streamflow some studies based on observational data have also found that the time lags between the change in long term meteorological dry wet condition and the responses of river water have been shown to vary from 1 to 2 months to over 6 months which depends on the local hydrogeology and land use guo et al 2020 wu et al 2021a moreover since downstream mekong river is strongly governed by the south eastern monsoon response of the natural flow of the mekong river is rapid to precipitation the operation the cascade reservoirs in upper mekong such as retaining extra flood water in flood season and releasing water supply in dry season should be also a key cause of the lag time of hydrological response to meteorological moisture condition change nevertheless these results indicate that the existing drought indices spei and grace based drought index might be relatively weak in monitoring the drought relating to river water deficits due to the uncertainty in the time lag in drought propagation since they are specific for drought in groundwater and precipitation respectively it further suggests that srsi is more suitable for monitoring drought of river water deficit compared with existing drought indices 5 discussion the lack of in situ observed information has impeded the increase in drought monitoring in remote areas and developing countries thomas et al 2014 zhao and gao 2019 although the mekong river as the case study for validating the srsi is well gauged many areas worldwide still lack in situ observation therefore this study proposes a novel satellite altimetry based drought index to monitor the drought of rivers i e the srsi along with a calculation and monitoring framework in the validation based on the in situ observations of mekong river the proposed srsi generally performs well for characterizing inter annual variation in drought of river water and capturing severe drought events comparisons with spei and sgdi also reveal the efficacy of the satellite altimetry based srsi these findings demonstrate the great potential of the srsi to monitor river water deficit in ungauged areas therefore the srsi provides a useful tool that could aid environmental protection water resources planning and real time early warnings of river water deficits wu et al 2018a and promote the protection of river ecosystems for remote and undeveloped areas nevertheless the use of srsi has some shortcomings such as its relatively low accuracy compared with ssi from observed discharges for some cases and deviation in drought intensity estimation potential factors affecting the performance of srsi might include the accuracy of retrieved river stages from satellite altimetry the sampling frequency of the river stages and the record length of the river stages the accuracy of the retrieved river stages primarily depends on the quality of the source of altimetry data affected by land contamination and retracking algorithms biswas et al 2019 frappart et al 2006 huang et al 2018b sichangi et al 2016 to capture the most likely range of possible application conditions and reduce uncertainty the already retrieved river stages from altimetry based water level databases are used and a conventional retracking and river stage retrieving procedure with least approaches and auxiliary data only dem and river masks are used is adopted to introduce additional river stage records from sgdr the errors in river stages stemming from the excessive land contamination e g reflections from irrelevant waterbodies or non water objects and errors in footprint selection because of changes in the extent of inundation biswas et al 2019 are difficult to identify which causes some outliers to be retained in the retrieved river stage series therefore the accuracy of the river stages for calculating srsi has the potential to be further improved by introducing one or more improved retracking algorithms and water level retrieving approaches such as the use of multiple retracking algorithms huang et al 2018b dynamic satellite images to assist river stage identification biswas et al 2019 and complicated models for outlier rejection schwatke et al 2015 the discrete temporal sampling of satellite altimetry data tourian et al 2016 is another notable limitation of their application to monitor drought the repeat cycle of the jason 2 3 is 10 days but is actually longer because of outlier rejection which shows adequate capability in monitoring and capturing the drought events but for the other satellite altimetry platforms with longer repeat cycles according to boergens et al 2019 such as envisat 35 days some extreme dry wet events might still be missed which would make the river stage records less representative for dry wet conditions especially when outlier rejections are frequent like vs4 in this study our further quantitative analysis shows that the sparse and uneven sampling of river stages might have larger influence than error in satellite altimetry therefore when developing new retracking and water level retrieving algorithms special attention is needed regarding how water level information from altimetry records can be retained the integration of multi mission satellite altimetry might provide a feasible solution except the data merging of jason 2 3 and envisat data for extend the record length performed in this study tourian et al 2016 proposed an effective approach to connect the river stages from jason 2 envisat and cryosat 2 missions by hydraulic and statistical methods which successfully generated a river stage series with a temporal resolution of up to 3 days boergens et al 2017 proposed an effective kriging based spatio temporal interpolation approach to integrate multi mission altimetry data which efficiently generated a 5 day resolution river stage dataset for the mekong river by making full use of the altimetry records over the trunk and tributaries boergens et al 2019 these approaches not only solved the problem relating to the sampling frequency of satellite altimetry but also the limitation of short repeat satellite altimetry data i e the deficiency in low spatial coverage boergens et al 2019 more satellite altimetry missions can be combined to improve the reliability and update frequency of srsi now or in the future such as the sentinel 3a b as well as the forthcoming surface water and ocean topography swot mission durand et al 2010 that is planned for launch in 2022 the swot mission is expected to provide accurate water level data with an unprecedentedly high spatial resolution wide spatial coverage and a repeat cycle of 21 days revisiting period of 10 5 days for most areas thus it shows much potential to aid real time drought monitoring the record length of the input data is often the subject of controversy for drought index calculation a record length of at least 30 years is widely suggested but there have also been various studies that have successfully captured and characterized drought events with much shorter record lengths when using spi sahoo et al 2015 pdsi zhong et al 2019a and grace based groundwater drought indices sun et al 2018b thomas et al 2017 in this study considering that the record length of jason era 13 years might be insufficient we further introduce the river stage data based on envisat and saral to extend the time series to 2002 unfortunately limited by the technology of this study we found that the former satellite missions like topex poseidon and ers cannot provide sufficient river stage records for mekong river before 2002 which impede the further extension of the river stage time series nevertheless the srsis calculated by nearly 19 year river stage records still fit well with the ssi by long term 30 year observations and capture the occurrence and intensity of severe drought events showing the potential applicability of the relatively short altimetry records for drought monitoring even so we also recommended to introduce these former altimetry missions if adequate records are available for practices e g for the rivers wider than mekong river frappart et al 2006 6 conclusions in this study a novel drought index based on satellite altimetry for monitoring the drought associated with river water deficits is proposed the mekong river is used as a case study to validate the efficacy of the proposed srsi and drought monitoring framework with using river stage data merged based on multiple altimetry missions including envisat and jason 2 3 the srsi is compared with the ssi of in situ discharge observations and with existing drought indices including spei and sgdi according to the fitting results of the theoretical probability distributions for river stages four skewed distributions log normal pearson iii log logistic and weibull pass the k s test in most cases although the log logistic distribution is used for the srsi calculations in the case study because it had the highest goodness of fit all four of the skewed distributions can be used to calculate the srsi validation of the srsi with respect to in situ calculated ssi shows that the srsi can capture interannual variation in drought of river water and identify the timing and intensity of severe drought events such as the 2019 drought event in thailand even though the srsi is based on the temporal discrete satellite altimetry records nevertheless our analysis also reveals that both error and low sampling frequency have nonnegligible impact on srsi performance comparisons with existing drought indices including spei and grace based drought index show that the srsi 1 year timescale has variant time lags of about 2 to 5 months for precipitation deficit and terrestrial water storage deficit for the mekong river indicating that the srsi is more suitable for monitoring river water deficit than other drought indices in sum our proposed novel drought index the srsi can be calculated without in situ data indicating that it could be used to monitor river water deficit in remote undeveloped and ungauged areas although the srsi has some shortcomings that should be considered it provides a useful tool that could be used to aid water resource planning environmental protection and real time early warnings of drought for stakeholders with limited access to data credit authorship

3042,the lack of in situ hydrological observations especially in remote and developing areas is one of the main challenges of drought monitoring this paper proposes a novel drought index the standardized river stage index srsi based on data retrieved from satellite altimetry missions the novelties of the srsi are that it can quantitatively monitor drought of river water deficits at multiple timescales and that it does not require in situ observations the mekong river is used as the case study to demonstrate and validate the srsi calculated from the multi mission satellite altimetry data envisat and jason 2 3 the log logistic distribution is best fitted for srsi calculation for the highest goodness of fit for river stages for the mekong river the comparison with the standardized streamflow index ssi from the in situ discharge observations shows that the srsi can reasonably capture the drought of river water deficit it is effective in identifying the timing and intensity of severe drought events such as the 2019 thailand drought the srsi is also compared with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and the grace drought index in revealing drought features such that the river water deficit of mekong river has time lags of 2 to 3 months for precipitation deficits and water storage deficits hence the srsi is more suitable for monitoring drought of river water deficit because it directly links to the streamflow via physical stage discharge relationship overall the srsi provides an effective indicator of drought of river water deficit when in situ observations are unavailable it can serve in the real time drought early warning in remote and developing areas keywords hydrological drought river water deficit satellite altimetry river stage drought index mekong river data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought is caused by the water supply below a certain normal threshold for a sustain long period it is one of the most frequent widespread and disastrous natural hazards mishra and singh 2010 wilhite 2000 there generally exist meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought wmo 2006 among them hydrological drought refers to deficiencies in terrestrial water bodies such as river lakes reservoirs and groundwater which are the direct fresh water source for human society therefore attentions also should be paid to hydrological drought for it can affect the river environment farm irrigation and the municipal water supply thomas et al 2014 wu et al 2018a wu et al 2022 hydrological drought commonly stems from precipitation deficits or enhanced evapotranspiration wu et al 2021a wu et al 2021b the effect of anthropogenic activities such as dam construction and urbanization on hydrological drought is also substantial wu et al 2019 wu et al 2018b climate change and global warming have substantially altered the global water cycle exacerbated meteorological and hydrological extremes and resulted in increases in the frequency and magnitude of drought events worldwide dai 2013 increases in the severity of drought have been widely observed in recent years in southwest china bai et al 2019 barriopedro et al 2012 zhong et al 2019a california griffin and anchukaitis 2014 the amazon basin saleska et al 2007 europe sutanto et al 2020 zaitchik et al 2006 and many other regions worldwide sahoo et al 2015 van huijgevoort et al 2012 van loon et al 2012 and these drought have resulted in tremendous social and environmental losses li et al 2020a thus there is a pressing need to develop more efficient real time drought monitoring and early warning approaches to improve the impact mitigation measures under the rapidly changing environment li et al 2020b li et al 2021 sutanto et al 2020 various drought indices and tools have been developed to characterize and monitor hydrological drought the palmer hydrological drought index phdi palmer 1965 and the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 are designed for drought related to surface runoff yield deficits the groundwater resource index gri mendicino et al 2008 and standardized groundwater level index sgi bloomfield and marchant 2013 are designed for groundwater deficits and the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 is designed for river water deficits these drought indices have provided useful tools for understanding spatiotemporal variation and the mechanism underlying drought guo et al 2020 lai et al 2019 wu et al 2018a nevertheless the application of these drought indices largely depends on the quality and density of in situ observations thus their application is limited in remote areas or developing countries where in situ hydrological observations are sparse or even unavailable monitoring hydrological drought by using the simulated data output from the large scale hydrological model is a feasible solution for such areas with limited in situ observations sutanto et al 2020 van huijgevoort et al 2012 van loon et al 2012 nevertheless such modeling based approach might also require reliable meteorological data inputs and might be difficult to model the drought in reality due to the influence of human activities satellite remote sensing facilitates powerful tools for characterizing the dynamics of terrestrial water bodies on a large spatial scale duan and bastiaanssen 2013 jiao et al 2021 lettenmaier et al 2015 providing efficient and low cost approach for monitoring drought especially in ungauged regions such techniques include but are not limited to high resolution imagery which can monitor the surface area of open water bodies such as lakes reservoirs and rivers li et al 2020c pekel et al 2016 wan et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 gravity anomaly remote sensing represented by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace missions which can monitor changes in groundwater bloomfield and marchant 2013 long et al 2013 thomas et al 2017 and satellite altimetry which can monitor the water stage dynamics of lakes reservoirs and rivers boergens et al 2019 han et al 2020 sulistioadi et al 2015 zhong et al 2020 several hydrological indices also have been developed based on satellite remote sensing such as the grace groundwater drought index ggdi for ground water deficit thomas et al 2014 2017 the reservoir area drought index radi based on cloud free high resolution optical images for reservoir water deficits zhao and gao 2018 and the water level deficit index wldi based on satellite altimetry for reservoir and lake water deficit hulsman et al 2021 although river channels are a major direct fresh water source in most areas worldwide few studies have developed the drought indices for monitoring and quantifying the drought severity related to river water deficits from the aspect of remote sensing lai et al 2019 developed an approach to monitor drought of river by simulating the discharge from satellite based precipitation products and then used it to calculate ssi however this approach requires in situ discharge observations for model calibration satellite optical imagery is considered useful for estimating river dynamics huang et al 2018a sun et al 2018a however the temporal continuity of optical imagery records is usually impaired by clouds pekel et al 2016 zhao and gao 2018 in comparison the satellite altimetry based on radar ranging is virtually unaffected by weather conditions and can provide more stable estimates of the river stage huang et al 2018a tourian et al 2017 providing an alternative way for knowing the drought of river water without ground based observations various works have developed efficient algorithms to retrieve river stage and discharge from satellite altimetry with many successful applications worldwide belloni et al 2021 boergens et al 2019 huang et al 2018b schwatke et al 2015 tourian et al 2013 tourian et al 2016 tourian et al 2017 by using altimetry missions like envisat jason 2 3 huang et al 2018a and sentinel 3 series huang et al 2019 several studies have showed that current satellite altimetry have the error of only tens of centimeters for river stage chang et al 2019 huang et al 2018a paris et al 2016 some institutes also established databases providing the already retrieved water level data for inland water bodies from satellite altimetry such as the river lake database the database for hydrological time series over inland water dahiti schwatke et al 2015 https dahiti dgfi tum de and the theia data and service center https hydroweb theia land fr although satellite altimetry still has some limitations like lower accuracy than in situ observation decimeter range temporally discrete records and less applicable for small rivers its drought monitoring potential is still found for some studies for instance boergens et al 2019 made an investigation on the ability of multi mission satellite altimetry in capturing extreme low river stage over mekong basin which helps to understand the potential of satellite altimetry in monitoring flood and drought nevertheless since drought is typically caused by long term accumulation of water deficit only capturing the instantaneous water deficit events might be inadequate to reveal severity of drought in practices a summary of the previous studies using satellite remote sensing data to monitor various types of hydrological drought are presented in table 1 no studies have been found to quantitatively monitor the time step drought related to river water deficits of different time scales without in situ data which thus still needs further development the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a satellite altimetry based drought monitoring framework for use in river water deficit in ungauged areas 2 propose a novel drought index the standardized river stage index srsi for characterizing river water deficit based on river stage data from satellite altimetry and 3 validate the performance of the proposed drought monitoring framework and srsi using a case study the mekong river an important international river in southeast asia passing china myanmar vietnam laos thailand and cambodia is used as the case study for validating the srsi several studies related to satellite altimetry have been performed over mekong river including river stage discharge series construction birkinshaw et al 2010 boergens et al 2016 2017 2019 pham et al 2018 and flood forecasting chang et al 2019 but development of altimetry based drought monitoring tools has not been reported yet satellite altimetry data from the jason 2 3 missions since 2008 are used to calculate srsi in the case study with introducing the altimetry data from the envisat mission to extend the altimetry series to 2002 to satisfy the need of drought utility although the reliability of drought indices is usually sensitive to the length of input data records wu et al 2018a zhong et al 2019a sahoo et al 2015 showed that a climate record shorter than 30 years is adequate for reflecting drought conditions probably because extreme climate events occurred along with normal events in recent years this suggests the potential of using the nearly 19 year envisat jason combined series for calculating srsi overall our study provides a practical method that stakeholders could use to monitor drought of river water deficit for ungauged areas 2 methodology 2 1 the standardized river stage index srsi the concept of the srsi is based on a normal standardization procedure with a theoretical probabilistic distribution of input river stage records and a temporal aggregation procedure that accounts for the temporal accumulation of water deficits under multiple timescales vicente serrano et al 2010 the concept of normal standardization procedure has been applied in several conventional drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 nevertheless these conventional drought indices rely on a continuous observation time series input differently the satellite altimetry data are typically temporally discrete for example one record for each 10 days for jason 2 3 and for each 35 days for envisat and saral altika which might be challenge for the application in the current standardized drought indices use of such temporally discrete data in standardized drought indices still needs further development and assessment which is especially useful for ungauged basins therefore different to the former studies srsi is proposed to exploit the satellite altimetry for multi timescale quantitative drought monitoring as well as adapt to the temporally discrete record of satellite altimetry based on the revised normal standardization procedure to match up with the monitoring and updating schema of satellite altimetry missions srsi records are also temporally discrete with the timestamps corresponding to the related satellite altimetry missions as a result srsi records can be immediately updated once the latest satellite altimetry record is released which permits near real time drought monitoring to be achieved the input river stage data can be derived from the sensor geophysical data records sgdrs usually released 2 months after real time and sensor interim geophysical data records sigdrs released a few days after real time from the archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic aviso team ftp access aviso altimetry fr which are the source data format of most satellite altimetry missions including jason 2 3 and envisat both sgdrs and sigdrs need further retrieving procedure to derive usable river stage data some publicly available satellite altimetry databases like dahiti https dahiti dgfi tum de and theia https hydroweb theia land fr also provide the already retrieved river stage data using river stages from satellite altimetry as input the steps to calculate srsi are as follows fig 1 1 temporal aggregation of river stage records drought is normally caused by a water deficit that accumulates during an antecedent period not merely the water conditions at the current time the aim of this step is to make the final calculated srsi capable of reflecting the antecedent river water deficits of different timescales this is essential because the response time to the water supply and the endurable river water deficit duration usually vary greatly among different sectors vicente serrano et al 2010 for example irrigation system can endure insufficient river water supply for a few months whereas large reservoirs can endure a year to coincide with the timescales of conventional drought indices typically 1 3 6 or 12 months we used a series of timescales of 30 day 90 day 180 day and 365 day for srsi which represented the monthly seasonal semiannual and annual drought scales respectively for the temporally discrete time series the temporal aggregated river stage for timescale s is defined as the mean value of the river stages within the s days before the current date 1 h t h t t s t t n t s t t where h t is the aggregated river stage at current date t h t is the river stage record at date t and n is the number of stage records within the s days before t this procedure is performed at all river stage records note that the time interval between the satellite based river stage records is not constant especially for the multi mission merged records and the gaps between two records are sometimes one month or even longer in such cases some aggregated river stage records might be less representative of the actual antecedent water deficit through trial and error we developed a series of rules to reject some aggregated river stage records that show low representativeness while maximizing the number of usable records retained for the 30 day timescale if there are no other records during the past 30 days the current record is rejected for the 90 day timescale the past 90 days are divided into two 45 day sub periods if any sub period lacks records the current record is rejected for the 180 day timescale the past 180 days are divided into two 90 day sub periods if any sub period has less than 2 records the current record is rejected and for the 365 day timescale the past 365 days are divided into four 90 day sub periods if any sub period has less than 2 records the current record is rejected 2 theoretical probability distribution selection and parameter estimation a suitable probability distribution of the river stage from satellite altimetry needs to be specified before normal standardization can be applied to the h records according to studies that have developed standardized drought indices vicente serrano et al 2010 vicente serrano et al 2012 wu et al 2018a the normal log normal pearson iii log logistic and weibull distributions are selected as candidates to be compared and the most suitable one would be finally adopted the kolmogorov smirnov k s test is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the candidate distributions to the h records the k s test is based on the cumulative distribution function cdf and uses the d max metric maximum difference between the empirical and theoretical cdfs to quantify the goodness of fit of the distributions smaller d max value indicates better goodness of fit for a given preset significance level typically 0 05 and a sample size there is a critical value d a of d max d max d a means that the candidate distribution can be rejected under the significance level i e does not pass the k s test before theoretical distribution selection and fitting the h records are categorized into 12 parts according to the calendar month of the records timestamps and the records in different calendar months are independently fitted by the candidate theoretical distributions more specifically the parameter sets of the candidate distributions are estimated for each calendar month separately this is because the statistical distribution of hydrological data like river stage and discharge are typically different for various seasons and even calendar months huang et al 2020 svensson et al 2017 tijdeman et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2012 moreover a single river stage also means different water supply condition for different calendar months all of the parameter sets of the candidate distributions fitted to the h records are estimated via the maximum likelihood estimation method next the k s test is applied to evaluate the fitted candidate theoretical distributions the candidate distribution passes the k s test and shows the smallest d max for most vss timescales and calendar months would be finally adopted for srsi calculation this means that all the h records would use the same theoretical distribution but the parameter sets would be different for every calendar month 3 normal standardization of aggregated river stage records the srsi can be calculated by normal standardization once the theoretical probability distribution is determined for each h the calendar month of the observation time is used to select the parameter set of the fitted distribution nevertheless the parameter sets are fitted for the monthly scale but h values are temporally discrete at the sub monthly scale which might cause discontinuity in the srsi series therefore the fitted distribution parameter sets θ m would be temporally linear interpolated to the timestamps of h as 2 θ m t d p θ m 1 d 0 θ m d f θ m 1 3 d i day 1 n day 1 0 5 d p 0 5 d d d 0 1 d d f 0 5 d d where m is the current month θ m t is the interpolated distribution parameter set i day is the day of the current month n day is the number of days of the current month and d p d 0 and d f are the coefficients of linear interpolation which are the weights for the previous current and next month respectively the quantile of h which is bound by 0 and 1 can be derived as 4 p c d f h t θ m t and the srsi value is derived as 5 srsi f p where f is the inverse cdf of the standard normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 which converts the p values with a range of 0 to 1 to become the srsi values centered by 0 and with a standard deviation of 1 in this step the input h to calculate srsi is based not only on the historical records for distribution fitting but also on the newly updated records from the latest satellite altimetry data the calculated srsi at the timescale of 30 90 365 days hereafter are referred to as srsi 30 srsi 90 srsi 365 respectively the category of drought according to the srsi value follows the schemes for the spi spei and ssi table 2 2 2 existing drought indices to validate the reasonability and performance of the srsi several existing widely used drought indices based on in situ observations or other remote sensing sources are used for comparison with srsi which are listed as follows 2 2 1 standardized streamflow index ssi the ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 is calculated from the in situ discharge observations at the gauging stations for comparison with the srsi the calculation of the ssi and srsi is similar a normal standardization procedure based on a fitted theoretical distribution is used and multiple timescales can be considered typically 1 3 6 and 12 month differently the ssi typically uses monthly mean discharge as input like other conventional drought indices the reliability of ssi is also sensitive to the length of input data records although sahoo et al 2015 found that a 10 year precipitation record is adequate for meteorological drought monitoring the reliability of data records shorter than 30 years has not been verified for drought related to river water therefore the ssi is calculated for two record lengths a 19 year length period 2002 2020 close to the length of records for envisat with jason 2 3 and a 30 year length period 1991 2020 the record length recommended by wmo wu et al 2018a to validate the reliability of short record lengths for hydrological drought monitoring 2 2 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a widely used meteorological drought indices the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 is calculated for comparison with the proposed srsi the calculation of spei is similar to ssi but it uses the differences between monthly precipitation to monthly potential evapotranspiration pet as input it is typically fitted by a log logistic distribution in this study the precipitation and pet data input are firstly spatially averaged on the subbasins controlled by the virtual stations vss for comparison with the srsi at the vss and then used to calculate the spei these subbasins are extracted from the flow direction images of hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 according to the location of vss 2 2 3 grace related drought index grace twsa data have frequently been used for drought monitoring with several related drought indices proposed including but not limited to the grace drought severity index grace dsi zhao et al 2017 ggdi thomas et al 2017 water storage deficit index wsdi sun et al 2018b and drought index terrestrial water storage di tws boergens et al 2020 in this study to ensure the comparability with the srsi the grace related drought index is calculated following the calculation of the sgi bloomfield and marchant 2013 which uses a standardized procedure based on standard normal distribution that similar to ssi and srsi the calculated drought index is called standardized grace drought index sgdi following bloomfield and marchant 2013 to calculate the sgdi twsa data are firstly fitted with the specific distributions for each calendar months individually and then the quantile p is calculated by using the fitted parameter set θ m 6 p c d f t w s a m y θ m and the sgdi can be derived as 7 sgdi f p where tws a m y is the twsa value for year y total n years and calendar month m θ m is the fitted parameter set for calendar month m f is the inverse cdf of the standard normal distribution according to bloomfield and marchant 2013 the twsa input to calculate sgdi should be fitted by the best fitting distribution in this study the normal distribution is used to calculate sgdi because it is found to have the best fitness with twsa records while other distributions like log logistic are found to did not pass the k s test for twsa records in most cases thus are less suitable for sgdi calculation in this study similar to the spei the input twsa data are firstly spatially averaged over the subbasins controlled by the vss and then used to calculate the sgdi 2 3 assessment metrics in this study the performance of the proposed srsi is validated using the following procedures 1 evaluation of the adopted river stages from satellite altimetry 2 evaluation of the calculated srsi and 3 comparison of srsi with existing drought indices two widely used assessment metrics are used to assess the results of the case study the pearson correlation coefficient pcc for linear correlations and the spearman s rank correlation coefficient srcc for nonlinear correlations the pcc is used to 1 assess the accuracy of the satellite derived river stages and srsi with respect to the in situ river stage observations and ssi calculated from in situ observations at adjacent gauging stations respectively and 2 compare the srsi with existing drought indices spei and grace based drought index for the latter the pcc would be calculated for different time lags between the srsi and existing drought indices to determine the lag times of the drought propagation from meteorological drought to drought of river water deficit the pcc is calculated as 8 pcc i 1 n s i s o i o i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where s i is the series to be assessed and o i is the series used as a reference note that the sub monthly calculated srsis would be temporally averaged to the monthly scale before evaluation and comparison in the evaluation of the satellite derived river stages with respect to the in situ observations the srcc is also adopted along with pcc this is because the relationship between river stage at different river sections might be nonlinear the calculation of srcc and pcc is similar but the inputs for srcc are the ranks of the series 9 srcc i 1 n r i r ro i ro i 1 n r i r 2 i 1 n ro i ro 2 where r i are the ranks of the series to be assessed and ro i are the ranks of the series used as a reference 3 case study 3 1 study area originating in the center of the tibetan plateau the mekong river is the largest international river in southeast asia it passes through several countries including china myanmar vietnam thailand laos and cambodia and has a total length of 4909 km and a drainage area of 811 103 km2 fig 2 the discharge of the mekong river which is 3800 m3 s on average at luang prabang and 13 600 at m3 s at the kratie section is critically important to environmental preservation agricultural irrigation navigation the water supply and hydropower generation of local countries baran and myschowoda 2009 sabo et al 2017 ziv et al 2012 the biodiversity of the mekong river is the second highest in the world after the amazon river and its local inland fishery is the main income source of local residents thus the mekong river is highly sensitive to water deficit several large cascade reservoirs and hydropower plants have been established in the upper mekong in the last decade and these structures have substantially altered the streamflow regime of the mekong river which has also increased the difficulty of modeling and prediction of river dynamics hecht et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhong et al 2019b the above characteristics also make it a suitable case study for demonstration and validation of our proposed drought monitoring framework it should be note that the mekong river as a case study is a well monitored system with adequate in situ observations although our drought monitoring framework of srsi is proposed for ungauged areas before the formal application over the ungauged areas an objective and reasonable validation for the newly proposed framework itself is necessary which is also an objective of this study therefore the mekong river is selected because it can provide reliable in situ observations as the reference for validation rather than it is used to represent the ungauged areas 3 2 satellite altimetry misssions there are several satellite altimetry missions launched that remain in running at present such as jason series saral altika hereafter abbreviated as saral cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 series however currently saral in drifting orbit mode since 2016 and cryosat 2 are long or non repeat cycle missions which are difficult to provide stable and frequent river stage monitoring for a river section sentinel 3 series were first launched in 2016 and thus have no adequate record length for drought utility therefore the satellite altimetry data from jason 2 3 series jason 1 did not retain most of the data over land are adopted as main source to provide the river stages of the mekong river to calculate srsi jason 2 was launched in june 2008 and provides short repeat cycle 10 days altimetry data from july 2008 to may 2017 jason 3 is the successor of jason 2 and has been collecting altimetry data since february 2016 it has the same ground tracks and 10 day repeat cycle as jason 2 in the middle and lower reaches of the mekong river there are four ground tracks of jason 2 3 no 001 103 140 and 179 across the trunk of the mekong river with five intersections here these five intersections are defined as virtual stations vss and referred to as vs1 vs5 to derive river stage data from jason 2 3 altimetry for srsi information on the vss is listed in table 3 considering that the length of river stage records from jason 2 3 series might be inadequate to calculate drought indices it is necessary to temporally extend the jason 2 3 records using the satellite altimetry missions that runed before 2008 like envisat topex poseidon and ers 1 2 in which only envisat is found to have efficient continuous monitor for most sections of the mekong river hence envisat with short repeat cycle data during 2002 to 2010 is adopted to provide historical river stage records to extend the jason 2 3 record series by a data merging approach based on linear regression please see chapter s2 in the supplementary information additionally this study also adopted the saral mission to increase the overlapping periods between jason 2 3 records and envisat records so that help the data merging of the two missions saral provides historical short repeat cycle data during 2013 2016 and has the same ground tracks and repeat cycle 35 days with envisat and can be regarded as the successor of envisat the river stage records based on the jason 2 3 and envisat saral missions are mainly derived from dahiti and theia water level archives we found that the spatial and temporal sampling frequency of these already for use river stage records might be insufficient more specifically these archives do not provide river stages at some potential virtual stations and the river stage records might be too few or have large deviations therefore this study also introduced the sgdr source data of jason 2 3 and envisat from the aviso ftp server ftp access aviso altimetry fr to retrieve the additional river stages the procedures for retrieving the river stage from sgdr data mainly follow the work of huang et al 2018a which has provided very detailed and easily followed procedures to process the sgdr data for save of space details of merging the jason 2 3 and envisat saral river stage records are in the supplementary material finally about 600 to 700 river stage records of about 19 year record length 2002 to 2020 are derived for the five vss 3 3 in situ observations before the formal application for ungauged areas validation of the reasonability and performance of the newly proposed srsi is necessary the performance of the river stages from satellite altimetry and the constructed srsi are assessed using the daily in situ river stage and discharge observations of mekong river are used to assess the accuracy of the river stages from satellite altimetry as well as to calculate the in situ based ssi for validating the satellite based srsi five gauging stations along the middle and lower reaches of the mekong river are used including luang prabang vientiane mukdahan pakse and kratie fig 2 with daily in situ observed river stage and discharge data from 1991 to 2020 sources of these datasets include mohammed et al 2018 and the mekong river commission website https www mrcmekong org note that these observational data above are not involved into the river stage retrieval from satellite altimetry and construction of srsi while only used as reference for validation of the retrieved river stages and the calculated srsi 3 4 meteorological datasets gridded meteorological datasets including precipitation and pet are used to calculate the spei for comparison with srsi the precipitation dataset is derived from the noaa climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based precipitation analysis chen et al 2008 which is spatially interpolated from precipitation observations at over 30 000 stations worldwide at a spatial resolution of 0 5 the original cpc unified precipitation data is at a daily resolution but are converted to the monthly scale before calculating spei the pet dataset is derived from the climatic research unit time series cru ts v4 05 monthly climate datasets harris et al 2020 this dataset is calculated from station interpolated gridded climate data including mean air temperature vapor pressure and cloud cover via the penman monteith formula harris et al 2020 at a resolution of 0 5 both datasets covered the period from 1991 to 2020 3 5 grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa dataset the grace twsa dataset is used to calculate the sgdi for comparison with srsi the grace missions monitor the change in gravity field caused by mass transfer and capture quantitative change in terrestrial water storage groundwater glacier and lake reservoir water thomas et al 2014 the twsa data is derived from the university of texas center for space research csr release 06 gridded mascon dataset https doi org 10 15781 cgq9 nh24 save et al 2016 based on the grace and grace fo missions which are expressed in centimeters of liquid water equivalent thickness the obtained twsa data is from the period of 2004 2020 at a spatial resolution of 0 5 and monthly temporal resolution it should be note that the original resolution of the grace product is of a few hundred kilometers even though the twsa data are presented on the 0 5 resolution 4 results 4 1 river stage data from satellite altimetry retrieved river stage time series based on satellite altimetry at the five vss with temporal resolution of averagely one record per 9 to 11 days see table 3 are shown in fig 3 the retrieved river stages captured seasonal variation in the hydrograph of the mekong river and the shapes of river stage curves also illustrate the characteristics of the river hydrograph of the subtropic monsoon zone for the upper vss especially vs1 the hydrograph of the river stage shows weaker variation such as increased dry season flow and lower flood peaks after late 2014 quantitatively the standard deviation std of the river stage of vs1 is about 3 2 m after 2014 which is about two third of the std before 2014 4 7 m this mainly stems from the fact that all large cascade reservoirs in the upstream reaches had been established and placed into operation at that time which significantly altered the streamflow regime of downstream reaches han et al 2019 while for the downstream vss because of the dilution of upper tributaries flow this phenomenon tends to become inapparent and the hydrograph tends to become natural for instance the river stage std of vs5 after 2014 3 6 m is up to about 90 of the std before 2014 4 1 m this indicates that the river stages from satellite altimetry can directly reflect the streamflow supply condition of local river section which itself has already been the result of the influence from the upper precipitation reservoir and tributaries therefore the framework of srsi directly links to the local river streamflow condition and thus has already reflected the upstream influences like reservoir regulation and interflow from tributaries on the focused river section in practices differences usually exist at satellite altimetry retrievals against ground truth thus data retrieval over inland water needs careful evaluation in order to quantify accuracy errors boergens et al 2016 the results of the evaluation of the retrieved river stages at the five vss versus the daily river stage observations at five gauging stations are shown in fig 4 note that no gauging stations are coincidently at the same river cross section of the vss so the local cross sections of the gauging stations and vss might have different elevations and shapes causing quite different river stage discharge relationships as a result the river stages at the vss do not necessarily have 1 1 direct proportion and even no linear relationship with the river stages at gauging stations even if the discharges are the same moreover since the river stages would be finally normalization by normal standardization in calculating srsi only the correlation of river stage with true values would affect the srsi s performance therefore the metrics based on differences between time series e g root mean square error are not adopted and only the linear and nonlinear correlation coefficients i e pcc and srcc are used to evaluate the merged river stage data there are no gauging stations close to vs3 fig 2 hence the evaluations at vs3 are based on both the upper vientiane station and the lower mukdahan station the river stages based on multi mission satellite altimetry and in situ observation generally showed high correlation with pccs and srccs over 0 95 revealing an acceptable accuracy of the satellite altimetry retrieved river stage and indicating that the extension for record length of jason 2 3 by using envisat saral records is feasible and reasonable see fig 4 there are also several outliers which corresponded to over or underestimated river stages there are several potential reasons for these outliers such as severe land contamination interfering with the satellite altimeter leading to mistakes in water level selection or the effect of interflow between the vss and the reference gauging station nevertheless further investigation on the causes of these outliers is not make in this study because more required in situ hydrological and topographical data are unavailable and the cause of error in satellite altimetry is not the major concern of this study overall the retrieved river stage is generally consistent with the observations under most conditions and the frequency and magnitude of outliers are in an acceptable range thus the river stage data are sufficient for srsi calculations 4 2 calculation of srsi to find the most suitable theoretical probability distribution for the srsi the retrieved river stage records at the five vss are temporally aggregated to four timescales 30 90 180 and 365 day by the procedure in section 2 1 and categorized into 12 calendar months to test the goodness of fit of the five candidate distributions the d max metrics of the k s test are shown in fig 5 with the exception of the normal distribution all of the four skewed distributions log normal pearson iii log logistic and weibull fit well with the river stages according to the k s test p less than 0 05 for all vss timescales and calendar months with only a few exceptions the log logistic distribution had the lowest d max and passes the k s test in most cases the weibull distribution has the second lowest d max therefore the log logistic distribution is considered the most suitable theoretical distribution and is used to calculate srsi 4 3 validation of srsi based on the fitted log logistic distribution parameters for river stage records above the srsis at the five vss are calculated at five timescales the srsis of the 30 90 and 365 day timescales are shown in fig 6 dry and wet spells of the mekong river are generally identified by the srsis especially the severe drought event in thailand in 2019 mekong river commission 2019 the srsis at the 30 day timescale show the greatest variation as they are affected to a greater degree by water deficit at shorter timescales by contrast the srsi series for longer timescales are smoother as they are affected to a greater degree by antecedent streamflow conditions over longer periods and the effect of outliers is weaker next the srsis are validated with respect to the ssi calculated from the observed discharge data at the five gauging stations the sub monthly srsis of 30 90 180 and 365 day corresponding to 1 3 6 and 12 month respectively timescales are first converted to a monthly time series by averaging and then compared with ssi 1 ssi 3 ssi 6 and ssi 12 respectively to ensure the comparability of the ssi with srsi the ssis are also calculated by using the log logistic distribution which also has passed the k s test when fitting the monthly streamflow data the ssis are calculated for a 19 year same as satellite altimetry 2002 to 2020 record length and a longer 30 year 1991 to 2020 record length respectively for investigating the influence of relatively short record length on the performance of srsi the 30 year record length is traditionally recommended as the requirement of data input for calculating drought indices the pccs of the validation are listed in table 4 the performance of the srsis is reasonable with pccs over 0 7 for most vss and timescales considering that the river stages of envisat era for extending record length might have lower sampling frequency it might thereby cause less accurate srsi since practical near real time drought monitoring would be mainly performed by the river stages for jason 2 3 era since 2008 we further calculate the pccs only for 2008 to 2020 for this period the pccs of srsi are apparently higher mostly over 0 8 indicating the acceptable performance for drought monitoring because of the sensitivity of the drought indices to record length the pccs of srsis are lower when referenced to ssis of 30 year records but the discrepancies are not apparent for most cases this might indicate that presently the length of 19 year river stag records could capture adequate extreme dry events and is appropriate for calculating drought indices fig 7 and fig 8 show the time series of the srsis and the ssis calculated for 19 year and 30 year record lengths by taking the 3 and 12 month timescales as examples for time series of the drought indices of all 1 3 6 and 12 month timescales please see the supplementary materials these figures show that the srsis are reasonably consistent with the ssis as interannual variation and trends in drought conditions are similar they also consistently capture the time range and intensity of some notable drought events such as the 2019 thailand drought beginning in the second half of 2019 thailand and the surrounding areas were hit by a disastrous drought event with srsis and ssis below 2 at all gauging stations and vss this finding suggests that the srsi could be a useful indicator of severe river water deficits although the satellite altimeter has sampling of about 10 days and might miss flood events it is still adequate to capture drought events since the drought is usually linked to the long period of continuous water deficiency that can even be captured by discrete hydrological records this further suggest that unlike the issues about flood monitoring drought events can be captured by the temporal discrete monitoring approach like satellite altimetry as long as the sampling is appropriately frequently averagely one record per 10 days and evenly nevertheless the srsi also shows some deviation in the estimates of drought intensity for slight and moderate drought this is particularly evident for srsi 365 at vs4 where srsi apparently underestimated the drought intensity during 2012 to 2018 see fig 8 with the exception of errors in the retrieved river stages the lower sampling frequency might be also a major cause of the inaccurate srsi as too much representative river stages might be missed even the vs4 has a total river stage record over 700 that comparable to other vss the jason 2 3 records are much fewer only 309 while other vss have over 400 see table s1 in the supplementary material for the issue about influence of accuracy and sampling frequency of satellite altimetry an investigation in depth is made by constructing the observed river stage time series with the same sampling frequency of satellite altimetry which then used to calculate srsi for comparison results are in the section s4 of supplementary material for saving space this investigation indicate that both accuracy and sampling frequency of satellite altimetry can affect the performance of srsi and the influence of sampling frequency is more apparent for longer timescale srsi especially the yearly scale srsi 365 moreover unevenly sampling of river stage also have potential impact on the srsi performance this might be the reason why much fewer jason 2 3 records relative to envisat series records at vs4 might cause the poorer srsi performances as the temporal distribution of envisat series records is much more uneven than the jason 2 3 records see fig s6 in the supplementary materials it is also should be note that the observation based ssis with 19 year and 30 year record length has highly consist curves which even overlapped for some cases this might further suggest that the 19 year record length is adequate for drought monitoring in this case study even for the srsi as we also found that the srsi of 19 year records are also consistent with the ssi calculated by 30 year records for most extreme wet and drought periods regardless of the timescales of ssi and srsi sahoo et al 2015 and zhong et al 2019a suggest that input data with shorter record lengths are appropriate for drought monitoring if they include both normal and extreme climate events in our case study this is probably because the severe drought events like the thailand drought of 2019 is included in the river stage and discharge datasets overall we suggest that the record length of the input data might have less of an effect on the reliability of the srsi compared with data accuracy and sampling frequencies there is nevertheless a need for caution when quantifying slight drought events to further understand the ability of srsi in capturing drought events the drought event recognition based on run theory wu et al 2017 wu et al 2018b is used to recognize the drought events of mekong river based on srsi and the ssi the recognition results of ssi are used as benchmark to evaluate the recognition ability of srsi following wu et al 2017 the consecutive months with srsi values below 0 5 would be regarded as drought events if two drought events have an interval less than 6 months and srsi is not higher than 0 5 during the interval the two drought events would be regarded as a single one and the area of the srsi curve below 0 in a drought event is defined as the drought severity by taking srsi 365 and ssi 12 as examples the drought events are recognized by them based on run theory for the five vss and results are shown in table s3 in the supplementary materials for lack of space results show that srsi can capture most of the drought events except 1 to 4 misses and misrepresents of drought events at each vs before 2008 i e before the monitoring period of jason 2 3 srsi also acceptably capture the timing and severity of the severe drought events in recent decade except for some cases at vs1 and vs4 for instance the severe thailand drought since late 2019 is accurately recognized by srsi at all vss with deviations in timing below 2 months and deviations in drought severity below 20 to the ssi results these results might indicate that the srsi proposed in this study generally works acceptable for drought recognition during the monitoring period of jason 2 3 even the used satellite altimetry data has lower sampling rate than the in situ observations 4 4 comparison with existing indices to further validate the efficacy of srsi the srsis at the vss are compared with the spei and sgdi which are spatially averaged for the subbasins controlled by the vss fig 9 fig 10 here the srsi 365 and spei 12 are used as examples the speis are calculated by using the log logistic distribution note that there is a gap period from june 2017 to may 2018 between grace and grace fo moreover during the last months of life of grace from november 2016 to june 2017 the data quality degraded because the accelerometer on one satellite was turned off bandikova et al 2019 boergens et al 2020 therefore the sgdi is not calculated for november 2016 to may 2018 the pattern of temporal variation of the two drought indices is similar to that of the srsis but time lags are present in the former this is expected because the drought of river water is the product of upstream meteorological drought while the lag time of terrestrial water storage deficits groundwater drought to meteorological drought is not necessarily similar with river water drought groundwater drought might be earlier than river water drought in some areas like the mekong basin cui et al 2021 to further investigate the temporal relationships between the srsi and the three other drought indices the pccs are calculated between the srsis at the five vss and the other drought indices for different time lags fig 11 positive time lags indicate that the responses of srsi are behind and vice versa the pccs between srsis and speis have maximums for the time lag of 2 to 3 months revealing that the responses of srsis are 2 to 3 months later compared with spei sgdis show close time lags with speis probably because the terrestrial water storage responds more directly to atmospheric precipitation and evapotranspiration than river streamflow some studies based on observational data have also found that the time lags between the change in long term meteorological dry wet condition and the responses of river water have been shown to vary from 1 to 2 months to over 6 months which depends on the local hydrogeology and land use guo et al 2020 wu et al 2021a moreover since downstream mekong river is strongly governed by the south eastern monsoon response of the natural flow of the mekong river is rapid to precipitation the operation the cascade reservoirs in upper mekong such as retaining extra flood water in flood season and releasing water supply in dry season should be also a key cause of the lag time of hydrological response to meteorological moisture condition change nevertheless these results indicate that the existing drought indices spei and grace based drought index might be relatively weak in monitoring the drought relating to river water deficits due to the uncertainty in the time lag in drought propagation since they are specific for drought in groundwater and precipitation respectively it further suggests that srsi is more suitable for monitoring drought of river water deficit compared with existing drought indices 5 discussion the lack of in situ observed information has impeded the increase in drought monitoring in remote areas and developing countries thomas et al 2014 zhao and gao 2019 although the mekong river as the case study for validating the srsi is well gauged many areas worldwide still lack in situ observation therefore this study proposes a novel satellite altimetry based drought index to monitor the drought of rivers i e the srsi along with a calculation and monitoring framework in the validation based on the in situ observations of mekong river the proposed srsi generally performs well for characterizing inter annual variation in drought of river water and capturing severe drought events comparisons with spei and sgdi also reveal the efficacy of the satellite altimetry based srsi these findings demonstrate the great potential of the srsi to monitor river water deficit in ungauged areas therefore the srsi provides a useful tool that could aid environmental protection water resources planning and real time early warnings of river water deficits wu et al 2018a and promote the protection of river ecosystems for remote and undeveloped areas nevertheless the use of srsi has some shortcomings such as its relatively low accuracy compared with ssi from observed discharges for some cases and deviation in drought intensity estimation potential factors affecting the performance of srsi might include the accuracy of retrieved river stages from satellite altimetry the sampling frequency of the river stages and the record length of the river stages the accuracy of the retrieved river stages primarily depends on the quality of the source of altimetry data affected by land contamination and retracking algorithms biswas et al 2019 frappart et al 2006 huang et al 2018b sichangi et al 2016 to capture the most likely range of possible application conditions and reduce uncertainty the already retrieved river stages from altimetry based water level databases are used and a conventional retracking and river stage retrieving procedure with least approaches and auxiliary data only dem and river masks are used is adopted to introduce additional river stage records from sgdr the errors in river stages stemming from the excessive land contamination e g reflections from irrelevant waterbodies or non water objects and errors in footprint selection because of changes in the extent of inundation biswas et al 2019 are difficult to identify which causes some outliers to be retained in the retrieved river stage series therefore the accuracy of the river stages for calculating srsi has the potential to be further improved by introducing one or more improved retracking algorithms and water level retrieving approaches such as the use of multiple retracking algorithms huang et al 2018b dynamic satellite images to assist river stage identification biswas et al 2019 and complicated models for outlier rejection schwatke et al 2015 the discrete temporal sampling of satellite altimetry data tourian et al 2016 is another notable limitation of their application to monitor drought the repeat cycle of the jason 2 3 is 10 days but is actually longer because of outlier rejection which shows adequate capability in monitoring and capturing the drought events but for the other satellite altimetry platforms with longer repeat cycles according to boergens et al 2019 such as envisat 35 days some extreme dry wet events might still be missed which would make the river stage records less representative for dry wet conditions especially when outlier rejections are frequent like vs4 in this study our further quantitative analysis shows that the sparse and uneven sampling of river stages might have larger influence than error in satellite altimetry therefore when developing new retracking and water level retrieving algorithms special attention is needed regarding how water level information from altimetry records can be retained the integration of multi mission satellite altimetry might provide a feasible solution except the data merging of jason 2 3 and envisat data for extend the record length performed in this study tourian et al 2016 proposed an effective approach to connect the river stages from jason 2 envisat and cryosat 2 missions by hydraulic and statistical methods which successfully generated a river stage series with a temporal resolution of up to 3 days boergens et al 2017 proposed an effective kriging based spatio temporal interpolation approach to integrate multi mission altimetry data which efficiently generated a 5 day resolution river stage dataset for the mekong river by making full use of the altimetry records over the trunk and tributaries boergens et al 2019 these approaches not only solved the problem relating to the sampling frequency of satellite altimetry but also the limitation of short repeat satellite altimetry data i e the deficiency in low spatial coverage boergens et al 2019 more satellite altimetry missions can be combined to improve the reliability and update frequency of srsi now or in the future such as the sentinel 3a b as well as the forthcoming surface water and ocean topography swot mission durand et al 2010 that is planned for launch in 2022 the swot mission is expected to provide accurate water level data with an unprecedentedly high spatial resolution wide spatial coverage and a repeat cycle of 21 days revisiting period of 10 5 days for most areas thus it shows much potential to aid real time drought monitoring the record length of the input data is often the subject of controversy for drought index calculation a record length of at least 30 years is widely suggested but there have also been various studies that have successfully captured and characterized drought events with much shorter record lengths when using spi sahoo et al 2015 pdsi zhong et al 2019a and grace based groundwater drought indices sun et al 2018b thomas et al 2017 in this study considering that the record length of jason era 13 years might be insufficient we further introduce the river stage data based on envisat and saral to extend the time series to 2002 unfortunately limited by the technology of this study we found that the former satellite missions like topex poseidon and ers cannot provide sufficient river stage records for mekong river before 2002 which impede the further extension of the river stage time series nevertheless the srsis calculated by nearly 19 year river stage records still fit well with the ssi by long term 30 year observations and capture the occurrence and intensity of severe drought events showing the potential applicability of the relatively short altimetry records for drought monitoring even so we also recommended to introduce these former altimetry missions if adequate records are available for practices e g for the rivers wider than mekong river frappart et al 2006 6 conclusions in this study a novel drought index based on satellite altimetry for monitoring the drought associated with river water deficits is proposed the mekong river is used as a case study to validate the efficacy of the proposed srsi and drought monitoring framework with using river stage data merged based on multiple altimetry missions including envisat and jason 2 3 the srsi is compared with the ssi of in situ discharge observations and with existing drought indices including spei and sgdi according to the fitting results of the theoretical probability distributions for river stages four skewed distributions log normal pearson iii log logistic and weibull pass the k s test in most cases although the log logistic distribution is used for the srsi calculations in the case study because it had the highest goodness of fit all four of the skewed distributions can be used to calculate the srsi validation of the srsi with respect to in situ calculated ssi shows that the srsi can capture interannual variation in drought of river water and identify the timing and intensity of severe drought events such as the 2019 drought event in thailand even though the srsi is based on the temporal discrete satellite altimetry records nevertheless our analysis also reveals that both error and low sampling frequency have nonnegligible impact on srsi performance comparisons with existing drought indices including spei and grace based drought index show that the srsi 1 year timescale has variant time lags of about 2 to 5 months for precipitation deficit and terrestrial water storage deficit for the mekong river indicating that the srsi is more suitable for monitoring river water deficit than other drought indices in sum our proposed novel drought index the srsi can be calculated without in situ data indicating that it could be used to monitor river water deficit in remote undeveloped and ungauged areas although the srsi has some shortcomings that should be considered it provides a useful tool that could be used to aid water resource planning environmental protection and real time early warnings of drought for stakeholders with limited access to data credit authorship

covariance ec technique of evapotranspiration et from the wetland ecosystem are still not too much based on ec measurements from 2016 to 2020 we investigated the variations of et and its controlling factors over the beihai wetland our results showed that et was mostly influenced by the net radiation rn from half hourly to monthly timescales as a result of sufficient water supply at the observation site in addition the cloudiness was also a key factor controlling et on daily scale by regulating radiation on overcast and cloudy days cloudiness suppressed et primarily due to the decrease in the direct radiation rdir while under sunny conditions the increased diffuse radiation rdif by cloudiness was conductive to increasing the canopy conductance gs and therefore et on annual

fluxes exchange between land surface and atmosphere by the processes of evaporation and transpiration liu et al 2019 it accounts for 60 65 of global terrestrial surface precipitation liu et al 2019 wang and dickinson 2012 accurate and long term et measurements is essential to better understand the interactions between the land surface and atmosphere as well as to understand the water cycle processes brubaker and entekhabi 1996 et can be measured and estimated by several methods such as eddy covariance ec chamber scintillometer weighable lysimeters bowen ratio surface water balance atmosphere water balance methods penman equation as well as the new developed maximum evaporation method wang and dickinson 2012 yang et al 2019 among these methods ec technique is widely applied as a standard method to measure the ecosystem turbulent flux and et continually in a direct and non destructive way baldocchi 2003 wilson and baldocchi 2000 ec has been widely used to quantify et in different wetland ecosystems including marshes malone et al 2014 schedlbauer et al 2011 boreal peatlands alekseychik et al 2017 peichl et al 2013 runkle et al 2014 reed wetlands li et al 2016 serrano ortiz et al 2020 zhou and zhou 2009 and alpine wetlands cao et al 2020 zhang et al 2016b fleischmann et al 2021 investigate et over different wetlands in south america and find the long term patterns of et follow a climate gradient et in equatorial wetlands 1296 1542 mm year is larger than that in temperate wetlands 743 1128 mm year while in boreal wetlands et is relatively small 199 298 mm year peichl et al 2013 in the meanwhile it has been reported that et varies greatly across different types of wetland ecosystems which may be related to the different meteorological conditions and biological features actual et is controlled by complex interactions of environmental and biological factors net radiation rn and air temperature ta are key meteorological factors that influence the seasonal and inter annual variations of et bucci et al 2008 igarashi et al 2015 song et al 2017 and the importance of ta increases with elevation ma et al 2018 the influence of water table position is often of less important and its impact may be confounded by the synoptic meteorological conditions such as less precipitation and higher atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd sonnentag et al 2010 wu et al 2010 cloudiness is a crucial environmental variable that affects the ecosystem carbon and water cycling dynamics gu et al 1999 letts et al 2005 xu et al 2018 several studies have found that cloudiness with large fraction of diffuse radiation rdif could improve the net ecosystem productivity and gross primary productivity kanniah et al 2012 han et al 2019 however there is no consensus on the influence of cloudiness on et according to some research cloudiness was conducive to stomatal openness and et enhancement dengel and grace 2010 wang et al 2008 while for sparse canopies cloudiness may reduce ecosystem et largely as a result of the decrease in vpd and ta rocha et al 2004 clearly cloudiness exerts a coupled and complex impact on et according to previous research the biological factors could control et through the leaf area index lai aerodynamic characteristics canopy conductance gs and the albedo of the ecosystem bagley et al 2017 forzieri et al 2020 williams and torn 2015 variations in et have also been attributed to variations in the type of land cover and wetland structure a research conducted over different agricultural and restored wetland sites in the sacramento san joaquin river delta california showed that the drained sites tended towards lower annual et rates than the flooded sites eichelmann et al 2018 there are large temporal and spatial variations in et due to these varying meteorological and biological controls a better understanding of the controlling mechanisms of et in various wetlands is vital for predicting the future hydrological cycle accurately studies of wetland energy and water exchange processes based on ec techniques have been conducted globally although most of them have been carried out in middle and high latitude regions with relatively little attention given to subtropical wetlands beihai wetland is a unique volcanic dammed lake wetland in tengchong southwest china with plants like a blanket floating on the water surface permanently this wetland is an alpine marsh its hydrogeomorphic characteristics have considerable impacts on the downstream surface water system e g adjacent streams and downstream discharges the study wetland situates within the subtropical monsoon climate zone with high temperature large precipitation and many cloudy days in wet season may to october the field site located in the southeast of the qinghai tibet plateau the tibetan plateau is an essential platform for water vapor transfer which is associated with the asian monsoon outbreak xu et al 2002 tengchong is located in this water vapor transfer corridor and the water vapor flux exchange processes over this region are important for a better understanding of the east asian water vapor cycle based on the five year continuous ec measurements of energy and water fluxes from 2016 to 2020 we investigate the variations of energy and et over this wetland ecosystem the objectives of this paper were to 1 analyze the seasonal and year to year variations of energy fluxes and et 2 identify the main factors controlling et on different timescales and 3 investigate the effects of cloudiness on et over this floating blanket wetland this research can provide a scientific basis and theoretical references for hydrological modeling a better understanding of the hydrological cycle mechanisms in high altitude areas and the impact of climate change on water cycle processes of wetland ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the observation site is located at beihai wetland tengchong county yunnan province in southwest china beihai wetland belongs to the irrawaddy river system it is the source of daying river which flows into the bay of bengal this wetland has a runoff area of 21 75 km2 and most of the runoff is supplied by precipitation although some originate from mountain streams and springs feng 2013 the wetland is surrounded by hills with the height difference between the wetland and the hills exceeding 200 m the original observation site 25 07 18 5 n 98 33 21 9 e was established in june 2015 its location was changed from near the shore to the middle of the wetland in march 2017 the current site 25 07 24 n 98 33 19 e 1728 m a s l was about 180 m from the original site fig 1 a this site situates within the subtropical monsoon climate zone with distinct wet may to october and dry seasons november to april according to meteorological records 1981 2010 from tengchong county weather observation station which is 16 5 km far from the wetland the annual sum precipitation and annual mean ta are 1532 4 mm and 15 4 c respectively beihai wetland is a marsh wetland with plants permanently floating on the water surface like a blanket there is a seasonal variation of the fraction of vegetation to water surface the dominant plants over the wetland surface were cyperus duclouxii e g camus and oberonia iridifolia roxb ex lindl with the maximum height exceeding 2 m above the wetland surface more details of the wetland are presented by du et al 2021 2 2 the instruments and data processing the ec system was installed on a platform at a height of 1 5 m above the water surface the platform covered an area of 10 5 m2 the flux observation instruments primarily consisted of an open path ec system and a conventional meteorological observation system the ec system included a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3a campbell scientific logan ut usa an open path methane ch4 analyzer li 7700 li cor inc lincoln nb usa and an open path carbon dioxide water vapor co2 h2o gas analyzer ec150 campbell scientific before november 2017 and li 7500a li cor inc after november 2017 the measurement height of the instruments was 2 m above the platform and the measurement frequency was 10 hz in addition wind speed u 010c campbell scientific usa ta and relative humidity hmp45c campbell scientific usa were observed at three levels 0 65 1 45 and 3 m above the platform the wind direction was monitored at a height of 3 m above the platform 020c campbell scientific the radiation components were measured with four radiometers at a height of 1 5 m above the grass and water surfaces cnr4 kipp and zonen delft the netherlands the photosynthetic active radiation was measured at a height of 1 5 m over grass li 190sb li cor inc usa the water temperature was measured at 5 10 20 40 and 60 cm below the water surface 109l campbell scientific usa the precipitation was observed by a tipping bucket rain gauge 52202 young usa the observed data were stored in a cr3000 campbell scientific data collector more details are provided by du et al 2021 the eddypro 7 0 4 software li cor inc was used to process 10 hz raw data and calculate the half hourly sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le post processing settings were also implemented in the eddypro software spikes due to electronic and physical noise were filtered according to vickers and mahrt 1997 the effect of terrain on fluxes was corrected by the double rotation of coordinate method kaimal and finnigan 1994 transfer functions proposed by moncrieff et al 1997 moncrieff et al 2004 were applied to correct the spectral losses the webb pearman leuning wpl correction was applied to correct h2o and co2 fluxes due to the density fluctuation of the air webb et al 1980 data obtained during rainy days was discarded following the post processing of raw data a quality assessment was performed using the flag system 0 1 and 2 foken et al 2005 poor quality data with a flag value of 2 were discarded from the following analysis the footprint source area was analyzed using the footprint model developed by kljun et al 2015 the footprint of the current site was shown in fig 1c and the footprint of the original site was presented by du et al 2021 the measured fluxes all originated from the wetland surface and the flux contribution area was mainly distributed in the southwestern and northeastern sectors depending on the prevailing wind direction there were some gaps in the observed energy fluxes due to weather conditions system malfunctions or quality control approximately 70 of the h and 65 of the le data recorded from 2016 to 2020 were available the filling method for et data was determined by the gap length with a linear interpolation used when the gap length was 2 h and marginal distribution sampling mds reichstein et al 2005 used when the gap length was longer than 2 h the energy balance ratio ebr was used to evaluate the ec data quality which was calculated as 1 e b r h l e r n q s the ebr on daily timescale could be calculated as ebr h le rn qs the energy storage in the vegetation canopy was relative small and could be negligible qs in eq 1 referred to the heat storage in the water it was calculated as following nordbo et al 2011 2 q s ρ w c pw i 1 n δ t wi δ t δ z i where ρ w is the water density 1 103 kg m 3 c pw is the specific heat of water at constant pressure 4192 j kg 1 k 1 δ t wi is the change of water temperature at the specific level i over a specific time δ t 30 min for this study and δ z i is the depth interval between two successive levels m based on the daily data from 2016 to 2020 the slope between h le and rn qs was 0 77 with regression intercepts of 8 81 w m 2 and a determining coefficient r2 of 0 65 fig 2 the average ebr value was 0 85 in this study which was within the range from other wetland sites cui and chui 2019 the energy imbalance was observed across all ec sites in the fluxnet network about 10 30 stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 the main reasons for the energy imbalance were instrument bias such as different types of gas analyzers systematic measurements sampling errors such as a discrepancy between rn sensors and the flux footprint and the loss of low and high frequencies in flux measurements forken 2008 leuning et al 2012 wilson et al 2002 2 3 biophysical parameters the clearness index ci was used as an indicator of sky conditions it was defined as the ratio of solar radiation rs received above the canopy to the extraterrestrial global horizontal solar radiation r0 as following gu et al 1999 3 ci rs r0 4 r0 rsc 1 0 033cos 360d 365 sin β 5 sin β sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ cos ω due to the lack of measurements of the diffuse radiation rdif during the observation period we used the reindl model reindl et al 1990 to calculate the rdif this model provides estimates of the diffuse fraction kd as a function of the ci and solar elevation angle 6 kd 1 02 0 254ci 0 0123sin β ci 0 3 7 kd 1 4 1 749ci 0 177sin β 0

of the sun and ω is the solar hour angle rdir is the direct radiation w m 2 which was equal to the difference between solar radiation and the rdif 10 rdir rs rdif the daily average ci was used to classify sky conditions theoretically ci was a number between 0 overcast and 1 sunny we divided sky conditions into sunny 0 6 c i 1 cloudy 0 2 c i 0 6 and overcast 0 c i 0 2 following okogbue et al 2009 during the period from 2016 to 2020 approximately 87 119 days were sunny days per year the cloudy and overcast days per year accounted for about 57 66 and 11 12 of all days respectively table 1 to identify the biotic controls on et we calculated the canopy conductance gs based on observed energy fluxes and meteorological data the gs was obtained by inverting the penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 2013 11 g s 1 ρ a c p v p d γ l e δ γ b o 1 g a 1 where ρ a is the air density kg m 3 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa k 1 δ is the slope of the saturation water vapor

which can be calculated through the quality controlled estimation of friction velocity u as follows 12 g a 1 u u 2 6 2 u 2 3 where u is the wind speed m s and u is the friction velocity m s 2 4 path analysis path analysis as a multiple regression method was widely applied to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables huxman et al 2003 wu et al 2017 zhuang et al 2016 it was especially effective in evaluating data where independence among variables was uncertain because it could exclude potential relationships between independent variables chen et al 2015 huxman et al 2003 this method was a particular useful analysis tool when a priori causal relationships among variables were well known li 1981 we used the spss amos version 24 0 ibm inc usa software for the path analysis first a model was constructed of the relationship between et and the independent variables which were chosen according to prior knowledge i e rdir rdif vpd ci ta gs in this paper han et al 2019 xu et al 2018 we then put the standardized data into the path model and used the maximum likelihood method to calculate the path coefficients ρ and discrepancy shao et al 2016 to optimize the final path model structure only the significant paths p 0 05 and ρ within the range of 0 1 0 1 were retained in general a high goodness of fit was considered to have been achieved when the root mean square error of approximation rmsea was 0 05 and the good fit index gfi was greater than 0 9 kline 2011 ueyama et al 2014 3 results 3 1 meteorological condition the variation of daily average meteorological variables was shown in fig 3 the daily integrated solar radiation rs over grass and water surfaces was the same ranging from about 1 4 to 27 5 mj m 2 d 1 the daily average ta ranged from 4 2 to 22 9 c the annual mean ta during the five years was 15 5 15 1 14 8 15 2 and 15 3 c respectively which was near or lower than the long term climate average 15 4 c this is evident in a period of high ta in 2016 compared with the other four years of observations the water surface temperature tw was a little bit higher than ta with the maximum value of 25 7 c it always above 0 c even during the entire winter period there was a small decrease in both ta and tw during the wet season due to the increase in precipitation the vpd was generally larger in spring with a maximum value of 1 13 kpa the mean u at 3 m above the wetland surface was largest in spring 3 1 m s and lowest in autumn the prevailing wind direction was southwest and northeast through the year fig 1d southwest direction was dominant during the wet season while that in the dry season was southwest and northeast fig s1 left this seasonal change of wind direction was mainly caused by the monsoon circulation there was difference in wind direction distribution between nighttime and daytime due to the complex terrain in this area while southwest was dominated during the daytime there was a significant proportion of winds from northeast and southeast sectors fig s1 right the annual total precipitation from 2016 to 2020 was 1 780 2 1 490 3 1 494 4 1 210 4 and 1 497 3 mm the precipitation data were obtained from the tengchong county weather station approximately 16 5 km away from the site respectively fig 3 most of precipitation occurred during the wet season 78 91 the year 2019 was considered to be a dry year with less annual precipitation compared to the long term climate average 1532 4 mm 2019 was ranked 4nd for total annual precipitation out of 40 years 1981 2020 in the data from the monitoring site this is evident in a period of less precipitation in spring and summer of 2019 compared with other four years of observations fig s2a 108 effective precipitation events daily precipitation 1 mm were observed in this year which was lower than that in other years fig s2b the year 2016 was wetter than the long term climate average which ranked 7nd for total annual precipitation out of 40 years it was primarily due to more precipitation days and greater precipitation intensity daily precipitation of 25 50 mm d contributed the most to the annual precipitation in 2016 while daily precipitation of 10 25 mm d contributed the most to the total precipitation in other four years fig s2c the other three years had near normal climate conditions 2020 was the second wettest year after 2016 during the observation period while the precipitation in august was 508 9 mm 3 2 mean daily pattern of energy fluxes the net radiation rn was characterized by a clear diurnal pattern it peaked at midday and became negative overnight fig 4 a rn over the grass surface peak value 522 w m 2 was smaller than that over the water surface peak value 574 w m 2 which was mainly caused by the difference in their albedo the albedo during the noon hours over the grass surface and water surface were 0 09 0 13 and 0 03 0 06 respectively the diurnal changes in albedo over both water and grass surfaces followed a u shape and the magnitude of the albedo during the dry season was larger than that during the wet season fig 4b driven by the variation of the solar elevation angle h and le also displayed a distinct diurnal cycle followed rn and the monthly average diurnal h and le had seasonal variation during the spring the peak values of h varied from 83 w m 2 in march to 68 w m 2 in may which was approximately 16 19 of the rn fig 4c the amplitude of h declined to the lowest level during summer peak value 55 w m 2 and reached its maximum in winter peak value 116 w m 2 the seasonal variation of le followed the opposite pattern to that of h the peak value of le ranged from 143 w m 2 to 205 w m 2 from winter to spring fig 4d as the wet season coming the amplitude of le increased and reached its maximum around 225 w m 2 in summer the qs was large in the daytime and remained negative during the night fig 4e indicating that water released heat into the atmosphere during nighttime the heat exchange between the lake water and the sediment was not estimated due to the lack of sediment temperature measurements which likely led to a bias in the calculation of qs however nordbo et al 2011 reported that the contribution of heat stored in the sediment was small and the bias caused by heat storage in the sediment was less than the inaccuracy in determining qs in general the maximum values of h rn occurred around noon fig 5 a this diurnal pattern of h rn was similar to that reported over a carex lasiocarpa mire in the sanjiang plain guo and sun 2012 le rn during the daytime had a clear u shape diurnal curve gig 5b it was close to or even greater than 1 around sunrise and sunset indicating that the available energy was mostly consumed by evaporation during the night le rn became negative and varied over a wide range between 1 and 0 as a result of the low turbulent le the bowe ratio bo was small or negative near sunrise and sunset but was large in the middle of the day fig 5c bo in the daylight hours varied between 0 and 0 5 during the wet season while during the dry season it ranged from 0 to 1 and even assumed values larger than 1 in winter the diurnal variation of bo was asymmetric from march to august with larger values in the morning than that in the afternoon and evening a similar diurnal pattern of bo was observed over a peatland fen in russia during the growing season where bo peaked in the early morning and approached 0 85 runkle et al 2014 the monthly average diurnal qs rn displayed no obvious seasonal variation and daytime qs accounted for about 29 37 of the rn during observation period fig 5d 3 3 monthly average diurnal and seasonal variations of evapotranspiration the monthly average diurnal variation of et followed a typical unimodal curve fig 6 during the winter the highest mean hourly et under sunny conditions was 0 27 mm h 1 and the maximum values oscillated around 0 38 mm h 1 et began to increase from spring and peaked in summer the highest mean hourly et hovered around 0 49 mm h 1 while the maximum hourly et value was 0 55 mm h 1 comparable values of hourly et in the noon hours were characteristics of the sanjiang plain wetland guo and sun 2012 at night there was no transpiration from vegetation due to the closure of stomata but et was still larger than 0 because evaporation from the water surface could continue nighttime et has also been observed over an open bog and peatland in japan and freshwater wetlands in the sacramento san joaquin river delta california usa eichelmann et al 2018 hirano et al 2016 this continuous transmission of water vapor to the atmosphere during nighttime is an important feature of lakes cui and chui 2019 du et al 2018 the daily and monthly total et was calculated after gaps in the et data were filled the total et in 2017 was not considered because several months of data were missing the seasonal variation of daily et was shown in fig 7 during the winter the daily et ranged from 0 4 mm d to 3 0 mm d in the subsequent months a significant increase in the daily et was observed owing to increased turbulent water vapor flux the summer season was characterized by the highest daily et with values of 4 2 4 7 mm d another feature of et in summer was that the daily totals varied within a wide range the lowest daily et was 1 5 mm d while the highest daily totals assumed values of 4 7 mm d the daily average et rate at our site was 2 1 2 7 mm d during 2016 2020 which was similar to the daily et rate in the sanjiang plain in china average 2 3 mm d peak 4 8 mm d guo and sun 2012 a boreal peatland fen in northwestern russia average 2 5 mm d peak 5 8 mm d runkle et al 2014 and a phragmites australis wetland in nebraska usa average 3 0 0 8 mm d mykleby et al 2016 3 4 controlling factors of evapotranspiration there was a strong linkage between et and rn from half hourly to monthly timescales fig 8 in equatorial and temperate wetlands et was driven by radiation primarily fleischmann et al 2021 there was a high water availability throughout the year in equatorial wetlands in wetlands with temperate climate the wet season was in phase with the rn resulting in high et in summer the correlation coefficient for the relationship between et and u was positive on half hourly timescale the turbulent eddies caused by wind shear could promote the gas exchange across the air and the water interface when u was high eugster 2003 the strong control of u on water flux also occurred in other sites mammarella et al 2015 nordbo et al 2011 when the timescale was extended to daily and monthly scales there was no significant relationship between et and u it has been reported that temperature should be considered when studying the evaporation process kuttler and goldbach 2015 similarly we found that et had a strong correlation with tw and ta on different timescales there was a positive correlation between et and vpd this was consistent with the relationship between evaporation and vpd over baldeneysee lake where vpd could explain 65 of the variation in the water flux kuttler and goldbach 2015 precipitation had a weak effect on et on the daily scale the correlation of precipitation and et on the half hourly timescale was not considered because half hourly precipitation data were not available the ci emerged as an important factor affecting et fig 9 ci could not only influence et through environmental variables but also through vegetation characteristics i e gs although ci had no direct impact on gs it could regulate stomata through vpd and radiation the increase in vpd suppressed gs while the rise in rdif and rdir stimulate plant stomata to open under overcast conditions an increase in ci was conducive to increasing rdif rdir and vpd leading to a positive effect on et the total effects of environmental variables on et were sorted by rdif rdir vpd under sunny and cloudy conditions ci induced the increase in both vpd and rdir while decreasing rdif the total effects of environmental variables on et under cloudy conditions were sorted by rdir rdif vpd as the sky condition changed from overcast to sunny condition the direct effect of radiation on et decreased while the indirect effect of radiation on et through gs increased 4 discussion 4 1 energy fluxes during the wet season the daily mean h rn and le rn were 0 23 and 0 63 while daily mean h rn and le rn were 31 and 42 during the dry season the difference of energy partitioning between the wet and dry seasons might be related to vegetation the vegetation played a major part in modulating energy partitioning by transpiration process and leaf reflectance sun et al 2019 the presence of vegetation during the wet season could increase the le rn through the change of vegetation color and transpiration dare idowu et al 2021 wohlfahrt et al 2001 the seasonal variation of energy partitioning varied across regions le dominated the energy partitioning across the entire year over a salt marsh site in southeastern south america tonti et al 2018 for some mid latitude and high latitude wetlands with a monsoon climate the onset of the wet season usually shifted the dominant flux from h to le schedlbauer et al 2011 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2016b it has been found that le played the main role in summer while h had the dominant role in other seasons in the alpine steppe and pasture on the qtp ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 in some regions of the western qtp the annual precipitation was 100 mm and h always dominated in the energy partitioning li 2003 on an annual scale the energy partitioning with each year was similar across years le accounted for about 67 65 72 of rn which was within the range reported for other wetlands malone et al 2014 runkle et al 2014 wu and shukla 2014 bo is widely used to investigate the energy and water dynamics across different ecosystems and climate conditions bowen 1926 it reached its minimum value during summer and peaked in winter the annual average bo during daytime ranged from 0 33 to 0 51 table 2 energy partitioning reflected the response of turbulent fluxes to land cover types and climate changes the significant difference of bo between 2016 and other years might be related to the obvious year to year variation of precipitation and water surface fraction it has been pointed out that the annual bo was controlled by annual precipitation grünwald and bernhofer 2007 yue et al 2018 also found bo during the dry years was higher than during the wet years in the meanwhile the changes in fraction of vegetation water influenced the variation of bo the vegetation dynamics could influence the albedo and radiation received over the wetland surface and hence affect the energy fluxes forzieri et al 2020 eichelmann et al 2018 found the vegetation canopy could lead to significance decrease in water temperature by preventing heating of the water column which might influence the energy partitioning zhao and liu 2017 also reported that the water surface fraction had a great impact on surface energy exchange and energy partitioning over poyang lake in china bo in this study was comparable to that of an inundated swamp gray et al 2018 and a western siberian bog during the growing season alekseychik et al 2017 in contrast bo over a subalpine horizontal flow wetland in jiuzhaigou china was found to be larger than that in our site it may be attributed to the frozen surface during the freezing period which blocked the movement of the water vapor to the atmosphere yan et al 2020 compared with le rn the ratio of qs to rn was small on annual scale the ratio of qs to rn during daytime ranged from 0 21 to 0 32 which was consistent with the contributions of energy stored in the soil and water to the energy budget over a churchill sedge fen in the canadian subarctic eaton and rouse 2001 and a reservoir in the mid latitude region liu et al 2012 the qs rn in the florida everglades marsh with smaller water depth was found to be lower than our study schedlbauer et al 2011 4 2 year to year variation of et the annual et during 2016 2020 over the beihai wetland was 762 3 mm in 2016 929 3 mm in 2018 990 5 mm in 2019 and 900 1 mm in 2020 respectively table 2 the annual et changed by around 30 during the observation period the remarkable difference in the annual et could have resulted from a combination of many factors first precipitation played an important role in the year to year variation of et the annual precipitation ranged from 1 210 4 mm to 1 780 2 mm during 2016 2020 and the annual precipitation changed by almost 47 the year 2016 was a wetter year with more precipitation days and greater precipitation intensity than that in other four years the daily precipitation of 25 50 mm d contributed the most to the annual total precipitation in 2016 while in the dry year 2019 daily precipitation of 10 25 mm d contributed the most to the annual precipitation different precipitation conditions in each year could affect annual et through radiation vapor pressure deficit vegetation stomatal conductance and even canopy interception kucharik et al 2000 it should be noted that the annual et was found to have a significant negative relationship with the annual precipitation determining coefficient was 0 90 p 0 05 similar relationship between cumulative et and precipitation was reported for energy limited sites zhang et al 2018 second obvious change in the fraction of the water surface within the footprint area was observed which was mainly because the location of the observation site changed from near the shore to the middle of the wetland the mean value of the water surface fraction was around 38 in the current site which was larger than that in the original site table 2 the fraction of open water to closed vegetation had a great impact on et dynamics eichelmann et al 2018 some studies showed that compared with open water the presence of plants in a wetland could significantly reduce et due to the physical limitations on vascular vegetation transpiration brümmer et al 2012 kellner 2001 in beihai wetland larger water surface fraction within the footprint area in the current site tended to increase et on annual scale finally the different observation instruments used during 2016 and the following years may have also increased the uncertainty in et estimates an open path ec150 co2 h2o gas analyzer campbell scientific was used in 2016 which then changed to the li 7500a li cor inc at the end of 2017 the annual et in our site was within the range reported for other wetlands fleischmann et al 2021 kang and cho 2021 malone et al 2014 eichelmann et al 2018 peichl et al 2013 xiao et al 2013 yan et al 2020 zhou and zhou 2009 table 3 owing to the management practices and regular irrigation the annual et in zhangye artificial wetland reached 1 300 4 mm year which was notably larger than the annual et over the beihai wetland zhang et al 2016a a previous study found that the annual et values were different over lakes at different altitudes which was attributed to the variation of atmospheric demand across different elevations ma et al 2016 the annual et in our study was larger than that of higher altitude alpine wetlands cao et al 2019 which could be partially explained by the lower atmospheric demand over the beihai wetland cao et al 2020 concluded that the annual et significantly decreased with increasing latitude and the annual et was reduced by 124 1 mm when the elevation increased by 1 000 m without considering the influence of vegetation composition and micro environmental conditions the feedback between et and precipitation et p was an important factor that determined local hydrological patterns malone et al 2014 it also could be used to investigate the impact of climate and land use changes on regional hydrology ma et al 2018 in general the annual et accounted for 43 82 of the precipitation which was within the range reported in previous wetland studies et p ratios of 35 92 cao et al 2019 malone et al 2014 peichl et al 2013 xiao et al 2013 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2016a zhou and zhou 2009 table 3 high et p suggested a strong feedback between the wetland and the regional climate and the wetlands could cool and humidify the surrounding atmosphere through the water loss by et which may be important for the regulation of future climate warming krinner 2003 4 3 environmental and biophysical controls on et in beihai wetland rn was considered to be the most important environmental factor controlling et from half hourly to monthly scales followed by other meteorological factors such as ta and vpd generally vpd affected et in two paths on the one hand when vpd is large the large water pressure between the vegetation s stomata and the atmosphere generally allows water vapor to flow from the stomata to the atmosphere and thus increases et on the other hand an increase in vpd could suppress the vegetation s stomata increasing stomatal resistance and limiting transpiration ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 marques et al 2020 wang et al 2022 in this study vpd ultimately had a promotional effect on et fig 8 previous research conducted over beihai wetland has shown that vpd rn and ta were the main controlling factor of half hourly le during both wet and dry seasons rn ta and vpd together can explained 79 and 81 of the variation in le on half hourly scale for wet and dry seasons respectively du et al 2021 the gs has generally been reported to be a biological factor controlling et wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the annual midday average gs in this site was 9 4 11 4 mm s midday mean gs during the wet season was about 14 5 16 0 mm s which was close to values for a marsh site in the sanjiang plain in northeast china guo et al 2021 and a peatland fen in northwestern russia runkle et al 2014 a negative relationship was noted between vpd and gs fig 10 gs showed a weaker response to vpd in our site than that over a glencar atlantic blanket bog in ireland sottocornola and kiely 2010 the different response of gs to vpd was mainly due to different types and relative abundance of the plants while the wetland surface over study site was covered by water and vegetation in glencar it was mainly covered by bare peat and brown moss which was less efficient in holding moisture once the peat surface dried out the bare peat stopped evaporating and tended to form a crust and ultimately reduced the ability of the ecosystem to transport water from the soil to the atmosphere gs had a positive effect on et fig 9 previous studies showed that et would become more sensitive to gs when the soil moisture gets smaller than a specific threshold depends on soil and plant properties zha et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 the cloudiness could affect the meteorological variables plant response and alter et in general the total radiation increased as ci increased and vpd also increased with ci correspondingly kanniah et al 2013 the comprehensive effects of environmental conditions and ci led to the variation of et under different sky conditions we found there was little difference between et under sunny and cloudy conditions and they were both larger than that under overcast conditions fig 6 in order to compare the relative contribution of ci and other environmental variables to et path analysis was performed under different sky conditions fig 9 on overcast days the rdir and rdif were small as a consequence of high reflection of radiation back to space by the clouds gu et al 1999 an increase in ci induced the increase in both rdir and rdif leading to a positive effect on et the total effects of rdif was the largest cloudiness could suppress et owing to the decrease in rdir and rdif under this sky condition while under cloudy conditions the total effect of rdir was larger than rdif and vpd the enhanced et promoted by rdif due to the decrease in ci could not be compensated for the reduction in et affected by rdir as a result cloudiness could result in a low et this was similar to that obtained under sparse canopies where cloudiness reduced et largely because of the decrease in the vpd and ta rocha et al 2004 under clear sky conditions our analysis confirmed that rdif was more sensitive to the changes in ci followed by rdir the indirect effects of rdif on et through gs were larger than its direct effect as ci deceased an increase in rdif was conducive to stomatal openness which therefore enhanced et previous studies have also found that an increase in cloudiness was conducive to et enhancement by increasing rdif dengel and grace 2010 han et al 2019 the enhanced rdif could not only relieve the stress of high temperature on plants but also allow the shaded leaves received more radiation because of its deep penetration and homogeneous distribution cheng et al 2015 the surface roughness could influence the interactions between near surface airflow and underlying surface and became one of the factors that control energy fluxes and et li et al 2021 the aerodynamic roughness length z0 during 2016 2020 was calculated using ec method chen et al 1993 we found there was an obvious seasonal variation of z0 with the maximum value of 7 4 0 7 cm occurring in september fig s3 in general z0 was found to have a good positive relationship with vegetation growth kotani and sugita 2005 while it might remain constant or tended to decrease when u was particular large because the vegetation tended to bend down with stronger wind and made the canopy surface smoother uchijima 1976 u was generally low at the study site therefore the seasonal variation of z0 could be considered to be closely related to the vegetation dynamics higher z0 was favorable to promote et in addition the surface roughness could affect et by controlling the land surface temperature compared to bare open lands the surface roughness was hypothesized to draw warmer air from aloft by increased turbulent mixing and released more stored heat at night which might facilitate et during nighttime the beihai wetland was a unique floating blanket wetland and this structure could influence the energy and water cycles the vpd observed in this location was fairly low below 1 kpa most of the time according to fig 3 most plants did not experience significant water stress and stomata closure at low vpds et was mainly controlled by radiation during both wet and dry seasons du et al 2021 moreover the water body stored a lot of heat and it had the potential to strengthen heat exchange over wetlands compared to dry land ecosystems lei and yang 2010 the energy for nighttime et was mainly provided by heat stored in water column the heat storage in the water column was related to water depth and qs in this study was larger than that over florida everglades schedlbauer et al 2011 additionally the vegetation floated on the water surface permanently over the wetland and the fraction of vegetation to water surface changed with season it had been reported that the changes in fraction of vegetation to water surface could explain 40 seasonal variation of et du et al 2021 our result showed that a larger fraction of water surface was more favorable for et on annual scale previous study had shown that the vegetation canopy over the water surface could decouple the water surface from the atmosphere and inhibit transport of water vapor from the water surface eichelmann et al 2018 additionally the vegetation dynamics also might affect the surface roughness and albedo thereby influencing the water cycle forzieri et al 2020 kala et al 2014 the wetland structure specially the ratio of open water surfaces to vegetation covered surfaces played a significant role in wetland cycling dynamics across multiple timescales more investigations about the impact of the wetland structural characteristics on the turbulent fluxes should be conducted in the future 5 conclusions based on the ec measurements from 2016 to 2020 the seasonal and year to year variations of et and its controls were investigated over an alpine marsh wetland the seasonal variation in et was found to be considerable the maximum daily et was 4 8 mm d occurring in summer while the minimum daily et was 0 4 mm d occurring in winter the annual et was 762 3 mm in 2016 929 3 mm in 2018 990 5 mm in 2019 and 900 1 mm in 2020 respectively the annual et changed by 30 during the observation period we analyzed the controlling factors of et on different timescales and found et was most influenced by rn from half hourly to monthly scales the cloudiness was also an important driver of daily et and the impact of cloudiness on et varied depending on the sky conditions under overcast conditions the rdir and rdif were small as a consequence of high reflection of radiation back to space by the clouds an increase in cloudiness could induce reductions in both rdir and rdif leading to a negative effect of cloudiness on et on cloudy days rdir acted a key role in promoting et and cloudiness could suppress et due to the decrease in rdir under sunny sky conditions rdif was the main controlling factor of et an increase in rdif was conducive to the increase of gs and therefore et enhancement the annual precipitation varied from 1210 2 mm to 1780 2 mm it changed by 47 during the observation period there was a significant negative relationship between the annual et and annual precipitation the wetter year 2016 with more precipitation days and greater precipitation intensity than that in other four years tended to suppress the annual et changes in the fraction of land cover also contributed the year to year variation of et the fraction of water surface in the current site 2017 2020 was around 37 3 38 4 which was larger than that in the original site 29 7 in 2016 annual et tended to increase as the fraction of water cover increased which was similar to other wetlands the analysis and findings here provide a basis for a better understanding of the energy and water balance over the wetland in the subtropical area interestingly the meteorological conditions cloudiness and inhomogeneity of wetland surface within the flux footprint also have a great impact on carbon dioxide and methane fluxes which will be investigated in future

3043,beihai wetland is a special type of alpine marsh in the southeast of the qinghai tibet plateau with plants like a blanket floating on the water surface permanently long term datasets with eddy covariance ec technique of evapotranspiration et from the wetland ecosystem are still not too much based on ec measurements from 2016 to 2020 we investigated the variations of et and its controlling factors over the beihai wetland our results showed that et was mostly influenced by the net radiation rn from half hourly to monthly timescales as a result of sufficient water supply at the observation site in addition the cloudiness was also a key factor controlling et on daily scale by regulating radiation on overcast and cloudy days cloudiness suppressed et primarily due to the decrease in the direct radiation rdir while under sunny conditions the increased diffuse radiation rdif by cloudiness was conductive to increasing the canopy conductance gs and therefore et on annual scale the annual et ranged from 762 3 to 990 5 mm and the annual precipitation was 1 210 4 1 780 2 mm during 2016 2020 the annual et changed by around 30 while the annual precipitation changed by 47 there was a significant negative relationship between the annual et and the annual precipitation more annual precipitation in 2016 with more precipitation days and greater precipitation intensity than that in other four years resulted in less annual et furthermore the fraction of water surface was another factor controlling year to year variation of et there was a larger fraction of water cover in current site 37 3 38 4 in 2017 2020 than that in the original site 29 7 in 2016 annual et tended to increase as the fraction of water cover increased keywords evapotranspiration eddy covariance

services such as providing freshwater protecting biodiversity sequestering carbon and regulating climate fleischmann et al 2021 yan et al 2020 although they only occupy 5 8 of the global land surface wetlands play an important role in ecosystem energy and water vapor exchange processes keddy 2010 wetlands are vulnerable to global climate changes and have become the focused area of climate change research alekseychik et al 2017 human activities and land use change affect wetlands size and persistence leading to significant wetland loss 50 globally mitsch and gosselink 2007 the combined effects of climate change and land use makes the wetland water and energy budget highly uncertain the hydrological cycle is one of the key components in ecosystems that link other biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycle and energy fluxes wilson and baldocchi 2000 eichelmann et al 2018 as one of the most significant parts of the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration et involves the water vapor fluxes exchange between land surface and atmosphere by the processes of evaporation and transpiration liu et al 2019 it accounts for 60 65 of global terrestrial surface precipitation liu et al 2019 wang and dickinson 2012 accurate and long term et measurements is essential to better understand the interactions between the land surface and atmosphere as well as to understand the water cycle processes brubaker and entekhabi 1996 et can be measured and estimated by several methods such as eddy covariance ec chamber scintillometer weighable lysimeters bowen ratio surface water balance atmosphere water balance methods penman equation as well as the new developed maximum evaporation method wang and dickinson 2012 yang et al 2019 among these methods ec technique is widely applied as a standard method to measure the ecosystem turbulent flux and et continually in a direct and non destructive way baldocchi 2003 wilson and baldocchi 2000 ec has been widely used to quantify et in different wetland ecosystems including marshes malone et al 2014 schedlbauer et al 2011 boreal peatlands alekseychik et al 2017 peichl et al 2013 runkle et al 2014 reed wetlands li et al 2016 serrano ortiz et al 2020 zhou and zhou 2009 and alpine wetlands cao et al 2020 zhang et al 2016b fleischmann et al 2021 investigate et over different wetlands in south america and find the long term patterns of et follow a climate gradient et in equatorial wetlands 1296 1542 mm year is larger than that in temperate wetlands 743 1128 mm year while in boreal wetlands et is relatively small 199 298 mm year peichl et al 2013 in the meanwhile it has been reported that et varies greatly across different types of wetland ecosystems which may be related to the different meteorological conditions and biological features actual et is controlled by complex interactions of environmental and biological factors net radiation rn and air temperature ta are key meteorological factors that influence the seasonal and inter annual variations of et bucci et al 2008 igarashi et al 2015 song et al 2017 and the importance of ta increases with elevation ma et al 2018 the influence of water table position is often of less important and its impact may be confounded by the synoptic meteorological conditions such as less precipitation and higher atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd sonnentag et al 2010 wu et al 2010 cloudiness is a crucial environmental variable that affects the ecosystem carbon and water cycling dynamics gu et al 1999 letts et al 2005 xu et al 2018 several studies have found that cloudiness with large fraction of diffuse radiation rdif could improve the net ecosystem productivity and gross primary productivity kanniah et al 2012 han et al 2019 however there is no consensus on the influence of cloudiness on et according to some research cloudiness was conducive to stomatal openness and et enhancement dengel and grace 2010 wang et al 2008 while for sparse canopies cloudiness may reduce ecosystem et largely as a result of the decrease in vpd and ta rocha et al 2004 clearly cloudiness exerts a coupled and complex impact on et according to previous research the biological factors could control et through the leaf area index lai aerodynamic characteristics canopy conductance gs and the albedo of the ecosystem bagley et al 2017 forzieri et al 2020 williams and torn 2015 variations in et have also been attributed to variations in the type of land cover and wetland structure a research conducted over different agricultural and restored wetland sites in the sacramento san joaquin river delta california showed that the drained sites tended towards lower annual et rates than the flooded sites eichelmann et al 2018 there are large temporal and spatial variations in et due to these varying meteorological and biological controls a better understanding of the controlling mechanisms of et in various wetlands is vital for predicting the future hydrological cycle accurately studies of wetland energy and water exchange processes based on ec techniques have been conducted globally although most of them have been carried out in middle and high latitude regions with relatively little attention given to subtropical wetlands beihai wetland is a unique volcanic dammed lake wetland in tengchong southwest china with plants like a blanket floating on the water surface permanently this wetland is an alpine marsh its hydrogeomorphic characteristics have considerable impacts on the downstream surface water system e g adjacent streams and downstream discharges the study wetland situates within the subtropical monsoon climate zone with high temperature large precipitation and many cloudy days in wet season may to october the field site located in the southeast of the qinghai tibet plateau the tibetan plateau is an essential platform for water vapor transfer which is associated with the asian monsoon outbreak xu et al 2002 tengchong is located in this water vapor transfer corridor and the water vapor flux exchange processes over this region are important for a better understanding of the east asian water vapor cycle based on the five year continuous ec measurements of energy and water fluxes from 2016 to 2020 we investigate the variations of energy and et over this wetland ecosystem the objectives of this paper were to 1 analyze the seasonal and year to year variations of energy fluxes and et 2 identify the main factors controlling et on different timescales and 3 investigate the effects of cloudiness on et over this floating blanket wetland this research can provide a scientific basis and theoretical references for hydrological modeling a better understanding of the hydrological cycle mechanisms in high altitude areas and the impact of climate change on water cycle processes of wetland ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the observation site is located at beihai wetland tengchong county yunnan province in southwest china beihai wetland belongs to the irrawaddy river system it is the source of daying river which flows into the bay of bengal this wetland has a runoff area of 21 75 km2 and most of the runoff is supplied by precipitation although some originate from mountain streams and springs feng 2013 the wetland is surrounded by hills with the height difference between the wetland and the hills exceeding 200 m the original observation site 25 07 18 5 n 98 33 21 9 e was established in june 2015 its location was changed from near the shore to the middle of the wetland in march 2017 the current site 25 07 24 n 98 33 19 e 1728 m a s l was about 180 m from the original site fig 1 a this site situates within the subtropical monsoon climate zone with distinct wet may to october and dry seasons november to april according to meteorological records 1981 2010 from tengchong county weather observation station which is 16 5 km far from the wetland the annual sum precipitation and annual mean ta are 1532 4 mm and 15 4 c respectively beihai wetland is a marsh wetland with plants permanently floating on the water surface like a blanket there is a seasonal variation of the fraction of vegetation to water surface the dominant plants over the wetland surface were cyperus duclouxii e g camus and oberonia iridifolia roxb ex lindl with the maximum height exceeding 2 m above the wetland surface more details of the wetland are presented by du et al 2021 2 2 the instruments and data processing the ec system was installed on a platform at a height of 1 5 m above the water surface the platform covered an area of 10 5 m2 the flux observation instruments primarily consisted of an open path ec system and a conventional meteorological observation system the ec system included a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3a campbell scientific logan ut usa an open path methane ch4 analyzer li 7700 li cor inc lincoln nb usa and an open path carbon dioxide water vapor

scientific data collector more details are provided by du et al 2021 the eddypro 7 0 4 software li cor inc was used to process 10 hz raw data and calculate the half hourly sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le post processing settings were also implemented in the eddypro software spikes due to electronic and physical noise were filtered according to vickers and mahrt 1997 the effect of terrain on fluxes was corrected by the double rotation of coordinate method kaimal and finnigan 1994 transfer functions proposed by moncrieff et al 1997 moncrieff et al 2004 were applied to correct the spectral losses the webb pearman leuning wpl correction was applied to correct h2o and co2 fluxes due to the density fluctuation of the air webb et al 1980 data obtained during rainy days was discarded following the post processing of raw data a quality assessment was performed using the flag system 0 1 and 2 foken et al 2005 poor quality data with a flag value of 2 were discarded from the following analysis the footprint source area was analyzed using the footprint model developed by kljun et al 2015 the footprint of the current site was shown in fig 1c and the footprint of the original site was presented by du et al 2021 the measured fluxes all originated from the wetland surface and the flux contribution area was mainly distributed in the southwestern and northeastern sectors depending on the prevailing wind direction there were some gaps in the observed energy fluxes due to weather conditions system malfunctions or quality control approximately 70 of the h and 65 of the le data recorded from 2016 to 2020 were available the filling method for et data was determined by the gap length with a linear interpolation used when the gap length was 2 h and marginal distribution sampling mds reichstein et al 2005 used when the gap length was longer than 2 h the energy balance ratio ebr was used to evaluate the ec data quality which was calculated as 1 e b r h l e r n q s the ebr on daily timescale could be calculated as ebr h le rn qs the energy storage in the vegetation canopy was relative small and could be negligible qs in eq 1 referred to the heat storage in the water it was calculated as following nordbo et al 2011 2 q s ρ w c pw i 1 n δ t wi δ t δ z i where ρ w is the water density 1 103 kg m 3 c pw is the specific heat of water at constant pressure 4192 j kg 1 k 1 δ t wi is the change of water temperature at the specific level i over a specific time δ t 30 min for this study and δ z i is the depth interval between two successive levels m based on the daily data from 2016 to 2020 the slope between h le and rn qs was 0 77 with regression intercepts of 8 81 w m 2 and a determining coefficient r2 of 0 65 fig 2 the average ebr value was 0 85 in this study which was within the range from other wetland sites cui and chui 2019 the energy imbalance was observed across all ec sites in the fluxnet network about 10 30 stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 the main reasons for the energy imbalance were instrument bias such as different types of gas analyzers systematic measurements sampling errors such as a discrepancy between rn sensors and the flux footprint and the loss of low and high frequencies in flux measurements forken 2008 leuning et al 2012 wilson et al 2002 2 3 biophysical parameters the clearness index ci was used as an indicator of sky conditions it was defined as the ratio of solar radiation rs received above the canopy to the extraterrestrial global horizontal solar radiation r0 as following gu et al 1999 3 ci rs r0 4 r0 rsc 1 0 033cos 360d 365 sin β 5 sin β sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ cos ω due to the lack of measurements of the diffuse radiation rdif during the observation period we used the reindl model reindl et al

classify sky conditions theoretically ci was a number between 0 overcast and 1 sunny we divided sky conditions into sunny 0 6 c i 1 cloudy 0 2 c i 0 6 and overcast 0 c i 0 2 following okogbue et al 2009 during the period from 2016 to 2020 approximately 87 119 days were sunny days per year the cloudy and overcast days per year accounted for about 57 66 and 11 12 of all days respectively table 1 to identify the biotic controls on et we calculated the canopy conductance gs based on observed energy fluxes and meteorological data the gs was obtained by inverting the penman monteith equation

which can be calculated through the quality controlled estimation of friction velocity u as follows 12 g a 1 u u 2 6 2 u 2 3 where u is the wind speed m s and u is the friction velocity m s 2 4 path analysis path analysis as a multiple regression method was widely applied to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables huxman et al 2003 wu et al 2017 zhuang et al 2016 it was especially effective in evaluating data where independence among variables was uncertain because it could exclude potential relationships between independent variables chen et al 2015 huxman et al 2003 this method was a particular useful analysis tool when a priori causal relationships among variables were well known li 1981 we used the spss amos version 24 0 ibm inc usa software for the path analysis first a model was constructed of the relationship between et and the independent variables which were chosen according to prior knowledge i e rdir rdif vpd ci ta gs in this paper han et al 2019 xu et al 2018 we then put the standardized data into the path model and used the maximum likelihood method to calculate the path coefficients ρ and discrepancy shao et al 2016 to optimize the final path model structure only the significant paths p 0 05 and ρ within the range of 0 1 0 1 were retained in general a high goodness of fit was considered to have been achieved when the root mean square error of approximation rmsea was 0 05 and the good fit index gfi was greater than 0 9 kline 2011 ueyama et al 2014 3 results 3 1 meteorological condition the variation of daily average meteorological variables was shown in fig 3 the daily integrated solar radiation rs over grass and water surfaces was the same ranging from about 1 4 to 27 5 mj m 2 d 1 the daily average ta ranged from 4 2 to 22 9 c the annual mean ta during the five years was 15 5 15 1 14 8 15 2 and 15 3 c respectively which was near or lower than the long term climate average 15 4 c this is evident in a period of high ta in 2016 compared with the other four years of observations the water surface temperature tw was a little bit higher than ta with the maximum value of 25 7 c it always above 0 c even during the entire winter period there was a small decrease in both ta and tw during the wet season due to the increase in precipitation the vpd was generally larger in spring with a maximum value of 1 13 kpa the mean u at 3 m above the wetland surface was largest in spring 3 1 m s and lowest in autumn the prevailing wind direction was southwest and northeast through the year fig 1d southwest direction was dominant during the wet season while that in the dry season was southwest and northeast fig s1 left this seasonal change of wind direction was mainly caused by the monsoon circulation there was difference in wind direction distribution between nighttime and daytime due to the complex terrain in this area while southwest was dominated during the daytime there was a significant proportion of winds from northeast and southeast sectors fig s1 right the annual total precipitation from 2016 to 2020 was 1 780 2 1 490 3 1 494 4 1 210 4 and 1 497 3 mm the precipitation data were obtained from the tengchong county weather station approximately 16 5 km away from the site respectively fig 3 most of precipitation occurred during the wet season 78 91 the year 2019 was considered to be a dry year with less annual precipitation compared to the long term climate average 1532 4 mm 2019 was ranked 4nd for total annual precipitation out of 40 years 1981 2020 in the data from the monitoring site this is evident in a period of less precipitation in spring and summer of 2019 compared with other four years of observations fig s2a 108 effective precipitation events daily precipitation 1 mm were observed in this year which was lower than that in other years fig s2b the year 2016 was wetter than the long term climate average which ranked 7nd for total annual precipitation out of 40 years it was primarily due to more precipitation days and greater precipitation intensity daily precipitation of 25 50 mm d contributed the most to the annual precipitation in 2016 while daily precipitation of 10 25 mm d contributed the most to the total precipitation in other four years fig s2c the other three years had near normal climate conditions 2020 was the second wettest year after 2016 during the observation period while the precipitation in august was 508 9 mm 3 2 mean daily pattern of energy fluxes the net radiation rn was characterized by a clear diurnal pattern it peaked at midday and became negative overnight fig 4 a rn over the grass surface peak value 522 w m 2 was smaller than that over the water surface peak value 574 w m 2 which was mainly caused by the difference in their albedo the albedo during the noon hours over the grass surface and water surface were 0 09 0 13 and 0 03 0 06 respectively the diurnal changes in albedo over both water and grass surfaces followed a u shape and the magnitude of the albedo during the dry season was larger than that during the wet season fig 4b driven by the variation of the solar elevation angle h and le also displayed a distinct diurnal cycle followed rn and the monthly average diurnal h and le had seasonal variation during the spring the peak values of h varied from 83 w m 2 in march to 68 w m 2 in may which was approximately 16 19 of the rn fig 4c the amplitude of h declined to the lowest level during summer peak value 55 w m 2 and reached its maximum in winter peak value 116 w m 2 the seasonal variation of le followed the opposite pattern to that of h the peak value of le ranged from 143 w m 2 to 205 w m 2 from winter to spring fig 4d as the wet season coming the amplitude of le increased and reached its maximum around 225 w m 2 in summer the qs was large in the daytime and remained negative during the night fig 4e indicating that water released heat into the atmosphere during nighttime the heat exchange between the lake water and the sediment was not estimated due to the lack of sediment temperature measurements which likely led to a bias in the calculation of qs however nordbo et al 2011 reported that the contribution of heat stored in the sediment was small and the bias caused by heat storage in the sediment was less than the inaccuracy in determining qs in general the maximum values of h rn occurred around noon fig 5 a this diurnal pattern of h rn was similar to that reported over a carex lasiocarpa mire in the sanjiang plain guo and sun 2012 le rn during the daytime had a clear u shape diurnal curve gig 5b it was close to or even greater than 1 around sunrise and sunset indicating that the available energy was mostly consumed by evaporation during the night le rn became negative and varied over a wide range between 1 and 0 as a result of the low turbulent le the bowe ratio bo was small or negative near sunrise and sunset but was large in the middle of the day fig 5c bo in the daylight hours varied between 0 and 0 5 during the wet season while during the dry season it ranged from 0 to 1 and even assumed values larger than 1 in winter the diurnal variation of bo was asymmetric from march to august with larger values in the morning than that in the afternoon and evening a similar diurnal pattern of bo was observed over a peatland fen in russia during the growing season where bo peaked in the early morning and approached 0 85 runkle et al 2014 the monthly average diurnal qs rn displayed no obvious seasonal variation and daytime qs accounted for about 29 37 of the rn during observation period fig 5d 3 3 monthly average diurnal and seasonal variations of evapotranspiration the monthly average diurnal variation of et followed a typical unimodal curve fig 6 during the winter the highest mean hourly et under sunny conditions was 0 27 mm h 1 and the maximum values oscillated around 0 38 mm h 1 et began to increase from spring and peaked in summer the highest mean hourly et hovered around 0 49 mm h 1 while the maximum hourly et value was 0 55 mm h 1 comparable values of hourly et in the noon hours were characteristics of the sanjiang plain wetland guo and sun 2012 at night there was no transpiration from vegetation due to the closure of stomata but et was still larger than 0 because evaporation from the water surface could continue nighttime et has also been observed over an open bog and peatland in japan and freshwater wetlands in the sacramento san joaquin river delta california usa eichelmann et al 2018 hirano et al 2016 this continuous transmission of water vapor to the atmosphere during nighttime is an important feature of lakes cui and chui 2019 du et al 2018 the daily and monthly total et was calculated after gaps in the et data were filled the total et in 2017 was not considered because several months of data were missing the seasonal variation of daily et was shown in fig 7 during the winter the daily et ranged from 0 4 mm d to 3 0 mm d in the subsequent months a significant increase in the daily et was observed owing to increased turbulent water vapor flux the summer season was characterized by the highest daily et with values of 4 2 4 7 mm d another feature of et in summer was that the daily totals varied within a wide range the lowest daily et was 1 5 mm d while the highest daily totals assumed values of 4 7 mm d the daily average et rate at our site was 2 1 2 7 mm d during 2016 2020 which was similar to the daily et rate in the sanjiang plain in china average 2 3 mm d peak 4 8 mm d guo and sun 2012 a boreal peatland fen in northwestern russia average 2 5 mm d peak 5 8 mm d runkle et al 2014 and a phragmites australis wetland in nebraska usa average 3 0 0 8 mm d mykleby et al 2016 3 4 controlling factors of evapotranspiration there was a strong linkage between et and rn from half hourly to monthly timescales fig 8 in equatorial and temperate wetlands et was driven by radiation primarily fleischmann et al 2021 there was a high water availability throughout the year in equatorial wetlands in wetlands with temperate climate the wet season was in phase with the rn resulting in high et in summer the correlation coefficient for the relationship between et and u was positive on half hourly timescale the turbulent eddies caused by wind shear could promote the gas exchange across the air and the water interface when u was high eugster 2003 the strong control of u on water flux also occurred in other sites mammarella et al 2015 nordbo et al 2011 when the timescale was extended to daily and monthly scales there was no significant relationship between et and u it has been reported that temperature should be considered when studying the evaporation process kuttler and goldbach 2015 similarly we found that et had a strong correlation with tw and ta on different timescales there was a positive correlation between et and vpd this was consistent with the relationship between evaporation and vpd over baldeneysee lake where vpd could explain 65 of the variation in the water flux kuttler and goldbach 2015 precipitation had a weak effect on et on the daily scale the correlation of precipitation and et on the half hourly timescale was not considered because half hourly precipitation data were not available the ci emerged as an important factor affecting et fig 9 ci could not only influence et through environmental variables but also through vegetation characteristics i e gs although ci had no direct impact on gs it could regulate stomata through vpd and radiation the increase in vpd suppressed gs while the rise in rdif and rdir stimulate plant stomata to open under overcast conditions an increase in ci was conducive to increasing rdif rdir and vpd leading to a positive effect on et the total effects of environmental variables on et were sorted by rdif rdir vpd under sunny and cloudy conditions ci induced the increase in both vpd and rdir while decreasing rdif the total effects of environmental variables on et under cloudy conditions were sorted by rdir rdif vpd as the sky condition changed from overcast to sunny condition the direct effect of radiation on et decreased while the indirect effect of radiation on et through gs increased 4 discussion 4 1 energy fluxes during the wet season the daily mean h rn and le rn were 0 23 and 0 63 while daily mean h rn and le rn were 31 and 42 during the dry season the difference of energy partitioning between the wet and dry seasons might be related to vegetation the vegetation played a major part in modulating energy partitioning by transpiration process and leaf reflectance sun et al 2019 the presence of vegetation during the wet season could increase the le rn through the change of vegetation color and transpiration dare idowu et al 2021 wohlfahrt et al 2001 the seasonal variation of energy partitioning varied across regions le dominated the energy partitioning across the entire year over a salt marsh site in southeastern south america tonti et al 2018 for some mid latitude and high latitude wetlands with a monsoon climate the onset of the wet season usually shifted the dominant flux from h to le schedlbauer et al 2011 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2016b it has been found that le played the main role in summer while h had the dominant role in other seasons in the alpine steppe and pasture on the qtp ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 in some regions of the western qtp the annual precipitation was 100 mm and h always dominated in the energy partitioning li 2003 on an annual scale the energy partitioning with each year was similar across years le accounted for about 67 65 72 of rn which was within the range reported for other wetlands malone et al 2014 runkle et al 2014 wu and shukla 2014 bo is widely used to investigate the energy and water dynamics across different ecosystems and climate conditions bowen 1926 it reached its minimum value during summer and peaked in winter the annual average bo during daytime ranged from 0 33 to 0 51 table 2 energy partitioning reflected the response of turbulent fluxes to land cover types and climate changes the significant difference of bo between 2016 and other years might be related to the obvious year to year variation of precipitation and water surface fraction it has been pointed out that the annual bo was controlled by annual precipitation grünwald and bernhofer 2007 yue et al 2018 also found bo during the dry years was higher than during the wet years in the meanwhile the changes in fraction of vegetation water influenced the variation of bo the vegetation dynamics could influence the albedo and radiation received over the wetland surface and hence affect the energy fluxes forzieri et al 2020 eichelmann et al 2018 found the vegetation canopy could lead to significance decrease in water temperature by preventing heating of the water column which might influence the energy partitioning zhao and liu 2017 also reported that the water surface fraction had a great impact on surface energy exchange and energy partitioning over poyang lake in china bo in this study was comparable to that of an inundated swamp gray et al 2018 and a western siberian bog during the growing season alekseychik et al 2017 in contrast bo over a subalpine horizontal flow wetland in jiuzhaigou china was found to be larger than that in our site it may be attributed to the frozen surface during the freezing period which blocked the movement of the water vapor to the atmosphere yan et al 2020 compared with le rn the ratio of qs to rn was small on annual scale the ratio of qs to rn during daytime ranged from 0 21 to 0 32 which was consistent with the contributions of energy stored in the soil and water to the energy budget over a churchill sedge fen in the canadian subarctic eaton and rouse 2001 and a reservoir in the mid latitude region liu et al 2012 the qs rn in the florida everglades marsh with smaller water depth was found to be lower than our study schedlbauer et al 2011 4 2 year to year variation of et the annual et during 2016 2020 over the beihai wetland was 762 3 mm in 2016 929 3 mm in 2018 990 5 mm in 2019 and 900 1 mm in 2020 respectively table 2 the annual et changed by around 30 during the observation period the remarkable difference in the annual et could have resulted from a combination of many factors first precipitation played an important role in the year to year variation of et the annual precipitation ranged from 1 210 4 mm to 1 780 2 mm during 2016 2020 and the annual precipitation changed by almost 47 the year 2016 was a wetter year with more precipitation days and greater precipitation intensity than that in other four years the daily precipitation of 25 50 mm d contributed the most to the annual total precipitation in 2016 while in the dry year 2019 daily precipitation of 10 25 mm d contributed the most to the annual precipitation different precipitation conditions in each year could affect annual et through radiation vapor pressure deficit vegetation stomatal conductance and even canopy interception kucharik et al 2000 it should be noted that the annual et was found to have a significant negative relationship with the annual precipitation determining coefficient was 0 90 p 0 05 similar relationship between cumulative et and precipitation was reported for energy limited sites zhang et al 2018 second obvious change in the fraction of the water surface within the footprint area was observed which was mainly because the location of the observation site changed from near the shore to the middle of the wetland the mean value of the water surface fraction was around 38 in the current site which was larger than that in the original site table 2 the fraction of open water to closed vegetation had a great impact on et dynamics eichelmann et al 2018 some studies showed that compared with open water the presence of plants in a wetland could significantly reduce et due to the physical limitations on vascular vegetation transpiration brümmer et al 2012 kellner 2001 in beihai wetland larger water surface fraction within the footprint area in the current site tended to increase et on annual scale finally the different observation instruments used during 2016 and the following years may have also increased the uncertainty in et estimates an open path ec150 co2 h2o gas analyzer campbell scientific was used in 2016 which then changed to the li 7500a li cor inc at the end of 2017 the annual et in our site was within the range reported for other wetlands fleischmann et al 2021 kang and cho 2021 malone et al 2014 eichelmann et al 2018 peichl et al 2013 xiao et al 2013 yan et al 2020 zhou and zhou 2009 table 3 owing to the management practices and regular irrigation the annual et in zhangye artificial wetland reached 1 300 4 mm year which was notably larger than the annual et over the beihai wetland zhang et al 2016a a previous study found that the annual et values were different over lakes at different altitudes which was attributed to the variation of atmospheric demand across different elevations ma et al 2016 the annual et in our study was larger than that of higher altitude alpine wetlands cao et al 2019 which could be partially explained by the lower atmospheric demand over the beihai wetland cao et al 2020 concluded that the annual et significantly decreased with increasing latitude and the annual et was reduced by 124 1 mm when the elevation increased by 1 000 m without considering the influence of vegetation composition and micro environmental conditions the feedback between et and precipitation et p was an important factor that determined local hydrological patterns malone et al 2014 it also could be used to investigate the impact of climate and land use changes on regional hydrology ma et al 2018 in general the annual et accounted for 43 82 of the precipitation which was within the range reported in previous wetland studies et p ratios of 35 92 cao et al 2019 malone et al 2014 peichl et al 2013 xiao et al 2013 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2016a zhou and zhou 2009 table 3 high et p suggested a strong feedback between the wetland and the regional climate and the wetlands could cool and humidify the surrounding atmosphere through the water loss by et which may be important for the regulation of future climate warming krinner 2003 4 3 environmental and biophysical controls on et in beihai wetland rn was considered to be the most important environmental factor controlling et from half hourly to monthly scales followed by other meteorological factors such as ta and vpd generally vpd affected et in two paths on the one hand when vpd is large the large water pressure between the vegetation s stomata and the atmosphere generally allows water vapor to flow from the stomata to the atmosphere and thus increases et on the other hand an increase in vpd could suppress the vegetation s stomata increasing stomatal resistance and limiting transpiration ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 marques et al 2020 wang et al 2022 in this study vpd ultimately had a promotional effect on et fig 8 previous research conducted over beihai wetland has shown that vpd rn and ta were the main controlling factor of half hourly le during both wet and dry seasons rn ta and vpd together can explained 79 and 81 of the variation in le on half hourly scale for wet and dry seasons respectively du et al 2021 the gs has generally been reported to be a biological factor controlling et wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the annual midday average gs in this site was 9 4 11 4 mm s midday mean gs during the wet season was about 14 5 16 0 mm s which was close to values for a marsh site in the sanjiang plain in northeast china guo et al 2021 and a peatland fen in northwestern russia runkle et al 2014 a negative relationship was noted between vpd and gs fig 10 gs showed a weaker response to vpd in our site than that over a glencar atlantic blanket bog in ireland sottocornola and kiely 2010 the different response of gs to vpd was mainly due to different types and relative abundance of the plants while the wetland surface over study site was covered by water and vegetation in glencar it was mainly covered by bare peat and brown moss which was less efficient in holding moisture once the peat surface dried out the bare peat stopped evaporating and tended to form a crust and ultimately reduced the ability of the ecosystem to transport water from the soil to the atmosphere gs had a positive effect on et fig 9 previous studies showed that et would become more sensitive to gs when the soil moisture gets smaller than a specific threshold depends on soil and plant properties zha et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 the cloudiness could affect the meteorological variables plant response and alter et in general the total radiation increased as ci increased and vpd also increased with ci correspondingly kanniah et al 2013 the comprehensive effects of environmental conditions and ci led to the variation of et under different sky conditions we found there was little difference between et under sunny and cloudy conditions and they were both larger than that under overcast conditions fig 6 in order to compare the relative contribution of ci and other environmental variables to et path analysis was performed under different sky conditions fig 9 on overcast days the rdir and rdif were small as a consequence of high reflection of radiation back to space by the clouds gu et al 1999 an increase in ci induced the increase in both rdir and rdif leading to a positive effect on et the total effects of rdif was the largest cloudiness could suppress et owing to the decrease in rdir and rdif under this sky condition while under cloudy conditions the total effect of rdir was larger than rdif and vpd the enhanced et promoted by rdif due to the decrease in ci could not be compensated for the reduction in et affected by rdir as a result cloudiness could result in a low et this was similar to that obtained under sparse canopies where cloudiness reduced et largely because of the decrease in the vpd and ta rocha et al 2004 under clear sky conditions our analysis confirmed that rdif was more sensitive to the changes in ci followed by rdir the indirect effects of rdif on et through gs were larger than its direct effect as ci deceased an increase in rdif was conducive to stomatal openness which therefore enhanced et previous studies have also found that an increase in cloudiness was conducive to et enhancement by increasing rdif dengel and grace 2010 han et al 2019 the enhanced rdif could not only relieve the stress of high temperature on plants but also allow the shaded leaves received more radiation because of its deep penetration and homogeneous distribution cheng et al 2015 the surface roughness could influence the interactions between near surface airflow and underlying surface and became one of the factors that control energy fluxes and et li et al 2021 the aerodynamic roughness length z0 during 2016 2020 was calculated using ec method chen et al 1993 we found there was an obvious seasonal variation of z0 with the maximum value of 7 4 0 7 cm occurring in september fig s3 in general z0 was found to have a good positive relationship with vegetation growth kotani and sugita 2005 while it might remain constant or tended to decrease when u was particular large because the vegetation tended to bend down with stronger wind and made the canopy surface smoother uchijima 1976 u was generally low at the study site therefore the seasonal variation of z0 could be considered to be closely related to the vegetation dynamics higher z0 was favorable to promote et in addition the surface roughness could affect et by controlling the land surface temperature compared to bare open lands the surface roughness was hypothesized to draw warmer air from aloft by increased turbulent mixing and released more stored heat at night which might facilitate et during nighttime the beihai wetland was a unique floating blanket wetland and this structure could influence the energy and water cycles the vpd observed in this location was fairly low below 1 kpa most of the time according to fig 3 most plants did not experience significant water stress and stomata closure at low vpds et was mainly controlled by radiation during both wet and dry seasons du et al 2021 moreover the water body stored a lot of heat and it had the potential to strengthen heat exchange over wetlands compared to dry land ecosystems lei and yang 2010 the energy for nighttime et was mainly provided by heat stored in water column the heat storage in the water column was related to water depth and qs in this study was larger than that over florida everglades schedlbauer et al 2011 additionally the vegetation floated on the water surface permanently over the wetland and the fraction of vegetation to water surface changed with season it had been reported that the changes in fraction of vegetation to water surface could explain 40 seasonal variation of et du et al 2021 our result showed that a larger fraction of water surface was more favorable for et on annual scale previous study had shown that the vegetation canopy over the water surface could decouple the water surface from the atmosphere and inhibit transport of water vapor from the water surface eichelmann et al 2018 additionally the vegetation dynamics also might affect the surface roughness and albedo thereby influencing the water cycle forzieri et al 2020 kala et al 2014 the wetland structure specially the ratio of open water surfaces to vegetation covered surfaces played a significant role in wetland cycling dynamics across multiple timescales more investigations about the impact of the wetland structural characteristics on the turbulent fluxes should be conducted in the future 5 conclusions based on the ec measurements from 2016 to 2020 the seasonal and year to year variations of et and its controls were investigated over an alpine marsh wetland the seasonal variation in et was found to be considerable the maximum daily et was 4 8 mm d occurring in summer while the minimum daily et was 0 4 mm d occurring in winter the annual et was 762 3 mm in 2016 929 3 mm in 2018 990 5 mm in 2019 and 900 1 mm in 2020 respectively the annual et changed by 30 during the observation period we analyzed the controlling factors of et on different timescales and found et was most influenced by rn from half hourly to monthly scales the cloudiness was also an important driver of daily et and the impact of cloudiness on et varied depending on the sky conditions under overcast conditions the rdir and rdif were small as a consequence of high reflection of radiation back to space by the clouds an increase in cloudiness could induce reductions in both rdir and rdif leading to a negative effect of cloudiness on et on cloudy days rdir acted a key role in promoting et and cloudiness could suppress et due to the decrease in rdir under sunny sky conditions rdif was the main controlling factor of et an increase in rdif was conducive to the increase of gs and therefore et enhancement the annual precipitation varied from 1210 2 mm to 1780 2 mm it changed by 47 during the observation period there was a significant negative relationship between the annual et and annual precipitation the wetter year 2016 with more precipitation days and greater precipitation intensity than that in other four years tended to suppress the annual et changes in the fraction of land cover also contributed the year to year variation of et the fraction of water surface in the current site 2017 2020 was around 37 3 38 4 which was larger than that in the original site 29 7 in 2016 annual et tended to increase as the fraction of water cover increased which was similar to other wetlands the analysis and findings here provide a basis for a better understanding of the energy and water balance over the wetland in the subtropical area interestingly the meteorological conditions cloudiness and inhomogeneity of wetland surface within the flux footprint also have a great impact on carbon dioxide and methane fluxes which will be investigated in future

3044,fractures are effective seepage channels and storage spaces for oil gas and groundwater understanding the distribution characteristics of fractures can improve the efficiency of water production and the control of water related geohazards in fractured aquifers the development and distribution of natural fractures are usually controlled by paleotectonic stress fields in this study the data obtained from outcrop cores and thin sections were used to determine the development characteristics of such fractures by doing an analysis of burial history tectonic evolution acoustic emission test rock mechanics test and conjugate joint analysis two dimensional 2d heterogeneous geomechanical models were established by using a finite element method fem stress analysis approach to simulate paleotectonic stress fields during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods the effects of the variations of paleotectonic stress fields hydrodynamic fields structures and rock mechanical parameters on the development of fractures could then be identified a calculation model for the rock rupture rate was established to determine the quantitative development of fractures in different periods favorable areas for natural fracture development were determined by examining the relationship between the fracture linear density and pumping capacity of eleven wells the simulation results indicate that the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods and high stress and or low stress were mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts during the indosinian period the tectonic and dissolution fractures were not developed during the early and late yanshanian periods the tectonic and dissolution fractures were primarily developed around the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions those fault and fold belts are the locations with the greatest development of the natural fractures which are also the main channels for the migration and accumulation of karst groundwater in the ordovician formation in the huainan coalfield this study provides an important reference for the prevention and control of the ordovician karst water damage in the study area and proposes a new method for the prediction of fractured carbonate reservoirs keywords tectonic fractures dissolution fractures paleotectonic stress field geomechanical modelling ordovician huainan coalfield data availability all the data are in the article 1 introduction natural fractures usually include tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures which are effective seepage channels and storage spaces for oil gas and groundwater tang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2009 zhang et al 2021a many studies have shown that the natural fractures developed in most coalfields in the world are closely related to multi period tectonic movements and corrosive fluid dissolution liu et al 2017b wang et al 2016 ye et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2011 understanding the distribution characteristics of natural fractures can improve the efficiency of water production in fractured aquifers and provide an important reference for the prevention and control of water related geohazards in fractured carbonate aquifer during coal resource mining therefore quantitative prediction of degree of natural fracture development and its distribution characteristics has attracted increasing attention from the coalfield hydrogeological community prediction of natural fractures development has gone through three stages up to present qualitative semi quantitative and quantitative prediction qualitative prediction of natural fractures was primarily based on the relationship between the degree of fracture development and its structural position or lithology hunter and young 1953 nelson 1985 gong et al 2021 price 1966 proposed that the degree of fracture development was proportional to the elastic strain energy saved in the rock based on this principle the energy method and fracture rate method were used to predict natural fractures and the prediction of natural fractures has gradually entered the semi quantitative stage murray 1968 was the first researcher to use the curvature method to predict reservoir fractures in a small island oil field in the united states this method is suitable for tectonic fracture prediction in brittle rocks shaban et al 2011 suo et al 2012 lisle 1994 introduced the curvature attribute to the geological field and the technique has been applied in fracture prediction with the continuous discovery of more fractured reservoirs scientists have gradually realized that the formation of tectonic fractures was not only related to physical and mechanical properties of rocks but also closely related to the paleotectonic stress fields gale et al 2014 gong et al 2019 guo et al 2019 tuckwell et al 2003 su et al 2014 methods such as rock mechanics test acoustic emission test and numerical simulation were used to restore and reconstruct the paleostress field to quantitatively predict the tectonic fractures guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 huang et al 2019 liu et al 2017a signaling that fracture prediction has entered the quantitative stage the finite element method fem is generally used to analyze tectonic stress fields and its validity has been confirmed fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li et al 2020 liu et al 2017a numerical simulation of the stress field is based on the mechanism of fracture development considers the actual geological information and combines numerical simulation results with the coulomb mohr criterion and the griffith criterion afterwards the distribution of fractures can be predicted or evaluated up to present most stress field simulations were based on simple geological models treating the geological unit as a homogeneous body with the same mechanical parameters for the entire geological unit without considering the effects of faults and folds guo et al 2016 hashimoto and matsu ura 2006 jiu et al 2013 wu et al 2017 the parameters in those simulations were often inconsistent with the actual geological conditions leading to substantial biases of stress field simulation and fracture prediction in the prediction of tectonic fractures petroliferous basins and coalfields in china especially in the north have undergone multi period tectonic movements and it is difficult to accurately predict fracture development using a single period stress field simulation because of the superposition of multiple tectonic fractures in reservoirs in addition the previous studies mostly focused on the prediction of tectonic fractures in the sandstone or shale formations fang et al 2017 guo et al 2016 ju and sun 2016 liu et al 2021 but did not pay too much attention on the distribution of tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures in the carbonate rocks unlike sandstone and shale tectonic fractures in carbonate rocks are easily dissolved and expanded by corrosive fluids e g meteoric water groundwater and hydrothermal fluids thereby forming dissolution fractures caves and even underground rivers chen et al 2022 li and cai 2017 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b therefore the study of tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures in carbonate rocks is helpful to understand the development and distribution of fractured carbonate aquifers reservoirs the ordovician carbonate is an important oil natural gas and groundwater reservoir in china and is also a key target for the prevention and control of water related geohazards during deep coal mining fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li and cai 2017 liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2019b like other coalfields in northern china the ordovician karst water in the huainan coalfield is an important ecological resource and a major water inrush source that threatens mine safety zhang et al 2019a 2020a 2020b drilling data showed that tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures in the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield are well developed which are the main storage spaces and migration channels for groundwater li et al 2010 zhang et al 2021a previous studies mainly described and counted the fractures in the cores and carbonate outcrop areas but did not investigate the overall distribution characteristics and degree of fracture development from a macroscopic perspective zhang et al 2021a resulting in that the water inrush accidents of the ordovician aquifer in the study area occurred quite frequently and the effect of grouting and blocking groundwater inrush was poor and unsatisfactory to obtain accurate prediction of the distribution of natural fractures in the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield the fem was employed to simulate the paleotectonic stress fields in different periods the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods in this study we will also predict the distribution of tectonic fractures based on the coulomb mohr criterion and griffith criteria and eventually to predict the distribution of tectonic and dissolution fractures combined with the tectonic fracture fields and hydrodynamic fields the accuracy of the prediction results was verified by cores fracture linear density and pumping tests 2 geological setting the huainan coalfield is located on the southeastern margin of the northern china plate at the intersection of the dabie orogenic belt and the tanlu fault belt and it shows an opposite thrust faultfold structural belt extending in the nww see direction fig 1 a c like other areas in northern china the study area experienced indosinian yanshanian and himalayan tectonic movements in the mesozoic era of which the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian are the most important three periods of tectonic activities in the huainan coalfield shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 the indosinian movement occurred in the triassic and the driving force of the tectonic stress field was the collision and docking between the south china plate and the north china plate the huainan coalfield presented a compressional stress field in the nearly ns direction 8 188 in this period the faults and folds in the nearly e w direction were developed in the study area such as fuli fault fufeng fault panji chenqiao anticline and gugou xieqiao syncline during this period shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 the early yanshanian movement occurred in the jurassic and the tectonic stress field was that of the pacific plate moving towards the nw direction and then subducting into the east asian continent the huainan coalfield presented a compressional stress field in the nww see direction 96 276 in this period a series of normal faults in the nne ne directions were developed in the study area which reformed and cut the faults and folds formed during the indosinian period shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 the late yanshanian movement occurred in the cretaceous and the extrusion direction changed from nw in the early yanshanian period to ne in the late yanshanian period such change is the consequence of subduction of the pacific plate in the nw direction and the ne compression of the tethys tectonic domain forcing the lithospheric masses in eastern china to stretch along the nw se direction the huainan coalfield presented a compressional stress field in the ne sw direction 55 235 in the late yanshanian period during this period the study area showed an extensional effect in the nw se direction and the faults formed in the previous tectonic movements further transformed into extensional faults shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 it is worth noting that the faults and folds in the early and late yanshanian periods were somewhat consistent with the existing tectonic framework of the study area the ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield are widely developed the outcrops of shungeng mountain and bagong mountain in the southeastern part of the study area completely expose the ordovician strata which are covered by mesozoic and or cenozoic strata in the rest of the study area zhang et al 2021a the thickness of the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield is from 75 80 m to 142 50 m with an average thickness of 89 0 m from top to bottom they are lower ordovician jiawang formation xiaoxian formation and majiagou formation fig s1 where the middle and upper ordovician strata are missed jiawang formation is composed of argillaceous limestone with an average thickness of 5 0 m fig s1 xiaoxian formation is mainly composed of argillaceous limestone dolomitic limestone and breccia limestone with an average thickness of 59 6 m majiagou formation is primarily composed of dolomitic limestone limy dolomite and dolomite with an average thickness of 24 4 m fig s1 below jiawang formation are the cambrian strata mainly composed of dolomite siliceous dolomite oolitic limestone leopard limestone and quartz sandstone with an average thickness of 1060 m above majiagou formation upwards are the carboniferous and permian strata composed of coal seams thin layer limestone mudstone and sandstone with a total average thickness of 1076 m fig 1b upward are the mesozoic and cenozoic sediments dominated by sandstone and mudstone with a total average thickness of 930 m fig 1b 3 methodology 3 1 sample and testing currently sixty three exploration wells in the huainan coalfield fully penetrated the ordovician strata these wells are distributed throughout the study area thus providing a rather detailed geological hydrogeological and geomechanical information database of the study area in this study the observation and test data from the ordovician outcrops shungeng mountain and bagong mountain see fig 1c and 11 representative wells fig 1c with 182 core samples were selected for further analysis thirty six core samples used for thin section observation were polished to a thickness of about 0 04 mm the pore structure and fillings were microscopically observed using an olympus cx41 microscope shinjuku tokyo japan in the state key laboratory of anhui university of science and technology zhang et al 2021a sixteen core samples used for rock mechanical parameter testing were made into cylinders with a diameter of 25 mm and a height of 50 mm the top and bottom surfaces of these samples were parallel with each other the rock mechanics tests for all core samples were carried out using the mts 816 rock mechanics test system mts systems corporation minnesota usa in the state key laboratory of anhui university of science and technology the experimental procedures were based on the chinese national standard gb23561 2009 t method for determining the physical and mechanical properties of coal and rock for instance uniaxial compression tests were performed to obtain the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of rocks table 1 brazilian splitting tests were performed to obtain the tensile strength of rocks table 2 triaxial compression tests were performed to determine shear strength data of rocks compressive strength cohesion and internal friction angles were determined from fracture pressure elastic modulus and poisson s ratio under different confining pressures table 3 the confining pressures used in the triaxial rock compression tests were 0 5 and 10 mpa respectively acoustic emission ae test is a technique for determining paleo tectonic stress values liu et al 2017a guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 in this study six samples were used for paleotectonic stress analysis in the state key laboratory of anhui university of science and technology as well the experimental setup was composed of a ds5 8b acoustic emission instrument a 300 kn universal press strain sensors and a microcomputer this device can assess stresses from paleotectonic stress periods and reveal the maximum effective principal stress that the strata have experienced table 4 the tectonic stress periods of the rock can be judged by using the number of kaiser effect points appearing on the ae curve of the acoustic emission experiment the direction of the maximum principal stress can be determined from the test results of such stress combined with the analysis of regional tectonic evolution history 3 2 classification of fractures field investigations and drilled cores showed that the pore types in the ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield are dominated by tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures fig 2 a h these fractures can be subdivided into vertical fractures dip angle 80 90 high angle fractures dip angle 60 80 medium angle fractures dip angle 40 60 low angle fractures dip angle 10 40 and horizontal fractures dip angle 0 10 the vertical high and medium angle fractures in the study area are well developed fig 2a g with a width of 0 1 300 mm and an extension length ranging from a few centimeters to several meters while the low angle and horizontal fractures are relatively weakly developed which are almost parallel to the strata bedding or oblique to the strata at low angles fig 2a b the inter cutting phenomenon between vertical fractures high angle fractures medium angle fractures low angle fractures and horizontal fractures is very common fig 2a b which is mainly related to the geological background of multi period tectonic movements zhang et al 2021a the statistics of 692 fractures in the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield showed that the fractures are mainly high angle fractures accounting for 44 22 and medium angle fractures accounting for 25 72 followed by vertical fractures accounting for 12 14 and low angle fractures accounting for 17 63 and horizontal fractures accounting for 0 29 the least fig s2a and they are mainly ne sw nne ssw and nee sww directions followed by nww see and nnw sse directions fig s2b among the 692 fractures analyzed there are a total of 568 vertical high and medium angle fractures of which 280 fractures are full filled 157 fractures are semi filled and 131 fractures are unfilled accounting for 54 03 36 29 and 9 68 of the total number of the vertical and high angle fractures respectively fig s3a there are a total of 124 low angle and horizontal fractures of which 67 fractures are full filled 45 fractures are semi filled and only 12 fractures are unfilled accounting for 54 03 36 29 and 9 68 of the total number of the low angle and horizontal fractures respectively fig s3b zhang et al 2021a found that the vertical high and medium angle fractures played a vital role in improving the permeability and karstification of the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield the fillings in the fractures are mainly calcite and clay 3 3 timing of fracture formation and stress states of fractures as discussed above different types of fractures were formed in the huainan coalfield because of the intensity and mode of the multi period tectonic stress field and the characteristics and strengths of structural deformation in the study area during different periods the timing of fracture formation and the state of paleotectonic stress should be identified to accurately predict the development and distribution of natural fractures burial history tectonic evolution stress field evolution isotopic geochemistry and other analyses are all important geological bases for identifying different stages of the tectonic stress field guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 liu et al 2017a zeng et al 2013 through the analysis of the tectonic thermal evolution and the evolution of the coalbed methane cbm reservoir forming dynamic system li et al 2002 and zhang et al 2005 found that the huainan coalfield mainly experienced three periods of tectonic movements from the triassic to the early cretaceous the first tectonic movement occurred at 240 ma the late triassic the second tectonic movement occurred at 160 ma the middle jurassic and the third tectonic movement occurred at 120 ma the early cretaceous zhan et al 2017 considered that the huainan coalfield mainly experienced four tectonic evolution stages stable subsidence stage cp structural deformation t j extensional uplift k e and depression deposition n q the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian tectonic movements occurred during the structural deformation and extensional uplift stages were particularly important for the development of fractures in the study area which control the distribution of coal measure natural gas in the coalfield zhang et al 2021b systematically analyzed the isotopes and minor elements of paleokarst fillings in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield and divided the evolution processes of paleokarst into four periods 1 late cambrian to middle ordovician 2 triassic 3 jurassic and 4 cretaceous the formation of tectonic and dissolution fractures is primarily related to the tectonic movements in the latter three periods that is the indosinian movement triassic the early yanshanian movement jurassic and the late yanshanian movement cretaceous as shown in fig 3 in addition acoustic emission test in this study also verified that the huainan coalfield experienced at least five tectonic stress rupture periods fig 4 and the tectonic movements occurred in the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods were particularly important for the formation of fractures previous studies have shown that conjugate joints a kind of shear fracture are of great significance in the identification of the state of paleotectonic stress fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 liu et al 2017a based on the statistics of 318 shear fractures in the southeastern outcrop of the huainan coalfield we found that the strike directions of these fractures were mainly nee sww fig s4a followed by ne sw and nne ssw the dip directions of these fractures were mainly sse followed by nnw nw and nww fig s4b through analyzing detailed observation combined with the regional geological setting three groups of conjugate joints were identified namely ne sw and nnw sse directions nee sww and nww see directions and nne ssw and nee sww directions fig 5 based on the development mechanism of the conjugate joints and their relationship with the orientations of the three principal stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 the corresponding paleotectonic stress directions can be derived from the orientation of the conjugate joints hancock and kadhi 1978 hancock 1985 brandes et al 2013 maerten et al 2016 using the stereographic projection method one can project the conjugate joints onto the wulff net lower hemispherical projection to draw the stress diagram kutty and joy 1997 maerten et al 2016 thus to obtain the occurrences of the three principal stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 of the conjugate joints as shown in fig 5 combining the history of the regional tectonic evolution of this investigation and results of previous studies shi et al 2021 shu et al 2017 wu et al 2014 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 the timing of formation of the three groups conjugate joints and the corresponding paleo tectonic stress states were determined as follows 1 the strike directions of the first group conjugate joints are ne sw and nnw sse indicating that the maximum principal stress is approximately along the ns direction 8 188 fig 5 which is a product of the indosinian movement shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 2 the strike directions of the second group conjugate joints are nee sww and nww see indicating that the maximum principal stress is nww see 96 276 fig 5 which is a product of the early yanshanian movement shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 3 the strike directions of the third group conjugate joints are nne ssw and nee sww indicating that the maximum principal stress is ne sw 55 235 fig 5 which is a product of the late yanshanian movement shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 therefore based on the conjugate joint analysis and acoustic emission test results table 4 combined with the analysis of the regional tectonic evolution history the paleotectonic stress field of the target layer in the study area includes three major periods indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian the maximum principal stress of the indosinian period was 88 03 113 93 mpa with an average value of 103 57 mpa the maximum principal stress of the early yanshanian period was 84 27 114 01 mpa with an average value of 99 14 mpa the maximum principal stress of the late yanshanian period was 91 02 123 18 mpa with an average value of 107 10 mpa the maximum principal stress directions of each tectonic period are approximately ns 8 188 nww see 96 276 and ne sw 55 235 respectively 4 theory and methods previous studies have found that the paleotectonic stress field controlled the formation development and distribution of tectonic fractures fang et al 2017 guo et al 2016 laurent and frantz 2006 li et al 2021 liu et al 2017a therefore the study of the paleotectonic stress field is helpful to reveal the development and distribution of tectonic fractures and then to determine their development areas in this study the finite element software comsol 5 3a was used to simulate the paleotectonic stress fields of the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods in the huainan coalfield the simulation of the paleotectonic stress field mainly includes the following steps 1 establishment of geological model 2 establishment of mechanical model 3 establishment of mathematical model 4 verification of inversion results and 5 model calculation 4 1 simulation of multi period paleotectonic stress fields 4 1 1 establishment of geological model the geological model is generally composed of the target strata and the geological structure in this study the ordovician strata and the faults and folds were taken as the study objects of the geological model compared with the boundary length of the study area 100 km long from east to west and 30 km wide from north to south the average thickness of the ordovician strata in the study area is merely 89 0 m fig s1 which is less than 0 1 of the length and less than 0 3 of the width thus the ordovician strata could be treated as thin plates furthermore the purpose of this simulation was mainly to show the control effect of the paleotectonic stress field on tectonic fractures from a macroscopic perspective so a two dimensional 2d geological model could be employed for numerical simulation in this study the 3d model can better reveal the control effect of faults and folds on the spatial distribution of fractures which will be an important direction for further research to eliminate the influence of boundary effects on the simulation results the model boundary was appropriately enlarged which was 135 km long from east to west and 70 km wide from north to south fig 6 a c however since the huainan coalfield is located on the southeastern margin of the northern china plate the eastern and southern boundaries of the models in this study are inevitably affected by the plate boundary during different periods of tectonic movement the faults and folds in the study area were different based on the previous analysis we know that the nearly e w faults and folds were mainly formed during the indosinian period fig 6a and the faults and folds in the early and late yanshanian periods were consistent with the existing tectonic framework of the study area fig 6b c according to the actual situation the faults folds and their adjacent rocks were defined as the fault and fold belts and the width of the fault and fold belts were determined based on the scale of the faults and folds in this study the primary fault and fold belts were both set as 1000 m wide and the secondary fault and fold belts were both set as 500 m wide the distribution of the fault and fold belts is shown in fig 6a c 4 1 2 establishment of mechanical model the establishment of the mechanical models includes the following two steps 1 determining the rock mechanical parameters of different units of the target strata in the study area 2 determining the loading methods size and constraint conditions of the tectonic stress on the boundary of the geological body 4 1 2 1 determination of the rock mechanical parameters the geomechanical model in the fem is an elastic body composed of individual units which have different rock mechanical properties in different units such as elastic modulus e and poisson s ratio μ therefore the tectonic zones the fault and fold belts and the non tectonic zones in the geomechanical model have been assigned different rock mechanical parameters the rock mechanical parameters of the ordovician strata in the non tectonic zones in the huainan coalfield were obtained through the uniaxial and triaxial rock tests tables 1 3 but the rock mechanical parameters in the tectonic zones were calculated based on previous studies which have shown that the elastic modulus values of the primary fault and fold belts in the tectonic zones were 70 and 75 of that in the non tectonic zones and the elastic modulus values of the secondary fault and fold belts in the tectonic zones were 80 and 85 of that in the non tectonic zones fang et al 2017 guo et al 2016 compared with the non tectonic zones the poisson ratio of the primary fault and fold belts in the tectonic zones was 5 larger than that in the non tectonic zones and the poisson ratio of the secondary fault and fold belts in the tectonic zones was 10 larger than that in the non tectonic zones fang et al 2017 guo et al 2016 therefore the rock mechanical parameters of the tectonic zones could be calculated based on the test results of the rock mechanical parameters of the non tectonic zones table 5 4 1 2 2 determination of the boundary conditions the boundary conditions include displacement and stress boundary conditions the rock mechanical test results showed that the rock deformation was primarily elastic before rupture and the stress was significantly reduced after fracturing therefore the assumption for the elastic model was used to simulate the geological body in this study this kind of elastic model has been successfully applied and the reliability and accuracy of the model have been verified by field engineering practices guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 the boundary stress of this model was mainly horizontal tectonic stress which was assumed to be a set of determined values that were uniformly loaded on the boundary of the model and the loading processes were divided into three stages the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods based on the results of previous studies on the paleotectonic stress fields of the northern china plate zheng 2008 peng et al 2015 fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 the maximum horizontal principal stresses in the indosinian period the early yanshanian period and the late yanshanian period were respectively 93 64 117 65 mpa 78 32 106 43 mpa and 89 53 121 15 mpa which were very close to the acoustic emission test results table 4 in this study thus the directions and sizes of the maximum and minimum horizontal principal stresses of the multi period paleotectonic stress fields in the huainan coalfield were determined fig 6a c in the stratum with a depth of less than 4000 m the ratio of the maximum horizontal principal stress to the minimum horizontal principal stress is approximately 2 1 guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 thus in the indosinian period the maximum horizontal principal stress was 103 57 mpa which was applied to the south boundary of the model from the ssw direction the minimum horizontal principal stress was 49 32 mpa which was applied to the east boundary of the model from the see direction in the early yanshanian period the maximum horizontal principal stress was 99 14 mpa which was applied to the east boundary of the model from the nee direction the minimum horizontal principal stress was 47 20 mpa which was applied to the south boundary of the model from the sse direction in the late yanshanian period the maximum horizontal principal stress was 107 10 mpa which was applied to the west boundary of the model from the sw direction the minimum horizontal principal stress was 51 0 mpa indicates tensile stress which was applied to the north boundary of the model from the nw direction 4 1 3 establishment of mathematical model the mathematical model is a method to quantitatively predict fractures and this model includes the numerical calculation method according to the mechanical model the fem chosen as the numerical calculation method in this study is the most important method used to determine the element type the element division and the concrete implementation plan based on the geological model and the mechanical model for the finite element method the tectonic framework is the foundation of the geomechanical model and the fem the mesh generation of the faults and fold zones in the study area not only affects the accuracy of the geomechanical model but also plays an important role in the simulation of the paleotectonic stress fields and the prediction of the distribution of tectonic fractures fang et al 2017 gale et al 2014 guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 tuckwell et al 2003 taking into account the differences between the tectonic zones and the non tectonic zones in the study area the meshes of the fault and fold belts were refined in this study and the geomechanical model was discretized by the triangular grid 3 nodes and quadrilateral grid 4 nodes eventually the indosinian model contained 4167 nodes and 8188 elements the early yanshanian model contained 12 710 nodes and 25 272 elements and the late yanshanian model contained 12 923 nodes and 25 704 elements as shown in fig 6a c the mesh refinement can be described as follows first the model was discretized with a coarse grid and triangular elements and the simulation was executed second the mesh in the first step is refined usually by two and the simulation was executed the discrepancy of simulation results such as the numerical solution of the maximum horizontal principal stress in the observation hole of above coarser and finer grids are compared if the discrepancy is below a pre defined threshold i e the relative error between the numerical solution and the measured values was less than 20 the simulation result can be regarded as mesh free and is acceptable otherwise one needs to further refine the mesh and repeat above two steps until the results become mesh free eventually in the simulations the faults were considered to be fault belts with certain widths such faults cannot propagate but were allowed to displace under tectonic stress in this modeling exercises our main concern was the influence of the macroscopic distribution of faults on stress distribution in the study area therefore the fault matrix interfaces were not specifically simulated such a simplification is acceptable for modeling large scale macroscopic characteristics of fractures and faults however it may not be acceptable for modeling localized or small scale fractures or faults in which the distinctive fracture or fault matrix interfaces may be of concern this is a subject out of the scope of this study but should be examined in the future the internal points along the y coordinate axis directions showed displacement when the elements were subjected to the palaeotectonic stress the displacement of each point along the two directions can be expressed as u and v and the displacements are all in relation to the coordinates of the point function they can be defined as follows guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 1 u u x y v v x y where u and v are displacements on the x and y axes based on the elastic mechanics there is a relationship between the displacement and the strain that can be expressed as follows guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2 ε x u x ε y u y γ xy γ yx u x u y where εx εy are the linear strain components and γxy γyx are the shear strain components in the deformation of the element according to formula 2 the relationship between the strain and the nodal displacement matrix can be simplified as follows guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 3 ε b δ where δ is the displacement matrix of the nodes and b is a geometric matrix from the elastic mechanics stress and strain can be described in the following form guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 4 ε x 1 e δ x u δ y ε y 1 e δ y u δ x γ xy γ yx τ xy g where δx and δy are the normal stresses components τxy is the shear stress components e is the elastic modulus μ is the poisson s ratio and g is the shear modulus by simplifying equation 4 stress and strain can be shown as follows guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 5 δ d ε where d is the elasticity matrix 4 1 4 verification of inversion results the measurements of paleotectonic stress in the hn3 and hn7 wells are listed in table 6 the measurement results of the two wells were used as constraint conditions for the inversion of the tectonic stress field based on previous research findings the inversion criterion was designed as follows the relative error between the numerical solution and the measured values of the maximum horizontal principal stress during the multi period tectonic stress fields were less than 20 which was used in many engineering practices an et al 1998 guo et al 2016 meng et al 2009 shan et al 2004 4 1 5 model calculation after the model was established and discretized the finite element software comsol 5 3a was used to simulate the paleotectonic stress field during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods through which one can obtain the distributions of maximum principal stress minimum principal stress and maximum shear stress of the ordovician strata in the study area in different periods the reasons for choosing these stress parameters to analyze are based on a few considerations 1 the maximum principal stress determines whether fractures and shear rupture occur in the rocks 2 the decrease of minimum principal stress or increase of the maximum principal stress will be beneficial to the formation of tectonic fractures 3 the maximum shear stress is the main cause of rock shear rupture when the rock slides along the shear surface a slip line will be produced and the rock will be destroyed fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 4 2 methods for predicting tectonic fractures although the fracture formation is a complicated process the release rate of rock energy proceeds faster under an intense tectonic movement and accelerates the process of rock failure that controls the formation and distribution of tectonic fractures in general there are two main types of fractures in the rocks under stress one is the tensile fracture and the other is the shear fracture the tensile fractures were usually predicted by the griffith rupture criterion while the shear fractures were often predicted by the mohr coulomb rupture criterion which has been successfully applied and validated in some studies fang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 therefore this study employed the above two types of rock rupture criteria to predict the development and distribution of tectonic fractures in the ordovician strata in the study area 4 2 1 the griffith rupture criterion the tensile fractures follow the griffith rupture criterion and its expression is as follows griffith 1921 if σ 1 3 σ 3 0 then the griffith rupture criterion can be expressed as 6 σ 1 σ 3 2 8 σ 1 σ 3 σ t 0 if σ 1 3 σ 3 0 then the griffith rupture criterion can be expressed as 7 σ 3 σ t 0 where σ 1 and σ 3 are the maximum and minimum principal stresses respectively mpa σ t is the tensile strength of the rock calculated by numerical simulation mpa 4 2 2 the mohr coulomb rupture criterion the shear fractures follow the mohr coulomb rupture criterion and its expression is as follows wu et al 2017 8 τ n c σ n tan ϕ where τ n is the shear strength of the rock mpa σ n is the normal stress mpa c is the cohesion or intrinsic shear strength mpa ϕ is the internal friction angle 4 2 3 calculation model for the rock rupture rate the tensile rupture rate l and shear rupture rate q of tectonic fractures in the target strata in the huainan coalfield were calculated by the module of the fem in comsol 5 3a based on the griffith and mohr coulomb rupture criteria the calculation equation is as follows guo et al 2016 9 l σ t σ t 10 q τ n τ n where l is the tensile rupture rate q is the shear rupture rate σ t is the tensile strength of the rock mpa τ n is the maximum shear stress calculated by numerical simulation mpa the meaning of σ t and τ n are the same as mentioned above in eq 9 when l 1 the tensile fractures will be formed in eq 10 when q 1 the shear fractures will be formed in actual conditions both tensile and shear fractures may be developed concurrently in rocks therefore to better quantify the degree of development of the tectonic fractures the comprehensive fracture rate z was introduced in this study a larger z value means a higher degree of development of the tectonic fractures the calculation equation is as follows 11 z l l q q 12 l q 1 where l and q are the weighting factors of the tensile fractures and shear fractures respectively and the values of l and q can be calculated through equations 11 and 12 the meaning of z l and q are the same as mentioned above 5 results and discussion 5 1 multi period paleotectonic stress fields when the proper geomechanical model was established and the corresponding rock mechanical parameters and boundary conditions were assigned the distributions of the paleotectonic stress fields in different periods were simulated the results of the multi period paleotectonic stress fields are shown in fig 7 where the positive value represents the tensile stress while the negative value represents the compressive stress a comparison between the inversion results and the inversion criterion indicated that the relative error between the numerical solution and the measured value of each maximum horizontal principal stress in the hn3 and hn7 wells during the three periods was less than 20 table 6 which could satisfy the engineering requirement fig 7a d and g showed the maximum principal stress values in the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods respectively the maximum principal stress values in the indosinian period were generally between 115 mpa and 50 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the east and central portion of the study area and low stress was distributed in the west portion of the study area the maximum principal stress values in the early yanshanian period were generally between 110 mpa and 35 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the east and central portions of the study area and low stress was distributed in the west portion of the study area the maximum principal stress values in the late yanshanian period were generally between 170 mpa and 10 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the west portion of the study area and low stress was distributed in the east and central portions in addition figs 11a d and g showed that the influence of faults on the distribution of the maximum principal stress was not obvious this is likely due to the fact that the study area is located on the edge of the northern china plate and the influence of the plate boundary effects on the models could not be completely ruled out fig 7b e and h showed the minimum principal stress values in the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods respectively the minimum principal stress values in the indosinian period were generally between 70 mpa and 5 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the east and central portions of the study area particularly in the fault and fold belts low stress was distributed in the west portion of the study area the minimum principal stress values in the early yanshanian period were generally between 60 mpa and 0 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the southeast portion of the study area particularly in the fault and fold belts low stress was distributed in the west and north portions of the study area the minimum principal stress values in the late yanshanian period were generally between 55 mpa and 10 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts of the west portion and low stress was distributed in the southeast portion of the study area fig 7c f and i showed the maximum shear stress values in the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods respectively the maximum shear stress values in the indosinian period were generally between 37 mpa and 14 9 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the central portions of the study area and low stress was distributed in the northwest portion and fault and fold belts of the study area the maximum shear stress values in the early yanshanian period were generally between 45 mpa and 5 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the east portion of the study area and low stress was distributed in the west portion of the study area particularly in the fault and fold belts the maximum shear stress values in the late yanshanian period were generally between 65 mpa and 0 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the west portion of the study area and low stress was distributed in the east portion of the study area particularly in the fault and fold belts the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods 1 during the indosinian period the stress magnitude showed a gradual decrease from southeast to northwest overall fig 7a c compared with the non tectonic zones the stress in the fault and fold belts was relatively concentrated fig 7a b but the shear stress dropped sharply fig 7c indicating that the rocks in the fault and fold belts were more likely to form shear fractures fang et al 2017 zhang 1997 2 during the early yanshanian period the stress magnitude showed a gradual decrease from southeast to northwest fig 7d f compared with the non tectonic zones the stress magnitude in the fault and fold belts decreased significantly fig 7d f showing that stress release occurred in the tectonic zones which was consistent with the mechanical properties of the normal faults formed during this period fang et al 2017 zhang 1997 3 during the late yanshanian period the compressive stress magnitude showed a gradual decrease from northwest to southeast fig 7g i compared with the non tectonic zones the fault and fold belts showed lower stress values and the fault and fold belts in the nne ssw and nww see directions had the lowest stress values fig 7g i indicating that the fault and folds belts in the study area were in a state of stress release which was consistent with the formation of a large number of normal faults during this period fang et al 2017 zhang 1997 based on the above analysis the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the indosinian early and late yanshanian periods and high stress and or low stress were mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts 5 2 distribution prediction of tectonic fractures based on the results of the paleo tectonic stress fields and the rock rupture criteria e g the griffith and mohr coulomb rupture criteria and the rock rupture rate the tensile rupture rate l shear rupture rate q and comprehensive fracture rate z of the ordovician strata during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods were calculated respectively as shown in fig 8 1 the indosinian period the l value of the non tectonic zones was 0 5 to 1 5 and it showed a gradual decrease from the middle to the east and west as a whole fig 8a while the l value of the fault and fold belts was lower fig 8a which was mainly related to the stress state of the tectonic zones and their mechanical properties of the rocks the q value of the non tectonic zones was 0 6 to 3 4 gradually increasing from northwest to southeast fig 8b while the q value of the tectonic zones was higher fig 8b suggesting that the shear fractures were developed to greater degrees within the fault and fold belts the study area was under a compressive stress regime in the nearly sn direction in this period forming the thrust nappe structural belts and shear fractures which resulted in that the q value in the study area was significantly higher than the l value and the higher q value was mainly found in the fault and fold belts where the stress was relatively concentrated fig 8a b as seen from fig 8c the z value of the non tectonic zones was 0 8 to 2 6 showing a gradually increasing trend from northwest to southeast and the maximum z value from 1 6 to 4 0 see fig 8c was mainly seen in the fault and fold belts therefore the tectonic fractures formed during the indosinian period mainly developed in the fault and fold belts in the nearly e w direction and the shear fractures were the main ones 2 the early yanshanian period the l value of the non tectonic zones was 0 2 to 3 4 gradually increasing from northwest to southeast fig 8d while the l value of the fault and fold belts was 0 6 to 5 0 fig 8d which was obviously higher than that in the non tectonic zones this phenomenon was mainly related to the tensile normal faults formed by the stress release of the tectonic zones in this period compared with the l value the q value was much lower in the non tectonic zones the q value was 0 2 to 1 8 gradually decreasing from northeast to southwest fig 8e in the tectonic zones the q value was only 0 2 to1 0 fig 8e indicating that the shear fractures were not developed in this period as seen from fig 8f the z value of the non tectonic zone was 0 5 to2 5 gradually increasing from northwest to southeast and the maximum z value from 2 5 to 3 5 was mainly seen in the fault and fold belts in the eastern and middle regions but the z value of the fault and fold belts in the western region was relatively low from 0 5 to 2 5 therefore the tectonic fractures formed during the early yanshanian period were mainly developed in the fault and fold belts in the eastern and middle regions of the study area fig 8f and the tensile fractures were the main ones 3 the late yanshanian period the l value of the non tectonic zones was 1 5 to 2 5 gradually increasing from southeast to northwest fig 8g the l value of the fault and fold belts in the ne sw nne ssw and nee sww directions was only 0 5 to 1 5 fig 8g but the l value of the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions was relatively higher ranging from 2 5 to 5 5 fig 8g in the non tectonic zones the q value was 0 2 to 3 8 gradually increasing from east to west fig 8h in the tectonic zones the q value of the fault and fold belts was relatively low ranging from 0 2 to 2 9 fig 8h only at the intersection of the faults faults and folds the q value increased slightly indicating that the tension in the tectonic zones was strong but the shearing was weak as seen from fig 8i the z value of the non tectonic zone was 0 6 to 3 0 gradually increasing from southeast to northwest and the maximum z value from 1 8 to 4 2 was mainly found in the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions therefore the tectonic fractures formed during the late yanshanian period were mainly developed in the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions in the western and middle regions of the study area fig 8i and the tensile fractures were the main ones based on the above analysis we conclude that the tectonic fractures in the ordovician in the huainan coalfield are mainly distributed around the faults and fold belts as shown in fig 8c f i there is a clear correlation between the distribution of tectonic fractures and the paleotectonic stress fields that is the more concentrated tectonic stress leads to more developed tectonic fractures figs 7 8 5 3 distribution prediction of dissolution fractures previous studies have shown that when the rock mass was not broken or in a state of shear rupture under a compression environment a greater compressive stress will lead to a greater degree of compressibility of the rock mass and a smaller dissolved porosity of the rock mass which were not conducive to groundwater migration furthermore the compressive stress environment could also cause groundwater pressure to increase elevating the pressure gradient and eventually driving groundwater away from the compressive stress location li 2001 noorishad et al 1982 oda 1986 omar et al 2020 rashvand et al 2019 however under a tensile environment if the stress caused the rock mass to form tensile fractures the stress and the pore pressure in the tensile fractures will drop rapidly making those fractures becoming convergent zones or discharge zones of groundwater flow li 2001 noorishad et al 1982 oda 1986 omar et al 2020 rashvand et al 2019 therefore the groundwater flowed from the high stress shear rupture zones to the low stress tensile rupture zones overall li 2001 noorishad et al 1982 oda 1986 omar et al 2020 rashvand et al 2019 based on the above principles and the distributions of paleotectonic stress fields and tectonic fracture fields the groundwater hydrodynamic fields during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods can be drawn as shown in fig 9 1 the indosinian period the tectonic fractures in the study area were mainly the shear fractures and concentrated in the southeast region fig 8b while the tensile fractures were mainly concentrated in the northern region fig 9a thus the groundwater flowed generally from south to north fig 9a 2 the early yanshanian period the tectonic fractures in the study area were mainly the tensile fractures and gradually increased from northwest to southeast fig 8d f thus the groundwater primarily flowed from northwest to southeast fig 9b due to the stress release of the fault and fold belts during this period many normal faults and tensile fractures were formed becoming passages for the migration and convergence of groundwater which was conducive to the development of dissolution fractures thus the degree of development of dissolution fractures formed during this period gradually increased from northwest to southeast and the fault and fold belts became the most favorable locations for the development of dissolution fractures 3 the late yanshanian period the tectonic fractures in the study area were also mainly the tensile fractures which gradually increased from southeast to northwest fig 8g i thus the groundwater flowed generally from southeast to northwest fig 9c the tensile fractures formed during this period were well developed in the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions which became the passages for the migration and convergence of groundwater and were conducive to the development of dissolution fractures thus the degree of development of dissolution fractures formed during this period gradually increased from southeast to northwest and the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions became the most favorable locations for the development of dissolution fractures by superimposing the comprehensive fracture rate z and tensile rupture rates q of the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods it was found that the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions were likely to be the most favorable locations for the development and distribution of fractures including tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures in the ordovician strata followed by the eastern and central regions and the western region was the weakest as shown in fig 10 a b based on the above analysis it can be drawn that during the indosinian period when structures and fractures were not well developed the rock matrix permeability controlled the flow of groundwater in the formation while during the early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods when structures and fractures were well developed structures and fractures controlled the formation permeability and the flow of the groundwater and the tensile structures often became the channels for the migration and accumulation of preferential flow which are consistent with the previous research results huang et al 2019 latham et al 2013 zeng et al 2007 5 4 verification of prediction results to verify the prediction results cores fracture linear density observed in the cores and pumping tests were used to evaluate the predicted development degree and distribution of fractures in the ordovician carbonate rocks the fracture line density refers to the number of fractures per unit length of rock or core and its unit is lines meter guo et al 2016 wang et al 2022 the fracture linear density in this study refers to the ratio of the number of fractures in the core section to the length of the cores which is not related to the direction it was found that the predicted well developed zones the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions completely coincided with the areas with high fracture linear density 0 5 lines m large pumping capacity 800 m3 d and relatively large hydraulic conductivity 1 0 m d and such zones include the hn1 hn4 and hn5 wells fig 10 table 7 the predicted developed zones the eastern and central regions in the study area also coincided with the areas with relatively high fracture linear density 0 2 0 5 lines m relatively large pumping capacity from 200 m3 d to 800 m3 d and moderate hydraulic conductivity from 0 2 m d to 1 0 m d and such zones include the hn2 hn3 hn6 and hn7 wells fig 10 table 7 the predicted undeveloped zones the western region in the study area coincided with the areas with relatively low fracture linear density 0 2 lines m small pumping capacity less than200 m3 d and relatively small hydraulic conductivity less than0 2 m d and such zones include the hn10 and hn11 wells fig 10 table 7 thus the predicted results of fractures in the ordovician strata were basically consistent with the results of the core observations fracture line density and pumping tests however some wells e g the hn8 and hn9 wells located in the western region which was predicted as an undeveloped zone had relatively high fracture linear density 0 2 0 5 lines m relatively large pumping capacity from 200 m3 d to 800 m3 d and moderate hydraulic conductivity from 0 2 m d to 1 0 m d which was inconsistent with the predicted results this suggests that the development and distribution of fractures could be highly complex in certain regions and further investigations are still needed this finding also indicated that the paleotectonic stress field was a key factor affecting the development and distribution of fractures in the ordovician strata but other factors e g lithology structure palaeogeomorphology paleohydrology etc might also play important roles in the formation and evolution of fractured carbonate reservoirs gao et al 2017 han et al 2016 zhang et al 2021b 6 conclusions based on this investigation the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield are dominated by high angle fractures and vertical fractures with a small number of low angle fractures and horizontal fractures the fracture strikes are mainly ne sw nne ssw and nee sww directions followed by nww see and nnw sse the fractures are mainly fully filled type supplemented by semi filled type with a small portion of unfilled type the fillings mainly include calcite and clay 2 it was determined that the target layer in the study area experienced three tectonic movements which highly correlated with fracture development based on the stage matching of conjugate joints and acoustic emission tests the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian tectonic movements the maximum principal stress of the indosinian period was 103 57 mpa with a direction of nearly ns 8 188 the maximum principal stress of the early yanshanian period was 99 14 mpa with a direction of nww see 96 276 and the maximum principal stress of the late yanshanian period was 107 10 mpa with a direction of ne sw 55 235 3 the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods and high stress and or low stress were mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts during the indosinian period tectonic fractures were mainly shear fractures and the tectonic and dissolution fractures were not developed during the early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods tectonic fractures were mainly tensile fractures and the tectonic and dissolution fractures were primarily developed around the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions those fault and fold belts are also locations with the greatest development of the natural fractures in the ordovician strata in the study area the accuracy of the prediction results was verified by cores fracture linear density and pumping tests 4 geological and mechanical models based on regional tectonic fractures were established for the three major periods of fracture development multi period paleotectonic field simulation was performed on the basis of the tectonic stress and rock mechanics a calculation model for the rock rupture rate was employed to determine the quantitative development of fractures in different stages favorable areas for natural fracture development were determined by examining the relationship between the fracture linear density and pumping capacity of eleven wells this method was used to predict fractures in the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield as an example which is of great significance to the

3044,fractures are effective seepage channels and storage spaces for oil gas and groundwater understanding the distribution characteristics of fractures can improve the efficiency of water production and the control of water related geohazards in fractured aquifers the development and distribution of natural fractures are usually controlled by paleotectonic stress fields in this study the data obtained from outcrop cores and thin sections were used to determine the development characteristics of such fractures by doing an analysis of burial history tectonic evolution acoustic emission test rock mechanics test and conjugate joint analysis two dimensional 2d heterogeneous geomechanical models were established by using a finite element method fem stress analysis approach to simulate paleotectonic stress fields during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods the effects of the variations of paleotectonic stress fields hydrodynamic fields structures and rock mechanical parameters on the development of fractures could then be identified a calculation model for the rock rupture rate was established to determine the quantitative development of fractures in different periods favorable areas for natural fracture development were determined by examining the relationship between the fracture linear density and pumping capacity of eleven wells the simulation results indicate that the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods and high stress and or low stress were mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts during the indosinian period the tectonic and dissolution fractures were not developed during the early and late yanshanian periods the tectonic and dissolution fractures were primarily developed around the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions those fault and fold belts are the locations with the greatest development of the natural fractures which are also the main channels for the migration and accumulation of karst groundwater in the ordovician formation in the huainan coalfield this study provides an important reference for the prevention and control of the ordovician karst water damage in the study area and proposes a new method for the prediction of fractured carbonate reservoirs keywords tectonic fractures dissolution fractures paleotectonic stress field geomechanical modelling ordovician huainan coalfield data availability all the data are in the article 1 introduction natural fractures usually include tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures which are effective seepage channels and storage spaces for oil gas and groundwater tang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2009 zhang et al 2021a many studies have shown that the natural fractures developed in most coalfields in the world are closely related to multi period tectonic movements and corrosive fluid dissolution liu et al 2017b wang et al 2016 ye et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2011 understanding the distribution characteristics of natural fractures can improve the efficiency of water production in fractured aquifers and provide an important reference for the prevention and control of water related geohazards in fractured carbonate aquifer during coal resource mining therefore quantitative prediction of degree of natural fracture development and its distribution characteristics has attracted increasing attention from the coalfield hydrogeological community prediction of natural fractures development has gone through three stages up to present qualitative semi quantitative and quantitative prediction qualitative prediction of natural fractures was primarily based on the relationship between the degree of fracture development and its structural position or lithology hunter and young 1953 nelson 1985 gong et al 2021 price 1966 proposed that the degree of fracture development was proportional to the elastic strain energy saved in the rock based on this principle the energy method and fracture rate method were used to predict natural fractures and the prediction of natural fractures has gradually entered the semi quantitative stage murray 1968 was the first researcher to use the curvature method to predict reservoir fractures in a small island oil field in the united states this method is suitable for tectonic fracture prediction in brittle rocks shaban et al 2011 suo et al 2012 lisle 1994 introduced the curvature attribute to the geological field and the technique has been applied in fracture prediction with the continuous discovery of more fractured reservoirs scientists have gradually realized that the formation of tectonic fractures was not only related to physical and mechanical properties of rocks but also closely related to the paleotectonic stress fields gale et al 2014 gong et al 2019 guo et al 2019 tuckwell et al 2003 su et al 2014 methods such as rock mechanics test acoustic emission test and numerical simulation were used to restore and reconstruct the paleostress field to quantitatively predict the tectonic fractures guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 huang et al 2019 liu et al 2017a signaling that fracture prediction has entered the quantitative stage the finite element method fem is generally used to analyze tectonic stress fields and its validity has been confirmed fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li et al 2020 liu et al 2017a numerical simulation of the stress field is based on the mechanism of fracture development considers the actual geological information and combines numerical simulation results with the coulomb mohr criterion and the griffith criterion afterwards the distribution of fractures can be predicted or evaluated up to present most stress field simulations were based on simple geological models treating the geological unit as a homogeneous body with the same mechanical parameters for the entire geological unit without considering the effects of faults and folds guo et al 2016 hashimoto and matsu ura 2006 jiu et al 2013 wu et al 2017 the parameters in those simulations were often inconsistent with the actual geological conditions leading to substantial biases of stress field simulation and fracture prediction in the prediction of tectonic fractures petroliferous basins and coalfields in china especially in the north have undergone multi period tectonic movements and it is difficult to accurately predict fracture development using a single period stress field simulation because of the superposition of multiple tectonic fractures in reservoirs in addition the previous studies mostly focused on the prediction of tectonic fractures in the sandstone or shale formations fang et al 2017 guo et al 2016 ju and sun 2016 liu et al 2021 but did not pay too much attention on the distribution of tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures in the carbonate rocks unlike sandstone and shale tectonic fractures in carbonate rocks are easily dissolved and expanded by corrosive fluids e g meteoric water groundwater and hydrothermal fluids thereby forming dissolution fractures caves and even underground rivers chen et al 2022 li and cai 2017 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b therefore the study of tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures in carbonate rocks is helpful to understand the development and distribution of fractured carbonate aquifers reservoirs the ordovician carbonate is an important oil natural gas and groundwater reservoir in china and is also a key target for the prevention and control of water related geohazards during deep coal mining fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li and cai 2017 liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2019b like other coalfields in northern china the ordovician karst water in the huainan coalfield is an important ecological resource and a major water inrush source that threatens mine safety zhang et al 2019a 2020a 2020b drilling data showed that tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures in the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield are well developed which are the main storage spaces and migration channels for groundwater li et al 2010 zhang et al 2021a previous studies mainly described and counted the fractures in the cores and carbonate outcrop areas but did not investigate the overall distribution characteristics and degree of fracture development from a macroscopic perspective zhang et al 2021a resulting in that the water inrush accidents of the ordovician aquifer in the study area occurred quite frequently and the effect of grouting and blocking groundwater inrush was poor and unsatisfactory to obtain accurate prediction of the distribution of natural fractures in the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield the fem was employed to simulate the paleotectonic stress fields in different periods the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods in this study we will also predict the distribution of tectonic fractures based on the coulomb mohr criterion and griffith criteria and eventually to predict the distribution of tectonic and dissolution fractures combined with the tectonic fracture fields and hydrodynamic fields the accuracy of the prediction results was verified by cores fracture linear density and pumping tests 2 geological setting the huainan coalfield is located on the southeastern margin of the northern china plate at the intersection of the dabie orogenic belt and the tanlu fault belt and it shows an opposite thrust faultfold structural belt extending in the nww see direction fig 1 a c like other areas in northern china the study area experienced indosinian yanshanian and himalayan tectonic movements in the mesozoic era of which the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian are the most important three periods of tectonic activities in the huainan coalfield shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 the indosinian movement occurred in the triassic and the driving force of the tectonic stress field was the collision and docking between the south china plate and the north china plate the huainan coalfield presented a compressional stress field in the nearly ns direction 8 188 in this period the faults and folds in the nearly e w direction were developed in the study area such as fuli fault fufeng fault panji chenqiao anticline and gugou xieqiao syncline during this period shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 the early yanshanian movement occurred in the jurassic and the tectonic stress field was that of the pacific plate moving towards the nw direction and then subducting into the east asian continent the huainan coalfield presented a compressional stress field in the nww see direction 96 276 in this period a series of normal faults in the nne ne directions were developed in the study area which reformed and cut the faults and folds formed during the indosinian period shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 the late yanshanian movement occurred in the cretaceous and the extrusion direction changed from nw in the early yanshanian period to ne in the late yanshanian period such change is the consequence of subduction of the pacific plate in the nw direction and the ne compression of the tethys tectonic domain forcing the lithospheric masses in eastern china to stretch along the nw se direction the huainan coalfield presented a compressional stress field in the ne sw direction 55 235 in the late yanshanian period during this period the study area showed an extensional effect in the nw se direction and the faults formed in the previous tectonic movements further transformed into extensional faults shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 it is worth noting that the faults and folds in the early and late yanshanian periods were somewhat consistent with the existing tectonic framework of the study area the ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield are widely developed the outcrops of shungeng mountain and bagong mountain in the southeastern part of the study area completely expose the ordovician strata which are covered by mesozoic and or cenozoic strata in the rest of the study area zhang et al 2021a the thickness of the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield is from 75 80 m to 142 50 m with an average thickness of 89 0 m from top to bottom they are lower ordovician jiawang formation xiaoxian formation and majiagou formation fig s1 where the middle and upper ordovician strata are missed jiawang formation is composed of argillaceous limestone with an average thickness of 5 0 m fig s1 xiaoxian formation is mainly composed of argillaceous limestone dolomitic limestone and breccia limestone with an average thickness of 59 6 m majiagou formation is primarily composed of dolomitic limestone limy dolomite and dolomite with an average thickness of 24 4 m fig s1 below jiawang formation are the cambrian strata mainly composed of dolomite siliceous dolomite oolitic limestone leopard limestone and quartz sandstone with an average thickness of 1060 m above majiagou formation upwards are the carboniferous and permian strata composed of coal seams thin layer limestone mudstone and sandstone with a total average thickness of 1076 m fig 1b upward are the mesozoic and cenozoic sediments dominated by sandstone and mudstone with a total average thickness of 930 m fig 1b 3 methodology 3 1 sample and testing currently sixty three exploration wells in the huainan coalfield fully penetrated the ordovician strata these wells are distributed throughout the study area thus providing a rather detailed geological hydrogeological and geomechanical information database of the study area in this study the observation and test data from the ordovician outcrops shungeng mountain and bagong mountain see fig 1c and 11 representative wells fig 1c with 182 core samples were selected for further analysis thirty six core samples used for thin section observation were polished to a thickness of about 0 04 mm the pore structure and fillings were microscopically observed using an olympus cx41 microscope shinjuku tokyo japan in the state key laboratory of anhui university of science and technology zhang et al 2021a sixteen core samples used for rock mechanical parameter testing were made into cylinders with a diameter of 25 mm and a height of 50 mm the top and bottom surfaces of these samples were parallel with each other the rock mechanics tests for all core samples were carried out using the mts 816 rock mechanics test system mts systems corporation minnesota usa in the state key laboratory of anhui university of science and technology the experimental procedures were based on the chinese national standard gb23561 2009 t method for determining the physical and mechanical properties of coal and rock for instance uniaxial compression tests were performed to obtain the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of rocks table 1 brazilian splitting tests were performed to obtain the tensile strength of rocks table 2 triaxial compression tests were performed to determine shear strength data of rocks compressive strength cohesion and internal friction angles were determined from fracture pressure elastic modulus and poisson s ratio under different confining pressures table 3 the confining pressures used in the triaxial rock compression tests were 0 5 and 10 mpa respectively acoustic emission ae test is a technique for determining paleo tectonic stress values liu et al 2017a guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 in this study six samples were used for paleotectonic stress analysis in the state key laboratory of anhui university of science and technology as well the experimental setup was composed of a ds5 8b acoustic emission instrument a 300 kn universal press strain sensors and a microcomputer this device can assess stresses from paleotectonic stress periods and reveal the maximum effective principal stress that the strata have experienced table 4 the tectonic stress periods of the rock can be judged by using the number of kaiser effect points appearing on the ae curve of the acoustic emission experiment the direction of the maximum principal stress can be determined from the test results of such stress combined with the analysis of regional tectonic evolution history 3 2 classification of fractures field investigations and drilled cores showed that the pore types in the ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield are dominated by tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures fig 2 a h these fractures can be subdivided into vertical fractures dip angle 80 90 high angle fractures dip angle 60 80 medium angle fractures dip angle 40 60 low angle fractures dip angle 10 40 and horizontal fractures dip angle 0 10 the vertical high and medium angle fractures in the study area are well developed fig 2a g with a width of 0 1 300 mm and an extension length ranging from a few centimeters to several meters while the low angle and horizontal fractures are relatively weakly developed which are almost parallel to the strata bedding or oblique to the strata at low angles fig 2a b the inter cutting phenomenon between vertical fractures high angle fractures medium angle fractures low angle fractures and horizontal fractures is very common fig 2a b which is mainly related to the geological background of multi period tectonic movements zhang et al 2021a the statistics of 692 fractures in the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield showed that the fractures are mainly high angle fractures accounting for 44 22 and medium angle fractures accounting for 25 72 followed by vertical fractures accounting for 12 14 and low angle fractures accounting for 17 63 and horizontal fractures accounting for 0 29 the least fig s2a and they are mainly ne sw nne ssw and nee sww directions followed by nww see and nnw sse directions fig s2b among the 692 fractures analyzed there are a total of 568 vertical high and medium angle fractures of which 280 fractures are full filled 157 fractures are semi filled and 131 fractures are unfilled accounting for 54 03 36 29 and 9 68 of the total number of the vertical and high angle fractures respectively fig s3a there are a total of 124 low angle and horizontal fractures of which 67 fractures are full filled 45 fractures are semi filled and only 12 fractures are unfilled accounting for 54 03 36 29 and 9 68 of the total number of the low angle and horizontal fractures respectively fig s3b zhang et al 2021a found that the vertical high and medium angle fractures played a vital role in improving the permeability and karstification of the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield the fillings in the fractures are mainly calcite and clay 3 3 timing of fracture formation and stress states of fractures as discussed above different types of fractures were formed in the huainan coalfield because of the intensity and mode of the multi period tectonic stress field and the characteristics and strengths of structural deformation in the study area during different periods the timing of fracture formation and the state of paleotectonic stress should be identified to accurately predict the development and distribution of natural fractures burial history tectonic evolution stress field evolution isotopic geochemistry and other analyses are all important geological bases for identifying different stages of the tectonic stress field guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 liu et al 2017a zeng et al 2013 through the analysis of the tectonic thermal evolution and the evolution of the coalbed methane cbm reservoir forming dynamic system li et al 2002 and zhang et al 2005 found that the huainan coalfield mainly experienced three periods of tectonic movements from the triassic to the early cretaceous the first tectonic movement occurred at 240 ma the late triassic the second tectonic movement occurred at 160 ma the middle jurassic and the third tectonic movement occurred at 120 ma the early cretaceous zhan et al 2017 considered that the huainan coalfield mainly experienced four tectonic evolution stages stable subsidence stage cp structural deformation t j extensional uplift k e and depression deposition n q the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian tectonic movements occurred during the structural deformation and extensional uplift stages were particularly important for the development of fractures in the study area which control the distribution of coal measure natural gas in the coalfield zhang et al 2021b systematically analyzed the isotopes and minor elements of paleokarst fillings in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield and divided the evolution processes of paleokarst into four periods 1 late cambrian to middle ordovician 2 triassic 3 jurassic and 4 cretaceous the formation of tectonic and dissolution fractures is primarily related to the tectonic movements in the latter three periods that is the indosinian movement triassic the early yanshanian movement jurassic and the late yanshanian movement cretaceous as shown in fig 3 in addition acoustic emission test in this study also verified that the huainan coalfield experienced at least five tectonic stress rupture periods fig 4 and the tectonic movements occurred in the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods were particularly important for the formation of fractures previous studies have shown that conjugate joints a kind of shear fracture are of great significance in the identification of the state of paleotectonic stress fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 liu et al 2017a based on the statistics of 318 shear fractures in the southeastern outcrop of the huainan coalfield we found that the strike directions of these fractures were mainly nee sww fig s4a followed by ne sw and nne ssw the dip directions of these fractures were mainly sse followed by nnw nw and nww fig s4b through analyzing detailed observation combined with the regional geological setting three groups of conjugate joints were identified namely ne sw and nnw sse directions nee sww and nww see directions and nne ssw and nee sww directions fig 5 based on the development mechanism of the conjugate joints and their relationship with the orientations of the three principal stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 the corresponding paleotectonic stress directions can be derived from the orientation of the conjugate joints hancock and kadhi 1978 hancock 1985 brandes et al 2013 maerten et al 2016 using the stereographic projection method one can project the conjugate joints onto the wulff net lower hemispherical projection to draw the stress diagram kutty and joy 1997 maerten et al 2016 thus to obtain the occurrences of the three principal stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 of the conjugate joints as shown in fig 5 combining the history of the regional tectonic evolution of this investigation and results of previous studies shi et al 2021 shu et al 2017 wu et al 2014 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 the timing of formation of the three groups conjugate joints and the corresponding paleo tectonic stress states were determined as follows 1 the strike directions of the first group conjugate joints are ne sw and nnw sse indicating that the maximum principal stress is approximately along the ns direction 8 188 fig 5 which is a product of the indosinian movement shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 2 the strike directions of the second group conjugate joints are nee sww and nww see indicating that the maximum principal stress is nww see 96 276 fig 5 which is a product of the early yanshanian movement shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 3 the strike directions of the third group conjugate joints are nne ssw and nee sww indicating that the maximum principal stress is ne sw 55 235 fig 5 which is a product of the late yanshanian movement shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 zhang 1997 therefore based on the conjugate joint analysis and acoustic emission test results table 4 combined with the analysis of the regional tectonic evolution history the paleotectonic stress field of the target layer in the study area includes three major periods indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian the maximum principal stress of the indosinian period was 88 03 113 93 mpa with an average value of 103 57 mpa the maximum principal stress of the early yanshanian period was 84 27 114 01 mpa with an average value of 99 14 mpa the maximum principal stress of the late yanshanian period was 91 02 123 18 mpa with an average value of 107 10 mpa the maximum principal stress directions of each tectonic period are approximately ns 8 188 nww see 96 276 and ne sw 55 235 respectively 4 theory and methods previous studies have found that the paleotectonic stress field controlled the formation development and distribution of tectonic fractures fang et al 2017 guo et al 2016 laurent and frantz 2006 li et al 2021 liu et al 2017a therefore the study of the paleotectonic stress field is helpful to reveal the development and distribution of tectonic fractures and then to determine their development areas in this study the finite element software comsol 5 3a was used to simulate the paleotectonic stress fields of the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods in the huainan coalfield the simulation of the paleotectonic stress field mainly includes the following steps 1 establishment of geological model 2 establishment of mechanical model 3 establishment of mathematical model 4 verification of inversion results and 5 model calculation 4 1 simulation of multi period paleotectonic stress fields 4 1 1 establishment of geological model the geological model is generally composed of the target strata and the geological structure in this study the ordovician strata and the faults and folds were taken as the study objects of the geological model compared with the boundary length of the study area 100 km long from east to west and 30 km wide from north to south the average thickness of the ordovician strata in the study area is merely 89 0 m fig s1 which is less than 0 1 of the length and less than 0 3 of the width thus the ordovician strata could be treated as thin plates furthermore the purpose of this simulation was mainly to show the control effect of the paleotectonic stress field on tectonic fractures from a macroscopic perspective so a two dimensional 2d geological model could be employed for numerical simulation in this study the 3d model can better reveal the control effect of faults and folds on the spatial distribution of fractures which will be an important direction for further research to eliminate the influence of boundary effects on the simulation results the model boundary was appropriately enlarged which was 135 km long from east to west and 70 km wide from north to south fig 6 a c however since the huainan coalfield is located on the southeastern margin of the northern china plate the eastern and southern boundaries of the models in this study are inevitably affected by the plate boundary during different periods of tectonic movement the faults and folds in the study area were different based on the previous analysis we know that the nearly e w faults and folds were mainly formed during the indosinian period fig 6a and the faults and folds in the early and late yanshanian periods were consistent with the existing tectonic framework of the study area fig 6b c according to the actual situation the faults folds and their adjacent rocks were defined as the fault and fold belts and the width of the fault and fold belts were determined based on the scale of the faults and folds in this study the primary fault and fold belts were both set as 1000 m wide and the secondary fault and fold belts were both set as 500 m wide the distribution of the fault and fold belts is shown in fig 6a c 4 1 2 establishment of mechanical model the establishment of the mechanical models includes the following two steps 1 determining the rock mechanical parameters of different units of the target strata in the study area 2 determining the loading methods size and constraint conditions of the tectonic stress on the boundary of the geological body 4 1 2 1 determination of the rock mechanical parameters the geomechanical model in the fem is an elastic body composed of individual units which have different rock mechanical properties in different units such as elastic modulus e and poisson s ratio μ therefore the tectonic zones the fault and fold belts and the non tectonic zones in the geomechanical model have been assigned different rock mechanical parameters the rock mechanical parameters of the ordovician strata in the non tectonic zones in the huainan coalfield were obtained through the uniaxial and triaxial rock tests tables 1 3 but the rock mechanical parameters in the tectonic zones were calculated based on previous studies which have shown that the elastic modulus values of the primary fault and fold belts in the tectonic zones were 70 and 75 of that in the non tectonic zones and the elastic modulus values of the secondary fault and fold belts in the tectonic zones were 80 and 85 of that in the non tectonic zones fang et al 2017 guo et al 2016 compared with the non tectonic zones the poisson ratio of the primary fault and fold belts in the tectonic zones was 5 larger than that in the non tectonic zones and the poisson ratio of the secondary fault and fold belts in the tectonic zones was 10 larger than that in the non tectonic zones fang et al 2017 guo et al 2016 therefore the rock mechanical parameters of the tectonic zones could be calculated based on the test results of the rock mechanical parameters of the non tectonic zones table 5 4 1 2 2 determination of the boundary conditions the boundary conditions include displacement and stress boundary conditions the rock mechanical test results showed that the rock deformation was primarily elastic before rupture and the stress was significantly reduced after fracturing therefore the assumption for the elastic model was used to simulate the geological body in this study this kind of elastic model has been successfully applied and the reliability and accuracy of the model have been verified by field engineering practices guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 the boundary stress of this model was mainly horizontal tectonic stress which was assumed to be a set of determined values that were uniformly loaded on the boundary of the model and the loading processes were divided into three stages the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods based on the results of previous studies on the paleotectonic stress fields of the northern china plate zheng 2008 peng et al 2015 fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 the maximum horizontal principal stresses in the indosinian period the early yanshanian period and the late yanshanian period were respectively 93 64 117 65 mpa 78 32 106 43 mpa and 89 53 121 15 mpa which were very close to the acoustic emission test results table 4 in this study thus the directions and sizes of the maximum and minimum horizontal principal stresses of the multi period paleotectonic stress fields in the huainan coalfield were determined fig 6a c in the stratum with a depth of less than 4000 m the ratio of the maximum horizontal principal stress to the minimum horizontal principal stress is approximately 2 1 guo et al 2016 guo et al 2019 thus in the indosinian period the maximum horizontal principal stress was 103 57 mpa which was applied to the south boundary of the model from the ssw direction the minimum horizontal principal stress was 49 32 mpa which was applied to the east boundary of the model from the see direction in the early yanshanian period the maximum horizontal principal stress was 99 14 mpa which was applied to the east boundary of the model from the nee direction the minimum horizontal principal stress was 47 20 mpa which was applied to the south boundary of the model from the sse direction in the late yanshanian period the maximum horizontal principal stress was 107 10 mpa which was applied to the west boundary of the model from the sw direction the minimum horizontal principal stress was 51 0 mpa indicates tensile stress which was applied to the north boundary of the model from the nw direction 4 1 3 establishment of mathematical model the mathematical model is a method to quantitatively predict fractures and this model includes the numerical calculation method according to the mechanical model the fem chosen as the numerical calculation method in this study is the most important method used to determine the element type the element division and the concrete implementation plan based on the geological model and the mechanical model for the finite element method the tectonic framework is the foundation of the geomechanical model and the fem the mesh generation of the faults and fold zones in the study area not only affects the accuracy of the geomechanical model but also plays an important role in the simulation of the paleotectonic stress fields and the prediction of the distribution of tectonic fractures fang et al 2017 gale et al 2014 guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 tuckwell et al 2003 taking into account the differences between the tectonic zones and the non tectonic zones in the study area the meshes of the fault and fold belts were refined in this study and the geomechanical model was discretized by the triangular grid 3 nodes and quadrilateral grid 4 nodes eventually the indosinian model contained 4167 nodes and 8188 elements the early yanshanian model contained 12 710 nodes and 25 272 elements and the late yanshanian model contained 12 923 nodes and 25 704 elements as shown in fig 6a c the mesh refinement can be described as follows first the model was discretized with a coarse grid and triangular elements and the simulation was executed second the mesh in the first step is refined usually by two and the simulation was executed the discrepancy of simulation results such as the numerical solution of the maximum horizontal principal stress in the observation hole of above coarser and finer grids are compared if the discrepancy is below a pre defined threshold i e the relative error between the numerical solution and the measured values was less than 20 the simulation result can be regarded as mesh free and is acceptable otherwise one needs to further refine the mesh and repeat above two steps until the results become mesh free eventually in the simulations the faults were considered to be fault belts with certain widths such faults cannot propagate but were allowed to displace under tectonic stress in this modeling exercises our main concern was the influence of the macroscopic distribution of faults on stress distribution in the study area therefore the fault matrix interfaces were not specifically simulated such a simplification is acceptable for modeling large scale macroscopic characteristics of fractures and faults however it may not be acceptable for modeling localized or small scale fractures or faults in which the distinctive fracture or fault matrix interfaces may be of concern this is a subject out of the scope of this study but should be examined in the future the internal points along the y coordinate axis directions showed displacement when the elements were subjected to the palaeotectonic stress the displacement of each point along the two directions can be expressed as u and v and the displacements are all in relation to the coordinates of the point function they can be defined as follows guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 1 u u x y v v x y where u and v are displacements on the x and y axes based on the elastic mechanics there is a relationship between the displacement and the strain that can be expressed as follows guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2 ε x u x ε y u y γ xy γ yx u x u y where εx εy are the linear strain components and γxy γyx are the shear strain components in the deformation of the element according to formula 2 the relationship between the strain and the nodal displacement matrix can be simplified as follows guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 3 ε b δ where δ is the displacement matrix of the nodes and b is a geometric matrix from the elastic mechanics stress and strain can be described in the following form guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 4 ε x 1 e δ x u δ y ε y 1 e δ y u δ x γ xy γ yx τ xy g where δx and δy are the normal stresses components τxy is the shear stress components e is the elastic modulus μ is the poisson s ratio and g is the shear modulus by simplifying equation 4 stress and strain can be shown as follows guo et al 2016 wu et al 2017 5 δ d ε where d is the elasticity matrix 4 1 4 verification of inversion results the measurements of paleotectonic stress in the hn3 and hn7 wells are listed in table 6 the measurement results of the two wells were used as constraint conditions for the inversion of the tectonic stress field based on previous research findings the inversion criterion was designed as follows the relative error between the numerical solution and the measured values of the maximum horizontal principal stress during the multi period tectonic stress fields were less than 20 which was used in many engineering practices an et al 1998 guo et al 2016 meng et al 2009 shan et al 2004 4 1 5 model calculation after the model was established and discretized the finite element software comsol 5 3a was used to simulate the paleotectonic stress field during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods through which one can obtain the distributions of maximum principal stress minimum principal stress and maximum shear stress of the ordovician strata in the study area in different periods the reasons for choosing these stress parameters to analyze are based on a few considerations 1 the maximum principal stress determines whether fractures and shear rupture occur in the rocks 2 the decrease of minimum principal stress or increase of the maximum principal stress will be beneficial to the formation of tectonic fractures 3 the maximum shear stress is the main cause of rock shear rupture when the rock slides along the shear surface a slip line will be produced and the rock will be destroyed fang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 4 2 methods for predicting tectonic fractures although the fracture formation is a complicated process the release rate of rock energy proceeds faster under an intense tectonic movement and accelerates the process of rock failure that controls the formation and distribution of tectonic fractures in general there are two main types of fractures in the rocks under stress one is the tensile fracture and the other is the shear fracture the tensile fractures were usually predicted by the griffith rupture criterion while the shear fractures were often predicted by the mohr coulomb rupture criterion which has been successfully applied and validated in some studies fang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 therefore this study employed the above two types of rock rupture criteria to predict the development and distribution of tectonic fractures in the ordovician strata in the study area 4 2 1 the griffith rupture criterion the tensile fractures follow the griffith rupture criterion and its expression is as follows griffith 1921 if σ 1 3 σ 3 0 then the griffith rupture criterion can be expressed as 6 σ 1 σ 3 2 8 σ 1 σ 3 σ t 0 if σ 1 3 σ 3 0 then the griffith rupture criterion can be expressed as 7 σ 3 σ t 0 where σ 1 and σ 3 are the maximum and minimum principal stresses respectively mpa σ t is the tensile strength of the rock calculated by numerical simulation mpa 4 2 2 the mohr coulomb rupture criterion the shear fractures follow the mohr coulomb rupture criterion and its expression is as follows wu et al 2017 8 τ n c σ n tan ϕ where τ n is the shear strength of the rock mpa σ n is the normal stress mpa c is the cohesion or intrinsic shear strength mpa ϕ is the internal friction angle 4 2 3 calculation model for the rock rupture rate the tensile rupture rate l and shear rupture rate q of tectonic fractures in the target strata in the huainan coalfield were calculated by the module of the fem in comsol 5 3a based on the griffith and mohr coulomb rupture criteria the calculation equation is as follows guo et al 2016 9 l σ t σ t 10 q τ n τ n where l is the tensile rupture rate q is the shear rupture rate σ t is the tensile strength of the rock mpa τ n is the maximum shear stress calculated by numerical simulation mpa the meaning of σ t and τ n are the same as mentioned above in eq 9 when l 1 the tensile fractures will be formed in eq 10 when q 1 the shear fractures will be formed in actual conditions both tensile and shear fractures may be developed concurrently in rocks therefore to better quantify the degree of development of the tectonic fractures the comprehensive fracture rate z was introduced in this study a larger z value means a higher degree of development of the tectonic fractures the calculation equation is as follows 11 z l l q q 12 l q 1 where l and q are the weighting factors of the tensile fractures and shear fractures respectively and the values of l and q can be calculated through equations 11 and 12 the meaning of z l and q are the same as mentioned above 5 results and discussion 5 1 multi period paleotectonic stress fields when the proper geomechanical model was established and the corresponding rock mechanical parameters and boundary conditions were assigned the distributions of the paleotectonic stress fields in different periods were simulated the results of the multi period paleotectonic stress fields are shown in fig 7 where the positive value represents the tensile stress while the negative value represents the compressive stress a comparison between the inversion results and the inversion criterion indicated that the relative error between the numerical solution and the measured value of each maximum horizontal principal stress in the hn3 and hn7 wells during the three periods was less than 20 table 6 which could satisfy the engineering requirement fig 7a d and g showed the maximum principal stress values in the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods respectively the maximum principal stress values in the indosinian period were generally between 115 mpa and 50 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the east and central portion of the study area and low stress was distributed in the west portion of the study area the maximum principal stress values in the early yanshanian period were generally between 110 mpa and 35 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the east and central portions of the study area and low stress was distributed in the west portion of the study area the maximum principal stress values in the late yanshanian period were generally between 170 mpa and 10 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the west portion of the study area and low stress was distributed in the east and central portions in addition figs 11a d and g showed that the influence of faults on the distribution of the maximum principal stress was not obvious this is likely due to the fact that the study area is located on the edge of the northern china plate and the influence of the plate boundary effects on the models could not be completely ruled out fig 7b e and h showed the minimum principal stress values in the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods respectively the minimum principal stress values in the indosinian period were generally between 70 mpa and 5 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the east and central portions of the study area particularly in the fault and fold belts low stress was distributed in the west portion of the study area the minimum principal stress values in the early yanshanian period were generally between 60 mpa and 0 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the southeast portion of the study area particularly in the fault and fold belts low stress was distributed in the west and north portions of the study area the minimum principal stress values in the late yanshanian period were generally between 55 mpa and 10 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts of the west portion and low stress was distributed in the southeast portion of the study area fig 7c f and i showed the maximum shear stress values in the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods respectively the maximum shear stress values in the indosinian period were generally between 37 mpa and 14 9 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the central portions of the study area and low stress was distributed in the northwest portion and fault and fold belts of the study area the maximum shear stress values in the early yanshanian period were generally between 45 mpa and 5 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the east portion of the study area and low stress was distributed in the west portion of the study area particularly in the fault and fold belts the maximum shear stress values in the late yanshanian period were generally between 65 mpa and 0 mpa high stress was mostly distributed in the west portion of the study area and low stress was distributed in the east portion of the study area particularly in the fault and fold belts the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods 1 during the indosinian period the stress magnitude showed a gradual decrease from southeast to northwest overall fig 7a c compared with the non tectonic zones the stress in the fault and fold belts was relatively concentrated fig 7a b but the shear stress dropped sharply fig 7c indicating that the rocks in the fault and fold belts were more likely to form shear fractures fang et al 2017 zhang 1997 2 during the early yanshanian period the stress magnitude showed a gradual decrease from southeast to northwest fig 7d f compared with the non tectonic zones the stress magnitude in the fault and fold belts decreased significantly fig 7d f showing that stress release occurred in the tectonic zones which was consistent with the mechanical properties of the normal faults formed during this period fang et al 2017 zhang 1997 3 during the late yanshanian period the compressive stress magnitude showed a gradual decrease from northwest to southeast fig 7g i compared with the non tectonic zones the fault and fold belts showed lower stress values and the fault and fold belts in the nne ssw and nww see directions had the lowest stress values fig 7g i indicating that the fault and folds belts in the study area were in a state of stress release which was consistent with the formation of a large number of normal faults during this period fang et al 2017 zhang 1997 based on the above analysis the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the indosinian early and late yanshanian periods and high stress and or low stress were mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts 5 2 distribution prediction of tectonic fractures based on the results of the paleo tectonic stress fields and the rock rupture criteria e g the griffith and mohr coulomb rupture criteria and the rock rupture rate the tensile rupture rate l shear rupture rate q and comprehensive fracture rate z of the ordovician strata during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods were calculated respectively as shown in fig 8 1 the indosinian period the l value of the non tectonic zones was 0 5 to 1 5 and it showed a gradual decrease from the middle to the east and west as a whole fig 8a while the l value of the fault and fold belts was lower fig 8a which was mainly related to the stress state of the tectonic zones and their mechanical properties of the rocks the q value of the non tectonic zones was 0 6 to 3 4 gradually increasing from northwest to southeast fig 8b while the q value of the tectonic zones was higher fig 8b suggesting that the shear fractures were developed to greater degrees within the fault and fold belts the study area was under a compressive stress regime in the nearly sn direction in this period forming the thrust nappe structural belts and shear fractures which resulted in that the q value in the study area was significantly higher than the l value and the higher q value was mainly found in the fault and fold belts where the stress was relatively concentrated fig 8a b as seen from fig 8c the z value of the non tectonic zones was 0 8 to 2 6 showing a gradually increasing trend from northwest to southeast and the maximum z value from 1 6 to 4 0 see fig 8c was mainly seen in the fault and fold belts therefore the tectonic fractures formed during the indosinian period mainly developed in the fault and fold belts in the nearly e w direction and the shear fractures were the main ones 2 the early yanshanian period the l value of the non tectonic zones was 0 2 to 3 4 gradually increasing from northwest to southeast fig 8d while the l value of the fault and fold belts was 0 6 to 5 0 fig 8d which was obviously higher than that in the non tectonic zones this phenomenon was mainly related to the tensile normal faults formed by the stress release of the tectonic zones in this period compared with the l value the q value was much lower in the non tectonic zones the q value was 0 2 to 1 8 gradually decreasing from northeast to southwest fig 8e in the tectonic zones the q value was only 0 2 to1 0 fig 8e indicating that the shear fractures were not developed in this period as seen from fig 8f the z value of the non tectonic zone was 0 5 to2 5 gradually increasing from northwest to southeast and the maximum z value from 2 5 to 3 5 was mainly seen in the fault and fold belts in the eastern and middle regions but the z value of the fault and fold belts in the western region was relatively low from 0 5 to 2 5 therefore the tectonic fractures formed during the early yanshanian period were mainly developed in the fault and fold belts in the eastern and middle regions of the study area fig 8f and the tensile fractures were the main ones 3 the late yanshanian period the l value of the non tectonic zones was 1 5 to 2 5 gradually increasing from southeast to northwest fig 8g the l value of the fault and fold belts in the ne sw nne ssw and nee sww directions was only 0 5 to 1 5 fig 8g but the l value of the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions was relatively higher ranging from 2 5 to 5 5 fig 8g in the non tectonic zones the q value was 0 2 to 3 8 gradually increasing from east to west fig 8h in the tectonic zones the q value of the fault and fold belts was relatively low ranging from 0 2 to 2 9 fig 8h only at the intersection of the faults faults and folds the q value increased slightly indicating that the tension in the tectonic zones was strong but the shearing was weak as seen from fig 8i the z value of the non tectonic zone was 0 6 to 3 0 gradually increasing from southeast to northwest and the maximum z value from 1 8 to 4 2 was mainly found in the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions therefore the tectonic fractures formed during the late yanshanian period were mainly developed in the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions in the western and middle regions of the study area fig 8i and the tensile fractures were the main ones based on the above analysis we conclude that the tectonic fractures in the ordovician in the huainan coalfield are mainly distributed around the faults and fold belts as shown in fig 8c f i there is a clear correlation between the distribution of tectonic fractures and the paleotectonic stress fields that is the more concentrated tectonic stress leads to more developed tectonic fractures figs 7 8 5 3 distribution prediction of dissolution fractures previous studies have shown that when the rock mass was not broken or in a state of shear rupture under a compression environment a greater compressive stress will lead to a greater degree of compressibility of the rock mass and a smaller dissolved porosity of the rock mass which were not conducive to groundwater migration furthermore the compressive stress environment could also cause groundwater pressure to increase elevating the pressure gradient and eventually driving groundwater away from the compressive stress location li 2001 noorishad et al 1982 oda 1986 omar et al 2020 rashvand et al 2019 however under a tensile environment if the stress caused the rock mass to form tensile fractures the stress and the pore pressure in the tensile fractures will drop rapidly making those fractures becoming convergent zones or discharge zones of groundwater flow li 2001 noorishad et al 1982 oda 1986 omar et al 2020 rashvand et al 2019 therefore the groundwater flowed from the high stress shear rupture zones to the low stress tensile rupture zones overall li 2001 noorishad et al 1982 oda 1986 omar et al 2020 rashvand et al 2019 based on the above principles and the distributions of paleotectonic stress fields and tectonic fracture fields the groundwater hydrodynamic fields during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods can be drawn as shown in fig 9 1 the indosinian period the tectonic fractures in the study area were mainly the shear fractures and concentrated in the southeast region fig 8b while the tensile fractures were mainly concentrated in the northern region fig 9a thus the groundwater flowed generally from south to north fig 9a 2 the early yanshanian period the tectonic fractures in the study area were mainly the tensile fractures and gradually increased from northwest to southeast fig 8d f thus the groundwater primarily flowed from northwest to southeast fig 9b due to the stress release of the fault and fold belts during this period many normal faults and tensile fractures were formed becoming passages for the migration and convergence of groundwater which was conducive to the development of dissolution fractures thus the degree of development of dissolution fractures formed during this period gradually increased from northwest to southeast and the fault and fold belts became the most favorable locations for the development of dissolution fractures 3 the late yanshanian period the tectonic fractures in the study area were also mainly the tensile fractures which gradually increased from southeast to northwest fig 8g i thus the groundwater flowed generally from southeast to northwest fig 9c the tensile fractures formed during this period were well developed in the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions which became the passages for the migration and convergence of groundwater and were conducive to the development of dissolution fractures thus the degree of development of dissolution fractures formed during this period gradually increased from southeast to northwest and the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions became the most favorable locations for the development of dissolution fractures by superimposing the comprehensive fracture rate z and tensile rupture rates q of the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods it was found that the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions were likely to be the most favorable locations for the development and distribution of fractures including tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures in the ordovician strata followed by the eastern and central regions and the western region was the weakest as shown in fig 10 a b based on the above analysis it can be drawn that during the indosinian period when structures and fractures were not well developed the rock matrix permeability controlled the flow of groundwater in the formation while during the early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods when structures and fractures were well developed structures and fractures controlled the formation permeability and the flow of the groundwater and the tensile structures often became the channels for the migration and accumulation of preferential flow which are consistent with the previous research results huang et al 2019 latham et al 2013 zeng et al 2007 5 4 verification of prediction results to verify the prediction results cores fracture linear density observed in the cores and pumping tests were used to evaluate the predicted development degree and distribution of fractures in the ordovician carbonate rocks the fracture line density refers to the number of fractures per unit length of rock or core and its unit is lines meter guo et al 2016 wang et al 2022 the fracture linear density in this study refers to the ratio of the number of fractures in the core section to the length of the cores which is not related to the direction it was found that the predicted well developed zones the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions completely coincided with the areas with high fracture linear density 0 5 lines m large pumping capacity 800 m3 d and relatively large hydraulic conductivity 1 0 m d and such zones include the hn1 hn4 and hn5 wells fig 10 table 7 the predicted developed zones the eastern and central regions in the study area also coincided with the areas with relatively high fracture linear density 0 2 0 5 lines m relatively large pumping capacity from 200 m3 d to 800 m3 d and moderate hydraulic conductivity from 0 2 m d to 1 0 m d and such zones include the hn2 hn3 hn6 and hn7 wells fig 10 table 7 the predicted undeveloped zones the western region in the study area coincided with the areas with relatively low fracture linear density 0 2 lines m small pumping capacity less than200 m3 d and relatively small hydraulic conductivity less than0 2 m d and such zones include the hn10 and hn11 wells fig 10 table 7 thus the predicted results of fractures in the ordovician strata were basically consistent with the results of the core observations fracture line density and pumping tests however some wells e g the hn8 and hn9 wells located in the western region which was predicted as an undeveloped zone had relatively high fracture linear density 0 2 0 5 lines m relatively large pumping capacity from 200 m3 d to 800 m3 d and moderate hydraulic conductivity from 0 2 m d to 1 0 m d which was inconsistent with the predicted results this suggests that the development and distribution of fractures could be highly complex in certain regions and further investigations are still needed this finding also indicated that the paleotectonic stress field was a key factor affecting the development and distribution of fractures in the ordovician strata but other factors e g lithology structure palaeogeomorphology paleohydrology etc might also play important roles in the formation and evolution of fractured carbonate reservoirs gao et al 2017 han et al 2016 zhang et al 2021b 6 conclusions based on this investigation the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield are dominated by high angle fractures and vertical fractures with a small number of low angle fractures and horizontal fractures the fracture strikes are mainly ne sw nne ssw and nee sww directions followed by nww see and nnw sse the fractures are mainly fully filled type supplemented by semi filled type with a small portion of unfilled type the fillings mainly include calcite and clay 2 it was determined that the target layer in the study area experienced three tectonic movements which highly correlated with fracture development based on the stage matching of conjugate joints and acoustic emission tests the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian tectonic movements the maximum principal stress of the indosinian period was 103 57 mpa with a direction of nearly ns 8 188 the maximum principal stress of the early yanshanian period was 99 14 mpa with a direction of nww see 96 276 and the maximum principal stress of the late yanshanian period was 107 10 mpa with a direction of ne sw 55 235 3 the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the indosinian early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods and high stress and or low stress were mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts during the indosinian period tectonic fractures were mainly shear fractures and the tectonic and dissolution fractures were not developed during the early yanshanian and late yanshanian periods tectonic fractures were mainly tensile fractures and the tectonic and dissolution fractures were primarily developed around the fault and fold belts in the nnw sse and nww see directions those fault and fold belts are also locations with the greatest development of the natural fractures in the ordovician strata in the study area the accuracy of the prediction results was verified by cores fracture linear density and pumping tests 4 geological and mechanical models based on regional tectonic fractures were established for the three major periods of fracture development multi period paleotectonic field simulation was performed on the basis of the tectonic stress and rock mechanics a calculation model for the rock rupture rate was employed to determine the quantitative development of fractures in different stages favorable areas for natural fracture development were determined by examining the relationship between the fracture linear density and pumping capacity of eleven wells this method was used to predict fractures in the ordovician strata in the huainan coalfield as an example which is of great significance to the prevention and control of water related geohazards and oil and gas exploration in carbonate formations credit authorship contribution statement haitao zhang conceptualization methodology investigation
